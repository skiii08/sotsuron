The Double Life of Véronique," Not the greatest, but still very good
","I know that this film is considered to be the highest achievement of Kislowski, and yet I have to admit that this is not so. The idea is neat - there are two ladies, Weronika in Poland and Veronique in France, both played by excellent Irene Jacob, they meet only once and still just see each other in Krakow during the anti-Communist strike of 1990. Weronika the Pole is a great opera style singer, though she never studied this seriously before, she misses her Mom and comes to Krakow to her drinking Auntie. There, she gets attention and accepts the invitation to sing in serious concerts. But she is deadly ill and dies suddenly during her debut. Veronique lives in France, she is a teacher, she is quite happy with her love life, her relatives and her hobbies. Anyway, this is where the extreme boredom creeps in, while you are through the French part of the film. I am sorry for all those who love the film, but the excellent tempo and impeccable style start to evaporate at about last 40 minutes of the film, and then you only plead yourself to watch it till the end. Good film indeed, all made in honey yellow amber color tones and full of sudden and subtle details - creeping old grannies, shambles on the background and peeling walls. Cool and deep work.",7,3,9,14 September 2006
Black Swan," Awful Mess
","I hated every single minute of this torturous endless take on ballet, gossips, hate, split personality, scheming,sexual innuendos,dull music, vague plot, predictable twists, extremely bad choice of color scheme and very silly ending. Well, that seems to be a sum of all evil in that Aronofsky's horrible movie, that is very slow, pathetic, never engaging, never thrilling and never convincing. It does not persuade to go and watch ballet, or try to perceive Swan Lake better. Nay, in fact, thyme filmmakers killed any hint of interest to this. This boggy plodding mess is not a decent take on mental disease, either. It does not provide any deep picture or awake any sympathy to any of the heroes. In fact, it is so cold, detached, distanced and bleak that all the possible attempt to like ballet will die immediately. Waste of time, and all the parts are very weak too - neither Portman, nor Kassel, Ryder, Kunis or else did anything to get us involved. It is so vapid and dry that next idea would be to get and watch some light-weight comedy or something",1,6,10,10 August 2014
Come and See," Honest Depiction Of The Brutality Of War
","Filmed by Elem KLimov in 1985, Come And See remains of The most brutally honest, chilling, deeply disturbing, awfully realistic war epics depicting the massacre of Belarus village by Nazi soldiers, along with all the civilians in a barn. What makes it even more brutal and shocking is that fact that the whole film is shown as if throught the eyes of a young boy Flyora, a partisan, who witnesses unbearable wanton brutality, survives and becomes deeply traumatized by this.
This is a very timeless film which sends one message - War is all evil, it is never fun or funride. It is woe, weeping, wildness and blood.",10,1,1,11 February 2018
Frost_Nixon," Very Compelling, Though Not Perfect
","Ron Howard made no easy feat - to portray a seminal Forst / Nixon's 1977 Interviews wasa real ordeal. To depict such a deep, difficult, traduced, much maligned and very multi-faceted man as Richard Nixon was, is never a very sweet job. Oliver Stone did a huge task with his awesome 1995 movie, with powerful Sir Anthomy Hopkins as a main part. 
Here, Howard used the obvious talents of such giants as Frank Langella as Richard Nixon, Michael Sheen as David Frost, Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan, Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick, Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt., Rebecca Hall as Caroline Cushing, Patty McCormack as Pat Nixon and Toby Jones as Swifty Lazar, among many. They certanly showed very high class and shone like real Luminaries. But yet, a very itchy question remains - was it all done right?
Well, the biggest problem is the general tonality of the movie - it is way too syrupy and way too mecriless towards great late President, the film tries too hard to persuade us what an evil lonely monster Nixon was, and how great to see him smashed and grounded. 
Oliver Stone did a far more weighed potrrayal of a tormented soul, with all his ups and downs.
The second biggest problem is shockingly Frank Langella - he is too old, too slwo, too bulky for avid, acidic, agile Nixon. The funniest fact is that Langella could have been better playing the very Leonid Brezhnev that his hero mentions so much.
To sum it up -
Fred Schwarz, writing for the conservative National Review online, said that, 'Frost/Nixon is an attempt to use history, assisted by plenty of dramatic license, to retrospectively turn a loss into a win. By all accounts, Frost/Nixon does a fine job of dramatizing the negotiations and preparation that led up to the interviews. And it's hard to imagine Frank Langella, who plays a Brezhnev-looking Nixon, giving a bad performance. Still, the movie's fundamental premise is just plain wrong.'",8,0,1,5 July 2018
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Shocking! Funny!!
","Well, if you think that South Park is bad, think twice. If you consider Benny Hill's jokes to be obscene, wait a bit. If you criticized Monty Python for its gross and blatant lack of political correctness, now come and taste Borat. What, you still haven't seen this yet? Borat is a brutal, absolutely limitless and endless waterfall of humor that is so cynical, so unrestrained, and so dark, that any weak-hearted person may get crazy. Borat is a Kazakhstan TV-persona (as the story goes), who lives in shockingly poor village and then is sent to the USA to 'teach Kazakh people lessons'. The whole film is a non-stop, multicolored, multi-dimensional assault of crude, vivid, cruel gags and jokes, where there is not a single topic left that is forbidden in the States. Jews, gays, Afro-Americans, patriots, Southerners, Mr. Bush, Iraqi war, disabled persons, Charismatic churches, The Baywatch  everything is mocked at with no limit and with no boundary. Borat speaks this terrible, wrong American and makes such horrible mistakes that it only multiples the effects by a mile. And it works. The film is one unstoppable burst of laughter, and the pun, the sarcasm, the irony hit the aim. Sometimes, you have to rub your eyes in utter disbelief, so hilarious it all is. Borat, in fact, is a marvelous movie equivalent of Frank Zappa with all his caustic jokes and disdain, and he is a great follower of South Park tradition where no sacred cow is left untouched. The very fact that this film is prohibited in Russia and Kazakhstan to appear on wide screens speaks tons for it. Do not watch it if you lack sense of humor or if you are painfully touchy. This is a dish not for the weak stomachs and it will feed you with thoughts and ideas to ponder for days and days.",8,1,5,8 April 2007
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The 1st Movie Was Better
","Well, I am bit puzzled. What can I say? Was the movie well done? Yes and no. There are certain weak parts and obvious stronger bits. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jnr both are great as Watson and Holmes, as well as Stephen Fry is a very funny Microft. But then, there are some big mistakes in casting. Noomi Rapace is The biggest blunder. She was great in The Swedish Girl Who... Trilogy, but here no. She is weak, pale, blunt, shallow and gray. The only part we remember of her? Her eating some food near The Eiffel Tower. Pity that there is no so much Rachel McAdamas this time, she was great then and good here What else can I say? The movie is well cut and shot, it is dark and ominous, as intended, and some scenes are pure Matrix-quality. But then, there are so many goofs and funny anachronisms that make the whole movie a bit unserious. My opinion? it was OK, and fun. A bit too prolonged at times.",6,9,13,10 June 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Sometimes Scary, Sometimes Very Slow
","I love the original 2008's Cloverfield as it is a strikingly powerful shaky camera horror-packed thriller with astounding tempo and impending doom looming over. This is a kind of sequel albeit a very distant and sometimes not at all, as much of the time this is a dense psychological thriller and not a monster attacj flick. 
What was right, was the casting of menacing John Goodman and awesome Mary Elizabeth Winstead as main parts. They do their job well, keeping this often achingly slow-pacing film somewaht feasible. 
What was wrong, was the pacing, the finalle and the whole lenghth - it could've done a way better were it shorter and faster. Thus, a good isea is somewhat marred and spoilt by a jarring slow tempo and some very wrong plot turns.
I hope the third part of Cloverfield saga would turn up better and ore consistent as this second suffers a lot from what was mentioned above.",6,0,0,6 January 2018
The Expendables 2," Big Fun, Big Action, Great Casting, Great Show
","At first, we had some reservations and some hesitations considering the second installment of the movie Expendables. Then, off we went and watched this. Almost 2 hours flew like a millisecond. Not a single frame is lost here in vain What can I say? This is a great fun, great entertainment with numerous allusions to the past movies of all the actors involved. We loved everything here - the script, the play, the action, the scenery, the music, the impeccable jokes and great humor. All the main heroes involved are cool - Stallone, Statham, Willis, Lundgren, Van Damme, Schwarzenegger all do their jobs well and entertain real much The movie is fast, furious, fun, ferocious at times, but very, very cool and very smart. All the jokes regarding past films are very nice, and the very appearance of Mr. Norris is a real center point. Excellent fun, great show",9,1,5,21 August 2012
Deepwater Horizon," Powerful Catastrophe Film
","In this age, it is not easy to create films about catastrophes, without sliding into expensive but uninteresting CGI effects, or getting cheap and nasty. Deepwater Horizon is a very fine example of exquisite balance between excellent actors' performances (Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Mark Walberg and Kate Hudson all show definite depth and sophisticated valor, depicting their parts decently and with a great gusto) and awesome CGI effects. Without going deeper into technical details, I have to admit the film has achieved its main goal - to show true heroism, valor, valiance and also cowardice and shallowness in the wake of doom and death. Excellent depiction of Lousiana nature, exactly right balance of mundane, tragic, heroic and stupid all add certain flavor to the very tough and nutritious broth of a film. I do recommend this fast, deeply tragic, decent and sobering film to all who want to think and would like to watch something serious and thought-provoking.",9,1,3,2 October 2017
United 93," Dry And Slow
","The very topic is very thrilling and interesting. WE all were deeply shocked by those terrorist attacks in New York and DC, and we all watched frozen in horror those blood-chilling moments of crashes.The movie about United 93 could prove a real masterpiece. It is OK but still falls short of its goals. I understand that Mr. Greengrass wanted to make the whole event as authentic as possible, but in reality we needed up with extremely dry, slow, dull and boring footage of almost second-per-second depiction of events. OK, but this is a documentary film, right? I was very bored after 20 or 30 minutes and nearly made myself watch it till the end. I agree, life is not an excitement as it is shown in blockbusters, granted. But then, the filmmakers could better shoot a very accurate documentary and then get a better result. Here, we see a very bleak effort with some moments of greatness, but still are not convinced",5,0,1,21 February 2013
It," Scary And Genuinely Excellent
","Stephen King's books are awesome to be turned into excellent movies. I remember old It with its absolutely great scare jumps and terrifying atmosphere. I was a bit skeptical as for a new rendition, but never have I been more relieved of my doubts - this new It is a great and thrilling 2 hour horror experience which is very well done, decently performed and immaculately delivers the message of fear and friendship over this fear. I am very much pleased by Bill Skarsgård's excellent part, he as Pennywise / It is a great choice and he is surely scary a lot. Younger actors are excellent as well, with Sophia Lillis being a certain winner and a decent performer despite her tender age. I do recommend this very dark, brooding, genuinely scary thriller to all KIng's fans as you won't be disappointed at all.",9,1,2,10 November 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Utterly Silly
","Awful movie. Point. Everything here is laughable and bland, pointless and bad. Bad playing, terrible and repeated effects, bad soundtrack, very naive plot twists, funny scenery and especially stupid depiction of Civil War battles. As we say in Russia, President Lincoln is fidgeting in his coffin, knowing how insipidly poor and terrible bad film Timur Bekmanbetov made up again. What can I say? The plots never really collide in the film, as if the real story and all that vampire stuff simply exist on different levels, no matter how much Timur was trying to gel them. It never did. I never was involved into the storyline, and found myself grinning in utter disbelief all the time while watching that horror of a film. My advice is - do not waste your time on this lowest-rate film, this is poorly executed and vapidly performed flick. Just save 2 hours of you life on for something better",1,0,3,29 November 2012
Rocketman," Rocketman as another failed biopic.
","Not so long ago, I wrote about the completely disastrous Bohemian Rhapsody, which showed us essentially a caricature of Freddie Mercury and the whole Queen group, and here on the screens is a new attempt to shoot a biography, this time - the story of the ups and downs of Sir Elton John. However, honestly speakings, I note that the filmmakers immediately warned everyone that 'Rocketman' is not a biopic, but a musical fantasy based on the life of Reginald Dwight (after all, that's what Elton's name really is).
What did we see as a result? Two hours (now people just forgot how to make short films) gallop on the biography of Elton from the time of his early childhood until 1983. What is most unpleasant, the mere musical came out, and I can't stand the musicals. And when all people around suddenly start to sing and dance - people in a cafe, a crowd on the street, visitors in a gay bar, it becomes very funny and even uncomfortable to sit through. But the filmmakers could not sustain all two hours in the musical format. The film either breaks down into surrealistic fantasies (a scene in the pool), then gallops through 15 years of Elton's career (a scene with a rotating piano), then sharply slows down and becomes almost dead in the languid dialogues of John and Bernie Taupin. Speaking of Bernie. He himself is shown very accurately, but the nature of his collaboration with Elton is completely distorted. And when actor Jamie Bell, playing Taupin, begins to sing, my ears start to bleed right away.
But what about Taron Egerton, who plays Elton himself? Well, yes, he is very similar at times, especially in the scene with his mother in a restaurant, he sings ... well ... not bad, but he doesn't reach the level of John. And he overplays very much in drug scenes, in passion scenes with John Reid and in concert episodes. By the way, speaking of a gay topic - it is surprisingly minor in the film, there is, really not that much as one can expect. But the period of marriage to Renate Blauel is simply crumpled and slurred.
Another big disappointment is the complete absence of the plotline of musicians in Elton's band.Very smart rockers played there, and their participation in the arrangements was crucial. And in the film they are just, as it were, some long-haired comrades in the dressing room , or standing on the stage with guitars and drums - and that's all. Then they simply evaporate and then again appear from nowhere.
Well, the movie is not without actual errors, gentlemen. The presence of the guitarist at the early concerts was very funny (by then John had only himself, a drummer and a bass player in his band). It was very funny to hear the song of 1976 in 1970, and tunes of 1982 and 83 almost in 1969. And of course the most ridiculous thing was to think up that Reginald took his last name from John Lennon, and not from singer Long John Baldry. Well, yes, why go into the details of who this Baldry is, when the Beatles are here, and everyone knows them. Well, then why isn't there a concert sequebce featuring John Lennon? After all, he performed very cool there on the same stage with Elton.
What we get at the end line is a very chaotic and slim fantasy on Elton's excesses, the entire plotline with studio work is almost completely removed, concerts are shown on the surface level, albums are mentioned very briefly, and as a result, young viewers will have a lot of mess in mtheir heads after watching this movie.
My rating is 3 out of 10, only for the music and Egerton's efforts to sing. Well,a dn also for the classy depiction of the Bernie Tapin's part. Watch this movie once and forget.",3,0,2,10 August 2019
Gravity," Excellent Video Effects...Then, That's About It, The Rest Is Bad
","Yes, Hollywood has managed to create enormously excellent video effects in movies, the budgets are huge, the pictures are awesome, but often, sadly, much too often, there is virtually nothing (with a capital N) behind this. Gravity seems to be an over-rated, over- praised and over-estimated movie that is in fact a boring, endless (even 90 minutes may become endless) and excruciating torture which never stops. No Zappa here, but generally, even such huge luminaries as Sandra Bullock and Goerge Clooney cannot save this yawning boredom from being tedious, slow, and very very annoying. OK, this is a very dramatic story, OK, the main hero is a brave woman, and yes, she does well in such shocking circumstances. Yes, the Earth and space visuals are stunning. Yes, the sound is awesome. No, there is no captivating plot to grab our attention. It only crawls so slow it nearly kills. And yes, we saw this type of plot way too often - a hero saves the day. Nothing new here, jut the setting is different. Can be seen and then forgotten",3,1,2,5 May 2017
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Blasphemous, Insipid, Lame, Vain... Horrid
","Worse and worse every time they made a film. THis one, made in 1979, is the pinnacle of their low taste, lack of moral, morality or ideas. Made the same year with excellent Jesus movie, this one is a shame of all they ever did. Nothing is funny here - the same silly grimaces of Idles, or Gilliam, or Innes or any other guy. The whole idea of exaggeration could have been good, but here it flops, fails, dies before getting even a wee bit funny. The whole 2 hours are a torture, overrated schlock and complete, vapid dross. Dross. Ash. Dead horse of a film. Humor? Is it here? Some claim there is. I stand with great late Malcolm Muggeridge who thought that film was a terrible piece of manure. He was not so straight, but I say that knowing that many fans of Monty would attack me angrily. But there are those who dare to say the true thing - this film simply is horrid. Point.",1,8,70,24 November 2013
I'm Not There," Very Confusing Mix Of Awesome And Awful In One Bottle
","Where to start here? I'm Not There is a very daunting, serious, far- fetching, high;y intellectual, brainy and at the same time, painful, awkward, clumsy, weird and sometimes sick movie with elements of great and gross, high and haughty, likable and lecherous, sweet and sick, fine and foolish. It reminded me heavily of Oliver Stone's Nixon, with its spiraling, non-linear, crazy pace, feedback, change of colors, abrupt jumps, foreshadowing, unexpected twists and all the same. Is this movie any good? Yes, it is. The performances of multitude of actors are all spellbinding and breathtaking - Marcus Carl Franklin, Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw,Charlotte Gainsbourg , David Cross, Eugene Brotto, Bruce Greenwood, Julianne Moore, Michelle Williams, Mark Camacho, Benz Antoine , Craig Thomas, Richie Havens, Kim Roberts, Kris Kristofferson, Don Francks, Vito DeFilippo and Susan Glover, Paul Spence - an amazing array of huge talents and powerful bandwagon of artistry. Music is excellent throughout, too - the original Dylan's songs as well as new tracks are just superb. What is also good here - excellent play of allusions to Dylan's life - Newport fest, Judas shout, family problems, The Beatles, drugs, poetry, Tarantula, many other things are thrilling and a real eye- feast for Dylan fans. What is bad? Uneven pace, some mannerisms, some really vapid moments, some unnecessary longer monologues, some utterly silly moments at all - they spoil the party much. But still, even 2 hours are not long here and the movie flows almost (almost) seamlessly. Pity, it was not cut to a closer perfection. But, it is very hard to make a decent biopic. I do recommend this to Dylan buffs, to folk rock fans... the rest? Maybe, not. Todd Haynes has made a great work, but not all are ready to see Dylan played by a woman.",8,0,0,11 August 2015
Fury," Utter Awfulness
","Well, Brad Pitt is good but he is not an almighty superman who ca play any part. At least, he is not good as a tank crew commander in this utter awful WWII flick. All the imaginable clichés are grouped here, all the predictable deaths, battles, shouts, moral lessons, growing heroes tales, mud and fires are here. Silly, utter silly tale of huge unreal goofs, especially when it goes down to tanks and how they survive the fire. The movie is dull, long, forgettable, boring, gray and tasteless. For crying out loud, how many times should we hear all this f-word uttered? Well, war was not a laced ballet, but after all, do we need profanities so much? To sum it up, dead upon arrival. A total waste of time. Bad to the core.",1,7,13,31 July 2017
Fight Club," Simply The Worst Film Of All Time
","Chuck Pallanick is a real piece of worst writing ever existing on this planet. This is one fact, admit it. The Fight Club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen. This is The worst film of all time in all instances, in all possible scenarios. Point. No arguing here. Nothing, simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue. Dirt, mud, muck, slime, blood, vapid acting, hollowness, emptiness, nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes. Just. Terrible. It is so. Edward Norton gives a weak delivery, Brad Pitt does not help, too, and Helena Bonham Carter is simply awful. This is the key-word - awful. The whole Fincher's flick is just awful mess. Rating - must be minus 1000, but here 1- The Worst",1,4,13,31 August 2014
Amistad," Another Spielberg's Masterpiece
","I haven't watched this movie till very recently and wow, what a movie it has been! This is a sheer work of a genius who is by all means Mr. Steven Spielberg. He does not do anything wrong again and again, and thus in this movie he did a great job, too. The very topic of slavery is so painful and disturbing that it would be wrong to make a sweetly home-video drama with no blood or brutality. Nay, sirs, Amistad did exactly the right job - the movie showed slavery as it is - brutal, bloody, bad, gory, evil, malicious, greedy, horrific and unpardonable. The casting is perfect and there are no bad actors in this movie at all. Even the small part of Anna Paquin as Isabella of Spain is a real gem, what say can we of bigger and even better parts by impeccable Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins? The film is very heavy, full of really unpleasant violence scenes but this all is not for the violence's sake. Nay, again, this all served the ultimate goal - to depict the inhuman nature of human trade, and this excellent movie did that well",10,0,3,10 February 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Soulless Cash Cow
","I am not a Star Wars fan, but must say that the old trilogy was and is very viable and cool, whereas newer trilogy started well, but then plunged into a total mess of a horrid making. This new pre- pre- prequel is not good. Why? Let's be honest - it's slow, it's very long, fat too much longer thane it has to be in fact. Be it 90 minutes, the world would devour it better. With its 2 endless hours run and very boring slow scenes it seems an eternity. Honest. The plot? Ah, rubbish, the obvious exploiting of far too well known scenery, places and even monsters. The main hero? Nay, she is just okay, but in a deeper sense, she is none above average and is paled into insignificance when displayed in relief of better stars. The effects? Good, but again, we have seen it all time and again. So, what remains? Nothing, in fact. Even all the recognizable characters and places do not warm up our hearts, all 2 hours an undying feeling of exasperating discomfiture does not leave us. We've been had by and racketed by greedy studio bonanzas.",8,10,17,22 April 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Nice Bridge Between Old And New Parts
","I have never been a real Star Wars fan but I have watched them all but a very new one which is still coming up to us Rogue One serves as a very decent and healthy bridge between three newer ones and those three older classic ones of the Saga. What can I say here? Not much than was already said or written or speculated about. This is a very fine take with that inmistakable 70's look, Felicity Jones being a very cool main hero along with a stellar cast of many including Forrest Whittaker or Mads Mikelsen. The movie is long and loud, and sometimes it lack a certain depth or psychological development but it worsk okay and goes on at a great pace so the 120 minutes are not that excrutiating at all. 
I do recommend this epic movie as a part of a huge Star Wars mosaic",8,1,1,13 December 2017
Coraline," Awesome! This Is A Real Decent Masterpiece
","Such cartoon movies are a real Feat to make, and one can only wonder how much effort, labor, pain was used to make such a tremendously great, funny, dark, serious, deep, decent and thoughtful work as Coraline is. I applaud to Neil Gaiman for his outstanding book, an yes, I do ch her for this cartoon movie that is a true work of Geniuses. Odd, weird, off the beaten track, often hilarious, this movie holds well and stands alone as a visual treat for eyes and a decent food for thought. Coraline, voiced by impeccable Dakota Fanning, is a really smart, brave, sarcastic and cool young girl who is not idle or cowardly, and who goes through all the ordeals with a head held up and with hew unique mix of curiosity, inquisitiveness, valor, fervor and great humor. She shines all the time of the film, thus making this excellent work even better. This is a very unique film with all its unusual characters, such as a sarcastic Cat, or funny busy Parents, or some evil guys, or even very funny Russian man as well, is a great example of nontrivial approach to a movie making.",10,0,0,26 October 2016
Dawn of the Dead," Starred Well, Plodded Slowly, Ended Boring
","Zack Snyder really wanted to make this Romero's classic movie a 21st Century zombie horror flick. He did a lot, true. As a result, what we see here is a mish-mash of all clichés possible, and every time you watch some certain scene, you scratch your head as if trying to recollect whether you've seen this already in many more such like movies, and you'll be right. We have seen this all before many times, and we are not impressed. One good thing did come out of that, though - Shaun Of The Dead, that hilarious parody film with great Simon Pegg as a lead. They parodied all the key moments of Dawn, with all those inevitable and highly predictable moments. Any redeeming feature in This flick? Maybe, the very beginning, with the family breakdown and initial panic spread out. All the rest is a yawning fest with all the hugely exaggerated scenes of cartoonish violence and long, slow talks. Watch it once, for curiosity's sake, and quickly dismiss.",3,1,3,30 March 2015
World War Z," Awful Clichés Aplenty
","Well, can you imagine a typical cliché'd American movie? What will we have? A large family. Right. A daughter with an asthma, all sorts of fears and panic? Yes! Wait, wait, wait, are we describing War Of The Worlds? Nay, silly one, we are talking 'bout World War Z. Brad Pitt? Yes, but he is all the same like he is in many films of his. David Morse? He is good. But he, as well as Matthew Fox, cannot save this slow drabness of typical deep cliché ridden flick. Everything you saw in Resident Evil, Saw or 28 Hours later is here aplenty. Running to the roof? Sure, buddy, you name it! Zombies biting people who become zombies and bite other people? You saw it all before? C'mon! You saw it not. This is the first time, I am sure! Nay, we all did see it, right? Well, let me try and be serious. This is a Bad movie. Very languid, bad, impossibly predictable and very very boring. As if them zombies ate the film crew and the tempo suddenly got faster, but the plot got duller and utterly silly. Funny, too. The more they try to make us scared, the more sillier it all looks. My advice - waste no minute on this boredom. There are two redeeming features here - this Israeli girl who is very nice, believable and very good addition to the plot. And the ending that is far better than many zombie flicks",4,1,4,13 November 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Weakest of Simon Pegg Trilogy
","This was 2004 - the first installment. And the cheapest, which is obvious, and the weakest of all three. I like good films with excellent and sparkling humor here and there, I like brilliant sketches and funny gags. This films has almost nothing. Nothing. Just a blatant remake of American zombie flicks, with a typical Englishness added to that - London streets, beer (I'd hate beer after watching it so much in three parts), pubs, horrible dry English accent and tons of silly profanities that add nothing, mean little and bring even less. Simon Pegg and Co do some decent job here and there, but in general, this is a very boring, overrated and unfunny film with all unnecessary gore, blood, violence and shooting added to the broth. The result? A huge shrug of mere disappointment and boredom. Could've been much better but. Big buts remains",4,2,5,5 July 2014
Argo," Shallow Cliche Festival
","Literary critic Stanley Fish says that the film is a standard caper film in which 'some improbable task has to be pulled off by a combination of ingenuity, training, deception and luck.' He goes on to describe the film's structure: '(1) the presentation of the scheme to reluctant and unimaginative superiors, (2) the transformation of a ragtag bunch of ne'er-do-wells and wackos into a coherent, coordinated unit and (3) the carrying out of the task.'
Although he thinks the film is good at building and sustaining suspense, he concludes,
This is one of those movies that depend on your not thinking much about it; for as soon as you reflect on what's happening rather than being swept up in the narrative flow, there doesn't seem much to it aside from the skill with which suspense is maintained despite the fact that you know in advance how it's going to turn out. ... Once the deed is successfully done, there's really nothing much to say, and anything that is said seems contrived. That is the virtue of an entertainment like this; it doesn't linger in the memory and provoke afterthoughts.What can be added to this? Not much. What we got is a very very typical cliched edge-of-the-seat rescue mission movie with all the very predictable traits such as cliffhanger, last minute salvation, smart guys talk, and above all, very angelic good country prevaling over very demonic bad one.
And am I the only one who is tired of all that endless four-letter depletive used so much and so every now and then that it really becomes tepid and fetid? 
Okay, the cast is awesome, soundtrack is spellbinding, the camera work is stunning, but then, we have just a nice wrapping paper with no afterthoughts once we consumed yet another trivial movie",2,0,2,9 June 2018
The English Patient," Intense Drama In The Times Of War
","The English Patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I say, most, because this movie, albeit very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some drawbacks. First and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? This one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film were an hour shorter, that would serve it only good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. He is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. And then there is desert of Egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. The nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here, too. It is obvious, terrible, and bloody. Then, there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, then nude bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much of a splendid actors' work, so much of realism, so much of brutality that war brings. This is not a film for relaxation. It makes you think.",7,1,3,22 September 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Brilliant Must Have For All Who LOve CS Lewis
","This is one of the biggest hits of the previous Christmas and rightly deserved its high merits. I was a bit suspicious if the director and the whole cast would manage such a delicate and thrilling book as The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. The huge success of The Lord Of The Rings only made my fears bigger. But then the film came out and that was a real smash! Everything is excellent here - young children, beautiful British nature, absolutely excellent role of Tilda Swinton as The White Witch (she is so terrible and beautiful at the same time that you feel that the Evil really may be disguised as an angel of light), the impeccable video effects. And the Lion Aslan - he was so real, so mighty and so kind! His death and his resurrection are very well shown and the battle scene, especially the silent part seconds before the grand clash is just jaw-dropping! If there is the next film this winter, I am looking forward to seeing it!",10,0,0,21 August 2006
Public Enemies," Shallow Misery
","Nay, it was not exciting to sit through unimaginably slow 2 hours and watch a very repetitive sequence of shooting / talk / shooting / talk scenes. Johnny Dillinger? Oh yeah, he was a true people's hero, wasn't he? Johnny Depp? Oh, he is a truly great actor, is he not? Not in this slow, sad, painfully silly movie that does not hold, excite, make think or else. Nor does that wake any sympathy or compassion to any killed character. They are all schematic, shallow, vapid, dragging, plodding sketches with no blood or brain. Too much blood is here, but it is not necessary, and all those endless shoot-out scenes do not add anything to a slow sleepy tempo. And that shaky camera, and all those heroic faces. Funny. Bale, Crudup, Kotillar - good names, but bad roles. No real breath, no life. No empathy, no nothing. Just a slow pace and dull view. Do not watch this. Even for fun. Waste of time.",1,1,2,25 September 2014
The Other Boleyn Girl," A Spellbinding Winner
","The story of the hapless wives of King Henry the Eighth is not any new. How many films and books do we have by now? Anyway, the new movie is a pretty fresh look at this never getting old story. The film boasts three huge stars  Eric Bana as Henry himself, Scarlet Johansen as Mar Boleyn, and Natalie Portman as unhappy Anna Boleyn. The film offers us a newer look at this story, and the whole 1 hour 45 minutes holds us tight. The plot is very curious and the actors play extremely well. A big cheer must go to Portman for her deep, serious, endearing and earnest performance. Her tragic heroine is very real, very convincing and very deep. Bana is a bit too slow and bleak as Henry, he really lacks some energy at times, and likewise Johansen is all the same frightened scary pretty face with half opened mouth. We saw it many times, did not we? The movie is not bereft of some bias. It seems that the filmmakers did everything to shift the initiative on all things from Henry to Anna. It is her who starts the whole machine rolling; it is her and not him instigating the schism with Pope, divorce and all. Bana seems so weak and passive here, that you start wondering if he is a king after all. Anna sometimes seems so evil and cruel in her plots that her tragic death sometimes looks like something she really deserved. But still, as a whole, this movie is a very good effort that is spellbinding in its portraying of the severe times. Recommended for a fresher look at old, trite story.",8,1,2,2 May 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Very difficult to judge
","Well, what do I say? I am a Protestnat Christian and hence do not approve of lousy things, filthy and foul words, bad humor and attacks on my Savior, which SP creators often did. But as a person with vivid, and as I hope good sense of humor, I do like this Bigger, Better Uncut film. Why? I think, the movie is not about being rude, obscene or just foul. This is about such hard nut to crack as the freedom of speech. And with their typical wry and warped approach, the SP fathers do it well. The songs are deliciously great, and the plot is very funny. I am not sure if I recommend that to everyone but I think it is still very cool if you wanna have some colder slap in the face...",6,1,1,25 April 2008
That Thing You Do!," Sweet, Down To The Point It Got Saccharine
","Tom Hanks is a real steamroller who goes well and mighty. He did many great movies and he seems to do no wrong. Yet, here he seemed to be all correct again, with this funny little film of a young band getting famous and then falling apart due to several factors all gotten together at one place. Here, the story seems to be OK, yes, as a drummer I do support all those technical difficulties the band encountered and all those conflicts they had. Yes, the studio / TV / gig routines are shown pretty well. Yes, the band seems to be very real, they play as if the actors play all their parts themselves. Yes, Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron are gorgeous sexy ladies. Yes, the band is a very funny gang often. And then, many NO's follow. No, the characters do not endear or grab you by their struggles or triumphs. No, the love line does not seem to be deep or decent. No, the final conflict does not smack of being real and mundane. It seems that Hanks tried very hard to slide along the surface without diving any deeper. There is no deep slant drilling of main heroes, there's only some sweet light slight tiny touches upon their psyche. This is a light little teen comedy with a very large chunk of certain shallowness and naivety, seemingly all coming from blurred recollections of Mr. Hanks himself. Oh, and I am sorry but does Mr. Zahn not irritate with his character all through. This obvious shallowness of all four main heroes seems extremely annoying, and this fluffy-puffy sweetness of Liv's Faye leaves nothing but a cloy of too sweet candy. Where Hanks succeeded is in biting certain sides of TV / cinema routine. Where he fails is depicting band's true evolution. And oh, all those jazz sentiments, they are so out of place that one can only rub their eyes in utter shock. Yeah, the overall feeling of very lightweight teen pop comedy never left me. It was nice, it was sweet. Decent or deep it was not. My rating - 7 Nice try, but not more",7,0,0,3 May 2017
Hot Fuzz," Not Awful, Just Rather Mediocre
","The second film of the three with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and this time with Paddy Considine, as well as Bill Nighy and then Timothy Dalton as a main baddie is a curio - you watch it for a sheer out burst of typically British gags, very strange tempo and rather crazy plot twists. Then, you get a killer's story, much beer, beautiful village views, some very daft jokes, much bad language, many very silly allusions to Pointbreak as well as some more US detective movies. Is this a poor film? Nay, it is OK, but still, bland and overtly banal at places, often naive and often bland. Watch it, digest the too much violence moments and easily forget it as a strange but sometimes hilarious work. Brits have a weird sens of 'umor, y'know, chap.",5,0,1,5 July 2014
Constantine," A Typical Hollywood Religious Mishmash
","I understand why Catholicism is so popular in Hollywood - it looks majestic, it has strange rituals and exorcism, it has Popes and big cathedrals, it contains some very contradicting moments and it does pay much attention to such things as daemons and so on. This movie is a typical Hollywood mishmash of it all, plus some crazy Hinduistic ideas and plus some wild ideas of mojo, talismans and so on. Keanu Reeves looks so tired, pathetic and vapid here as if he was dragged to play here against his will. Tilda Swynton does not help, either, and even great Peter Stormare looks very badly here. Anyone, did you understand the main idea of that film? Me not. I consider this film a total waste of time, celluloid and money. The video effects are so bad, too, that they merely made me laugh. Did they? Anyone who liked this, please, say why it was made, in the first place? And I especially abhor the very idea that Satan may be stronger than God, like he was in this brute of a film. Surely, Hollywood has very poor ideas about the Bible. Learn it, guys!",1,5,10,13 August 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Waste of time
","I know I will sound off the beaten path, but the film is a tedious bore. Do not waste your precious time on this candy sweet bubble gum. Come on, what did they wanna say? The story is unreal slow and extremely boring - two cowboys fall in love, make wild sex in a tent, then depart, get married, have unsuccessful family lives, give birth to kids, quarrel with wives, then meet again, then again make love, then one of them dies and another is sad. So, this is a Grammy Award film? Hello, are you sleeping? This is a monotonous melodramatic sugary sweetish gay-praising story, where there is no vivid play of either Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhaal - what do we see? Unending silent scenes, slow dialogs, and the bottom line? Gay style is great, go for it! What though the family is in ruins, and your life is vapid! I am deeply sorry but why don't we then have a film praising normal family with healthy heterosexual relations and happy kids? Or, hasn't it suddenly become so boring for us all? Do not waste your time on it. Or, rather, show it to kids to tell them that this lifestyle is ruinous.",1,9,63,4 September 2006
Spotlight," Almost Perfect, Albeit A Bit Too Long And Too Slow
","This movie has recently won Best Picture at 2016 Oscar Ceremony, so what else could be possible said or written about it? Well, let critics and professionals single out merits and demerits of this epic movie, I am but a mere amateur viewer and not a journalist. So, let me just express my merely subjective opinion. I liked the movie, I was drawn into its steady pace and awesome performances of all the actors, and my personal Like goes on to a beautifully elegant Rachel McAdams who is excellent here and she is deeply real as a journalist. And, yeah, all other main stars are tremendous here - Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, Mark Ruffalo, Stanley Tucci - they all did a vastly satisfying work and one never doubts these are paper men, journalists who dig and who find the Truth. And the topic is extremely important and is depicted very well. The whole theme of child molesting by certain Roman Catholic priests is a deeply painful yet important one to reveal. I am glad this is The Best Picture, the only complaint - a bit too slow and long. If it were shorter, that would be perfect.",9,1,3,5 March 2016
Insomnia," As Strong As The Norwegian Original
","Insomnia is a slow, gloomy, glum, dark (inside) movie, but this is the way Nolan intended it to be. The slow pace and sudden outbursts of violence and anger make a fine balance for the well-known story of a small town murder. The stellar ensemble of Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams make this strong film a mere feast for eyes, and the breathtaking nature serves as a cold, but magnificent background for the wild human passions that are on display here. Alaskan views are almost a main character of the movie, adding with their cold detachment to the merciless out weaving of the events. It is incredible to see how people live and work in this ever-sunny polar day spell of time, which makes it terribly hard for Pacino's character to get by. He is suffering and we feel it. This is a cool example of Al's excellent acting and he makes it very naturally and very smoothly. All the main and secondary parts are performed well and the whole film deserves a big cheer, with only one possible minus - it was bit too long.",9,0,0,10 March 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," One Of The Greatest Disaster Movies Ever Created
","Roland Emmerich is a very uneven film creator, he can make an outstanding movie with awesome plot and great characters, ansd then he can produce a flop.
The Day After Tomorrow is an impeccable masterpiece where all the numerous elements have come perfectly well together. The cast, with Jake Gyllenhal and Dennis Quade at the lead, with also Emmy Rossum and Ian Holm at the helm, is very well selected. And each actor does a very decent job, with a whole array of deep and convincing characters to add to a bigger picture. What is great, we feel for them, sympathize, sufffer and rejoice with them all the time.
Some critics bashed the scientific side of the plot, and I can say, this is not a scientific moviw, but the message is clear and vivid - albeit also livid - the climate changes very fast and Nature can pay very severely.
The CGI are awesome and we nevr feel fooled or bought cheap, the immense sheer power of wild wanton nature in its fill menacing glory.
The movie is long but bever slow or boring, it hilds you at the edge of your seat without getting too preachy or ploddy.
Highly recommended",10,2,2,7 January 2019
X-Men," Nice, thrilling, but not the greatest
","See, I like this thrilling and well done film, but in no way will claim that this is a masterpiece or a serious social commentary. The idea is clear and straightforward - there are mutants among us, they are different, they are the others. People hate them, are afraid of them and want to get rid of them. Right, the film is about how unique and different we are all and that we all have to be tolerant and correct. But the very meaning of tolerance was distorted and mis-used so much these days that it is almost a wrong and bad term now. Anyway, the film is well made, the video effects are impeccable and the characters of Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, or Ben Kingsley are very good. But, still, even with all this in mind, I watched this film not as a any serious or deep attempt but only as a quick, up-tempo and highly entertaining fairy tale. I am sorry if I hurt any of your feelings, but this is what it is. Nice, upbeat, good-looking work and that is all.",7,2,4,22 September 2006
Spider-Man 3," Sorry, but this is boring!
","I was never a big fan of Spidey, but however, I have seen all 3 parts and must say that the 1 part was the best by all means, but then the Part Two was great thanks to Willem Defoe and great plot... This part is so tedious, so boring that you must rub your eyes all the time. 2 hours are absolutely unnecessary here, if you cut the film one hour short, that'd help a lot. There are some weak parts in this sequel. Sand Man is the weakest and the thinnest person here, his character is thin and badly depicted, the love line is boring and the part of the flat owner's daughter is seemingly silly. I felt tired, even video FXs did not help, and the bed was slow, bad and boring. Please, do not make part 4!",4,2,4,3 June 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Countdown To Extinction or Shall We Await The 4th Part?
","I have been waiting for the third part of Resident Evil for so long that the very expectation has somehow overgrown the film itself. We had it all in first two parts  great, sexy, smashing Milla Jovovich; dead men walking; suspense; special effects to the fore; always tense line of plot And what did they offer us in the third and seemingly last part? Milla is still very sexy, she looks great even with her incredibly bad hairdos, she is sporty, strong and she fights like a man. There are dead men aplenty, and there are pools of blood a lot. The film starts not so convincingly and it goes a bit too slow and too repeated some time. But then, when other heroes appear and the action gets very tight, the film gets much better. Mind it, in today's realm of 4-hours monsters, this part with its mere 90 minutes seems a short condensed blast of pure energy. Maybe, there is not so much to think or ponder about, but who cares? After all, Milla is true to the end. She is cool, she may cry, she fights, she has a great physique, and yes, yes, fans of her body, she does appear completely naked couple of times. What else can be dreamed of? Jokes aside, the third part is a good entertainer and it holds your attention all 90 minutes + and you never regret you started watching it. The only question remains  what does the end mean? Will there be the Fourth part? After the Apocalypse and Extinction, should we expect some Retaliation or, maybe, The Last Judgment? I do not know. But if the next part is the same fast and ferocious shot of naked energy (no pun intended), I would vote for that.",8,1,2,30 December 2007
A Bridge Too Far," An Absolute War Materpiece
","I cannot believe I never knew about this astounding war movie. A Bridge Too far is an excellent, excellent film with a very tight plot, superb suspense and very strong message, without a the typical modern-day sweet happy end. The film describes the actual September 1944 Holland invasion that went not too good for the Allies. The cats is all star-studded and shines all the film throughout, with all the best cast in small, but significant roles - Dirk Bogarde James Caan Michael Caine Sean Connery Edward Fox Anthony Hopkins Gene Hackman Hardy Krüger Laurence Olivier Robert Redford Maximilian Schell - among many. The film leaves no open ending, with a message that is clear and clean - war is terrible, and there are no good deaths. A Bridge is shot very much in The Longest Day or A Battle Of Britain style, where all the actors speak their languages, and the subtitles are of great help. The 3 hours of the length may seem a bit too long for some, but for war film fans this work flies like a lightning and gives almost not a second to breathe. Very tense tempo helps and adds much to the splendid work of cinematography. Highly recommended",10,7,13,7 September 2014
Zodiac," Oh my, this is awful!
","That was a real huge hype here in Russia. The trailer was also very cool, and blood-chilling. I like both Gyllenhaal and Downey Jr, but what a great boredom! It was such a long, slow, endless, vapid, dull, energy-lacking epic. It has one and very serious problem - this movie is very slow. The pace is nice first 30 minutes, but then, all other 2 hours, the film becomes a terrible drag, so moody and so boring. Neither Jake nor Robert save this bore of a film. I lost all interest after the first hour and was only waiting till the end just to know if Zodiac killed anybody else and was he ever caught or not. Please, make a shorter version of that, one hour or so, and bingos! this film will really rock!",1,8,18,10 August 2007
Cloverfield," Awesomely Scary!
","I never thought a digital shaky camera amateur approach horror movie could have been so great. I was in total awe and could not take my eyes off the screen all 80 minutes of this excellent suspense work. JJ Abrams is a decent filmmaker and he did a great job here, this Monster is so terribly ferocious and so scary that I was deeply shocked and terrified that could not sleep well. The film is well done, and the fast tempo never gets you feel bored. it sucks you into its plot and makes you totally immersed. The poor main heroes die and you feel a sad, deep, pulsating anguish. They fight so bravely and try to survive that it is a real, real pity they die. The huge monster is so horrible, so scary, so huge that I felt a real pain and real panic it was on the screen. The only bad part - all heroes die, and a deep sorrow lingers.",9,0,2,22 August 2009
Hotel Rwanda," Overwhelmingly Astonishing War Drama, Must See
","Rwandan genocide was a bleak, bloody, ruthless and violent page in African history, and Hutu massacring Tutsi and UN Forces also suffering casualties is no small thing to depict. A bad filmmaker would make this into a sweet melodrama with all the clichés and trite ideas. A good director has made this heavy story into a real must see foe everyone who wanna know about what genocide is and how awful vile people may behave. Terry George made a great work here, showing just one page of that tragic book - hotelier Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, saving hundreds of both Tutsi and Hutu from immediate murder and shame. His actions are shown as actions not of a super hero, but a mere man of flesh and blood, but with guts and valor to withstand the threat, deceive the killers gently, buy the time, do all one can do in such gruesome situation, and thus save those people. Don Cheadle is a highlight of this as a main hero, and his dignity, vigor, skills and power shine all throughout the movie. Nick Nolte as an UN officer is another great stronghold here, brave and level-headed man of duty and word. Even the cameos of such stars as Joaquin Phoenix or Cara Seymour are absolute treat. And then, there are all those vile, brutal Hutu warriors with machete and guns, cold-blooded and intolerant. They are shown so deeply true that they awake sheer terror and shiver. This is a very good movie and deserves all the praise and attention. 10 out of 10",10,1,1,31 January 2017
Gettysburg," An Outstanding Civil War Masterpiece
","It is my favorite topic in the US history - the great and tragic Civil War. When brothers were killing brothers. When fathers were against their kids. When the whole country was torn apart. For me as a Russian, it is a very challenging and difficult to grasp the war that raged on a far away soil far many years away. But we had our Civil war, too, so the topic of fierce fight for the home turf appeals to me greatly. The movie, albeit its 4 hours running time, is a real winner. It is a huge success and a real masterpiece of cinema. Not ever before had the movie captured my attention and for so long. Plus, this is one of the rare instances when the movie gets only better with each repeat. It doesn't age with the course of time, it never gets boring or trite. The main characters are so real, down-to-earth people with their fears and feats, that you can never doubt they are so real. The parts played by great Thomas Berrenger, Martin Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, George Lazenby, among many others, are excellent and superb. The Little Round Top fight and the famous 'Bayonets!!' charge from Joshua Chamberlain is blood-thrilling. Or, the final hopeless attack of the Confederate Army in an open field, towards the volleys and canisters - this is heartbreaking. What is really great, the movie does not say North is good, South is bad. Nay, it is far from that. The film shows the real tragedy of a war, the real suffering of real people.",10,2,4,12 April 2011
"I, Tonya"," Very Strong And Eeerie Serious Drama
","Labeled as a mockumentary, I Tonya is in my opnion a very deep, very serious, very touchy biopic, with very clever plot twists, fourth wall breakage, excellent cast, amazing soundtrack and terrific Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding. She alone makes this anyway awesome movie even more awesome, and she deserves all th accolades and awards she has already won or was nominated for. Margot proves she can execute a very serious, sensible, psychological role and can do with certain gusto, valor, passion and thrust. The plot sheds light on to her quite dramatic and often traumatized life story, her strained family relations, her gaines and losses. 
I need not say more - I do recommend this movie very urgently to be watched as a prime example of excellent biopic.",10,0,2,25 March 2018
Crash," Tremendous film!
","I have watched this film only yesterday when I got the DVD with all the bonus, musical video and the interviews. And I must say that I loved this tremendous film with all my heart! I didn't expect it to be so great. Anyway, my expectations have been greatly rewarded. Everything is excellent in this movie - the play, the music by Marc Isham, the operator's work, the colors, the plot. The very idea is also very good - racism. We face it in Russia, we see it in the ISA, we come across it all around the world. Racism eats us like a rust eats the iron. And, what is especially great in this film, is the fact that those heroes who seem to be racists in the first place (like the policeman played by Matt Dillon) turn out to be kind, heroic people, and those who never seem to be any racists at all, are in fact the ones. The cameo appearances of Sandra Bullock and Brendan Frazer are second to none! Even though their roles are small, they play with such blood-chilling truthfulness that you don't hesitate to believe them. Excellent story is the one with two Afro-American brothers - one is a Cop, another is a criminal. The second one is shot by mistake and this tragedy shocks so terribly. The plot about the Iranian shop-keeper is another winner. The film is an absolute winner, an absolute master work, a true holder of all those awards and prizes.",10,3,9,3 August 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Very tragic, very good
","Some people think mistakenly that Pan's Labyrinth is a children's movie, but this is certainly not the one. The very plot is very cruel, dark, gloomy and not so serene. The story takes place in 1944, in General Franco's fascist Spain, where small, but active partisan's detachments still continue their struggle. The main heroine, little girl named Ophelia, comes with her pregnant Mom to the idyllic countryside to see her step-father, fascist Captain, a murderous, ruthless villain, with no human feature left. The story then goes in two parallel lines  one is dark, terrible reality of WWII, with its battles, executions, tortures, partisan actions and fierce cruelty on Nazi's side; another is a deep, mystical fairy tale with Pan, faeries, horrible eyeless monster, magic chalk and a brave girl Ophelia who really wants to help her Mom and her yet unborn son. At times, the film becomes so intensely cruel, so bloody and so mercilessly real that it's hard to watch and not be shocked with how terrible any war can be. And the fairy part is also very dark, frightening and spooky, it is not a sweet bedtime moralist story, nay, it is far too real, too. The never-ending succession of deaths of several main heroes leaves a heavy trace on your heart and the very ending, with its honey-golden hues of color, its openly Christian moral and its sweeter tones is probably the only light spot in the whole deeply tragic and very convincing story. The film is a big winner on the side of Mr. Del Toro as a director, writer and main originator, and the Captain's part, played by Mr. Lopez, is truly a genius of bright, persuading performance of sheer brilliance and great talent. Not a film for kids, but still, this is a must for those whop seem to forget how bad Nazism is and how abominable any war may be.",9,2,5,8 April 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," An Old Chemistry Of Burton And Depp Do Not Work Always
","Tim Burton is a great filmmaker. He can really shine in his warped, wry, painfully gory movies. Johnny Depp is a very deep and mature master of acting. He is the star. But sometimes, something wrong happens. Like in this much hyped movie. Sweeny Todd starts very well, then it gets sickly sick, then simply gory, then unbearable, then horribly terrible. No, this ain't about singing. After all, Depp sings much like David Bowie, Helen Carter Bonham boasts of quite strong falsetto, and even Alan Rickman is not devoid of depth and imagination. The songs are sometimes too banal and prolonged, but this is not so bad. What is really poor is the plot. You never feel sorry for poor Todd and his wife's fate, as well as his daughter's future. The situation balances between complacency and stupidity. And then, all of a sudden, Sweeny starts lacerating throats of many innocent men, with all that blood gushing so thick that Burton comes closely to Quentin Tarantino with his total lack of any taste. Depp is vapid, miserable and extremely poor all throughout the film, as well as Bonham who simply is laughable. The same may be said about wholly weak part of Sasha Baron Cohen and his character. All this is forgettable, as well as the line of Johanna, Todd's daughter, and her future. This part of the script is hugely underdeveloped and thus begs wanting. Blood is all galore, no real script, no deeper efforts, no persuasive performance  the movie is a large waste of your time, your money and patience. It only proves that great men often fail and flop most miserably.",1,8,16,2 May 2008
Malcolm X," Long, Slow, Too Wordy And Biased
","Denzel Washington is a swell, pure gold actor, he can save and grace any movie he is in, and yes, he is great here, but this endless, unimaginable 3 hour and a half mammoth kills all his endeavors and assets burying them under a lead stone sheet of pretentiousness, boredom, and what is the worst offender, a very heavyweight preachy tone which becomes more and more acidic sour and then simply makes you cringe and run for some lightweight family comedy. What is also wrong? Bad pacing, very badly conceived flashback scenes and a very very tedious plot. Generally, such films are often a victim of their own weight - they sink like a marble brick, and they are too wordy. Like here, it is the same endless amount of smart speeches and oratories, but after two hours you feel a strong desire to switch to Mr. Bean or Benny Hill. Malcolm X was not a good man and he fell a victim of his own faith, we know that, and what he preached was wrong. So, no matter how much Spike Lee and Denzel tried, they failed to make us like this cold, ruthless, icy man of no sorrow. I felt no sorrow either for him or for his work, and the documentary footage of great late Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr only proved how much better this Baptist minister was than that loud and brash preacher. The film only hit the nail on the right head",2,7,20,26 April 2017
Suicide Squad," AN AWFUL MESS
","My, what was that? I heard so many opinions and yes, they varied but I never thought my disappointment would be so big.
1. Actors.
No, even Margot Robbie did not impress me, at all. She overdoes, overplays, over-everything every singly frame and shot. In fact, her vapid delivery leaves an empty bewildered stare - why. Will Smith? Nay, too formulaic and very badly predictable. Jai Courtney? Nay, too bland and very heavily on the surface. The rest is intermittently forgettable.Ah, yes, there was Cara DeLevigne, probably, the weakest and the worst choice here, as her delivery is painfully bland and pointless.
2. The Plot.
Nothing new. You do this, if you don't - you Then we see lots of shootings, deaths and wild fights. Did we see it before> Yeah, lotsa times.

Ocean's Thirteen," It's Getting Faster Every Time
","Ocean's 11 was a brilliant combination of gripping detective, thrilling comedy and excellent love story, lifted on high by the dazzling array of great actors. Ocean's 12 was slightly worse, as the plot began repeating itself and some tricks did not work out again. Ocean's 13? C'mon, give me a break! What could be invented, if anything, this time? Especially, taking into account the sad fact that Julia Roberts would not take part in this part anymore, what will happen this time? Well, the film makers eliminated the love story altogether, which thinned the film really badly. Instead, in addition to the smashing team of Clooney, Damon, Garcia, Pitt and others, they invited the one and only Al Pacino as a red-haired, merciless and vile casino owner, greedy and devoid of any principles. This time, the Danny Ocean team decides to ruin his tasteless new casino and even combine their efforts with their deadly rival, Mr. Benedict. And then, a fountain of head-banging tricks, smart ideas and impossibly expensive gadgets starts pouring on us effortlessly for almost 2 hours. The classical glossy picture, smooth jazz background, elegant view of Ocean (who, in fact, is a very incidental character this time, leaving much more time and space to other heroes) leave very little time to think. The movie becomes a nice, tasty, easy to digest comic strip, almost stripped of any serious thought or psychological insight. What is also a pity; the heroes of Pitt and Damon also have less impact and time on the screen, although Damon's appearance as a womanizer at the later part of the film and his romance with Pacino's aid make the film very funny. Keep it in mind, Pacino's hero is impeccable. He is cold, vile, greedy monster, a real shark, and his appearance, his hairdo, his suits, his manners are superb. He is the real winner of the whole movie. Well, trequels become so fashionable that one may scratch in utter disbelief if a new port be added or not. I hope, they will not go on with Ocean's 14. That will be really too much of a good thing. But still, this movie left me quite pleased. At least, that was a swift, easy-going, sweet-tasting, laughter-provoking bubble gum. Pity, that could have been a far better try.",5,0,2,26 August 2007
Interstellar," By So Far, The Worst Movie In 15 Years. Period.
","This is awful. Awful in every single sense - this length of three endless hours, this snotty sentimental atmosphere, these unbearably slow and hammy dialogs. Everything is poor and mediocre in this production. The tonality is set wrong and it is false all through. Then, the cast - Matthew McConaughey is teary, lame and languid. He is the weakest chain here and his efforts to be endearing or touchy do not touch or endear. Anne Hathaway? Probably, her worst part in years. Michael Caine? John Lithgow? Nope, lame at all costs. Avoid this poorly scripted, badly shot, lousily edited slowpoke of a torture. This is just a mere waste of time, and the idea is lost in utter drabness. Let's be honest - I did not understand the idea, the moral and the message. I was totally sucked and drained. And them, this horrendous loud music that deafens the dialog and simply deafens. Why? Why was that so loud and boring? In a word, bad. Bad, bad, bad thing. The worst in years, and I mean it.",1,11,21,21 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Don't Listen To Haters - This Episode Is Awesome
","I will never fathom choirs of angry critics and befuddled fans who are now vocal and loud in dismissing this newest Episode 9. We have watched this part yesterday in 3D and what I must say - this is awesome to the point of perfection. This impeccable part is a very fast, smooth, elegant and sharp marathon (almost 3 hours whistle by) through the familiar territory with all the fresh thrills and surprised galore.
Everything is this Saga part shines - excellent cast, with great late lamented Carrie Fisher, splendid Mark Hammil, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, among others. I must also stress the point that Daisy is a Huge Star now, she is the very correct choice of the main hero, and she is apple of an eye with all due praise.
The deep, humorous, often touching, often sad, often exciting part runs at full speed never giving one a moment to breathe. So full and so complete it is.
Enjoy and get it, you'll not regret this marvelous episode.

Pacific Rim," Worth The Effort, But Still Often Very Formulaic
","So much has been written, said and uttered about this mammoth production of a blockbuster. Pacific Rim seems to be a very promising try, as it starts where Godzilla or even Independence Day have stopped. With better funds, greater video effects, bigger sound, decent actors, huge soundtrack, excellent funny parts of two zany professors, this movie could have achieved a real great point. In some ways, it did. In many, it failed. With all the efforts, there are still may open questions dangling in the air. I will not ask them to create Spoilers, so still, some plot holes remain. The formulaic performance of several actors add to a weaker impression, and rather predictable twists of plot make it duller thing to peruse. There is much of a clichéd pathetic speaking, much of predictable development, and still, some questions were never answered. One can watch this movie once, just to get to know this one, but then luckily forget and never come back to this at all.",6,0,0,25 July 2014
American Sniper," Mixed Result
","No doubt, Clint Eastwood is a genius, he can like no one else deliver a slow, deliberately theater-style film of such a slow and often plodding tempo that you want to jump forth as quick as possible. Eastwood is a master of slow build-up and awesome suspense. He can pick up great actors and make them do their best, like Sienna Miller and Bradley Cooper did here. This film suffered too much heavyweight praise, it has become almost a sacred cow that is not to touch or to be tampering with. Ay, anyway, the film is not without its weaker moments. it is painfully slow far too often, it is very bleak and often too stifling. It is often fer too repeating, and yeah, it smacks of Hurt Locker way too much. Bradley Cooper is a great amazing drama heavy, he does his job very well. But the feeling of some highly strung trying of being more authentic does not leave me even now. Sienna is cool, too, but often too schematic or withdrawn. That said, I did enjoy battle scenes and the great Mustapha / Chris duel, as well as dust storm scene. That said, Black Hawk Down and Hurt Locker are still better",Null,0,15,20 August 2017
Glory," Civil War Movie Masterpiece
","I was first a bit skeptical about Glory since I am not a huge Matthew Broderick fan, but the watch changed my perception of him drastically. Here, Matthew delivered one of his greatest and most breathtaking roles with such deep understanding and thorough sincerity that his performance really rocks high. Not only him, both Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman play admirably deeply and convincingly well. The theme of African-American troops in the US Civil War is immensely interesting and Edward Zwick did a real great job. Two hours of a movie fly so fast that you never notice the time. The plot, the camera work, the sound, the soundtrack - all seam together well and very smoothly. The heroism, tragedy and immense triumph of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry is shown so greatly and so truly, that Glory ranks well with such all-time greats as Gettysburg or Gods And Generals. This is a great war movie, with warm look on Black soldiers and their everyday lives, their faith and their heroic deaths in the action. The movie is very highly recommended.",10,1,2,3 July 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," Splendid movie
","I loved this film. Very smart, very intelligent and very sharp, shrewd, acute look into the depths of Fashion Business magazine. The part of Meryl Streep, who played mighty but still vulnerable Miranda Priestly, is awesome. She conveys the main part of a ruthless and down-to-earth, business-like shark of the glossy mag with such admirable precision that an awe arise immediately. The bags she has, the expensive clothes she wears, the comments she makes, the house she lives in - everything is so first-class, so impeccable, so grand. Her part is a real feast of the film. She delivers her lines with cold snobbish aplomb, but deep in her heart she is a loving, caring Mom and she teaches her new aid so patiently and well that it can't but gives an admiration. The whole big fuss of a mag making is shown with such cute accuracy and the tension is so palpable that one cannot but love this excellent film. Very well done",8,0,0,20 March 2007
Bridget Jones's Diary," Pure Fun, Excellent Entertainment, Albeit A Bit Rude
","Bridger Jones is a clear phenomenon, nobody can deny the fact. What Helen Fielding managed to achieve with her book is enormous. Here, both in the novel and the film, we see the heroine who is far, far from perfect. She, in words of Mr. Darcy, smokes like a chimney, drinks lake a fish and dresses like her Mom. Bridge is not ideal, she is a woman on a fatter side, prone to fall a victim of all her weaknesses and her friends. The film manages to catch this. Renee Zellweger is a great choice for the main part, albeit being a Texan, she overcame the initial difficulties and here she is a real Londoner, with an unmistakable British accent, British ideas and customs. The other great winner is Colin Firth who depicted Mr. Darcy with his cool, reserved, down to earth manner. Colin is hilariously reserved and his near smiles are unforgettable. Hugh Grant is yet another perfect choice for the part of Daniel Cleever, a classic cad, sweet and deadly nice outside and terribly rotten inside. Typical cynical British humor shines and sparkles like a tinsel all the way through; unbelievably hilarious situations which Bridget finds herself in make you laugh all 90 minutes of this light, tight, bright and delightful comedy. What made me feel a bit repulsive was a continuous talk about sex, sex, sex. When the topic was repeatedly returned to even by Bridge's Mom, I was nearly shocked. Then, maybe this is a huge cultural gap, but the sheer impudence of some talks also nearly killed me. In my country, Russia, to tell a woman in her face that she is getting old and she absolutely must get a man is a unimaginable rudeness. Here, it is shown as if it is natural and no one seems to correct themselves after such a shocking case of rude behavior. Sometimes, the film gets pathetic, though, especially when it does show the way too prolonged scene of fistfight between Darcy and Cleever. After all, the film doesn't make you think too hard. Well, we all are created imperfect, we smoke, drink, and say foul words, have premarital sex, tell lies, cheat, et cetera. This has to be fought, not somehow celebrated. But it is good to be made fun of. In which, the film got very well.",7,1,1,19 August 2007
Top Secret!," Zany, Wacky, Silly. But It's Lost Some Of The Older Charm
","I remember watching this film on some old cranky VHS somewhere in 1988- 1989, with some 'orrible Russian dubbing, but it was so hilarious, we split sides laughing and almost screaming with giggles. Young and handsome Val Kilmer seemed so cool and nonchalant there, that we all simply tried to imitate his gimmicks and we all dwelt on repeating some of the craziest and funniest routine of the movie. Years later, I finally watched this one in English. Yeah, much of fun is still there and cameo by Omar Shariff is excellent, but still, some of the older magic is gone. Some gags ran stale, some jokes look vapid, some routine seems banal and not good even for a parody spoof film. The ZAZ team did a fine job. Yeah, some films lose charm, some stay the test of time. This on is 50/50, as some of the jokes grew rotten. But still, it can be watched",7,1,2,24 January 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," Nonsence
","The 91st annual Oscar ceremony will be held soon, in the list of the main contenders for a number of awardsthere is Brian Singer film Bohemian Rhapsody. I deliberately endured a pause, waited until the first waves of delight and anger subside, carefully watched the movie in the original, all of more than two hours and now I would like to express my opinion on this biopic.
Remember the 1991 Oliver Stone film called Doors - there was still thin Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison? After so many years, all the flaws of that picture become apparent. In the foreground, Jim himself, the other participants are registered superficially and as if passing by. Then, in 1991, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore were somewhat offended by the fact that in the film about the group of the group itself there could have been more about themselves.
And now the new biopic, now about the Queen group - one of my favorite and respected ones. I am 47 years old, and I found the period when the group still existed and released their later albums (1989 and 1991). Many of us watched the 1986 concert film Live in Budapest several times. We remember that real group, we saw Freddie on the screen and saw who he was. And those of us who started to study the team's biography thoughtfully understood that Queen is not only Freddie. This is Freddie, Brian, John and Roger. All four wrote songs and played on a variety of instruments. And when Mercury died, the group quickly turned into ... well, into a parody of itself. Arguably, one can argue, but all later releases with George Michael, Paul Rogers and now with Adam Lambert are, in essence, a quality hack. The Queen were from the same breed as the Beatles - remove at least one member, and everything will immediately collapse.
Then Ione can argue, but what about the enthusiastic reaction of May and Taylor on the film with Ramey Malek? The answer is very simple - another chance to bask in the glow of past glory. Name at least one thing from the post-Mercury-post-Deacon Queen and so on the same scale as the records of 1973-1991. Do even try to recall.
So. Singer film. What we got in the end? Enchanting nonsense for 120 minutes for the audience of the 21st century, having the most fragmented understanding of Freddie and the whole group. An objection can immediately be heard here - yes, but in 4 hours the whole history of the group cannot be shown. Well, and who prevented to focus on, say, two significant moments in the history of the group - the recording of the 1975 album A Night at the Opera and on the performance at the Live Aid concert in 1985? Instead, we saw a chaotic race through the long history of the team, with incredible jumps from 1973 to 75, from 1980 suddenly in 1977, and so on.
I have not yet spoken about the grossly factual errors. Among the most egregious are, for example, John Deacon on bass as part of Smile, or selling a van to get money to record a debut disc, or a completely wild moment learning a We Will Rock You song in the year of 1980, although the thing itself was written and recorded in 1977 or John Deacon, suddenly singing in studio recordings.
Well, okay, viewers in their mass don't give a damn about all these delights, probably. Well, maybe the actors were great then? Not so. Ramey Malek as Freddie is not even a joke, it is a pure farce brought to the point of absurdity. A slender young man with very noticeable artificial teeth mannerates and grimaces for two hours, trying to portray a singer who, even in the years of same-sex relationships, radiated masculinity and strength. Immediately, we see a certain vocalist, who had fallen into Smile from where (all Freddie's early musical projects were simply ignored) (and by the way, it was possible to spend more time on Tim Staffell,) just as quickly changing his relationship with a girl for romance with men, and then throwing up absurd parties ... and so on, swiftly and at the top, skipping important events and moments of biography.
For some reason, it reminded me of the hackneyed clichÃ© of a number of books and films about the path of a genius - lack of understanding of relatives, the way up, excesses, painful searches for themselves, psychological drama. And yes, all this is present in the 'Rhapsody'.
Well, but what about the other members of the group? Actually, can they save the movie? No, they do not save. May is shown as such a good-natured brat with no special character traits, Taylor is d epicted as that kind of cutie, worn off with one of his songs and suddenly fiercely quarreling with Freddie, and Deacon just looks like occasionally talking furniture. Oh yeah, he's showing the song on the bass. Next thing on him - silence.
The critics are absolutely right in one issue - Malek is trying very hard, but he overplays terribly, the beautiful picture does not carry any content with it. Instead of a truly interesting team history, we absorb a bright and mannered video clip with small pieces of facts. Clip feed for clip generation.
And one more thing - Live Aid was undoubtedly important for the band in terms of reviving interest in their music. But in general, they could even asa solo event gather 130,000 spectators, as was the case in 1988 in Brazil, for example.
What can be said in conclusion? Alas, the film was completely unsuccessful, in my opinion - a complete failure. I do not recommend watching at all, well, except for fun.
My rating is 1 out of 10 (I give a point for the music of the group that sounds in the film).",1,17,32,26 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An Amazing Journey Begins
","It is very, very difficult to write about The Lord Of The Rings. So much has been already said, written, discussed and argued about this epic of a film that every new comment tends to repeat any already written work. I will try, anyway. I like this film, all three parts. I remember the trembling in my body before going and seeing the first part, The Fellowship Of The Ring. And, yet, I liked that. I watched the film in cinema twice and then countless times on DVD, an enlarged version on two discs, with many deleted or shortened versions. The ensemble of the actors is just amazing. Now, after the film, it will be impossible to imagine any other Frodo but Elijah Wood, any Gandalf but Sir Ian McKellan, and any Galadriel but Kate Blanchette. And then, there is Sean Bean as an impeccably neat and marvelously great Boromir. And then, there are Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies as Legolas and Gimli respectively. The first film is an excellent change from a peaceful, sweet Shire to a gloomy Moria, then from fabulous Rivendell to terrible Mordor. The Orcs, the Elves, the Hobbits are all here, they are larger than any life, they live, eat, drink, sleep, talk, breathe. And what is simply amazing you never doubt that they are. Peter Jackson and his team did an enormous job. Thanks to them, we see and feel the smoke of the wars, the tragedy of poor Boromir, the suffers of Frodo or Arwen. And what makes the film so brilliant, is the feeling at the very final scene that you want to see the next right now, you simply cannot wait",10,1,2,7 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," 90 Minutes Later
","28 Weeks Later is a very dynamic, fast, ferocious and wild movie. And, yes this is true, this one belongs to the kind of films that do not make you think, but, instead, grip and hold you by their tempo and speedy change of events. The sequel to 28 Days Later is also taking place in infected London. The view of the great city, taken by the plague, is breathtaking. All those empty streets, all those neglected parks, all those ruined houses are spellbinding, as well as excellent helicopter shots. Then, there are very, very fast zombies, running all around and looking very frightening. Well, the film is only about 90 minutes long, and this is a rare treat nowadays. What is good, it does not get boring or dull. The fast pace remains throughout and that is a great side. What is bad, somehow, is that method of shooting the scene, when the camera is shaken and stirred all the time, and in some 3 minutes it becomes very inconvenient to watch that blurred sequence of actions. The heroes? Well, the movie is so intense, that they have no time to develop or express themselves at any rate. They either run or chase. The only person you feel sympathy to is that military marksman who gets killed by mistake as he is thought to be one of the infected zombies. His death is so tragic, but his life is so full of heroic deeds that he really evokes sympathy. Watch this film if you want some really intense and condensed action. For some deep and serious pondering, this work is not a good choice.",6,1,3,26 August 2007
Pitch Black," Thrilling work
","Vin Diesel as Richard Riddick is very convincing in this film, which starts a series of two, and hopefully there will be trequel to this. The movie is very well done, with excellent sceneries, great tension, smart plot and excellent suspense all the way through. Several people survive on a planet and start a bloody fight against horrible man-eating flying creatures, merciless and cruel. Nothing new? Well, Riddick makes it very fresh and upbeat. He is cool, strong, cynical and very clever. He is not daunted or haunted, he acts in cold blood and his actions seem cruel at first, but then it is him who saves at least three people and helps them escape the bad place that they had landed on. Vin Diesel proves that he is a good drama actor and not simply a strong guy with muscles. He does play and does that admirably well. Good work, smart and clever.",9,4,6,10 August 2007
Cold Mountain," Fine Scenery, But Overtly Boring
","Many people sing arias about this monster of a movie, as they say. They told me many times it was a masterwork of pure art, as grand as The English Patient was. Well, for the start, I do not enjoy the Patient movie. Sorry. Cold Mountain was a yawning boredom almost all 3 hours. I waited for the famous Crater attack scene. It was shown. Not true, not as it was in reality. I wanted a Civil War movie and got a messed melodrama with very slow and poorly acting Nicole Kidman, very funny (the best there) Renee Z., and then, Jude Law. He was not good for his part. He was far too weak for that tremendously challenging character. So, even the parts of Donald Sutherland or Phillip Seymour Hoffman did not save this film from the abyss of boredom. Sometimes, it was OK, especially in battle or shoot-out scenes, but mostly - slow, deliberate and unnatural. There are many goofs, many historical inaccuracies for Civil War buffs' horror. Generally, it was a languid, prolonged, unnecessary dirty movie, which did not even come close an inch to masterworks like Gettysburg or alike. Sorry, it was not great.",2,3,4,16 November 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Couldn't have been worse...
","Talk about the sequels... Well, why did it flop so miserably? All the elements of the winning formula are here - Mr. Gov'ner, Arnie; the bad Terminator, this time even a lady Terminatrix, T-X, and the cool plot. Oh, really? The film is unbearably boring and inevitably dull. There are two wooden facial expressions on Arnie and they are so predictable, that you can play the whole role instead of him. Kristanna Lokkn is a bad actress indeed. She doesn't even pretend to play, she just runs well, falls down well, looks in a blank stare well and then kills fast. See, anyone else can play this all. You didn't need to pay Arnie so much bucks for this trash! The very scene of the cars' chase is also very predictable and it is not even funny. The biggest problem of this sequel is a sheer absence of any humor and then totally bad play of those young actors who are John Connor and his future wife. You really miss Linda Hamilton and all her really deep work. Bad, bad film, indeed.",1,0,3,25 September 2006
The Alamo," The Alamo - Triumph And Tragedy
","I must say, I never was a Billy Bob's fan, but his part as Davey Crockett made me change my opinion. Billy Bob shined in this great film, and his Davey is a real man with his assets and liabilities, with his likes and hates. A true hero of Texas. His violin on the roof before the attack is a deeply moving scene, as well as his last valiant moments. The character of Sam Houston, impeccably performed by great Dennis Quaide, is another big winner. Dennis performs so deeply and so well that I never doubted his integrity and his sincerity. Another great winner is Mr. Echevarria as Santa Anna - excellent portrayal of a malicious dictator, cowardly and treacherous. His subordinates awoke more sympathy, given the valiant deaths of some, but Santa Anna shies too as a great example of a real evil guy. Very good soundtrack and very stunning battle scenes make the film even more splendid, and the sordid scenes of fighting bring to mind all the heroism and valor of Texans. Greatly recommended",Null,2,4,5 August 2011
The Patriot," Incredibly Great Movie
","It is very easy to criticize, lampoon or scold movies by Roland Emmerich ß his works are often out-of-the-real-world, too bombastic or unreal. But he does his job well and he is great as a director in The Patriot.This is the movie that I am never tired of watching again and again. Everything here is almost impeccable and incredible. Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is the best possible choice for this great heroic role, as well untimely passed away Heath Ledger as his son. Also, Chris Cooper is unbeatable in his part, and Tom Wilkinson is over the sky as General Cornwallis. There are many great actors here, and I think that the whole line-up is very very good. The battle scenes are made with a sheer touch of a genius and are very realistic and blood-chilling. Some humorous touches are also vivid and present and make the movie somewhat warmer and dearer. One can easily go down to the minutest details and criticize the inaccuracies, but they are all invisible when you sit and enjoy a very decent work, and 2 hours + fly very fast. Highly recommended movie, really one of Emmerich's best",10,3,9,3 September 2012
Divergent," Dauntless Movie, Candid Effects, Amiable Tempo, Not That Bad
","Divergent is not that bad film as many picture it. I watched it very carefully, through my headphones in order to get a better sound, to hear actors' sometimes quiet whispering, to get a better idea of lavish soundtrack. The whole cast is pretty strong here, and yes, Shailene Woodley as Beatrice 'Tris' Prior Theo James as Tobias 'Four' Eaton Ashley Judd as Natalie Prior Jai Courtney as Eric Coulter Ray Stevenson as Marcus Eaton Zoë Kravitz as Christina Miles Teller as Peter Hayes Tony Goldwyn as Andrew Prior Ansel Elgort as Caleb Prior Maggie Q as Tori Wu Mekhi Phifer as Max Kate Winslet as Jeanine Matthews Ben Lloyd-Hughes as Will Christian Madsen as Al Amy Newbold as Molly Atwood - they all did a pretty solid and decent work. I must say and dare say the first part is rather nice, and a thrilling piece of work to watch. Yeah, there are weaker moments, too. What many have already mentioned before, the plot is at times terribly predictable, and you can easily tell the next twist before it even happens. Is it so bad? Yes, as it turns a movie a bit sour. No, as it does not spoil the whole movie. The video effects are very spellbinding and the lush soundtrack proves to be a pretty strong point. But still, many, many characters beg for deeper portrayal and a better explanation. Sometimes, some elements seem to be a bit shallow and not that persuasive, it just happens and you have to go with it. I say, this movie should be watched and will be enjoyed, but a second try? I am not sure so much.",8,0,1,20 July 2015
Jarhead," Quite an average film
","I expected more of this film. The idea to show the US army going to Iraq through the eyes of a regular Jarhead was neat, and Jake Gyllenhaal is a very strong, promising actor, but the final result was large disappointment. Well, Jake is a good choice here, he plays a very good role, his acting is refreshing and convincing. But then, the film is far too long and soon starts to stumble and crawl. Anyway, there are absolutely excellent moments there. The one where the angry jar-heads try to kill at least one Arab is so truthful and chilling that makes you shudder. Or, when the jar-heads go along the desert, covered with the billows of oil smoke, black and really shocked - What are we doing here? Is the war that there is? The film could have been much better, be it not so slow and prolonged.",5,0,1,19 September 2006
Dunkirk," The Best Movie Of 2017, One Of The Best In War Genre
","I've been patiently waiting for this Christopher Nolan's new war epic and rightly so. This is a very mesmerizing, awesome, spellbinding effortless (seemingly) but astonishingly great movie that captures the terror and (and this is even more horrifying) averages of war tragedy. The movie depicts Dunkirk evacuation from France to Britain, and we witness several main characters suffering loss, pain, thirst, fear, hope, despair, hope again and then - a huge exhaustion. This is a really deep and strikingly realistic war film which show the cruelty and immediacy of was so vividly and so honestly livid that tears are about to come, and you sit on the edge of your chair and clutch fists in pain. Empathy is very deep here, too. All the main heroes, Branagh, Hardy and Murphy among those,do such a tremendous job that you forget you're watching a movie, you feel like you're there, in grim, dim, dreary, dreadful reality of war. I certainly recommend this excellent movie to all serious war theme buffs. This is a very true, decent and honest effort. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",10,2,10,9 December 2017
Cross of Iron," Too Much Violence, Too Many Goofs
","Sam Peckinpah was real master - his Major Dundee is a classic. Here, he tried the very nerve of many Russians - so-called Great Patriotic War in Soviet Union, here we see Taman region of 1943 and all is shown through several German army officers and soldiers. James Coburn and Maximillian Schell are mani stars, and well, they do good job. But then, all the right message of the movie - War Is All Hell - is somewhat blurred and lost. One thing which stands on the way and does not allow to delve deeper into the plot is any goofs - Russian uniforms are a laughing stock and not correct, many weapons are wrong, even Soviet T34 tanks when firing make a wrong sound. We hear Russian speech in the movie - several times, it is good and clear. several times, it is very heavily accented and all wrong in a choice of words (believe me, I am Russian). Sam Peckinpah dwells too long in brutally violent battle scenes - yes, was that brutal, violent, bloody, dirty, merciless and wild. That is true. But here we expected more of a personal tragedy displayed. Instead, all the deep tragic moments are smashed away with prolonged (too much prolonged battle sequences). It gets to a real drag sometimes. Russians never wore those helmets in attacks like those and rarely fixed bayonet to their Mosin rifles - too heavy and not effective. Russians never attacked like that, too. Russian tanks are also a bit sluggish in the movie, while in reality they were incredibly fast, quick, precise in firing and good for breaking walls. Goofs aside, violence aside, that was a good movie. Another weaker point - too long.",6,2,4,11 May 2014
Aliens," An Absolute Masterpiece
","There are several films where the second part is the best. Termonator 2 is one great example, Aliens is the second. Here, every little thing is a real work of art. This is such a great, timeless suspense movie that every time you watch it, you see some new details, some new events, some new revelations. This is a real treat and fest to eyes. Sigourney Weeaver, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn and others did such a marvelous job here. Ripley was never better, more convincing, decent and reckless than here. And then, there are those horrible, ghoulish shrieking aliens, so terrible and so menacing that they make you blood chill and freeze all 2 hours. This film was made in 1986 but still is watched like a very modern, up-to-date, fast, wild and unmitigated audacious attempt. Really good, really great. Highly recommended for all who like such thrillers. Well done, with excellent props, FX's and deep dark atmosphere of fear and horror",10,0,2,22 July 2013
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Cringeworthy Rubbish
","I like Harry Potter series, the last film of 2 parts was really spellbinding, and the serious tone of later books / films was oretty cool. OK, I said, this film is a part of Potter universe, and also, there are several excellent actors there - this one should be great effort. No, very loud and very clear No. Eddie Redmayne is te first and the main cringeworthy factor here - his drunken, sloppy, shaky delivery smacks of such obvious amateur aura that it makes it not even funny - it makes it sick and shallow. Evrything is a flop here - it is not a kid fairy tale, being too violent and vile. It is not a serious later Potter film, being too silly and sleazy. It is not even a parody, being too serious to its demerit. Another awful mess is Colin Farrel's part, leaving only smork and sickness

Ocean's Eleven," Certainly The Best Of All Three Parts
","Some films have this uncanny knack to be great from the very start and for ever. They were fresh, funny and cool at first, they remain great all years throughout. Soderbergh made this brilliant masterpiece back in 2001, and even now this movie is watched with a real pleasure, as it goes on with a gusto, excellent tempo, mesmerizing music and impeccable sense of humor. This is a remake that is way better than its Frank Sinatra original. Here, the shining cast of excellent stars make this film a real treat and a real chef-d'ouevre to digest at any time. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, among many, made this film such a tremendous trip. The soundtrack is a huge winner, too, with all that cool jazz, dance tunes, Presley's hits and lounge tracks, adding much to the seemingly nonchalant and brisk beat of the movie. The suits, the sets, the stunts are all jaw- dropping. Beautiful, lovely film that already stood the test of almost 15 years and will stay so for sure. Highly recommended.",10,0,1,1 February 2015

","Maybe, I am getting too old, maybe, this is a part of subculture that I do not grab or embrace, maybe this is that comic book culture that we did not and largely do not have here in Russia, but one thing for sure and this is this: Scott Pilgrim is a really utter rubbish, awful nonsense and a terrible fetid crazy kaleidoscope of whatever which makes you feel tired, dizzy, angry and laughing at the same time. The film presents a very impressive crew of great actors, such Micheal Sere or Kieran Culkin, or a very sweet Mary Elizabeth Winsteadm but what we have is a headache and a very silly mix of all unimaginably poor comics and a very shallow plot that can appeal only to very young, green, immature and silly willy kids who know no life. This is a bright wrapping with no real candy underneath, nay, it is empty and vapid inside. Scott Pilgrim fails to entertain, to deliver message, to excite or thrill. Insread, we witness a bad, poor, shallow, mediocre broth with no meat, only thin layer of some fat on top. Poor and miserable",1,3,8,3 December 2017
Resident Evil," Masterpiece!!!
","I love Milla very much. I like this movie, since this is one of the best she ever starred in, including the Fifth Element or any other. But Resident Evil is ever fresh, ever thrilling monster. The plot is excellent and from the very start the movie holds you glued to the seat and never allows you even to take a breath in or out. Milla as Alice is brave, sexy, valiant, courageous, smart, cool and so clever. And then there is Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, she is so gloomy, so dark and so demonic, that you hardly avoid falling in love with her too. The very idea that some large corporation like Umbrella here may control you, create some terrible genetic monsters and never be responsible for that is also a big magnet in this film. This is cool, impeccable and great All 10 / 10",10,7,15,1 August 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Abominable Monstrosity Of Yawning Tedium
","You want a definition of pretentious, tedious, boring, prolonged, too far-fetched, dull, skewed, pathetic, silly and bland? Well, you got it - this abominable terrible monstrous long stew that was intended as a masterwork but failed sizzling and dies with a whimper. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a terribly vapid and languid film that crawls lazily and only gets a bit faster when the shootings come in, but alas, even they sound as if some boys exploded powder from their dad's bullets in the backyard. This lazy, idle, slow, plodding, yawning delivery is made all worse by awful scenes of some duels or deaths which all seem unnatural or staged. Brad Pitt? Sam Shepard? Sam Rockwell? Well, ven excellent stars can make horrid missteps like they all did here. My advice - never even think of watching this abomination of artless stew/",1,3,7,8 April 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," Most Overrated Piece Of Terrbile Cinematography
","Why on earth is it considered one of the best? Can anyone explain this mystery to me? The film is just awful - outdated, slow, clichéd, skewed, biased, unrealistic, propaganda-driven, silly at times, overtly naive and very very long. Peter O'Toole? Can he play? He can. Not in here. Here, his uneasy array of homo-hints, blank stare, evidently weak acting, very unnatural emotional display, shallow delivery and generally very irritating mimics. Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness are no better with their laughable gestures, bad lines and unconvincing acting. This is a very overrated piece of time movie, which belongs to where it should be - in the past, as a result of very poorly executed epic saga ewhich drags and dies along. My advice - watch it, but then drop it. There are better movies in this world... THis one is a real waste of time.",1,20,56,3 March 2013
It Follows," It Tries Very Hard
","It Follows was and still is a very popular movie, well - quite understandable - pretty young lady as a lead, and she has long legs and we see her legs almost throughout the film. The atmosphere of dark suspense is built up quite well many times, scary jumps are good, too. Still, something is inherently wrong with this movie - it way too often becomes slow and dragging, losing much of its initial impact and dabbling in mediocrity. Maika Monroe is a sweet lady, but she often lacks certain depth and way too often is just staring blankly again leading to a loss of a real thrill or scare. OK, then, it tries to be a thrilling movie, instead, it ends up being nice but not more above than that",6,0,1,5 October 2017
JFK," Terribly Long, Boring and Very Vapid
","Oliver Stone can be both great and miserable, he can create some really astonishing works like Nixon, or he may dwell in the mire of banality. Here, you can start slinging mire at me, but I did NOT like JFK - I have watched this Director's Cut version and merely managed to sit through this endless boring mire or wild fantasy, unimaginably poor play of some actors, like Bacon or Oldman, and then, I never was a fan of mediocre president as JFK was in reality. Having said that, I must agree with those reviews which state that Stone quite forgot to put a disclaimer at the very start of this horrors of a movie that he had mostly wildly invented most of the plot and much of that is pure imagination land, not more So, any redeeming feature? Nope, I was not impressed by equally dismal performance of Kevin Costner, not was Dobald Sutherland more better or persuasive. Result--> This is the most overrated movie",2,5,15,22 July 2013
Get Out," Probably The Worst In Years
","Everything good that you've read about this movie is wrong. This is true what Armond White of National Reviw said - this is a shallow rendition of serious racial slur topic on to a Tarantino-type idiocy with all its worst traits, and a deeper delving into a very sleazy and outwardly silly moss of dullness, tedium, drag, plod, endless F-words, endless slow pacing and very midget message, which all was lost in mire and drabness and woven with webs of tepid boredom.
Avood this awful flick at all costs, and believe me - hatdly ever had I seen a more shallow and skinted wry fest of weak rants and totally blank shooting with zero results.",1,5,11,29 December 2017
2012," Farce
","Mind you, Roland Emmerich is a great filmmaker and he can create a truly brilliant work - like my favorite The Day After Tomorrow, or Independence Day. These are really cool and compelling works. 2012 is not. Oh my, almost 3 hours of complacency, vapid jokes, caricatures and shallow images. The main hero? Sure, divorced. President of USA? Sure. African-American. Russian? Sure, fat bandit. Chinese? All cruel morons. Catholics? All die very soon. Tibet lamas? All light and grace. I am tired of those cartoon'd images. A real farce, especially think of the silly-looking Queen of England. Nothing here holds it together. John Cusack? Amanda Peet? Naaah, boring! The only light spot is Woody Harrelsson and his short role, pity, too cameo...",1,2,3,31 May 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," Splendid albeit a bit gloomy final stand
","Sequels are either a success or a flop. This is not anything new. WE saw the terribly weak, vapid and bloodless sequels such as Terminator 3 or Blade Trinity, but, at the same time, we witnessed such marvelous examples of strong sequels such as Destination Point or Matrix. What about the X-Men? Did they stand their ground and did this final part prove it had been worth waiting? Yes, it did! This final part is a sweeping, majestic and grand take, full of breathtaking video effects and excellent tag-lines, dialogs, moments, and on top of it all, full of deep tragic events. Well, this is the darkest out of the three parts. Several main characters die, including Xavier himself, some of his aids and enemies. The plot is great. WE see a new vaccine that will eliminate the X-genes from the mutants' organisms and many of the mutants are striving to do so. Then, a terrible bloody war between the Magneto's gang and Xavier's part rage on. We see the struggle between these two parts and then the intruding of the people to this battle. The film is very quick, fast and ferocious, we cannot stop or have a break, since it is so thrilling and exciting. The play of such stars as Hugh Jackman, Ian McCellan, Halle Berry and others is excellent and you never doubt the truth of it all. Very good last part, a bit gloomy, but still strong.",9,0,1,5 October 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Smashing Second Film
","Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White.",10,2,4,7 September 2007
Schindler's List," Must Be 100 Out Of 100
","The best. I mean it. I am not a Jew, but a Russian-Polish, and am very Pro-Semite. Still, I waited to see this film for many years, as I felt I was not yet ready. But now, I have seen it and am so deeply impressed that I cannot express my utmost gratitude well. Spielberg is a genius here, as he always is. He made a strikingly great work, so deep and so tragic. Its black and white scheme made it even better and deeper. All who played there are truly tremendous. Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley - just even them three made it so brilliant. This is a movie that must be seen and taught at schools as a great reminder of utter horrors of Holocaust. I am deeply moved to tears, especially by the final scene which is so good, so tender, so gentle and so Powerful. Need I say more? This is a masterpiece",10,15,23,25 November 2012
The Mist," Good but with some flaws
","The Mist starts extremely well, the very fog, the horror of the first minutes, the first victims - that all seems to be utterly great and captivating... but then, after almost 90 minutes, I started to ask myself if I ever got the answers to some burning questions. The very end of the movie is so improbable, so shallow and so illogical that the 1 question was - Why struggling so much if the end is going to be so silly and so hopeless? The explanation of the whole monsters' attack is also so very thin and so disillusioning that the 2 question rings like - Could the film makers invent some really more exciting explanation? Apart from that, the whole film is a good suspense horror and a very true King's work... If only they improved some weaker spots a bit...",7,0,2,12 October 2008
Stardust," A Fairy Tale Not For Little Kids
","Oh, what a mixed impression! Take Michelle Pfeiffer, add Robert De Niro, Rupert Everett, Sienna Miller and then throw is some brutal jokes, gay innuendos, magic worlds, incantations, miracles, Unicorns, blue blood (literally), love story, flying ships in the Lexx style  and what will you get? A tasteless, banal, lascivious mess of a film? No, Stardust  a very humorous, deeply funny and highly entertaining 2 hours of a very good movie. At the very start, the film smacked of some bad, borrowed Lord Of The Rings  style parody, but with the course of time, it got only better in amazing proportions. Be warned, this is not the film for little kids, it has such gooey moments like De Niro as a gay pirate captain, or Pfeiffer as a merciless murderer. The film has so many gory scenes and sexual hints that it borders on adult fringe. This is not a classic fairy tale in a classic sense of the word. No, it has so much of a tragedy, so much of a broken romance and of violent historic costume drama. There are many highlights here. Peter O'Toole as a senile dying king is one of them as well as the seven dead but very much alive ghosts of king's murdered sons. After all, De Niro's gay dance with cross dressing is a pure explosion of risky but extremely clever humor. 10 points go to his pirate crew, the bunch of slightly dumb but yet valiant commandos. A very exceptional treat for those with wide world view.",8,1,1,30 December 2007
I Am Legend," Many Missed Opportunities
","This movie could have been really a great work. Will Snith IS a superb actor, and he can save almost any poor script, but here there are many weak spots, and generally, the movie is very predictable, so even great Will cannot help it. The movie is shot well, that is what I gave it a 5, special effects are very decent, and empty New York really seems grand. The doggy is a real cute, and she saves most of the weaker spots with her genuine canine simplicity. Yes, this is all good. But then, the zombies. Did we see them all before? Sure, we did. And many times and in many similar films. They run, eat, roar, howl, yell, yelp and scream. They are ghouls, real monsters. This is all good, too. But not fresh and not original in any sense. We saw it all before. We can easily predict what will happen soon and who will die. Well, if you want a better zombie movie, try Resident Evil, Part 1 - this is really a better take on the topic of flesh eaters. So, the conclusion? Not bad, but not so great or fresh",5,1,2,3 November 2013
Shrek the Third," Very Funny Sequel!
","I liked Shrek the Third. Very good, funny, witty film with many good jokes, excellent humor, great music and outstanding video graphics. Greeat animation, as well. What is the most outstanding here, is that the cartoon became more serious in tone, more deep in sense, the topics of child raising, responsibility, care and love are introduced here better, in more vivid colors. Shrek is as usual - clumsy, cool, rude and funny, but the main plus here is the hilarious bunch of female heroes - Snow White, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella - they are so funny, so cute and so superb that almost steal the show. And when Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song came out, I was roaring with laughter, it is so great! The movie is a real must see.",8,2,3,3 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," One Of The Best War Movies
","I think, war is horrible. War is bad, silly and really tragic. There are very few good war movies, as there are many shallow, insipid, vapid, sentimental works that do no good. The Hurt Locker is a deeply tragic, deeply thoughtful, deeply truthful war film, that really holds you glued to the screen and make you feel hatred the war. All the actors, Renner, Mackie, Feines, Morse do their job and you feel this is what it is like in the war. There's nothing funny, sweet or sterile in war. Sweat, blood, deaths, bullets, explosives - all this makes a war, and Mrs. Bigelow shows that really well. She managed to touch the strings that really ache, and you understand that war is awful.",10,0,4,2 January 2011
The Longest Day," Remarkable Work Of Real Genius
","This is a brilliant, brilliant, very good movie. I watched years ago in Poland with Polish dubbing and loved every minute of it, and now finally watched in English with real voices of great cast of stellar actors and actresses who made a very fantastic job. So much has been said and written about this huge production, that it will be no wise to go repeating the many times written things of praise. Anyway, what is really great about this excellent movie? This is not banal, not pompous, not trite or clichéd. Instead, it depicts the war as multi-tiered, multi-faceted affair through the eyes of many simple men and women. What is Really great and really outstanding here, is the way the battle is shown - every little person made their humble effort in winning that horrible battle, and together, they won. The great cast of many actors show us all sorts of people - paratroopers, soldiers, nuns, Resistance fighters, partisans, officers, generals, sailors, miners - and they all commit themselves and do great and unimaginable feats of valor, courage and gallantry. The battle scenes are among the best I've ever seen and they mesmerize with their cold, brutal realism, with their excellent depiction and their impeccable effect. War is all hell, and it is clear here. Much can be said about each separate actor - they all did marvelously here. This is a grand example of a really great movie. Thank you",10,3,4,5 March 2013
Ex Machina," 1 (Awful) Is The Best Description For This Abomination
","OK, have you ever watched a movie that was nominated, praised, glazed and framed, more awarded and blah blah, but turned out to be Dead Boring? You're in for a treat with this abomination of a movie of almost 2 hours of plodding slow pace and terrible dialogs aplenty. Actors? None, whatsoever. I mean, they're so bland and blunt that a child can perform better. Dialogs? Laughable. Plot? No spoilers, but so silly and so trite that one can only scratch a head in utter disbelief. Oh yeah, nudity. How can a movie now do well with no full frontal nudity? It is there, ladies aplenty. Perverts may be happy. But the problem is, this does not save a movie from dead snoring boredom at all. Nay, it only makes it even sillier and goofier. In effect, no effect. No sense, no reason, no rhyme. Just beautiful nature and dead bored actors. Leave it for ever and touch this idiocy not.",1,2,10,3 September 2016
Patton," Mediocre And Forgettable
","Again, there are good and bad war movies. This one is rather poor. Seems to be, all the elements of a great war movie are here - stellar cast, great camera work, excellent and meticulous approach to details and superb music. Why does it then fall flat? The mere idea is nothing new - a bio of a great war general, this time, Patton, throughout his ordeals and victories in Africa and then Italy and then France. Yeah, but no. The false tone is set up at the very first, long, laughable and totally unnecessary speech scene that does all the wrong service and only makes the tonality of the film pretentious and suddenly comic. Battle scenes - there are several. But a very sloppy montage and abrupt character add to a bigger misery. Even the man himself seems to be all at odds with the whole thing. The worst is yet to come with typically awful depiction of Russians. More to say here is only to induce laughter. So silly the whole scene is. The best is all of a sudden is a very delicate and deeper take on Germans - Jodl, Rommel, Steiger are all very decent and highly deliverable antagonists with their hopes and falls. That does not save these unimaginably long 3 hours of a plodding mess from a yawning boredom.",3,5,13,16 October 2016
The Illusionist," Edward Norton Proves He Is Very Good
","The Illusionist is not a brilliant film, but it is nice. If you think that it is about somebody like Houdini and his tricks, then you are mistaken. The main hero, played by excellent Edward Norton, named Eisenheim, is an extremely talented illusionist, whose shows attract great attention and have no explanation. But this simple plot is weighed much by the fact that the whole story takes place in visibly calm but internally tense Vienna, where His Royal Highness is plotting against his father, an Emperor of Austrian  Hungarian empire, to take his throne. Mr. Eisenheim is suddenly in the very midst of this political turmoil, which is only mad worse by his romantic affair with Prince's bride-to-be. The seemingly slow and peaceful film in fact gets in quicker with every minute and the whole whirlwind of events is flying high. Till the end of the film we have no idea who is dead or alive, who is going to win or lose, who is right or wrong. This is a great, up-tempo story, with political killings, love, tricks and mystery. Sometimes, the film seems to become openly mystical, sometimes, very realistic. This is what it makes it so very thrilling and catchy.",7,1,1,22 April 2007
1917," Very Good War Movie But Certainly Not The Oscar Movie Of The Year
","Sam Mendes took an enormous task to cover with this vast war epic - he decided to show just 24 hours of a war-torn day in 1917, April, through the means of a seemingly uninterrupted endless camera shot so that we could witness the whole event as if through the eyes of a main hero, Lance Corporal William 'Will' Schofield, here depicted masterfully by George MacKay. Alongside him, there's a whole array of wonderful British actors appearing here and there, such as Mark Strong as Captain Smith or excellent Benedict Cumberbatch as Colonel Mackenzie, or equally superb Colin Firth as General Erinmore.
This technique of a seamless single shot is nothing new, and here we see some obvious edits and cuts, which are not a tragic obstacle. Generally, the movie delivers the message extremely well, with a certain drawback being very obvious - the movie often drags and plods, thus losing much of its certain steam.
Several blatant mistakes and goofs apart, 1917 managed to impress me, but on one thing I surely agree - this was not the Movie of the year.",8,0,3,15 February 2020
Lincoln," An Awesome Masterpiece by Spielberg
","I was waiting for this movie eagerly, since I am a huge Civil War buff and am a great Lincoln admirer. Then, I was a bit suspicious - will it be a kitschy pastiche? Or a bloody gory mess? Or a costume sweet nothing? My fears were dispelled after almost 3 unforgettable hours at the local theater. Steven Spielberg has made a truly amazing masterwork of art, and his hand of genius is impeccable here. The film is never boring, never drags, never stuns in a bad way. It is a mature, deep, decent, daring step into seemingly slow territory of an Amendment hearings and private life of the most beloved US President. This is not a war film like Private Ryan, or Gettysburg. Do not expect grand battle scenes. But, this is a great film about how terrible any war is. The anti-war sentiment is so vivid and strong here. The very topic of the Congress hearings could be dull and boring, but a great array of great actors made this thrilling and captivating. The casting is perfect - Daniel Day Lews, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and many others made this film a feast for eyes and ears. The historical background is also very accurate and precise - you almost feel the coolness of White House rooms in winter, or a deep smell of blood in a battlefield, or a sweet smell of flowers on a table in the Mansion. The film is a big winner and a must-see for all clever people. 10 out of 10 - must be 100 out of 100",10,0,3,27 January 2013
Children of Men," Tremendously Vacuous And Horrid Waste
","I don't even know where ans how to start to describe this absolutely unimaginably horrendously awful waste of two hours that is Children Of Men. Why? Simply because this is such a terrible movie that each and every aspect of this simply drags and is buried in dross. What would be the perfect word to describe this stupefying idiocy? I guess, this is this - Mess. Mess of a plot which was never developed, with totally unsympathetic and shallow characters who never took off, with very strange soundtrack which seems to be cool but then sinks in drabness, with unbelievably shoddy plot which leaves so much to be desired that there's nothing left to desire at all. On top of that, there is this mind-numbing stupidity of profane language scattered all too fat, and then Micheal Caine comes in with his absolutely unnecessary part, which leaves you with mouth ajar and a question What on Earth have I just seen. Certain silliness aside, the bombastic ending is equally shallow and similarly bad. What do we have? Maybe, one of the Worst of the Worst films ever.",1,1,8,25 November 2017
Million Dollar Baby," Good but not excellent
","The film leaves many mixed feelings and emotions. First, the actors' play is always very good. Marty Freeman, Clint Eastwood and of course Hillary Swank are in all senses excellent actors, their delivery is impeccably smooth and almost close to perfection. It is not the acting that spoils the mood, it is the very tedious tempo of the film. Did you notice that sport films are mostly very boring? The acute, high-pitched and up-tempo sport scenes are intermittent with impossibly slow and boring 'real life' moments, when we see that they are also people, that they have their problems too and so on. But, dear me, I always wait till these boring moments will be replaced with those sharp sporty scenes again. The same with MDB - as a sport film, this is great, as anything else, it is slightly slowish and boring.",6,1,6,11 September 2006
Event Horizon," Abrupt and Not So Thrilling
","This movie was a big buzz back then, but I never managed to watch it in time, so only now I have done that. Well, sometimes, even the great casting does not help - as neither Sam Neill nor Lawrence Fishburne do save this mediocre plot from miserable plodding and very pathetic ending. The plot is very trite and does not leave any thrill or mystery very soon. Yes, very soon you can easily predict the next step and say what will happen and to whom. This is not good, as the trite plot is never an asset but rather a pending tail, that leaves no place for excitement. The very idea of the lost spaceship and lost crew is very old and very quickly the gore comes in, leaving no time to think or ponder. Well, this is a very good work, and this movie leaves you with a very bated feeling of disillusionment and slight boredom - what, is that all that this is? There are better films in this genre, so do not waste time on this one",3,1,2,18 October 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Very Appealing and Deep
","I must admit that I never watched any Swedish films before and this one was a novelty thing, if I may say so. t first, I was a bit skeptical and sour about that, but then this slow, growing film got me in and made me thrilled. Outstanding work, great plot, mesmerizing slow tempo which is a big plus. Marvelous severe Swedish nature. And then, Blomqvist and Rapace as two main heroes. I must say, they both play great. Very convincing and very thrilling. The plot is a bit predictable, especially, when we were given some hint about Nazi connections, but then, it still rocks good! There are some drawbacks, of course. Some nudity, graphic violence and rape scenes are not appealing at all, and deeply disturbing, and I am awfully sorry, but the view of hairy armpits of Lisbeth does not add to the pleasure of watching. Anyway, minor goofs and violent details did not spoil the general big picture.",8,1,5,2 April 2011
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Brilliant Sequel
","This is a very good sequel to RE that really thrilled me, shocked and sent me creeps! I loved the first movie with its great tempo, thrilling adventures, dead men walking, awesome Milla and excellent Michelle, with its Red Queen and valiant fight for life. The sequel is not worse, anyway. The whole city of Raccoon is plagued, dead are all around, and only Milla again as Alice may save them all. She does. The movie never gets boring or slow, it holds you glued and gets you more and more excited. The very end makes you ask what the last part be? I am waiting for the last part and just hope it will be better and not as bad as Ultraviolet that is a shame. Milla rules and let us hope she will be as great as she is here...",9,13,26,3 August 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Astounding New Episode
","Well, so much has been written, said and tweeted already that very little can be added to a loud choir of either praise or another choir, of criticism. Anyway, having said that, I must admit that The Last Jedi is a truly astounding episode and it holds admirably well in the already large and weighty Star Wars saga. This new part is the longest but the movie never drags or stalls and what's more, a very healthy intake of breezy humor adds a very strong element to this tightly-knit fabric of a plot. 
Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher - to name the few - do a very spellbinding and jaw-dropping work, and what's again very cool and decent, they are shown as real people, with weak spots, doubts, hopes, hesitations, panic, fear, terror and strength. Much has been written about Kylo Ren's battle with his own Dark Side, so no new thing must be added, but this very struggle is a truly breathtaking edge-of-the-seat holder all through this excellent film. Large and very clever parts played by Hamill, Fisher and Ridley also never let us down, and every time any of our beloved characters appear on the screen, we feel delighted to see them alive and kicking and going on their uneasy but deserved and rewarding paths. 
Awesome CGI, heart-wrenching deaths, intrepid feats, daredevil space battles add a huge portion of awe and excitement. And then, a beauty of the nature as well as very strong music put new pieces of mosaic thus building a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of thriller and food for thought.
This is a very welcomed new part of a large mechanism, and so many hints were dropped, new bridges to a fresh episode were built that we now have to take a deep breath and pluck up all our patience awaiting a new film.
So, this one earns 10 out of 10, to my and to many watchers' minds. I do hope the next part will fly into high space (pun intended) with the same gusto and valor.",10,6,26,17 December 2017
The Imitation Game," Too Dry, Too Formulaic And Inferior To Enigma
","Yes, Enigma in 2001 was a highly fictionalized movie, while there was a real Alan Turing and yes, The Imitation Game is based on all true life events. But what worked well in old film has not succeeded here in anew one. My opinion - while that old one was a perfect mix of suspense, thriller, drama, war epic, tragedy and romance, here it is a bleak dull shaggy description of some ill and variously challenged man with a good mind. But it all falls flat with a painfully slow delivery, unpersuasive tonality, certain flaws and goofs and a very silly air of pathetic motto: Who, if not us. OK, they did a marvelous job, but some aspects of war were so mundane and boring that they do not deserve a film to show. Do we really need to see a highly unwell man breaking codes or very blatantly Oliver Stone style of interpolation being stolen? No, certainly not. What is also very obvious and painfully poor is that rainbow scheme flag agenda propaganda slyly creeping into a plot, delivering a certain ungodly message. Okay, we can watch this once and quickly dismiss",2,2,2,25 April 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Winner!
","Yes! This was worth waiting! This was the film that surpassed all the bravest expectations. Mr. Depp is probably the greatest living actor in the world now, along with Al Pacino, De Niro or Julia Roberts or Jodie Foster. He is the ideal choice for a role of a real freak, like Willie Wonka is supposed to be. He plays Willie in such a cool, unbeatable way, that you only must applaud his mastery and talent. His Willie is a real freak, kind but cruel at the same time, vivid and languid, as if drunk and very sober. He is a walking enigma and he is a true King Of The Weird. The scene where he commands one of his nut squirrels to check a head of a naughty girl is merely cruel, but so funny. It is not only Depp, then, there is a very god part of Mrs. Bonham Carter, and then, all the actors are a good, brilliant choice here. And the colors! From a gray, dull scheme of Charlie's poor shabby hut to the warm, psychedelic rainbows of Willie's world! Awesome work of the crew and the film maker... Excellent work, all in all.",10,0,3,29 September 2006
Silence," Very Unusual, Deep, Tragic, Albeir Rather Violent
","Martin Scorcese is a tremendous filmmaker which he has proved time and again with numerous awesome movies such as Gangs Of New York or The Departed. When I was told he had made a film on Christian missionaries to Japan in the 17th century, I became highly suspicious - who of all the people, Mr Scorcese, the very man who made a highly insulting The Last Temtation Of Christ. I was very cautious when starting watching this epic movie. My impressions are very mixed. Let me touch upon certain pluses and minuses/ What was good - 1. Excellent casting - Neeson, Garfield and Driver are awesome from start to finish, they are impeccably excellent and very powerful in each scene they do. This is the 2nd Garfield's film connected with the issue of faith and he again shines brightly. I must also pay deep respect to Japanese actors Tadanobu Asano and Issey Ogata who did marvelous job. 2. The setting - filmed in Taiwan, but depicting Japan, the camera simply enjoys every single trait of gorgeous nature, deep and mighty, superb and awesome. 3. The plot - I was deeply moved by a very correct depiction of Christianity and the real, present, graphic suffering that believers had to endure. 4. The message is simple and yet powerful, too. Silent suffering is often equal to that vivid and loudWhat was bad: 1. The length. Unwielding 160 minutes are too much to swallow at one gulp. Too slow and too plodded. 2. Too graphic a violence. No, real, too too much. I felt sick and tired soon. 3. Tempo. Must be faster and more abrupt at times, me-think. General rating - 8 out of 10",8,0,2,26 May 2017
The Insider," A Very Good Ensemble Of Pacino And Crow
","The Insider is a very serious film; it has none of typical Hollywood sweet sentiments. Instead, it offers us a very deep insight into the modern-day problem  a struggle between an individual and a multi-national tobacco corporation. All the means is good here  bribery, libel, lies and blackmail. But the main hero, here played by Russell Crow, is undaunted, and despite the threats and loss of a family, he goes on. Another main character, here performed by always impeccable Al Pacino, is a hot-tempered CBS journalist, who is not afraid either of some mighty Lebanese Mullah or not less mighty tobacco moguls. He also goes on and he wins. The happy end here is not a false, sugary sweet melodrama type of end. Nay, since the whole plot is based on a real story, the director Mike Mann made it as it was. Yes, the happy ending, but after so much sufferings and losses. What is good, the movie does not thrive on blood or violence. What is a bit rude and even shocking, all the heroes use too much of the F-word. The cameo appearances of Gina Gershon and Stephen Tobolowsky are also a nice surprise and they add some certain spice to the plot. In general, if you like deep, mature, serious dramas about every day life and such like, watch that! Mind some foul language, though.",8,0,1,14 October 2007
Everest," Excellent Movie About How Fragile (And Futile) Life Can Be
","This is an awesome film, so severe, so dooming, so palpable, so menacing. And it sends one and a very clear message - the Nature is too tough to trifle with, it is too violent, too wild, too unpredictable, too huge for us to fathem. This enormity of the Everest Mount, this unbelievably awesome scale, this tremendous size, this humongous altitude diminishes all people and makes them look like tiny tots.
This is a very deep, a bit slow one, but deeply tragic, deeply serious, grave and solemn. It sends chills, it sends vibes, it sends a clear warning - don't mess with Mount. It sawllows people easily. 
I was very freightened after watching this movie, as it is so brutally honest, so horribly shocking, The very sheer volume of the Everest just opnes eyes and shows how unnecessary it is to climb there and die there.",9,0,2,10 January 2018
Once Upon a Time in America," Just awful!
","I watched this terribly long, boring, slow, bloody, gory, silly film several times. Why, or why was that so overestimated? What for? It has nothing, but too much blood, sex, more blood, more sex, child molesting, more blood, more child death, child sex, more blood, more slow talks, more long shots, more blood and more molesting. Raping, killing, talking, sex in a car, more fights, more sex... I am not a sick person. This film did make me feel sick. Why was it made? No one plays here, it drags 4 hours, it leaves a heavy heart and empty brain. Not for kids, not for those who idolizes De Niro or Woods, not for Leone's fans. This is just a bad, tasteless, vapid, senseless, soulless, heartless, clueless rape of our brains. Very bad.",1,50,105,15 December 2007
Taken," Fast Pace, Furious Plot
","Taken is a very ferocious, but fast and interesting movie - Luc Besson knows his trade, and Liam Neeson is a sure great actor who can convince you in everything he does. Pity there is not so much of screen time was alloted to gorgeous Famke Janssen who's is impeccable, sweet and deep as usual. The plot is very simple, there are no convoluted twists or impossibly hard to grasp details, everything is very straight, aggressive, brutal, plain and loud. Yes, too brutal, yes, too bare. Well, it is a part of plot here. You do not ponder for hours, trying to decipher twists and riddles. Such films as Taken should be, too. Maggie Grace is nice, she is very young, sweet and sexy. Yet, she has a long way to go to mature to play more demanding roles, but here she does well and does it all right. The movie is not for kids due to high level of rude violence and adult themes touched upon.",8,1,1,9 April 2014
This Is Spinal Tap," This Goes To Eleven!!
","What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see",10,1,4,1 August 2013
The Descent," No Nothing
","In this film you fill find - no plot, no thrill, no plausible character development, no real scary monsters (just some Gollums being thin and rather vulnerable), no real common sense (dares anyone, at least a female, go into unknown caves?), no logical sequence (what on earth was the car accident scene for??), no real performance (all female characters played unbelievably poorly), no medical truth (how can one speak with an ice pick lacerating their throat??), no logic in explaining how those monsters ate and where they got their plentiful amount of food (since bones are numerous), no explanation why the seemingly US vehicle was moving on a British side of the road, no real suspense and no real fright, no humor and no irony. Simply, there is no nothing not at all that is worth spending your bucks and time for",1,10,18,2 April 2011
The Da Vinci Code," When A Heresy Meets Hollywood
","Well, a heresy is a heresy, after all. For hundreds of years, the ideas and concepts have been molested, falsified, distorted, changed all over and got rid of. And we live in the age of post modernism, when as it seems everything is relative and therefore any stupidity immediately catches the general attention and does become a real fad. Dan Brown with his impossibly poor book, The Da Vinci Code, did exactly that. He wrote an unimaginable mishmash of pseudo-scientific, quasi-religious, sub par ideas that he suffered greatly to collide ands then juxtapose together. See, man, the Theory of Conspiracy has nothing new beside it. We have heard that all before many times. And then, see we all know that this is a lie, outright. Let us be somehow fair to Hollywood. They did their best trying to reproduce that mixture of sheer lies, idiocy, anti-Christian paranoia and anti-Catholic stance onto the silver screen. They did. But again, they failed on several levels. First and foremost, Tom Hanks as Prof. Robert Langdon is weak, bleak, slow and very pale. He used to save a whole lousy film before, but not now. Here, Tom is certainly not the main star; he simply goes with the general anemic flow and lets it happen. Sir Ian McKellen also does not shine. He is what he is  an old man. Add a beard and a cloak, and voilà, you have the same old Gandalf again! Jean Reno plays without his usual gusto and his role is at its best schematic. Maybe, only Jurgen Prochnow saves the day with his impeccable little part, but all is swept away with Audrie Tatou's impossibly weak performance. She goggles her eyes, she utters incredibly silly maxims, and she overplays and exaggerates it all to the level of amateurism. With that all in mind, no wonder that the 2-hours' long torture never gets a desirable cohesion. The film starts very well, as a real thriller, then gets to the point of some detective story, then almost falls down to some comedy and ends up as a second  rate melodrama. I almost wanted to laugh and change the DVD for some lightweight show on TV. What a pity many had to suffer that in the cinemas! Dan Brown, with his main ally, ultra-liberal Hollywood mongers, has made a new fierce attack on Christian beliefs and values. The inedible beefsteak of utterly hilarious ideas never gets to the throat. A mere enumeration of what he tried to depict will leave any seriously thinking individual in total shock. Jesus being married and having a daughter with Mary Magdalene, herself being a kind of pagan female goddess with some sacral sexual meaning, the Temple knights fighting to save the secret, the very idea of Jesus being a mortal man only  these are all old, old fairy tales. They are old, venomous, but not as harmful as some angry believers could get it. We saw that all before, didn't we? Time will show how many new Dan Browns will appear with their abominable books and films full of gods and demons, false ideas and wrong suppositions. And Hollywood will always keep that fire burning, making shallow screening versions, with poor plot and bad play. I pity Hanks, Reno, and Tatou, all others who wasted their talents on that low-key, tasteless treatise. Time will show. People will gladly forget this ditty, never having become a real song. A heresy is a heresy. It was, is and will always be.",1,17,34,23 September 2007
Three Colors: Blue," Blue. Sad. But so Majestic and Grand
","An outstanding work of the great late Mr. Kislowski. This time, the main heroine is impeccably performed by excellent Juliete Binoche and she plays with a mastery and skill that still admire after all these years. The film is truly blue, the main color scheme is really blue and then it suddenly turns to a Kislowski's most beloved honey yellow that it is a sheer pleasure to watch it. The main heroine suffers a death of her husband, a famous classical composer and her daughter in a car accident. She slowly starts to come back to life, and every time she has a real epiphany we hear a marvelous, deep, majestic music all around her. The woman becomes a new life, she sells her large house, buys a neat flat, meets new people and slowly returns to a normal way of life. She meets new neighbor, meets a former lover of her late husband, goes swimming... Life goes on, but up till the end, when she finally takes the work of writing the EU Anthem herself, that she finally comes back to this side of life. There are some very cool smaller details in the film - like, a bent old granny trashing the bottle, or a homeless flautist who anyway goes to his 'work' in a luxurious car, or a scene of street fight late at night - everything is so sharp, precise and forms a full grand scale picture. The only slight minus of the film is a bit slower tempo that it really should have had, so that to make this work an absolute peak. However, this film stands out still...",9,0,0,15 September 2006
The Happening," Very Good!
","Mark Wahlberg is truly a universal and unique actor. He can play almost everything, from a chilling thriller to a driving drama. Here he is a school teacher, methodical, deep, sober and very meticulous. His dry approach to events helps him a lot and he never loses his head even in dangerous moments. The idea of the movie is very good  to show that we, people, are a danger to the Nature in such a blood-chilling way. The scenes of mass suicides and gory deaths are truly horrifying and they do show the fragility of human life. Now, there's a great suspense growth in many scenes and the wind rustling in the trees has never been more terrible to hear! There are many minor parts in the film and those often unnamed heroes die and show us the very horror of the situation. Another great plus of the movie is its tempo and durability  it is very short and never drags. The very beginning and ending of the film are excellent and stand out much.",8,2,4,22 September 2008
The Departed," Very Tragic, Very Real, Very Good
","The Departed is a very, very good movie. Even if it is a way too long for such a genre, more than 2 hours, still, it holds together well and never gets boring. This is a joint success of the director, actors and the cameramen. Bright, vivid colors of Boston coincide with the terrible, bloody scenes of gang's shootouts. The central idea is very cute, too. One secret agent gets close to Mr. Costello, a very dangerous, bloody bandit; while Costello's man gets right into the Police, and he is very smart man, as no one can seek and destroy him. The film is a tense, brisk, fast and furious. The marvelous play of Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg adds great suspense and incredible zest to the movie. Up to the end you sit with your breath off, never knowing how it all will end up. The final is very tragic, but you have to see it yourself, because it will lose much if anybody tells you about that before. Watch it, you will not be sorry. Even if this film is so sad and offers no happy end, it stays as a bright example of a serious gangsters' movie.",8,0,2,28 April 2007
War of the Worlds," All the clichés
","Sometimes, there are movies where you can see all the clichés of Hollywood, possible and impossible. This movie is a classical example of a bad movie full of trite clichés and poor delivery. So, what do we have here - a hapless divorced Dad, with bad job and messy house a hapless son, sullen teenager with no desire to talk to his Dad or do any creative work a hapless little daughter with the amazing collection of all imaginable diseases of this world, including asthma, hysteria, autism, schizophrenia, paranoia, cancer, flu, rabies and all the rest a hapless stranger in a basement with all the paranoid behavior and bad ending a hapless movie that leads nowhere and leaves no impression a hapless performance of all the actors involved, Tom Cruise being the worst of the pack a hapless audience that had to endure that horror",1,1,4,12 September 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Prolonged, Slow, Rather Tepid and Boring, Thus, Not So Great As Many Claimed
","I expected more from that so-much lauded classic with so many great actors as main stars. Yeah, I watched it with all my patience and was a bit shocked - so? and that is that? Is that it? Is that the classic of cinema that so many people praised so much? I say, this is terribly long, very boring, very slow and rather tepid. And yeah, lukewarm. It did not hold well and left a very mixed impression. Yes, a great job was done and the final blow-up is a must-see. But then, there are so many buts and ifs. I was appalled by a slow tempo and very boring dialogs. My advice - yes, you can try and watch this one, but with a certain grain of salt, as not so many old films stood the test of time and preserve the fidelity and decency of other works. I give it 5 out of 10, but still, not to return to that one again",5,4,12,20 December 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," 4 For Muisc, Zero For Movie
","Anna Kendrick is lovable, she is very sweet, very sexy and very cute. And yes, all of the main heroes have excellent voices. Then, the music is cool, there are snippets of numerous outstanding melodies and awesome vocal arrangements (although, way too often acapella suddenly turns into a full-blown instrumental backing, which left me quite puzzled and bemused). Other ladies are sweet and attractive, too. Well, that's it. As for the movie - million times you've seen this endless saga of past success-turned-fiasco-turned-newbie-turned- growing pains-turned-long way to the top-turned-in the end everything's gonna be alright. You will see nothing new here. What is really awful ( and I mean this - really really poor) is this absolutely low-level racial-cultural stereotyping of the worst kind. I was shocked and saw in utter amazement those shameful caricatures of certain peoples. Silly, in the weakest manner said. The rest is just a forgettable, passable, liquid junk of silliest kind. It all is underdeveloped and lacking real depth. It's not even realistic or funny, to say the least. Music here gets 4 points, as there are many bad and schlock schmaltzy tunes, but the movie deserves nothing. It is so badly bad.",4,1,1,6 November 2017
Downfall," Awesome And Deeply Tragic Drama
","Well, it is never easy to make a film about such a terrible monster as Adolf Hilter, without either falling into a blunt, bland, straight at your face slogan accusation agitation ditty, or a totally unrealistic and outward silly.Der Untergang did a tremendous job showing a very real and very psychotic Hitler as he was. And that was not a small trifle. The film did a truly outstanding job of showing Hitler as a totally mad, but still cunning, violent but still thinking person. he is a tyrant, a monster, a real murderer and he is a cannibal, devouring Germany as a simple bite to pay for his fallen ambitions. His suffering and death are viewed with a great satisfaction, but not simply because - the film shows why and shows what for. I will not get into a greater detail, as it will bake spoilers, I only say - watch this, watch this tremendous masterpiece as it depicts the madness of last days of Reich, the cruelty of war, the senselessness of Nazism and wantonness of evil. Great movie, awesome casting, powerful message - war is all Evil.",10,1,1,20 September 2017
Whiplash," Big Expectations, Rather A Moderate Impression
","I had been waiting for this movie for long time, as I am a drummer of sorts myself, I like music, I like drumming films, and this one seemed to be a great achievement. After all, there are all those raving reviews and blazing cheers made to this spectacular piece of cinematography. Well, yes, I have watched it, and what I can say? It is very over-rated. Yes, both Simmons and Teller seem to give very impressive performances, and yes, Teller is A Good drummer with neat stroke, precise beat, gentle swing and delicate accents. But then, he does not convince as an actor. The love story is the biggest disappointment and the greatest weakness of the film. It simply passes by. leaving me cold and unaffected. Was that dubious drumming achievement worth losing a beautiful girl? It was not. Simmons is surely the crowning top of the production, but then, he is too sadistic, too dry, too pedantic or a jazz aficionado, he seems more like a drill sergeant than a genial conductor. The final solo? To long and too drawn out for a satisfying coda. Kinda cool, but tiresome and yup, dragging. It is a film for a single watch and quick oblivion.",6,6,13,4 December 2014
The Green Mile," A Breathtaking Masterpiece Of Sheer Art
","I love Stephen King's books, and he is a very lucky man to see his books put on silver screen so well. Just think how great are these movies - It, The Stand, The Shining, Langoliers, Tommyknockers, etc. The Green Mile is not exception, with only one exception (pun intended) - this is one of the all-time greatest King's adaptations ever made. Tom Hanks is a true star of this long, sad, deep, thought-provoking steamroller of a great film. How long does the film last? 2 hours? I never noticed that. I have it on old 2-VCR pack, with a great Behind The Scene bonus film. No boredom, no yawning. Just a sheer stream of a breathtaking prison life film. And the hears! Thet are marvelous. Brutal, Dell, The Mouse, Percy... all of them are shining here at top might. High;y recommended, with a slight deviation to the idea that the film has too many swear words and so graphical violence",10,1,3,1 June 2008
Dark Shadows," No Redeeming Feature Here
","Tim Burton used to be gooood. He did. Johnny Deep used to be a genius, too. He did. Here they both failed. Miserably. Utterly. Wholly. Completely. Totally. Pity. This is a vanity piece, as they say. Truly so. Why was that film shot? We did see Depp as a freak with all his nauseatic mimics, his wiggling limbs and queer-ish gestures. We saw in awful Sweeney Todd. We saw Helena Bonham Carter and we know already how bad she is. Any clear spot? Pfeiffer? Nay, she is very much like in Stardust. Old hat. So, any clear spot? Yeah. Alice Cooper. Music. This is all. All that dark, sepia, gloomy scheme is so funny and laughable. We never even smile. We saw all those mannerisms before. The winning formula Burton / Depp is a small smelly Quatsch here. No, no redeeming feature here at all. No wonder, it was so panned by critics. They are right.",1,2,4,13 November 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Utter Squalor, Must Be 1, 3 Goes For Effort And Some CGI
","This is what happens if you take much money, use your old tricks and base all your ideas on a small kids' book of 300 pages. I like JRR Tolkien's Lore very much and he is my all-time favorite writer. I was OK with LOTR Trilogy. Although there were poor moments and sheer goofs, the old trilogy was not bad. The Hobbit? Very much has been said and written about this trilogy, so I need not add more. I just want to say that this is what happens when you take a small thin book for kids, add much money, add totally unnecessary characters, add some crude CGI, sometimes even laughable ones. Peter, you did a lousy job, served a bad service, and this almost universal unanimous hatred towards Hobbit three parts is a vivid result of bad logistics, bad script and very poor decision of making a short book into a huge lump of a untasty monster of a movie",3,6,10,24 July 2016
Bring It On," 2 Out Of 10 - And these 2 Are Only For Dushku And Soundtrack
","I remember liking this light comedy in 2000, but when I watched this flick again, I was taken aback by its sheer shallowness, simplicity, overcliched plot, silly twists, extremely weak acting, horrible weak dialog and very surface morals.
Who can like it? Clearly - men who crave young girls in bikini, and here's what you see galore. Girls, who wanna be like main heroes. That's it.
Kirsten Dunst? She is awfully weak here, too, plain and inconvincing at all. Gabrielle Union? Nay, too formulaic.
So, 0 out of 10. No, wait - 1 for very beautiful Eliza Dushku, and 1 for music.",2,1,3,22 September 2019
Inception," Very Impressive But Not Superb
","Inception is a good movie, and yes, Christopher Nolan is a dept filmmaker as well as Lenoardo DiCaprio and the whole team are awesome wholesome actors. But if we bypass the bursts of joy and look at the movie in a more sober way, we must admit this is too long, far too slow at many cases and sadly so, overtly preachy. The sadder tonality of the movie is often far too heavy and leaves with a sore heart, whilst the slower pacing makes this undeniably excellent story a lead heavy bolt. The plot is well done and the idea of a dream within a dream is appealing to us, and yeah, the whole line of telling is very cool, and sure, the CGI are awesome and thus leaving us with mouths open. Unfortunately, the pace kills it all, and after couple watchings the boredom creeps in with no boundaries",8,0,2,1 June 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Mediore Piece Of Nothing
","Oh my God. How can it really be possible? A great cast, with such stars as Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp or Daisy Ridley among those, pretty good director and the lead character who is Kenneth Branagh, seemingly lossless plot, a classic Agatha Christie train murder story... and what we have is a horrible, grotesque, crooked, over-played, over-done, over-cooked, over-made up, over-made, over-performed, over-everything piece of truly fetid garbage. What is even more insulting, the movie is a tedious endless ebb boredom fest.
 Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and a half stars, and stated that he felt it focused too much on Poirot to the detriment of the other characters, adding, 'Never let it be said the director misses an opportunity to place his star front and center, unfortunately relegating just about everyone else in the obligatory International All-Star Cast to a paper-thin character with one or at most two defining personality traits.
Truly so.
 Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club rated the film a C+ and complained that Branagh's 'erratic direction-more interested in cut glass and overhead shots than in suspicions and uncertainties-bungles both the perfect puzzle logic of the crime and its devious solution.'
Very truly so.
Empty, shallow, void and null nothing. Avoid this",1,16,32,1 March 2018
Defiance," Not Awful, But Very Weak And Pathetic
","It seemed to be an excellent idea to make a WWII movie, set in Belarus in 1941-1945, showing the (in)famous Belski Brothers, who were Jews making their partisan camp and fighting against the oppressors. The problems stated immediately when I saw the casting. Don't get me wrong, Liev Screiber is a great choice, but Daniel Craig was clearly wrong. He is again a James Bond character, cool and defiant (Pun intended), but he lacks depth and is not convincing as a Jew. The rest of the casting is rather bland and bleak, so you will hardly remember anybody there. The second problem is the historic accuracy. I will not dwell onto details, but in reality that was not so simple as in the movie, as The Belskis fought not just Germans. The reality was much more convoluted, complicated and mixed. The third and really puzzling aspect is - why on earth do they speak a very weird mixture of typically simplified and wronged English and suddenly in Russia. I am Russian, and I was almost jumping on my chair hearing these sudden jumps from broken English to quite clean Russian. Liev speaks Russian better, by the way. Then the battle scenes - well, this shaky camera, these typical explosions, these bullets fatty zing-zanging onto soil - all of that is so ...wel.. Hollywood. The whole battle thing here is so hasty, kinky and wry that it leaves a feeling of utter disbelief. The overall impression - no, this is not your ultimate war movie. It leaves you cold and never lets the feeling of artificial setting go away. My rating - 2.",2,0,1,5 May 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Tremendously well!
","When I watched that movie in cinema, I was very suspicious. We in Russia are spoiled (in a good way) by our excellent TV series that were praised in the UK, so the new version was a bit of a red herring to me, as well as a red rag. But then, I watched it and later bought a DVD and watched again, and then I must say - this is a tremendously well-done film! Robert Downey JR has done a great job and his Sherlock is young, vivid, often ferocious, funny and really witty. he embodies that spirit of adventure that he loves so much. And then, there is that old, dirty, smelly, muddy London with gas lamps and filthy streets... The spirit of the time, despite some minor goofs, is depicted here very well. I loved the film due to its bright tone, fast tempo and mild humor. That is a real treat and a must-see!",10,0,2,31 May 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A Triumph Of South Korean (Anti-) War Cinema
","I read much about this 2004 Korean War period piece movie, and alas, never got a time to watch it. Until I finally have lent my attention to this long, 2 hours and a half, sometimes brooding, sometimes violent film. And yes, I have enjoyed the film a lot. No, not the sheer amount of violence that it depicts, the clear and very sharp anti-war message that it delivers very powerfully and skillfully. I knew the Korean war was a merciless and bloody affair, but was not prepared to the utter array of scenes and blood-chilling battles the film showed us. What is more and the most important here is the straight-ahead and transparent message of 'war is all hell'. The story of two brothers taking part in this bloody war makes the whole thing more personal and even intimate, thus telling us how people could change in the midst of carnage and massacre. Jang Dong-gun as Lee Jin-tae and Won Bin as Lee Jin-seok, Jin-tae's younger brother are great protagonists and their personal tragedies make this awesome film eve more subtle and wanton at the same time. Civil war is awful and crazy. This film shows that plain and simple. I do recommend this epic highly",Null,0,0,28 September 2016
The Good Shepherd," The Good Shepherd  Quite Good. Quite Slow, Though
","Why, oh why are the new films so long? The typical film nowadays is not less than 2 hours or so. Often, in such films, like Syriana or the like, the mere duration spoils the whole picture. You wait patiently when the film finally ends up, or, if you are at home, check with your DVD remote how many minutes are left. The same goes on with The Good Shepherd. A very good director's work of great Robert De Niro is marred much by the 2-hours drag. Mind it, the film is very good, this is a very serious work with so many good stars involved  Matt Damon as a main hero, Angelina Jolie as his unhappy wife, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, among others. Another great plus here is the plot  the formation of the CIA, and its genesis, its activities, its struggle against the Nazi, the Communists and the like. I am Russian, I remember clearly the Cold War years, the very fervor of Russian and US agents fighting against each other. I must admit, the Russians are shown very well, quite correctly and pretty accurate here. The family drama of the main hero is shown superbly. His constant absence from home leads to adultery, to broken home, to tears and the tragic life of his wife and his beloved son. I never liked Jolie much, as well as Damon, but here they are very convincing and their tragedy is depicted very well. When it comes to the family tragedy of their son, it all becomes really horrible. The terrible choice  whether to pursue a successful career or to spare the family  plagues the hero of Damon and he chooses badly. His family is nearly non-existent and he suffers greatly. Among the certain minuses of this film I should again emphasize its length, its certain lack of tempo and then, there is too little of Mr. De Niro! He is appearing twice only and that is a sad fact. Alec Baldwin is another secondary character here and that is also sad, we wish he were here more. However, the film is very good at showing the American society of 1930-1960's. Kennedy, Castro, The Bay of Pigs, Soviet spies, Cold War, Nazi, Berlin  all is here and all is shown through the eyes of US citizens. Another great achievement is the grim portrait of that stupid, terribly self-righteous secret society of 'Skulls'. That is true; America is so equal in many senses, that some people badly need some 'secret circles' to become more 'sophisticated' or 'chosen'. Here, De Niro is absolutely great showing such a shallow mob of puffed peacocks who are trying to be somebody very special. And again, the main idea is consistent  when the duty is too big, families die. Great work, suffering of those mistakes described above. But then, there is not a perfect film, yet.",8,1,1,2 September 2007
Prometheus," Muddled And Very Incosistent
","Ridley Scott is a hugely talented filmmaker. Yes, he is. Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Mike Fassbender are all good actors. Yes, they are. 3D effects and awesome, and all the creatures are extremely realistic. True. Now, there is such a thing as a plot hole. Here, many plot holes. Very many plot holes. I watched this muddled 2-hour bog of pseudo-sci-fi, quasi-religion, as-if-moral film and could not but ask many questions/ Why? Why was that liquid drunken at the very beginning? Who are those white tentacles? Why killing all the humans? Who is that big white Space Jockey and why does he behave he does? Why was that planet abandoned? Why those containers? Many questions and all are unanswered. Sadly, but so. I simply watched just to see the end, which was very confusing and rushed-up. And the sequel? No, thank you, ma'am. That will be truly flabbergasting, to say the least. Noomi is OK, but still she is just a second rank actress, and while she was OK in that Swedish trilogy, here she seems to be a bit clumsy and sluggish. Charlize? Cool, too cool. Cold, I say. It is a film to watch once and easily forget.",3,3,6,25 April 2014

There were so many high praises of this film, that I decided to watch it closely, and... and I was deeply disappointed, as this movie surely has not stood the test of time and today is intercepted as a mere bleak, hollow, dark, vapid and rather weak exercise in D - depression, despair, disenchantment, drool and drainage. I agree, was was not all exciting and interesting, but this movie does not deliver any strong message, nor does it succeed to damn war as evil, or nor does it teach us any lesson at all. It is seen as a brisk, but shallow attempt of early film film-making, dire and failed. Kubrick did not persuade us that war is evil, the general ennui and detached air did not help us feel any bonds to main heroes, and even great final scene failed to cement the film reputation. Overrated, boring and zany at places.",2,6,21,10 July 2014
Taken 2," Nice Movie
","I must admit I did not yet see the first part of Taken, so my perception is not marred by any comparison. I like Liam Neeson, I really like Famke Jansen, I do like Luc Besson's films, and the soundtrack was very cute, especially The Chromatics' theme melody. So, my impression overall is very positive, I did enjoy the fast, furious, straight pace of the movie, the simple plot, the quick exchange of events, and the clear ideas of the script. This is a simple, clear and decent movie, without all the false pretense and puffed-up dialogs. Thas is what made it fun to watch - very straight and rather logical. Some might say the film is predictable and not original, lacking the fresh ideas, but some on, men, when did you last see any real fresh ideas movie? Good job of all the main actors, good camera work, good sound, good picture- the movie is really good and smart. Exactly what a good thriller should look like",7,1,2,6 April 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," Plain Awful Mess Of A Movie
","Well, why is this movie so terrible? Can we enumerate 50 reasons? No, it should look like this - 50 Shades Of Shame - 1. Boring, overlong, slow-pacing movie 2. No real chemistry between main 2 heroes 3. Rather boring soundtrack, with Beast Of Burden being the only redeeming feature 4. Absolutely underdeveloped characters that look more like school book sketches than real people 5. Absolutely unnecessary prolonged nudity scenes that are neither arousing nor passionate, but plainly uneasy and awkward 6. Very vapid emotional background - we cannot feel for the heroes, and both Grey and Anastasia are just cold, withdrawn, detached figurines 7. No real sexual appeal - yeah, Dakota is pretty, but her nudity leaves a very clumsy, almost ashamed air 8. Tedious talks - all those Contract issues seem so laughable and vapid that leave you deeply shocked 9. Over-pretentious seriousness. Only 2 times when Anastasia chuckled or giggled was that funny, the rest was a yawn 10. Well, even 10 points are too much for this banal, dry, silly piece of horror Not recommended to watch. Score - 0 out of 10 - The Worst Movie of 2015. Period",1,1,4,15 March 2015
Blade Runner," Pathetic Mesh
","Awful - this is the only correct word that comes into mind while trying to express an impression after watching this horrible, endless, long, slow, trite, banal, bland, vapid, tasteless, languid, sorrowful and pitiful movie. Risdley Scott made this maybe as a film noir, instead he made a deep insult to all of us. Mindless bog, slow dark laughable waste of time and money, terribly poorly sync'd, with all plot holes, silly dialogs and unbearably poor acting of Hannah, Hauer, Harrison and all the rest. Ut seems they were all dead bored with this curio, and endless steamy dark scenes only build up a bigger misery that this film evokes. There are no redeeming features in this bog, no light in this drabness, no sense in this ugly mire. I was repeatedly told how cool Blade Runner was, now I say that the blade is blunt, and the only running must be away from this horrible dross. Must not be seen by anyone and ever.",1,55,108,14 May 2014
Mr. Holland's Opus," Fine, touching but predictable
","I liked the movie. I liked Richard Dreyfuss as a main hero, Mr. Holland, a Music Appreciation Class teacher. The movie is very true to the point when it speaks about teacher / class relations. I am a University teacher myself, and I surely do know what it is like to get a tight connection to the students' hearts, without losing either your integrity or your authority. I felt what Holland felt, I understood what he did wrong and what he did best. All his ups and downs, all his misgivings, wrong ideas for the class, bad relations with his hearing-impaired son, tough relations with the local educational authorities - everything is shown admirably well. Also, and it should be pointed out, the movie is especially good at the scope. The 30 years of the US history are shown briefly but very vividly and really well. What is really weak is the sheer predictability. Many Hollywood films are made this way - Good/Bad, Up/Down, White/Black. I mean, I could easily foretell when in the next scene Holland will have a problem or its graceful solution. Also, the grand finale is too sweet. I understand, Hollywood dictates the rules, so the serious film must have a refreshing, sweet final. But it was all too much. Too sweetish, too bombastic. Notwithstanding all that, in general, the movie is one of the few that really shows what teaching job is.",7,3,5,10 January 2007
Ben-Hur," It Didn't Stand The Test Of Time
","Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama.Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all",5,4,12,11 August 2013
Pitch Perfect 3," Of All Three, The Worst
","Clearly so - Pitch Perfect 3 is the worst of all three parts of the series. Why? Lazy writing, no new ideas at all, lazy script, endless repeating of the same tired cliches and beaten paths. Anna Kendrick is extremely sweet and nice, Rebel Wilson is funny and loud, John Lithgow is a funny little trifle, too. Apart from that, all the virtually same scenes are rotated nonstop for ever. Vocals, competition, evil rivals, love lost and found, and surely, the final singing scene is a sickly sweet honey toffee sugary treacle idiocy, but for good music, it'd been a total mess.
It is. Even good music saves it not",1,14,22,13 March 2018
Speed," The One That Didn't Stand The Test Of Time
","This is a movie which gathered all the imaginable praise over the years. It seems nothing could be wrong in this flick - great actors - Hopper, Bullock, Reeves, Daniels, great script, great stunts, great suspense, great practical effects. Everything seemes just top notch, perfect and precise here. First viewing also seems to cement this belief - excellent thriller with lots of daredevil tricks and huge moments.
Than, the time passes, another viewing comes. And... the movie seems to be a stock of trite jokes, not more than okay plot, unrealistic stunts, more than often silly twists and above all, laughable continuity. Nowadays, this bus chase bomb threat film is seen as a nice, but hugely outdated effort, belonging obviously to the past.",4,1,10,21 October 2018
Live Free or Die Hard," Too cold
","Bruce is great, he does not age, he runs, shoots and kills, and he swears, he cracks his usual jokes and he looks well. But what has happened? The first two Die Hards are still the best, the first one is very fresh and upbeat even today, the second is my personal favorite... but the last one, 4.0, is a bit too cold. This is what happens when all these computers come in. They are faceless, cold, impersonal and really soulless. The film fell a victim of that. Even the Dad / Daughter line does not convince me too much and the whole movie stands alone like a nice showcase of good studio effects. All those viruses, blown up helicopters, cars and shoot outs are great, but they seem a bit senseless and only serve as a good trap, not making you think or wanting to watch it again. Hope, the 5.0 will not take place in space...",7,1,4,10 August 2007
Midway," Tremendous Triumph
","Ronald Emmerich is such an uneven filmmaker - he can make a masterpiece like The Day After Tomorrow, and at the same time he can fail abysmally in such flops like 2012. Here, in Midway, he is at his very best - powerful script, awesome casting, magnificent battle scenes, excellent dialog, tremendous message. The plot shines all through the movie with its sparkling beauty. The horror of war is depicted especially well, and all those huge aerial fights are so quick, so cruel, so mighty that they leave you breathless.
The correct pacing, correct depiction of both Japanese and Americans, correct delivery are knitted seamlessly here.
Very beginning, with the Pearl Harbor battle, one can feel deeply satisfied to relive the all too familiar scene from Michael Bay movie, albeit better shown and better handled.
And after all, great performance from all actors add a great gusto of adrenaline intake.
Excellent war movie it is, with spellbinding message and deeply satisfying results",10,1,3,27 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Cheap Parody
","Well, where do I begin? Star Wars were great, then they started to die with each new episode. Then came this one abomination of desolation of our eyes and brains. What is wrong here - to omit all the mentioned already faults - absolutely wrong and unnecessary amount of silly jokes and vapid humor which leave much to be desired and ruins the solemnity of the film. Are we glad to see old Han Solo and Lea? Nay, they are as old as hills and simply drag by. Chewbacca? Same old geezer. Luke? One second. Not much to persuade us to like this sad, slow, long and unnecessary installment. Then the bad guy comes. Og my, who told him to utter his lines in this unimaginably awful flat bleak whining voice? Is he scary? Never a chance. He is merely a buffoon hidden in a mighty shadow of Lord Darth. And this new bad guy on a throne? Come on, give me a break. All said, we must admit that he sound is crisp, the camera work is serene, the editing is awesome. Well, this is all. Then you watch this and hate this.",8,30,92,22 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Very Strong Sequel
","As I said before, I am not a Star Wars fan but all of these films are very exciting and very entertaining. This one, Force Awakens, is a pretty strong and astonishing eye candy with plot to match and excellent actors' chemistry to binge watching and enjoy.
I need not retell the plot but what I can say, this is a fine element of a bigger mosaic and as a definitive piece it holds well, showing that not only excellent CGI or great vision can create a stunning effect, but also a thoughtful idea, careful approach to depicting baddies, strong twists and very subtle grain of humor add a real lot of greatness and grandeur.
Good movie with Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford as well as Adam Driver shining great and not allowing te plot to slide into banality or sentimentality.
I await a new episode and hope they will prove more.",8,2,4,13 December 2017
Final Destination," Just excellent
","This is not just a teen film with a thin story line, then some silly jokes and then some sex...no, this film is way better. The very beginning makes the film a blood chilling masterpiece - when a main hero sees a vision of the plane crash and is in panic, he and several other people are gotten off the plane and then the plane explodes right when taking off, and then the true horror begins. Death is seeking all those who survive, it hunts its preys and kills them with no mercy. The absolute masterpiece of the film is the scene of the teacher's death - when she is going to drink hot tea and then adds some icy vodka instead and thus the cup is cracked, she then puts the cup on her computer, vodka oozes in, the PC explodes, the glass wounds her face, she falls down and then more and more terrible details add to her terrible death. The only weak point is the idea that death chooses the order who and when to kill. We all will die, but in no specific order, I believe, and there is no design here...",10,1,3,4 September 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Road Goes Ever On
","Well, in the LOTR book, the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears, and the death of Saruman was not like a deleted scene in the DVD version, and then there was not the feat of Legolas of killing an elephant so easily, and then Sam never held Frodo hanging on a cliff There are many points of bitter criticism of the film, and many are true. But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien, but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on.",10,2,4,7 September 2007
Munich," Too Long, Too Moralistic, Too Violent
","Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker, he knows how to strike all the right notes and how to make deep, decent, sentimental albeit deeply moving powerful roller-coaster of an epic movie. Here, he aimed well, but missed several times. The very topic of Munich terrorist attacks is a huge theme which can be made into a riveting steamroller of action and suspense. But then, almost 3 hours, slow move, too much moralistic stuff, totally unnecessary sex scenes, brutal violence and too much blood make this seemingly good film a wreck. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig are both good, but not so very well to persuade us. The whole film slides along very slowly and it adds to the creepy dark air. The movie started very well, but then it all gets very dull and slower, then simply unbearably slow and yet violent. Not the best in SS's canon, not the best surely",5,0,5,10 July 2014
Pitch Perfect," Music Is Very Good Here, Anna Is OK< The Rest Is Definitely Not
","I understand why musicals are so popular - nice actors, cool songs, great choreography, excellent soundtrack, merry atmosphere. Yeah, right. This movie, Pitch Perfect, tries hard to be the one, too. It succeeds in several fields, it fails in several other. Yeah, music is very good. Especially, all those a Capella arrangements of such hits as Don't You (Forget About Me) or some more are very good, and really first-class. Yeah, Anna Kendrick is sweet, she performs very realistic, and her vocal delivery is way too great. Her dances are nice, too. But then, the rest goes. Almost all other actors are so all over the place, thrown on a kitchen sink and exaggerated that one can only eye them in utter disbelief. They overdo, overplay, overact almost everything, so the comedy quickly falls onto a farce and a mockery. The film is long, as well, it would've been better if it were shorter. By so far, what we have is a mediocre movie with some unfunny gags, sick scenes and trite jokes. Can be watched once and then quickly dismissed",5,1,3,18 May 2015
Godzilla," Total Mess
","I loved the previous Godzilla with Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno - at least, that Godzilla had some warm humor, some real suspense and some real action. This one is a total mess, a naught-for-good waste of time, a real haphazard array of pseudo-scientific things, laughable action sequences and on top of that, swimming in it - a total lack of humor, or irony. Or both. Boring, slow, underdeveloped, languid mess with some utterly unnecessary final battle, several silly-looking flying lizards, very typical destruction scenes and a question - why? what was the reason for making this unimaginably poor remake, or retake with no clear plot, with no sense and no redeeming feature. Do not watch it, no humor and all seriousness make this horror of a movie a worse mish mash",1,8,19,28 July 2014
Life," Awful To The Point Of Cringe
","What would happen if you took the plot from Alien , added some incredibly silly characters, added a very unhealthy dose of boring tedious dialog, added a totally unbelievable portion of dumb decisions, added highly predictable twists and turns, added some bored to deaths actors like Reynolds or Gyllenhal, added a Russian with a thick accent, and then shook and stirred to the level of utter laughs? Bingo, you've gotten Life, the very strong contender for the dubious monicker of probably the worst Sci-Fi flick of the year. 
Honest, I do mean so - I coud not make myself watch this awful minced mea of silliness and utter boredom. And then, again, do we really need another Alien so bad?",1,4,8,29 December 2017
300," Awful In Every Sense
","If you look for a really horrific movie that contains all the possible features of a miserable flop, then 300 is your sure choice. It has every possible goof, mistake, anachronism, idiocy, stupidity, silliness or plain foolishness. If you are a history buff, avid this film at all costs. It has nothing to do with either Spartan history, or Persian military system. This movie is badly colored, dark, extremely humorless, awfully deadpan, pathetic, too far serious, too bombastic. And the dialogs! Oh, them. Imagine several too laughingly over-muscular macho men uttering high-blown words out of proportion, all of them far too pompous and huge, and you get it. All is bad here, and poor Persian king is a mere unimaginable caricature of some hilarious outlook and modern piercing galore. Oh my, history suffers here a lot too much. Even for laughs this movie will not do - Gerard Butler along with Heady, Wenham, and other actors looks funny and never convincing enough to induce any feeling of sympathy or interest. Trash this utter junk.",1,2,5,9 August 2015
Cube," The Movie Which Didn't Stand The Test Of Time
","When I first watched this bizarre low-budget Canadian film, I was impressed. Years after, I have tried it again - and immediately all the weaker points went visible - very weak acting, poor script, long (too long) dialog parts at times, boring sequences, and yeah, the film didn't hold - it fell apart, before it got exciting. The trite plot betrayed shallow characters, limp psyche and lame ideas. What was more shocking, there was no compassion or interest in any of the heroes, be that Kazan or Leaven. They all seem bland, gray and one- dimensional, and in case with Quentin, a promising beginning gave way to a very disastrous under-developed hell of a terrible person. The Cube seemed to be in the same league like Lawnmower Man - once, it was awesome, very soon later - awful. There are low-budget movies which can deliver fun or thrill. Cube delivered only boredom and very basic blunt smirk.",2,6,11,26 September 2017
The Thin Red Line," National Geographic Views + Battle Scenes = Horrid Mess
","Everything is awfully wrong in this endless, 180 minute flick that seems like a dying serpent, slowly sleuthing along some moss, and then suddenly twitching in agony, and then getting to slow die again. Casting? Oops, how can that possibly happen when there is a really Huge bunch of first class, awesome actors, like Nolte, Clooney, Caviezel, Penn, Leto, Harrelson, Otto, Brody and Travolta among others, and then all of them deliver an awful mess of a film. The problem is vivid and loud - they play too curt, too brief, too short, there is No development, No depth, No hook. No main hero. Instead, we are suffering to watch ugly faces close-up and then watch a twitchy battle scene with all usual gore, blood, noise and brouhaha. This movie lacks the tragic fragility of The Longest Day, lacks the brutal honesty of Private Ryan, lacks the deep development of Battle Of Britain, lacks the excellent delivery of Bridge Too Far, lacks the exquisite accuracy of Schindler's List, lacks the poetic cruelty of The Pianist, it lacks every possible detail. It lacks all it can have. Instead, it gives us tons of unnecessary dialogues, then, and it becomes very annoying, the astonishingly beautiful nature scenes, and then drops it all into a shaky mess of indistinct horror. No, this is not a good anti-war movie, this is a wasted effort of utmost low",1,4,6,11 May 2017
The Great Escape," Dated Piece Of Unwelcomed Comedy
","Wait. comedy? This is a war movie. Yes, it is supposed to be. It is not. What was planned as a serious, deep, psychological wartime escape drama, in reality turned into a raw, unbaked, half-cooked slapstick with awful character development, with awful performances, especially those from McQueen and Bronson, need one mention terribly laughable and horribly unserious delivery. The whole thing seems like a lame amateurish school play with absolutely irregular moves and wrong lines. I never, but never believed a single thing they said or did. The whole film just smacks of a cheap second-rate low-budget effort of a mediocre dubious merit. There is no merit, as even actors betray a playful unseriousness of what they say or do. Does the movie ever seem to be tragic or decent? Nay, even the killing spree seems to be staged or simply poor. Poor - this is the word. Every little detail in this film is poor or false.",1,7,24,11 May 2017
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 200% Horrible
","This one was considered the best, my pals told me many times how great it was. I watched it very carefully. I almost cringed and simply made myself watch it till the end. This is Awful. I hated every single second of this third-rate-horror-of-a-tasteless movie ever. Ever. Nobody is funny in this movie - Innes, Gilliam, Idles, Cleese - they all are horrible. This is a very fine example of really poor script, terrible play, vain efforts of being funny, but just being utterly silly. Stupid. Senseless. Clueless. Less of all. Just less. I hated it with all my guts. Right were those who said this movie did not stand the test of time. Well, it never stood at all. It dragged and crawled most miserably. My advice is this - never waste 90 minutes of your time on this delirium, this stew of unfunny skits and blunt jokes. There was nothing sacred for this bang of unfunny comedians. It is clear here. it is bad and worse every minute. Simply bad",1,21,56,24 November 2013
Moon," Unbearable Drag
","I love Sam Rockwell's talent and his impeccable ability to make a great, outstanding performance in almost every movie he is in. So, I was even more thrilled when learned that Duncan Jones, the son of great late David Bowie, is a film director. Oh, and here is the voice talents of Kevin Spacey in use, too. Wow, I said, that's gonna be a marvelous movie.
Instead, what I was treated to, was a flabbergasting drag of laughable scope, with a plot twist so trite and predictable that I nearly ate my giggle. Smirk. Come on, guys, are you serious? Are you really trying to sell me this outdated, banal stuff, seen so many times?
Duane Byrge wrote: 'Nonetheless, 'Moon' is darkened by its own excellencies: The white, claustrophobic look is apt and moody, but a lack of physical action enervates the story thrust.' The critic felt mixed about the star's performance, describing him as 'adept at limning his character's dissolution' but finding that he did not have 'the audacious, dominant edge' for the major confrontation at the end of the film.
Just how very true, indeed!",1,4,12,24 February 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Hated Every Second Of This Abomination
","How to make a really awful, mind-numbing, horrid, puking, cringeworthy, hateful, silly, stupid, sick, marred, sub-par, flawed, blemishful movie? Make one with no plot, with several absolutely out of place looking models, with endless rushing and racing, with endless violence and with endless explosions. Add blood, add silly costumes, add ugly freaks galore, add oil spills, add sand and add unwanted and unsuitable sexy innuendos. This is what you get - awful Mad Max, which leaves a profound shock of wasted time and a feeling of being had by. Even beautiful models like Kershaw or Whiley or Kravitz, even fine actresses like Theron could not save this monstrosity from being a whole, complete, total, wholesome flop on all sides. This is an example of a horrible, totally ugly and unpardonably silly failure which made some cash and was praised. I do not dig this sick liking of sick films. I do not recommend this awful idiocy to anybody",1,9,17,2 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Good Movie, Although A Bit Uneven
","Mel Gibson is a very good film director, and a very fine actor, although not without failures or errors on his way. His resume is fairly spectacular, and here he touches upon a very delicate and a very serious subject - the conflict between religious beliefs and military duties. Desmond Doss was a very famous Seventh Day Adventist who took part in Battle Of Okinawa and due to his belief never took up a rifle and never killed anyone, but he saved as many as 100 lives of wounded soldiers and officers. The film is about this modest and brave man, who spared no effort to save his comrades. Was the film a success? Well, with all the coming Oscar nods, and with Mel Gibson and a stellar cast behind, this is very tough to be very critical. Let's say this - the movie is good, but not awesome, good but not perfect. This is not Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day, for sure. Why? Well, there are some almost cringe-worthy pathetic scenes, that awake all the worst clichés of Hollywood, the battle scenes are impressive but hardly anything but already many times repeated gruesome bloody things. The slower part of the movie is often boring and too slow, and the main actor, well he is OK, but sorry, not higher than just average. This is a good film that must be seen at least once.",7,3,6,26 February 2017
The Runaways," Rock'n'roll Biopic Not In The Best Of Shapes
","Oh yeah, it is a way too difficult to film biopics about real rock bands. If the members are still alive, they can meddle in the process, send a scathing review after the film is made, or ask to be withdrawn from the script altogether if they fear their part in a given movie would be not so good. Or even the time limits of a film, even if the band in question, The Runaways, exited for not so many years, still, many many key events have to be omitted or so heavily shortened that any fan will end up scratching their head and asking whether it was what they wanted to see. Mind you, this version is not bad at all, as a musician myself, I must admit that the rehearsal process and backstage routine are depicted admirably well, and the whole grudge of a song learning, sound check, and pre-gig booze is here at an excellent realistic swap. Still, the short timing of the movie leaves much off the camera, and the whole thing seems a bit too rushed and sometimes ruined. The main actors do their part well, Kristin Stewart as Joan Jett is surprisingly decent, dark, menacing, self-destructive and deep. Dakota Fanning as Cherry Curie is another winner, with her blonde angelic looks and wild persona. The rest is a bit dubious. Kim Fowley? Was he that weird and queer? Lita Ford? She is present, but her fiery guitar and her fiery persona are shown so briefly and little, that one can only feel shame. The bassist? Her name? Poor dear, she never even uttered a word. Sandy, the drummer? She is cool at the offset, but then she is somehow lost in a mire. The rushes ending and vague scenes with bathtub and sea leave us a bit perplexed, and the whole wrap-up is a bit too confusing. Anyway, this is not a bad effort, and yeah, can be watched at least once, even for their sake of beautiful ladies and their long legs. Kidding. The movie is good.",7,1,2,3 April 2016

Donnie Darko," Now, Pay Attention - This Is THE Worst Movie Of All Times
","I mean it. 2 hours of endless, tedious, plodding, boring, killing, brain-sucking, blood-stopping, feeling murdering hell of a pretentious nothing. I have a simple question - please, answer it with all your utmost honesty - have you understood what this movie is about? Anybody? Class? Nobody. Just as I was thinking. Let's be serious. This is a total and absolutely unpardonable waste of time, space and celluloid. Extremely cheap, blatantly silly and sadistically slow torture of your mind, your good feelings and good vibes. No one is this agonizingly bad take, and I mean nobody, does any decent work. The movie seems to be a very long and expensive effort of some art school students to troll us all and kill us outright with this sheer and immense stupidity. No acting, no plot, no suspense, no twist, no shock and no fun. Vapid and tasteless abyss of idiocy. Songs are OK, that's all Rating - Zero and even minus 1000 out of 10, and I do mean it. It's a real poor taste and bad joke altogether",1,2,7,10 December 2016
Cinderella Man," Inevitably Predictable And Boring
","Why, can you tell me, the Hollywood production may be so boring? If there is a movie about any sportsman, then the film starts usually with him being OK, then, all of a sudden (irony included) he gets into a deep, bottomless pit of a despair or problem, then slowly he starts his way up and on. Cinderella Man is exactly this kind of a movie. Apart from brutally detailed boxing scenes, this is a sweaty, sugary sweetish family drama of a hero rising back from bad to good. The plot is so predictable that we could comment what was going to happen 10 minutes prior to the very event. The performance of Russell Crowe is never more terrible than here, as well as Renee Zellwegger is so pathetic with all her sad and happy faces she tries to put on from time to time. Bad, insipid, pathetic, miserable ruin of a film",2,2,5,12 October 2008
Beetlejuice," A Bit Dated But Still Awesome
","Many older movies date not so gracefully, and when you watch them after awhile, crappy video effects, or bad montage and cutting are so obvious that the whole movie turns sour or very silly. Beetlejuice aged gracefully, thanks to a huge injection of healthy humor, spellbinding star cast, excellent calypso songs, awesome plot and very cynical twists in the story. You saw it, you know it. What else can be added to this great film? Winona Ryder is very cool choice here, she is dark, moody and way way out there, but her deep sense of humor helps her get through all the initial sadness. Great work by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin also add much to the whole crazy vertigo of gags, jokes and laughs. Good camera work also helps, and even old-fashioned video effects do not spoil the party and do not steal the infectious joyousness of the story. Highly recommended",10,13,18,21 June 2014

To begin with, it shows one of the most thrilling and interesting moments in world history, that is, Hitler assassination attempt, and then, it depicts the event very well. Tom Cruise here is a great choice, he portrays Von Stauffenberg very convincingly and we believe him all the time. Tom managed to play deep, with passion and excellent precision. Other great winner is the portrait of Hitler himself, here we see a maniac, a cruel tyrant so closely and so causally that the very fact we see Hitler shocks us. Such a small man could do such horrible crimes! Then, there are other great roles, of Beck, Fromm, Goebbels and others. They all are real, breathing, flesh and blood men and women who really created history in 1944. This is a very good movie and I do recommend it to all who like European history. Maybe, the only weak moment is the slightly dragging tempo at times, but it did not break the whole picture.",8,1,2,1 May 2009
The Simpsons Movie," This is good, but not as awesome as expected
","The Simpsons are really lovable, great and well, smart enough, even Homer. I expected more of that large movie, to tell you the truth. I am not at all disappointed, but the movie could have been really better, I am sure. Why? What happened? Maybe, the expectation was much higher than it had to be? Maybe, the original 20 minutes series are really better? Several moments in the Movie are simply brilliant... The poor swallows that got killed against the Dome, the Green Day song, Homer on a bike... I wanted more and expected more laughs. Nay, the film is funny, but at places it was slower and dragged a bit. I wanted more of Monty Burns, Moe and Nelson. I wanted more of Bart's pranks and Lisa's sheer genius. But still, this film is a sheer pleasure to watch.",8,1,4,10 August 2007
All the President's Men," Extremely Powerful Movie
","If we take Nixon of 1995, last years's The Post and 1976's All the President's Men, we will get a powerful trio of totally different but still mightily similar powerful movies which all describe the same time, the same era much to the same great effect. Here, in All the President's Men we see very similar pacing and setting as in The Post, which in fact is a wonderful prequel, but the focus is on two great real living journalists, Dustin Hoffman as 
Carl Bernstein and Robert Redford as Bob Woodward - and this duo possesses an admirably strong and amicably cute chemistry with a smashing effect.
This film is already a classic of serious, slow-pacing, menacingly slow, dark brooding matter and utter grandeur.
Highly recommended",10,2,2,10 March 2018
Evil Dead II," Outdated, Cheap, Not Scary Anymore
","In some 1988, when I watched this movie as a teenage boy, I was scared a hell out of me. I loved Bruce Campbell's funny acting and his heroic actions. Now, in 2014, I watched Evil Dead II again - wow. A bunch of laughs and deep yawns. Cheap, naive, outdated, pathetic movie. Too much blood and too many plasticine ghouls are not scary at all. naive FXs add to general misery and make the whole affair a real comedy stick. Campbell is OK, and he is very funny, even when using his chainsaw. But the whole movie is a just a cheap video as if to some 80's song a la Thriller. Monsters? Funny and unconvincing. Horrors? Nope, none of that. Suspense? Hardly ever. Fear? No, smiles all around. Some films do not stand the test of time, this is a typical example. I know, the 3 rd part was a pure comedy/parody. They even think of a 4th part. Nope, too much of this stuff. The films belongs to its time. It was a real smash sensation then, it ain't anymore now. Just a bit f a shame, in fact.",4,1,4,11 May 2014
V for Vendetta," 50 / 50 - Both Good and Bad
","Well, what a difficult task! This is the film that has to be good, but sadly it is not. Let me subdivide all the good and bad things into two groups. Good things: 1. Natalie Portman - she has always been one of my all-time favorite actresses. And here she plays with a great gusto, with such unrestrained passion that you feel what she feels - pain, joy, stupor. Even bald, she is awesome! 2. Inspector Finch's part - the best role here, in fact. The man is solid, cool and he is so full of inner pain and desire to find the truth that his part becomes nearly the central in the film. 3. The main 'Baddie'- the Chancellor - looks so pathetic, but then is full of threat and evil. A good, full fledged portrait of a modern dictator, who rejects so many things but eats the forbidden food in secret. 4. The Archbishop - terrible libertine, old and full of vice. This is a great image of a lustful person who in fact has to be otherwise.Bad things: 1. V himself. Unbearbale bore! His endless speeches were intended to be the acidic acerbic diatribes, but sound so falsely, so pathetic and so pompous that simply make you laugh. His play? Poor Hugo Weaving - does he play, after all? Nay, he just twists and shakes and fights like Neo in Matrix. C'mon, Hugo, Mr. Anderson is in another film! 2. The anti-fundamentalist sentiments. It is clear that the Wachowski Brothers are deadly afraid of the Right-Wing republican Fundamentalists, and so they picture them as a gang of Nazi-like, gay-hating, bloody liars. Come on, men! This is so obvious and so funny! Look, everybody has the right to express himself or herself freely, but your anger and hatred are so clear and so funnily childish. In general, there is one thing that explains all - on the Bonus DVD disc there is a footage about the comics - well, if the whole film is based on comic strip, what can we await of it? 1.",5,1,4,24 August 2006
