Black Swan," RIP-OFF of Perfect Blue
","This movie is a complete rip-off of a great Asian film called Perfect Blue. I'm posting a video to show you how preposterous the rip-off was. And of course, the anim√© isn't mentioned at all, no tribute, nothing. Even the names of the main characters are almost the same, Nina for this shameless movie and Mima for Perfect Blue. The only difference is that Nina is a ballet dancer and Mima a pop star but all of the great scenes in Perfect Blue are blatantly copied and pasted in Black Swan. I can understand that people who have never seen Perfect Blue can think that Black Swan is a great movie but, here's the truth, it is a shameless rip-off.See the proof for yourself:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbN2sWFOfe4",1,12,18,11 March 2014
