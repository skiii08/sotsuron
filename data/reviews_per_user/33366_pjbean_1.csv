50 First Dates," a great idea
","50 first dates is a good idea that almost works. It has a sweetness about it that almost gets lost in all the typical Adam Sandler silliness. Hard to say what the original script looked like, but it seems like it may have been a romantic comedy before it was filled with toilet humor and over-the-top accents. After PUNCH DRUNK LOVE I thought Adam may have been growing in a new direction. Not so. If you're a fan of his early work, this is more of the same. A really good soundtrack - lots of classic tunes are updated here - and Drew Barrymore make it worth watching, but you're left feeling it could have been so much more. The ending is full of strange and obvious gaping wholes, but I guess if you buy the rest you can ignore that. Liked it the first time when it was called MEMENTO. Average rental, but I'm glad I didn't go to the theatre to see this one.",5,0,1,1 July 2004
