Casablanca," American Rick Blaine finds himself the holder of the letters of transit out of Casablanca and standing before the love of his life once again.
","This movie was truly amazing. I never found myself bored, not even for a second. The underlying dry humor in a lot of the scenes really made the storyline comical to the viewer (if you understood the humor). I have a whole new appreciation for old time movies and Humphrey Bogart. The dialog was perfect, the characters sucked you in so much that at times I forgot it was just a movie. I also may have been the only person who was thoroughly happy with the unusual ending that in my eyes wasn't predictable. That's the most I can say without giving it away. It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't help finding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character. Rick Blaine was a strong character that you couldn't help feeling some sympathy for, but his character displayed selfless and humble qualities that made the movie all the better.",10,5,7,11 October 2012
Citizen Kane," The death of a powerful media proprietor causes a news team to research the meaning of his last uttered word.
","Orson Welles' ability to not only direct but play the leading role in a film is something that's not seen that often today, or recognized. I found it creative that the film started at Kane's death and then went backwards in an effort to show his life journey, while the reporter, Jerry Thompson, searched for the meaning behind Kane's last word, 'Rosebud'. It showed the growth of a man born in poverty who makes it lucky when a gold mine is discovered under his mother's property. Kane grows to be a charismatic man loved and looked up to by many. However his personal life lacks, as what happens to most people who experience such wealth and power. It was a lesson of the things that matter in life. The scene where Kane throws and breaks many objects in his room after his wife leaves him. This scene shows a different side of Kane, and as the viewer I felt a lot of sympathy for him, as though he was looking back on his life wondering if all the wealth was really worth it.",9,1,2,24 October 2012
The Graduate," Benjamin Braddock is a recent university graduate who falls in love with a girl who's mother he's had an affair with in the past.
","I found this movie very comical, but almost too far-fetched that I couldn't enjoy it to the extent that I have enjoyed other films. The cinematography was great and the cameraman's ability to show the point of view of the character in certain parts made the film interesting. I found the scene where Ben took Elaine on the date to be absolutely ridiculous, for the mere fact they fell in love when neither of them acted desirable on the date. Throughout the film, Mrs. Robinson continually expresses how much she doesn't want Ben to date Elaine but never explains why. However it can be inferred it's because she has feelings for him herself, it is never clarified. When Ben follows Elaine to Berkeley, she accuses him of raping her mother, and by simply telling her this isn't true, Elaine believes it and agrees to marry him. This may have been the most far-fetched scene of all. No right woman would believe a rape cry to be untrue by simply being told it isn't. Perhaps the wild ideas of the film are what make it so enjoyable to some people. It was entertaining and kept my attention, but I probably wouldn't see it again.",6,1,2,29 November 2012
Singin' in the Rain," A musical comedy about a production company who makes the transition from silent films to sound.
","This was one of the best films I had seen in a while. The combination of bright color, diversity of characters, and the array of talented singers and dancers made it a fun and comical production. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) was my favorite of the characters. Hit witty comments and hilarious performance of 'Make Them Laugh' made him standout although he technically wasn't a main character. The budding romance of Don and Kathy can be seen from the very beginning as a sort of Screwball Comedy way of making them poke fun of each other at first but slowly put aside their differences and fall in love. I loved how, especially in the beginning, they sort of make fun of the materialistic norms of Hollywood. The public's obsession with 'power couples' and the idea of Lockwood and Lamont as a household name. But as the movie goes on Don starts to lose interest in following the Hollywood norms and becomes more interested in giving the love of his life, Kathy Seldon, some credit for her amazing talents as an actress and singer.",10,0,3,2 November 2012
Psycho," A young female secretary from Pheonix finds herself in the hands of a suspicious mother and son who own the motel she is staying at.
","The cinematography for this film stood out to be as near perfection. The shower scene for which Marion is stabbed to death is deemed to be as skill-full as cinematography could get in this time period. The storyline was interesting and served as a bit of a mystery to the viewer. The acting was believable and they could not have possibly cast better actors for each role. The grim and sort of scary storyline stood out to among the films i've viewed from this time period. I liked how it was kept a secret until the end that Norman's mother was dead, although I kind of started to suspect this in the middle. It was unusual for the 'main character' (Marion) to be killed off so early on, and this came as a bit of a shock to me. And surprises in films are what make them successful as opposed to predictable plots.This film is legendary in the history or horror films and set the bar for scary movies to come.",9,0,0,4 November 2012
