The Blair Witch Project," Very unique (for it's time), but very poor
","If you're still stuck in any time before 2005, and haven't seen any found footage type films, or if you're one of those people that think all Indie films are instantly masterpieces purely because it's Indie no matter how terrible it is, or if seeing three tired teenagers arguing through a shaky camera lens entertains you, you might find this film interesting. Otherwise, this film is absolutely terrible. Definitely not a film you should waste your time on if you want a scare. It consists of 10% people telling a story followed by 80% of arguing teenagers, 9% crying and the final 1% is a slightly tense moment, but probably only made intense because you think something more exciting than exhausted, depressed teenagers arguing and crying might happen. I can see how this gained it's popularity on release due to it being an original take on horror films in relation to the films in it's era. Maybe selling it as real, actual footage probably helped it's reception too. But in modern times, when it is no longer unique, it is just a very boring film about three college students arguing",1,2,5,23 April 2015
