The Blair Witch Project," What a waste of time
","Excellent marketing of a pathetically boring attempt at horror.. The unsteady camera work was meant to lend authenticity but only provided another piece of the annoying puzzle. The endless whining and 'Oh my God''s throughout this piece not only demonstrated the actors were inept at improvisation but also clearly revealed a lack of proper education in the English/American language... excuse me.. but did no one on the shoot have access to a thesaurus? In the end , it was laughable, not frightening, not edgy, simply amateurish, yet one assumes the makers of this atrocity were laughing all the way to the bank.. This also made it acceptable for other would be film makers to substitute shaky, out of focus footage to build terror or suspense instead of genuine film craft and intelligent dialogue. End of rant.

Finding Neverland," A beautiful film
","For years, 'Peter Pan' has been iconic, the lost boys, the never aging Pan,untouchable, whimsical and tinged by sadness without knowing how he came to be, but finally we were allowed to glimpse the soul of his creator,J.M. Barrie, masterfully played by Johnny Depp. The ever so soft Scottish accent was perfectly rendered , not blustery or over the top with all of the rough rolling of the rrrrrrrrrrrrr's and glottal stops that many performers affect while using imitating the language, but Mr. Depp delivers a believable Scottish 'burr' that gives the appearance of having been softened from years in the world of the English upper crust. Mr.Depp's performance was warm, inviting and thoroughly convincing as a man of kindness and compassion but also possessing the child-like wonder of the world around him. His co star, Freddie Highmore, provides the inspiration for Peter Pan to Depp's Barrie, however, one comes away from the film feeling as if a true and lasting friendship has been made off screen for the two. I highly recommend this movie, it is one of the infrequent treasures of cinema that one can take every member of the family to see and yet have each member come away happy and thoroughly enchanted by the film. End of gushing. thanks",10,2,2,7 January 2006
