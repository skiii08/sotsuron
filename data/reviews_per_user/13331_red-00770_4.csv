Hereditary," SLOW, NO SCARES AND WHAT AN HILARIOUS ENDING!!!
","So slow of a movie, what was it all some crazy cult by her mother and loony friends??? No scares at All.... It all built up to tha last 20 mins which was sort of ok til she floated up the treehouse Hahaa me and my Uncle burst out laughing at tha part as did few others in tha cinema. And tha naked people jus standing in tha woods again funny.... Totally overrated movie much like the Babadook and the Witch ot the VVitch however its spelt.",3,1,4,26 June 2018
The Babadook," About as scarey as an episode of Goosebumps!!!
","Cant believe anyone rates this crap.
Watched this movie few years ago and was really disappointed as its sooo overrated it's laughable. 
Low budget and crap special effects as in tha Babadook itself Hahaaa.
It makes Halloween 3 look like a masterpiece.",1,2,6,3 April 2018
The Irishman," Meh
","Few years took for this film to arrive, Don't Believe tha Hype, this ain't no classic. Slow burn, with the last part sending me to sleep. Actors old made to look young and young-ish actor made to look old, De Niros dodgy contact lenses, also the way he beats up the greengrocer that was comical, looked like a 90 year old man dishing out a lame beating, notice his foot stamp with the opposite foot an nothing being under it hahahaa, Stephen Graham's accent dodgy. Years for this pffftttt.",6,346,619,28 November 2019
1917," DON'T WATCH THIS WATCH SAVING PRIVATE RYAN INSTEAD!!!
","Okay first of all it's better than 1 star but as of the stupid, pathetic HIGH rating had no choice but to try even it out with the worst rating possible. This film is slow, full of plot holes, characters that no one could like, not enough action, sort of like a made for tv Sunday night film. High Drama crap. As for the plot itself well Spielberg did it a million times better. This is artsy-fartsy type crap, that the snobs an the critics lap up.",1,4,16,9 February 2020
