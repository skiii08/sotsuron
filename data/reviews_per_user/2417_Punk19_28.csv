The Mask," Hilarious
","Stanley Ipkiss(Jim Carrey) has it the hard way. Living in a motel, a job with a boss that doesn't care, a car that won't run. Things change when Stanley finds a magical mask that changes him into that funny green faced guy. Soon though that green masked guy is running from the cops and from the finger tips of evil. So what happens when a masked funny guy comes in contact with a blonde haired lady and Paggy Brandt? Acts as funny as he can be. Even in the face of danger.Starring Amy Yasbeck(Peggy Brandt) Jim Carry(Stanely Ipkis),Peter Riegert(Lt.

","When you watch this you'll be like all goo goo eyed. Gizmo is so cute. Yet he has problems. If he gets wet he sprouts out these evil babies that will destroy everyone and everything. Not only that but Gizmo can't eat after midnight. If he does then he'll turn all ugly like.Watch your bed and garage when you watch this. You'll never know if a ...........Gizmo will come out.

Also if you like this you'll like Critters, Critter 2 and Little Monsters. But when you watch this you should always remember.......bring the smiles along with the popcorn.",8,0,1,16 July 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Beware
",Although I give this a 8/10 this isn't a good film to watch if you have something against blood. This movie has way to many bloody scenes and it also has some sexual scenes that aren't funny to watch.It starts off in a hospital then it goes on to a house in the suburbs. This woman's boyfriend gets bitten by this infected..........thing and thus dies and becomes one of the living dead. We then see a truck full of stow aways and a few other scenes with died people that are now zombies kill people.Although this is a good movie I wouldn't recommend it. Too much blood and too much sexual content.,8,2,4,5 July 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Um okay
","I gave this a 5/10 because it was comedy mixed in with horror. Nothing is watchable if it has comedy mixed in with the plot. Also as with my other comment on the other Dead movie it has too much blood and gore. I think they need to stop making these Living Dead movies. It's too sickening to watch. Not to mention it's not a stable plot with stable characters that take their jobs seriously. Who wants to see a jokester play jokes and kill dead things anyways? What this really needed was maybe a car chase, a nice plot, maybe a few serious characters and maybe a romantic atmosphere. This entire movie was stupid. What was going through the directors head anyways?",5,2,9,5 July 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Memories unlocked
","Chronicles of Narnia, a movie that will stay with me forever and ever. Why do I say that? Well it gave me back a memory that I had all but forgotten. The memory of seeing the cartoon with my grandmother when I was a little girl.Starting off in the United Kingdom, four children named Peter (William Moseley), Lucy (Georgie Henley) Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) are in the crossfire of a war between Americans and the Nazi troops of Hitler. They are shuffled out of their home in London to a country home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent).Once there they find that life there is very dull and bleak. Until the youngest child, Lucy, finds a wardrobe that takes her to an enchanted forest ruled by an evil witch. Right from the start she makes a friend of Mr. Tumnus,(James McAvoy)the Faun. She goes back and tells the tale, but her siblings don't believe her.That is until the second youngest child, Edmund, follows his sister to the forest. Once there he meets the evil white witch (Tilda Swinton) and her coachman Ginarrbrik (Kiran Shah). The witch gives Edmund something to eat and drink and then allows him to leave.One day later all four children go to the forest, thanks to Edmund and a fly away racket ball that flew into the window and broke an armor suit. Once there they go and find out that Lucy's friend, Mr. Tumnus, was taken by the white witch, for treachery. They then meet up with Mr. Beaver (Ray Winstone) and his wife Mrs. Beaver (Dawn French).Edmund goes to the white witch's castle, only to be disappointed and captured by her. You see, she wants to make the prophecy which tells of two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam coming to Narnia to stop evil and make peace happen again not happen. Edmund meets Mr. Tumnus and then he is whisked away to find his family.The beavers take Peter, Susan, and Lucy to see Alsan (Liam Neeson), the great lion. He will help them in getting back their brother. The white witch kills Aslan, only Aslan doesn't die, he is brought back, because he wasn't a traitor.The climax of the film shows Peter, Edmund, Aslan, Susan and Lucy fighting the White Witch (with a wide assortment of creatures called Hags, Red and Balck dwarfs, Centaurs, Fauns, Satyrs, Cheetahs, foxes and wolves.) and winning back the peace of Narnia. Fifteen years later they are riding threw the woods, looking for a white stag. Lucy finds the way back to the wardrobe and they return to their young selves. The ending shows the Professor telling Lucy that she cannot get back into Narnia. That he already tried that and it didn't work.I found this movie to be a good memory for both young and old audiences. It doesn't only give memories, but it brings back old ones. It is fun for the entire family, old and young. I had to give this film an 8 out of 10. Can't wait for the second one to come out.",8,0,0,24 September 2006
Batman Returns," Somewhat disturbing
","From watching Batman the first one I would of thought the second Batman would be worth watching. Well now I know that it wasn't. This movie stars Michael Keaton and Danny Devito. Danny being the Penguin of course.Having defeated the Joker, Batman now faces the Penguin - a warped and deformed individual who is intent on being accepted into Gotham society. Crooked businessman Max Schreck is coerced into helping him become Mayor of Gotham and they both attempt to expose Batman in a different light. Earlier however, Selina Kyle, Max's secretary, is thrown from the top of a building and is transformed into Catwoman - a mysterious figure who has the same personality disorder as Batman. Batman must attempt to clear his name, all the time deciding just what must be done with the Catwoman.If you watch this you'll notice two things. One, the Penguins nastiness and two Catwomans playful antics. Trust me this sequel just didn't meet the advances the first one had.",5,1,2,8 July 2005
Blade," Excellent movie
","Wesley Snipes stars as the only day walking vampire that hunts the night hunting, bloodsucking, hideous vampires of the night. His main rival is Deacon Frost(Stephen Dorff). The story really gets into the swing as Frost fights with pure blood vampires and a female named Dr. Karen Jenson(N'Bushe Wright). But he seems to have even more problems and troubles when his SON, yes his son, named Blade and his friend named Whistler(Kris Kristofferson)offer their skilled hands into the fight for humanity.A very good movie. There are two sequels that I'd strongly recommend. Along with the Dracula series, Van Helsing and Dracula 200.",Null,0,1,28 August 2005
The Mummy," A classic
","In ancient Egypt, high priest Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo)started a forbidden relationship with Anck Su Namun(Patricia Velasquez), Pharaoh Seti's(Aharon Ipalé) Mistress. When Seti(Aharon Ipalé) finds out about what's going on, Imhotep and his loved one stab him, but can't escape the trustworthy guards: Anck Su Namnun chooses to commit suicide while Imhotep is bestowed with the Hom-Dai, the most feared curse of all: He is mummified alive in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead.More than thirty-six centuries later, in 1923, to be exact, adventurer Rick(Brendan Fraser) leads Egyptologist Evelyn(Rachel Weisz) and her brother Johnathan(John Hannah) to mysterious Hamunaptra. While Johnathan is keen on finding the legendary Egyptian treasures, Evelyn wants to search for the Book of the Living, which would clarify a lot in historical knowledge about the ancient Egyptians. Unfortunately, they and a rivaling group of careless American adventurers free Imhotep's mummy from his eternal prison.Now, with the ancient and quite agile high priest on the loose, the adventurers and scientists face not only a dangerous enemy, but also a massive threat to today's world: Imhotep wants to bring Anck Su Namnun back to life by using Evelyn's body, but he also wants to rid the world of the disbelieving crowd of democracy-supporters to be able to enforce his tyrannic dictatorship.Now as you can see. This movie is totally and utterly awesome. A classic to any shelf.",10,1,2,14 July 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Awesome
","Man when they made this movie they beat the odds. Tornadoes, hurricanes, ice,rain, wind and snow all in one storm? Yikes, they really made one movie to watch with the whole family. But the question here is this, will it happen? Maybe it will. I doubt it though.It starts off with a scientist drilling in Alaska. Then we go to a press conference in England. The plot unfolds as storms start hitting the entire surface of Earth. We watch as it colder and colder until it suddenly goes into a new ice age.I recommend this to anyone. A great movie for the entire family. A movie to watch when storms are about.",10,3,5,6 July 2005

Running for their lives soon after they avoid the cops, The Terminaton(Arnold Schwartzenegger)and the government. The ending is just suburb. A good beginning to the sequel.

Scary Movie 2," Downhill all the way
","Okay so they made this after that crappy first one. The only reason I mainly watched this anyways was because Tim Curry was in it. He even acted horribly. This movie, although sometimes funny, didn't make since. Oh a ghost is haunting a mansion and 6 young college people are drafted in to lets say do an experiment. I'd say this is the stupidest movie sequel in the history of movies. And that's taking it nicely. They never should of made these stupid Scary Movies. Heck they don't even deserve the title. A Funny Movie or A Horrible Movie is more like it. They even took stuff from other movies. Once again this movie and it's sequels don't deserve a place on the shelves.",5,1,4,6 July 2005

The main danger is Nomak(Luke Gross)and his increasing thirst for blood. Soon he multiples and sends out an army of his own kind on the normal night walkers.But here's the catch. Nomak was created in a lab, yes but by whom in the head oldest vampire Damaskinos(Thomas Kretschmann)whose daughter, Nyssa(Leonor Varela) hasn't a faintest idea of having a brother.I especially enjoyed the parts where he was almost drained of blood but brought back to life and killed Scud(Norman Reedus)who had been helping Blade when Blade was searching for Whistler.

Alien vs. Predator," Better than Expected
","Before I get to the real review, I need to say that I didn't see this movie because of all the bad reviews it got. The trailer looked nice, but from what everyone was saying, it wasn't worth any of the time to watch it. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who was also the screen player.The alien characters were created by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, and the predator characters were created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas.Okay, so a signal is received by a satellite company, owned by Charles Bishop Weyland(Lance Henriksen), in which they see a heated source that looks like an underground pyramid. Weyland decides to round up a few experts, so that they can go and find out what and where this pyramid is. The first person they contact is Alexa Woods(Sanaa Lathan), who is climbing a ice ledge at the time. Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova) an archaeologist and his assistant Thomas Parks (Sam Troughton)are then contacted. Alexa is then in a helicopter and meets Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner), a man with two young sons.Sebastian, Alexa, Thomas, Maxwell Stafford (Colin Salmon), Mark Verheiden (Tommy Flanagan), and Adele Rousseau (Agathe De La Boulaye) all meet on a boat and discuss with Weyland about the situation. Alexa decides to leave, luckily she changes her mind at the last minute when she finds out that an amateur guide is going to replace her. She tells them three important rules then they go off in search of this pyramid.Meanwhile, a Predator ship is coming towards Earth. A group of Predator youngsters are watching a virtual hologram of the pyramid while they prepare for the upcoming battle with the alien species that are living in the pyramid that the humans are going to look for.The group of scientists, guards and other people walk towards the pyramid and slide into it. One steps on a stone that falls and releases the alien queen, which has been frozen for 2000 years. She thaw's out and starts laying eggs. Meanwhile the humans have reached the sacrificial chamber.The teenage predators land on Earth and start their trek in getting to the pyramid. They have to hunt and kill the aliens to be seen as adults. So this pilgrimage is actually a mission to adulthood. Before they actually get to the pyramid, they indulge in killing the humans above.Meanwhile, the alien eggs have hatched and have released Facehuggers. Adele and Graeme are killed during this and chestbursters result. Alexa and the rest of the group have discovered the guns that the predators are to use in fighting the aliens and take them, resulting in the predators rampage in trying to get them back.Almost all of the humans in the group are killed, only Alexa survives. The predators are no worse, two of the three have been killed, leaving one. This one predator and Alexa team up and fight off the queen. At the end of the movie, the surviving predator is killed. An elder gives Alexa a war spear and leaves. When the predators leave earth, they have no idea that their fallen comrad has been infected with a chestburster and soon the creature bursts out of his chest, resulting in an alien/predator hybrid with both mandibles and the long tongue-like appendage.A sequel is to be released sometime in 2007, presumably October or December. This movie deserves more praise, because it shows that we humans can in fact fight alongside other races besides our own. I give this movie a seven out of ten, it needed more action. Other than that, it was a pretty good movie to watch. I highly recommend this and the other Alien/Predator films.",7,1,2,13 January 2007

Detroit Rock City," The truth revealed
","Along with other things that impress me, this has to be at the top of my list. I would have never known it if this movie was tossed at me from a garbage can. This movie focus's on four young teenagers who are completely crazy about KISS. Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip Hurudie (James DeBello), Hawk (Edward Furlong), and Jeremiah 'Jam' Bruce (Sam Huntington) are a tribute band named Mystery to the awesome music artists only known as KISS. But soon the fun goes to spoils due to Mrs. Bruce (Lin Shaye), Jam's mother, who finds the KISS tickets and torches them. Now the four friends have to take a trip from a boarding school to Detriot. Jam confronts his mother and sets her straight, and the four boys get what they wanted to see.With this movie we get to see all original members of the KISS band, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanely, and Ace Frehley and we get to see Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley's longtime companions. I had to give this movie a perfect ten because it just reflected what us teenagers had to go through to see our favorite bands perform. I'm glad that this movie was made for one reason, the reason to teach our parents that what we listen to isn't bad.",10,3,5,3 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Fantastic

But by whom they don't know. They believe it to be Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton). But maybe they are wrong. Maybe it's Harrys new friend Tom Riddle(Christian Coulson) Now they must act fast. They must run to the rescue of both Hogwarts and the students of Hogwarts. But in their path is the professor that doesn't know a thing about magic except a magic spell that makes you forget.I loved the way Dobby, Lucius Malfoy and Draco were portrayed. More than less these are my favorite actors of the Harry Potter series. Alan Rickman(Professor Snape)is a close crush for myself. So is Warwick Davis(Professor Flintwick). It's too bad that one actor doesn't have more screen time. He'd be a great star in this series. I can just see him flying on a broom and fighting Professor Snape.

To bad he doesn't listen and remember the words that he should say when he needs to get back.Watch carefully because I think the part where the skeleton hands come up and hit and punch Ash is the funnest.
