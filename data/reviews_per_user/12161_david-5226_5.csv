The Hangover," for GUYS only
","Superb movie - but there will be very little enjoyment if a female was seeing this flick - in most cases. Furthermore, guys - DON'T watch with your parents - it will be EXTREMELY uncomfortable!The R rating info says little as to what's actually in this film. This film is seriously just a hair from a MA rating - not kidding. It does say 'Nudity' - but it should be 'A-Lot of Nudity'. Overall, I'm a 24 year old guy and found this movie VERY enjoyable! I watched it with my mom and a bunch of friends (don't know why - just ran out and got this, heard it was 'good')- was a BAD IDEAD. L E A V E T H E P A R E N T S O U TBut, older guys will definitely find this movie hilarious.",9,0,0,6 January 2010
Final Destination 2," Worth watching for the opening scene
","Honestly. The best part of this movie is the highway pileup at the beginning. I like all-types of movies, but one of my favorite things when it comes to movies that I like is a powerful, incredible, inventive action scene. How can a pileup be inventive? I can't explain it--it just is.Like that bridge pileup on Mission Impossible III: incredible. The rest of the movie is pretty good. But, the intro scene, though very gory and over-the-top, is very entertaining and leaves you saying '...wow!'Good stuff.",8,2,2,7 April 2011
Quantum of Solace," But it.
","What's with all the anti-hype of all this camera movement stuff? People, come on, it's not that bad. And it's only on a few small sections, I feel it adds to the grittiness that Daniel Craig has added to the bond series. And it's not used excessively. It does, however, forcibly make you pay attention closer to the action scenes, to keep in control of what's going on. I think the editing is done beautifully. Casino Royale had similar editing techniques, and they still pulled it off fine. You can kind of think of it as the same editing style as the Transporter movies. Quick, precise, but still effective.This movie is incredible. Being a bond fan since the beginning, this one fits in very well. This movie feels very 'bond-like' at the last action major sequence. Especially concerning the location of the last major action sequence. It sort of brings you back to the earlier days. I watched this movie 3 times when I rented it. And for some reason it got better and better every time. Great action movie.",9,5,12,22 April 2009
Children of Men," holy cow
","This movie is cinematic genius in every way imaginable. I have never been so moved, so tensed, so opened, & so astonished in a long time. I feel this is one of the best movies ever made. You will be gripping your fingers in your palms really tightly through some scenes in this movie until you bleed, and you won't even notice it. You will be grinding your teeth too - I recommend wearing a teeth guard, or shoving some paper towels in your mouth.What makes this movie so incredible and so highly respected? 1. Cinematography 2. TensionAll the actors and director and producers and location scouters were perfect too.Those 2 points are right on the money. It gets deep inside you while watching it. It tickles your organs with a dirty sharp finger. This movie has more tension than most horror movies, seriously. I'm extremely surprised that this flick isn't in the top 100 on IMDb, but it made the top 250.BTW, you will understand how much work went into this movie by watching the bonus features. They did such innovative things in this film that make these current 2009 flicks look like cheap VHS home movies.This movie, though very different in times and so forth, is similar to the amount of work that went into Apocalyptico (sp?).... incredible sets... incredible story... incredible tension. I will explore other works from the director, writes, and cinematographers who did this film, and hopefully come across such a beautiful piece of art like Children of Men. A+",10,3,12,20 June 2009
