Minority Report," This movie sucks!
","After watching the movie I saw that it was based upon a short story. That's probably the problem. A short story has been stretched up to a full length movie. ItÂ´s predictable and in all this high tech surroundings it does not make sense that they have to manually move some fileboards around. Reminds me of the old data tapes in the 70's. So, a B movie made with A budget.",1,5,10,18 February 2003
