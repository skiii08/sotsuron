Requiem for a Dream," Horrifically Brilliant
","If you are the type of person that reviews a film on how much you enjoyed the story, you will hate this, as you will find a story of several people taking the 'easy' way out to get what they want in life, and ultimately their horrifying demise as a result.The first thing that grabs you about this film from the first few minutes of watching is the cinematography is absolutely first rate and the whole film is very well directed.  The sound track is also particular impressive, with a powerful peice running throughout the film.It will make you think, cry, and possibly sick.8 out of 10.",9,0,0,26 December 2002
Fight Club," Requires Some Thought, honour this, and it will amaze you!
","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** We are all controlled by numerous factors, our job, our possesions, how much money we own and live by what society defines to be normal, and ultimately who we are lead by (Prime Minister, President etc...) but then even breakaway cultures end up having a leader, even if what they are lead to believe is not to be lead!Many people in their own minds see themselves how they'd like to be, but this could only happen outside the control that is their own life, very few people actually have the guts to pick up the ball and run with it.Fight Club has sooo many meanings and hidden messages that it requires a lot of thought to fully appreciate the film.  I have seen the film twice and still keep reading into it more and more.Ed Norton makes a fantastic appearance as the joint lead alongside Brad Pitt in a film that basically mocks us all for being such automatons, and what deserves most credit is Ed Nortons narration throughout the film, it is so monotone, and emotionless and thats just how it should be for this film.Fight Club has a EXCELLENT twist (So DO NOT let anyone tell you anything about the film, just watch it), and if you watch it a second time or third you will notice by listening and watching carefully that there are BIG hints throughout yet anyone that tells you they sussed it first time round... well, I think they'd be lying.It deserves 10/10 for storyline, directing, performances by the cast and a twist that rivals sixth sense.  Nothing too fancy with the cinematography but it doesn't really need it.I'm sorry to say that a lot of people will (and do) hate this film, possibly because they do not see what it is really about, and just see the fighting, which admittedly, if thats all it was about, it would be rubbish.  It's just a shame that it won't be remembered as one of the greats, I read somewhere on IMDB that a GREAT film is not easy to watch and I have to perfect examples of this, Fight Club, and Requium For A Dream.***** Spoliers Below Here *****I'm sure I don't need to tell you but did you know there are single frame flashes of Tyler Durden while Jack (if that IS in fact his name) is at work and at the therapy groups?  I bet once you've seen them you'll see them every time you watch the film without freeze frame.  Also, in the scene where Tyler is burning Jacks hand, there is only one pair of legs under the table.",Null,0,1,2 January 2003
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," The funniest Conincedence in a film ever!
","*** Minor Spoliers Ahead ***I think you have to come from England or at least have a good understanding of English culture (or more importantly the Cockeny Accent) to FULLY appreciate Lock Stock.  However this film should still appeal to everyone.Techinically the film is brilliant, the cinematography is first rate, the sound track turns the film from being fast paced to being slow dark and sinister in an instant, and each character having their own little theme tune works really well, I particularly like the electric guiter riff that accompanies the character 'Dog'.The chronology of the film with the storyline is very clever and sometimes makes things very funny, for example as the boys are walking into the pub they are met by a man on fire coming the other way which we find out about later whilst developing Rory Breakers character.This was the first film I had ever seen with Vinnie Jones in and I have to say, he's good for the film he gets away with being able to play himself! He is well suited to the roll and performs what is probably the most gruesome part in the film when he kills a man by repeatedly slamming a car door on his head!  Just like his footballing days...Sting deserves a mention too, not the best actor in the world, but suits his chracter well, with his cool calm 'don't give a sh*t attitude towards the crime bosses.Anyway, you should see this film, if you live in england you will roar with laughter at the sear hilarity that the london Scene and cockeny accent brings to it, and if you are outside the UK you will still find this film funny and is worth seeing.10/10.",Null,1,1,2 January 2003
