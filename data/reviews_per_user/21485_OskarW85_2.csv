Blade Runner 2049," Another bitter disappointment from Ridley Scott
","(Mild spoilers ahead) Do not be fooled by raving reviews of 10/10. This movie is worse for 'Blade Runner' franchise than 'Alien:Covenant' was for its own. I do not know what Ridley Scott is thinking taking a dump on his best known movies, but at this rate we will have 'Thelma and Louise 2:Get married or get busted' and 'Black Hawk Down too' by the end of this decade. My biggest problem with the movie is that it is not a 'Blade Runner' movie at all. We all loved crowded, dirty streets of futuristic LA where neo-noir Deckard is hunting its prey. That atmosphere created tension from the first minutes up to the grand finale. Here we get bland, rather empty streets where couple of extras are wandering without a clue together with our main hero-K. In original we got pretty small sets that were creating illusion of huge city bulging with life. Here we have huge CGI pans of mostly empty streets. The difference is stunning. Deckard was using city to gain advantage, K is running in sterile sets pretending to be futuristic offices. In original we had beautiful sets with great lighting. Here we have bland CGI that cannot really compare to the real thing. I think it is pretty bad when neon lights from 35 years ago look much better than today CGI. It sounds silly, but they really do not make movies like they used to do.My second grip with the movie is the screenplay itself. Original had simple yet satisfying story of policeman hunting bad guys with nice, non-obvious ending and love affair to spice things up. Here we have Inception-like twists inside the twist inside the twist. Except none of the twist are really interesting. Our hero has no motivation whatsoever to do any of his actions. He just flows in the direction his boss throws him. We are supposed to follow journey down his memory lane, but he is just as disinterested in discovering the past as we are disinterested watching his actions. He goes to different locations seemingly at random. We almost don't see his detective work. Screenwriters must have felt similarly because they included character of Claire Underwood... I mean Lieutenant Joshi that literally tells K where he should go next. Screenwriters also tried to include 'copy' of omnipotent Eldon Tyrell by creating character of Niander Wallace, played by Jared Leto. His delivery falls flat on its face. Instead of fearful ruler of the city we get mumbling, blind guy that serves no purpose at all. Scenes with him are long, boring and completely forgettable.Love affair is also laughable in this movie. While Deckard fells in love in beautiful replicant, K has affair with... a hologram. A hologram girl named Joi that is part of his apartment. Yep, we literally see him 'kissing' and 'hugging' a hologram. How is it even possible? I do not know. But they must have been very proud of it, because we even see scene of virtual sex where real life hooker is 'body double' for the hologram itself and they enter one another. Yes, it is just as ridiculous as it sounds. In one of the plot twists K has to move hologram into temporary pen-drive-like device so bad guys cannot intercept it and learn about his plans. Yet during later attack pen-drive is destroyed and hologram 'dies' shouting 'I love you' to K. I cri evrytiem, seriously.And last but not least - the music. I do not remember a movie with such obnoxious score. Original had one of the most praised soundtracks made by Vangelis. Soundtrack to this movie was made by Hans Zimmer. But you would not tell. Most of the 'music' are horrible synthesizer sounds reminding of 'other world Silent Hill' score or dinosaur farts after auto-tune. I don't know if it's some cruel joke by Zimmer or maybe some Skrillex-wannabe made it and Hans just signed it. But it is bad. Really bad. People were literally leaving cinema during one of the longer fights, it was that unbearable.",3,13,47,8 October 2017
Sicario," Completely Plot-less
","That movie was a thorough disappointment. One could think than in 2 hours you just HAVE to have some plot to put all the visuals together. But not here. Director uses dialogue only when absolutely needed, so plot is almost non-existent. We get stunning visuals and interesting locations, but it's like watching bizarre video-clip. For the whole movie I questioned motivations of main characters. (major spoilers ahead) Even first scene raised my eyebrows, when our agents find dozens of bodies hidden behind the dry-walls in a safe house. Let that stink sink for a moment... Dozens of decaying bodies in apparently occupied safe house. Why? Does the great boss like to torture his soldiers with stink? Does he fell awkward digging holes so he went with vertical storage instead? Or maybe it's just poor plot-vehicle to show our agent is angry enough and ready to go after big bad guy? DING DING DING So Kate joins the group and guess what they do next? They exfiltrate local gang boss... from a Mexico. Because Freedom goes wherever it wants to go. Not only that but they kill some gang members right on a crowded highway just before border. Just a normal day at work I guess. Kate (our main character) doesn't like it, but hey - they are big boys and she wants to be a big boy too. Why do they choose to torture local boss on American soil and prepare risky convoy ride instead of going by helicopter? Because (redacted), that's why. I don't want to go further, but every part of the movie is filled with stupid, inconsistent decisions that do not make any sense at all. If National Geographic went to document lives of narco bosses - it would be just like this movie. Chaotic, brutal and completely plot-less. The movie ends where it started - NOWHERE.",3,7,14,5 June 2017
