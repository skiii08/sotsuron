Scarface," Great for the 80's...not so much now.
","If you want a movie that sums up the bloodiness of action films in the 1980's, but also sums up the awful use of synthesizers, and highlights the outrageously ridiculous fashion hold overs from the 70's, Scarface is the film for you.Having grown up hearing how wonderful the film was, I went into viewing it with high expectations...which were entirely not met. The film is almost comic in appearance and sound, and is a prime example of what happens when things just don't age well. For those who were about when it came out and remember the early 80's fondly, then it might well be your favorite film. Anyone else, I'd suggest at best watching it when it shows up on cable, if not at all.For those who aren't aware of the film's premise, its about Cubans who come to America, when Castro released thousands from his prisons, taking advantage of American asylum promises. The main character and pals move in on the organized crime/drug trafficking in Miami...stir in your usual power/money corrupts scheme, and you've got yourself a movie. I've long thought the main reason folks like the film is only to shout out its tag line,'Say hello to my little friend!' ...and that may be the most redeemable trait of the film.",3,12,26,8 February 2005
