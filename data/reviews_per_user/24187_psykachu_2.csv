Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome Movie
","Well, I'll be honest, I almost fell asleep during the beginning of the movie, they where talking waaay to much, not a lot of action until the podracing scene. Man, I didn't recognize Natalie Portman from the start, this movie had amazing costumes. But the disappointment was Anakin, why Jake Lloyd? Why not Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense? What's wrong with you George? Haley was only 1 year older, and much cuter. Maybe you can star him as the next Luke Skywalker. I think the best performances was with Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman. Great movie but could've been more exciting than the first three movies.",Null,0,0,13 August 1999
Lilo & Stitch," Finally, and down to earth Disney flick!
","**TINY SPOILERS**I've seen this movie over 20 times, and its still cracks me up! A real eye opener for many young kids and helps reveal the real world through the life of Nani and Lilo. It is original b/c it isn't based on the formula of a normal Disney movie i.e. Caucasian characters having asinine problems in the classic films of yore (devouring poisoned apple from old crone, trading voice for human legs and being late to a ball! *gasp* oh the tragedy!) But L&S being set in the gorgeous surrounding of Hawaii takes away the fantasy fairy tale; the movie becomes more genuine and less mechanical stressing that Stitch's violent impulses that have been 'programmed' into him all disappear when his natural intuition kicks in as he begins the search for family and friendship, and Lilo, a child longing for a friend, was the answer to his prayers and vice versa.To those of you paranoid about your kids being subjected to violence (Lilo punching some kid in her face) let me just say, THAT was funny and if you're worried about your kids copying whatever they see on tv, well that sounds like a personal problem to me. It is possible for a kid to determine right and wrong and you can EXPLAIN to them that it is only a movieno wait, a CARTOON. What difference does it make if Lilo hits another girl or Daffy Duck SHOOTING himself in the face? Kids see a lot more than just a punch in the face. It's only a cartoon folks, not a bloody Hannibal Lecter special where you point out the bits of iniquity. The part where Stitch gets run over was even sugar coated with several cute 'squeaks' He's *indestructible* after all, (well he's bulletproof and all that) The characters are very unique (whoever heard of a dog/koala who plays an electric ukulele? The part with Nani and Lilo were arguing was so real It was uncanny because it was like my sister and I were just animated onto the screen rarely we can relate to characters on screen, especially a cartoon. And if you didn't know this was about a 'broken' family READ THE MOVIE SUMMARY if it doesn't have one well im sure you were suspicious of the PG rating, it was on there too you know, so don't go blaming the movie if you're kids become violent blue devils. You knew what you were getting into. Parents are totally oblivious to these labels anyway and manage to get Vice City for their innocent 7 year old.If you love to laugh and having an adorable little alien win your heartyou won't be let down. So sit back, relax, and don't complainit's only a bad movie if you make it one. I give it 6 stars out of 5",Null,0,0,24 March 2003
