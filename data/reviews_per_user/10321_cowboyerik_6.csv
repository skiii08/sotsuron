Alien 3," ALIEN 3 assembly cut on blue ray INCREDIBLE improvement; master piece!
","I remember walking out shaking my head along with the rest of my family decades ago upset with how bad Alien 3 was. We really expected something great, and it was terrible. I'm so happy that blue ray extended cut was made and released in 2010. It was great! Totally different, characters are developed very very well. It's to bad financial problems destroyed the 1992 version ultimately turning so many new and younger fans away. I am looking forward to Prometheus 2 and hope very much that it's done well. Aliens are sure to be part of it, just not sure how! Alien 2 will always be most people's favorite movie in the series however Alien 3 got a huge boost. It's a respectable movie worthy of the series!",9,2,3,28 March 2013
Alien: Resurrection," Prometheus had me re-watching the ALIEN director/reworked cuts
","Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 'assembly cut' benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!",8,0,1,28 March 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Shocked at the richness, greatness, perfection; automatic Oscar SWEEP, all available categories period!!
","OMG, rarely if ever have I been inspired to go back and see what I just saw on the same day; I actually thought I was in IMAX 3D, but was in 3D Hall; doing 'Director's Hall' IMAX 3D tonight; don't care what it costs. This latest Star Trek was perfection. I am totally shocked at how emotionally powerful, electric and awe inspiring, visually stunning, masterfully written, perfectly paced, well conceived, drawn-up and thought out from start to the last closing credit with the finest Star Trek music score to date.Easily outdoes all other Trek movies and perhaps most of them combined with great respect to each Star Trek title from the past because this movie redefines every aspect and boundary of what anyone may or might expect from a movie or entertainment of any kind.For these reasons, and because I would never spoil anyone's chance to see this first time, and have the same thrill ride I just and seen in a good mood, in 3D, on a wonderful day with a popcorn and pop, no details herein of the movie.I'll end by making the BOLD statement that this movie will be the first ever movie to SWEEP any and all movie awards nights including Oscars. Yes, I predict a first ever Oscar sweep in any category that applies and only categories such as 'short film' or best 'foreign film' would not apply cause it's not on those categories. This movie should win everything. There simply won't be enough accolades to go around.Unless something else comes out this year of greater than a TITANIC caliber movie comes out, nothing else can touch this. It's an all new standard. Only JJ Abrams doing the next installments of Star Wars could touch it in the future.",10,3,14,22 May 2013
Rules of Engagement," No, You have not seen this before, most awesome, eyeopening!
","Even though everyone has seen X-file type Federal cover up shows and movies, this movies goes well beyond that. Rules of Engagement shows the paradox that we as civilian Americans are aware of, but that our Soldiers have to deal with most everyday somewhere in the world. You will see the conditions of life under Saddam Hussein, what survival really meant for many Vietnam Veterans, the Paradox of living in the United States also known as the 'Great Satin' , and HONOR survives today in today's United States Military Services. Those of you young children, young adults, those lost with your Sub-Woofers, Neon lighting, and absurd tire and rim setups, should see this film to perhaps appreciate or recognize, all the dead men, OF YOUR SAME AGES and DESIRES, that in fact never realized any dreams, cause they sacrificed in the name of the Truman Doctrine. That doctrine says we must protect our Liberty and Freedom against aggressors, paticularly communist ones.",10,3,10,14 May 2000
Prometheus," ALIEN v. Prometheus - I want a Prometeus 2
","I had a TERRIBLE 2012, I had no chance time to see any movies. I'm taking 2013 OFF. My first objective was to CATCH WITH 2012 MOVIES. Ridley Scott was one at the top of my list. I'm a HUGE FAN of ALIEN movies. The stories, the sounds, effects, the thrill of being scared outta my mind. I was a teenager when ALIENS (Alien 2) came out; I was hyped for it, I was young and was fresh off the memories of watching Alien. ALIEN 2 blew me away; absolutely top notch. I was delighted and surprised that Prometheus was a branch off ALIEN, exploring that original seated Alien now known as an 'Engineer'. Absolutely brilliantly written, thought-out, filmed and cut together. I could ask nothing more from this film after my initial screening. Yes, I was a 'director's' cut. I want more and I wants PROMETHEUS 2.",10,11,21,5 January 2013
Gladiator," Greatest Sorta True Story Ever Told; Most GLORIOUS!
","Gladiator, is the greatest story ever told. The greatest and most glorious film ever created without a doubt. If you have no appreciation for history, your ancestors, or the course of mankind, your family or yourself, you might not like this film.Gladiator should serve notice to mankind, of what in fact, mankind is not. No honor, no glory, no wisdom as well as many other faults. Today, commercials, radio, cash and campaign managers determine our leaders. Not for accomplishments or ability but for status and figure head. Gladiator, depicts Rome, and a few leaders in a time of great corruption and mis-guidance of central authority.Gladiator illustrates the price of Roman restoration, and what it will cost the United States, to restore our leadership in all branchs of government, except possibly the Judicial Branch. Our leaders are immoral, corrupt, and ride on the backs of others. No mater the party affiliation, sex and money(Democrats), or Iran-Contra/Coke/or the ruininous state of Texas(Republicans), all are corrupt, and frankly only SANDBAG the government our people need. Anyone see stats/statistic on Texas, it is the most toxic state in the country! Thank you Gov. Bush. Florida beachs don't smell to good this year either, more like sewage.Gladiator inspires the mind, even after viewing 4 times, it is still compelling both emotional and morally. If only our leaders would have even 1% of Maximus's morality, loyalty and compassion, we would be a better world, 100 times over....",10,0,0,17 May 2000
