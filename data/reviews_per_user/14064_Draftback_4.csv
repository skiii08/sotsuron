Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A movie entirely in the Star Wars spririt.
","Finally, I sat in the cinema's comfy seat looking at the commercials. Ever since the day I heard the new Star Wars movie was in the making, I, and quite a few others, had anticipatied this day. You had read in papers about people who had seen the movie and said it wasn't good at all. 'This isn't even worth 2 hours of my life' you even heard someone say. As a Star Wars fan, not a freak, there is a difference you know, you took the criticism with ease. Knowing for yourself that 30-year old people who had seen the original Star Wars movies when they were young would probably have far to high hopes for this movie, thinking it would be some kind of out-of-this world experience, you just knew that George Lucas wouldn't let you down. After seeing the movie, I know I was right. The use of special effects made thanks to computers was extensive, but did not at all ruin the movie; Lucas knew that he wanted to use what he could, and he did it. The result? A Star Wars movie with stunning special effects, a story entirely in the Star Wars spirit, characters and actors that match those in the original trilogy and the force as it's ally. Could it fail? Of course not, and it didn't either.",7,0,0,19 August 1999

Mission: Impossible II," Exasperating twists and tiresome escapades makes MI:2 a dull boy
","In this action filled flick Tom Cruise and co-stars battle desperately against not only sinister villains but also a hopeless script filled with annoyances and plot holes. 'MI:2', although making top dollars at the box office I'm sure, only succeeds halfway in being entertaining, leaving large holes in desperate need of filling. Numerous attempts to fill these holes are made using well choreographed action scenes, I'll give them that, and hopeless, yes they are, plot twists. This results in a mildly entertaining movie with a lot more to be desired.In general, sequels to action movies and the likes, such as Mission Impossible, although not winning any Oscars per se, still often manages to be entertaining in the 'Hey, honey, that was an hour and a half well spent, I had fun' kind of way. However, Mission Impossible 2 does not succeed even at this, and should therefore be left alone. Tom Cruise fans should go watch 'Eyes Wide Shut' instead and if your looking for an action filled sequel, hey, it's a jungle out there, and you know it.",2,0,0,29 July 2001
The Hurricane," Here comes the story of the Hurricane
","Denzel Washington plays the black boxer Rubin Carter, wrongly accused of murder and sentenced to prison. Avid youngster Lesra Martin played by Vicellous Reon Shannon reads the book Carter writes in prison and together with his Canadian friends embark on a crusade to free Carter from prison.The Hurricane, based on a true story, survives thanks to grandiose acting by Denzel Washington. In all, the plot holds together but the veracity of it all can be discussed as I am sure it has and will. The degree of truth aside it is an entertaining story and it is not hard to sympathize with jailbird Washington. His saviours, the Canadians, are sadly enough a bit weekly defined and in spite of their key roles in the movie they don't quite seem to fit in. Bob Dylan's excellent 'Hurricane' lifts the film further.",7,0,2,30 July 2001
