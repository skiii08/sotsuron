It," Surprisingly good
",This movie had me after minutes. The introduction of Pennywise is handled excellently by Bill Skarsgard who delivers a note-perfect interpretation. The switch from playful and infantile to menacing is no better exemplified than in the moment we hear him segue from a jubilant 'pop pop pop' to a guttural hiss. Genuinely the stuff of nightmares. The film devotes time enough to each character to give them substance without diverting for too long from the threat of an appearance from 'IT'. The 'loser club' are as likable as the bullies are repulsive. Perhaps the only downside to this film is the message that 'adults are the real monsters' is perhaps a little too on-the-nose but nevertheless this message certainly rings true. A thoroughly enjoyable film and deservingly the surprise hit of this summer.,8,3,5,20 September 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Great Odin's Raven!
","**contains spoilers** In no way is this a criticism but my immediate review of this movie for anyone who asked was that it was jingling keys for a baby. For a movie titled Ragnarok - essentially the apocalypse - it all feels somewhat inconsequential as soon as you come away from it, however it is a contender for one of the most entertaining MCU offerings. It looks great, its pacing is fast and tidy, there are enough tie-ins to the wider MCU to satisfy and finally there is genuine humour in a Thor movie. I believe this movie will have good re-watch value and is a fine example of what Taika Waititi is capable of with a big budget, alongside his successful and excellent indie portfolio. I can see that some people will struggle with this movie as nearly everything is played for the joke, and almost every time it hits. The 'Loki turning into a snake' story and every Korg section are hilarious, and the only two misses in the movie for me were the 'Des & Troy' line and the Hela fight scene where she slays an entire army which looked a little too much like CGI Neo fighting a thousand agent Smiths. The 'Planet Hulk' section is awesome and gives new depth on this character. The Grandmaster is fun, but slightly overstays his welcome (see post-credit scene) and the ending is a perfect cliff-hanger for those of us counting down the days to Infinity War.",8,1,5,23 November 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," More Austin Powers than James Bond
","Some people may assume the title of this review is an insult, but I would say there are equal parts positive and negative in this. Bond has become a laboured, sombre affair in recent years and though those films are still a quality product there is little fun to be had. Step in Kingsman - a high-octane, largely brainless British spy film that might lack the grit of Bond, but is infinitely more enjoyable. I watched this film with a perpetual grimace of disapproval at the cliché-riddled plot (a global super-villain with a lair; the protagonist being unusually proficient at driving and parkour before any of his training, despite being a no-hoper street youth; the mentor fast-tracking the protégé into a role of prominence against the odds etc...) yet... I carried on watching. I wanted to see what happened next despite the lack of originality because the film is paced well and holds your attention. The fight scenes are unnecessarily slow-motioned almost to a point of bending time infinitely, but they are also violent in a way many films are afraid to be for fear of bumping up their certificate and infringing on the profit margin. The Austin Powers ridiculousness of this movie was cemented in the closing minutes as Eggsy is rewarded for his heroics with the chance to engage in anal sex with a princess while Mark Strong has to watch and keep the engine running. Yep, that actually happens... but in fairness, it actually makes the rest of the film seem palatable in hindsight.",5,0,2,20 September 2017
Spectre," Weighed down by the spectre of Bond (get it?)
","WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS (sort of) This movie helped me work out why the only Bond films I tend to like are the first in a new series by a new actor playing the titular role. The series is locked in a never ending series of nudges, winks and nods to the past. Each new Bond attempts to reset this and does so to a degree, e.g. the 'tough' Bond we get played by Daniel Craig (There's no way Pierce Brosnan is sitting naked on a chair getting his balls smashed in), but then it slopes steadily back towards the tropes that define Bond as a whole. This guy is a hardened killer, he could stab himself in the leg and his heartbeat wouldn't raise. Daniel Craig is a good actor so we believe this too, we buy into the fact that Bond as we now know him is athletic, hard as nails and will stop at nothing to get the job done - yet we are asked to believe that he can fall in love once every two years? That this husk of a human being can fall victim to his emotions on such a regular basis? It's these staple Bond-isms that kill the pace of the film and take you out of the moment. We open with Bond taking some woman up to a room, only to then hop out of a window to kill someone. Why?! Who the f**k is she? Is she now a witness that needs to be murdered? I assume this bit is there just to remind us that Bond loves to f**k, but he was never going up there to have sex, he was out of that window straight away. Then later we get Bond showing up at a funeral to seduce the widow, like Will Ferrell in Wedding Crashers. There is no cause for it and it doesn't suit the tone of the film, the information he gets from this could have been acquired a million other ways. Then we finally get Madeleine, who tells Bond no and you think 'wow, finally'. Oh but wouldn't you know it, we get a boring romantic scene on the train where Bond reminds us that in his world no means yes. This only serves to end the film like most other Bond films where the who-gives-a-s**t love interest is in peril and Bond can do his dead-eyed, sad clown without makeup face.Overall this isn't a terrible movie, it looks great and there are some cool set pieces, but it struggles to get to the point because it has so many historic boxes to tick. Do we have to go to Q's office in every film to see some inventions? Can Bond just do one cool thing without adjusting his cuff? Can 'M' stop being surprised that after 50 years of doing whatever the f**k he wants, that Bond has just done it again?There is a lot of detail to this film that requires you to give it your full attention, but you will find yourself going blurry eyed and missing it because it repeats so much that you don't realise when you need to check back in. You really expect me to recall the identikit post-2000 billionaire villains from the other movies in this franchise whilst also trying to force out a s**t to give about MI5 and MI6 merging?? Some people are saying Daniel Craig doesn't look like he enjoys the role anymore, but I think its the opposite. I think he's in too deep, he looks as laboured and drained as this Bond should be. He kills people for a living and has no life, even Moneypenny gives him s**t about this. I suppose that's something new at least.",5,0,3,13 September 2017
