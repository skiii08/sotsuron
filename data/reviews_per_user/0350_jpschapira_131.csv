Whip It," Drew Barrymore: the sexy eternal child
","Drew Barrymore has seen everything. She's been everywhere, she's worked with everybody; she reached the top, fell all the way to the bottom and, patiently and professionally, tried to climb again. Last year she collected very important awards for her wonderful performance in 'Grey Gardens', and she also directed her first film, 'Whip it', which is very much like her: charming, fresh, winning, sexy in that very particular way Barrymore always made us think about 'sexy'. Some friends laugh at me when I say Drew Barrymore is sexy; I know she's pretty, but she's sexy too. Beautiful and confident as Barrymore, Bliss Cavendar is the hero of the film. She's played by Ellen Page, who reminds us of Barrymore not because of her role choices or acting abilities but because she has that special naturalness: not the one that makes you great (anyone can achieve greatness –something more related to what others think and rarely aware of the truth inside people-, sooner or later, even if they don't deserve it), I mean the naturalness that doesn't question the fact that someone has been born to live on the screen, forever. Barrymore is that someone, and so is Page. But the hero Bliss is a particular being. Particular because she innerly defies the suffocating nature of a town in Texas named Bodeen. The film's opening scene is the setting of a beauty pageant. While all of the girls look like Barbies ready to be locked in a box, Bliss is in the bathroom with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat, revelatory) resolving a situation involving blue hair, if you know what I mean. And it's not that Bliss isn't beautiful (I said she was, didn't I?) and smart; she can win any beauty pageant but she just doesn't believe in it. Still, she does it because it's important for her mom (Marcia Gay Harden, moving as usual). Also, it's not that she's this rebellious, bright, somewhat revolutionary teen that wants to change the world. She wants to get out of Bodeen, plain and simple; and so does her best friend. Wait, I still haven't mentioned the best part about the main character. Bliss perfectly knows what she doesn't want, but she still hasn't found what she wants, what might –or not- define her in some way. We see her working in a diner, and then lying in bed. We can tell that she isn't unhappy, but she isn't happy either. As a director, Barrymore is wise enough to present Bodeen not as the dumb little village it could have been presented as. I guess Shauna Cross, the film's writer and the author of the novel it's based on, knows that a town like this is not always as we watch it on film. But Barrymore holds the key card. She's seen enough to understand there are conventional plot developments that can't be skipped. Hell, she even knows that the dad played by Daniel Stern has to be kind of primitive but good-hearted as no other character in the movie. However, she fights. No, not to bring something new (in that case, the roller derby, a sport and main event of the movie, is unexplored enough): she fights for something pure, honest. The transparent connection she's always conveyed as an actress makes 'Whip it' the movie she would have chosen to make but could never be real until now. Now she's the boss.That's why the music -by The Section Quartet- plays, mostly, as a silent soundtrack, without talking for the characters. That's why the characters, mostly, don't even talk themselves (there's a beautiful love scene, shot underwater, that begins with pure gestures and concludes the same way, with expressive looks and absolutely no words), except for 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket (played by Jimmy Fallon who, well directed, is actually good, and achieved the best performance of his career alongside Barrymore in 'Fever Pitch'), the narrator of the roller derby games, a necessarily unbearable character that goes against the quiet nature of the film. That's why Bodeen is never really Bodeen and the sermons are never sermons (the conversations between Bliss and her parents, which are many, are short and potent, never aiming for a certain dramatic impact that only occurs –inevitably- towards the end and between the parents, or when the parents are on their own). That's why there's a character that sings played by a singer, Landon Pigg. I mean I might be exaggerating but I think Drew Barrymore is probably the only person who can gather a supporting cast that includes a female stunt double (Zoe Bell), a rapper (Eve), a SNL comedian (Kristen Wiig), two probable skaters who never did a film in their lives (Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica), a relatively unknown comedian (Andrew Wilson) and an Oscar nominated actress, among other things. Of course Barrymore plays a role, but a very little one, graciously exaggerated to the point that the viewer is never waiting for her appearance. Even when it's impossible to miss a moment created by her, entirely for her, in which she shouts 'food Fight!', the Barrymore that directs also proves to be selfless and lets her actors shine. Oh, yes, they shine, in the never-ending tale about finding yourself. The moment in which Bliss meets three roller derby players, something cracks; in her and in the movie, who makes way for one of its few slow-motion shots. When you know what you want, that's when you become sexy. The thing with Drew Barrymore is that she knew it all along.",8,1,5,27 April 2010
Walk the Line," Let's do it; let's fall in love
","So, every year, before the Oscars take place, I try to watch or catch any film that has anything to do with them; specially the five nominated ones. Now it's Oscar week, and as I do all that, I found myself sitting down and watch 'Walk the Line', which is not one of the Best Picture nominees, but a strong contender in other categories.Let's say that when you watch a film knowing it is nominated for something, you do it differently. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon are nominated for their roles as Johnny Cash and June CarterI was not that much looking at them, but more like studying them; their chemistry, accents and impersonation, channel or imitation or however you want to call it (it is ultimately a performance anyhow).These two persons were truly in loveI fall short. These two persons were deeply; madly in loveI fall short. These two hearts were unitedI could be getting close. What Phoenix and Whiterspoon do to bring that passion alive is amazing. Beginning with their chemistryWe all know the charismatic blonde can feel the chemistry with any other actor, in her romantic comedies. But this is drama, and it gives a whole new depth to the matter.If you watch 'Election' or 'Cruel Intentions' or 'Pleasantville' you'll find a young, ambitious and talented actress. But this is a turn; 'Walk the line' shows us the character actor in her; the dramatic power she owns. She and Phoenix go to the highest levels, take the highest risksAnd succeed. Johnny Cash's was a life of depression, uncertainty and craziness; but there was always one light in his life: the fact of knowing who his woman wasAnd that was June Carter.Phoenix laughed when receiving the Best Comedy Actor Golden Globe: 'Who would have pictured me winning something about comedy', he laughed. He wouldn't laugh at the Oscars if he won; he would be grateful but probably uninterested. That's the way he is, that's the way he played Johnny Cash and another bunch of characters. But Cash highlights, of course. Because of his persona, his lifeHis music and songs, which Phoenix (unlike Jamie Foxx last year) sang himself.Whiterspoon also sang the songs, got the accent and the personality of her character right. I don't know what she's planning to say, but I'm betting all on her favor for this Sunday, because I believe she'll win, because I saw it when she was singing 'Jackson' alongside Phoenix, looking at him with love and desire, as Johnny and June must have looked at each other during their lives.And James Mangold made all the right calls. I knew he was good directing actors because he got the best out of Stallone and the best out of Winona Ryder in a movie she didn't (but should have) get nominated for. Now I know he made all the right calls with this movie because he could have directed a film about Cash and his ups and downs, but he directed a film about his and June's ups and downs, which is a lot better.He made the right calls because his film could have been one of those VH1 episodes about the life of a singer, but he made a strong and centered film with a defined objective. I understand this was a personal project for him, so, had he done it for VH1, he wouldn't have got the recognition he wanted and deserved. Phoenix and Whiterspoon's nominations are also Mangold's.He made the exactly right calls because he based, together with Gill Dennis, his screenplay on Cash's own writings. It goes through the music career, a very good scene of his first audition, his first concert, and of course his love life. Finally, he ended up delivering us a story that's so, but so extremely potent, that it sticks with you for a while: it's contagious.You've got to feel something when Johnny walks from a town to another, all wasted, just to see June. You've got to feel touched when Johnny tries to kiss June, and after she denies he says: 'It just happened', and June looks at him, recounting everything he does and demanding he should take credit for something.You can't stay still when John is about to touch bottom, down in the trees, about to fall into the river and June's mother looks at her: 'You go with him June', and she replies: 'I don't want to go down there'. 'Honey', her mother concludes: 'You are already down there'.",8,0,0,2 March 2006
Mission: Impossible III," The last mission? Don't think so...
","It seems like Tom Cruise's been running all his life, or at least all this decade: 'Mission Impossible II', 'Vanilla Sky', 'Minority Report', 'Collateral', 'War of the Worlds'And if that's not enough running, you should watch him in this film, the latest installment of the 'Mission Impossible' franchise directed by J.J. Abrams where he plays the known agent Ethan Hunt and has to take care of another mission; he doesn't stop. J.J. Abrams is the creator of TV's top series 'Alias' and 'Lost', but it seems his creativity ends up just about there. He's the guy who has made watching television a cinematographic experience these last few years, but a TV series is TV in the end. Of course we don't want to accept the difference, because it looks amazing. Well, 'Mission Impossible III' also looks amazing; but it looks like TV.However, that's not really an important thing, because the difference between television and cinema is getting smaller by the day. The issue is that this last 'mission' doesn't work as a whole picture. It has happened that franchises are ruined after the first filmI'm just thinking 'Mission Impossible II' shouldn't have been made. Yes, John Woo directed it and the great Hans Zimmer put his own touch to the great Danny Elfman's iconic score.Now the prominent Michael Giacchino has given a new energy to the score and it sounds greatAnd so what? I wrote that this is the latest installment because you never know if there's going to be another one; and the truth is they could do it any day if they do it like this. It has come to the point that any excuse worth enough to generate fabulous action scenes serves as what we commonly know as a 'plot'. And there goes the rest; by this I mean Abrams and his writers' intelligence. The way I see it, this could have been a great mini-series of four chapters. It has four breathtaking action scenes and each one could have been the thrill of each one of the episodes. This is why movies run for two hours nowadays: because of the long eventful action scenes. We get those in television tooBut Cruise had to do it big time; on the big screen.How can the guy pull 'Collateral' and 'Minority Report' and then this? The latter ones are also action movies, and he runs, but he delivers good performances, unlike here. It is quite embarrassing to watch him confront Philip Seymour Hoffman, to whom all the credit goes for creating one of the most memorable villains in recent years. There's not a sign of something coming from a cartoon in his performance, which he builds with admirable composure. Beside him, Cruise looks like the robot Keanu Reeves is so used to play.I can't count the number of the underused actors found in the rest of the ensemble; you should watch it for yourselves. By the way, Ethan Hunt doesn't die, but you already knew that. I mean; what would 'Die Hard' be with a dead Bruce Willis?",5,0,0,18 June 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," There was a time...
","Paul McGuigan is an enormously talented man. His film before 'Lucky Number Slevin', 'Wicker Park' was jumping around in style and intensity; and in everything: performances, camera use, intelligent writing. These three things in special repeat themselves in 'Lucky Number Slevin', where McGuigan got some really professional actors that couldn't do much (Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci) and others that had a blast (Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis). But it's difficult to sit down and appreciate performances in this film; it goes faster than 'Wicker Park'.Again, the director brought Josh Hartnett for the main role, and again he puts the young actor in the wrong place at the wrong time. To say that 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a story about a guy in that situation above mentioned would be fair enough; because telling the rest is spoiling it for the viewer. At times, you can't take your eyes off of the screen, but there were moments where I honestly felt a little tired.It would be unfair to blame Jason Smilovic's script for this, but he throws a lot of things in and the movie is just above one hundred minutes. And I've been thinking if the movie would have been better with more detail and pauses so we could really understand and study the characters, but I say noBecause this is how McGuigan works, and here Peter Sova's cinematography and Andrew Hulme's edition are better than ever; with challenging close ups, imaginative shots, beautiful quick cuts and a solid use of flashbacks.The movie requires flashbacks because it's a mess, but it's a nice mess. An intelligent mess with avoidance (and also mocking) of the clichés all the way through, with intelligent movie references and an unexpected resolution you only see coming when you have to. Is it too intelligent for its own good? I really don't know, because it doesn't just put a lot of words and some action so we get distracted; it focuses completely on the words and conversations of the characters. Yes, we don't remember some characters and they're not really developed, but the script asks questions about things we've seen some minutes agoIt goes back on the story; it wants to know if we're really paying attention.I never stopped paying attention because of what I said before, because McGuigan's way of capturing a city's feeling, because of J. Ralph's exhilarating score and also because the actors' faces. Morgan Freeman's face demands attention and, believe it, also does Josh Hartnett's. Both of them take the film to high levels, while Bruce Willis makes a great narrator but a not so great player in person. In other words, it's his voice and not his face that demands attention.The good thing is that you want to see the movie again when it's over, because you feel like you've missed a lot; just like it happened to me with 'Wicker Park', which was a remakeThis is an original. The good thing is that you'll never forget about something called 'The Kansas City Shuffle'. The bad thing is that Paul McGuigan can make a great movie, but 'Lucky Number Slevin' is not it.",6,0,1,13 August 2007
3:10 to Yuma," The power of silence
","I don't know much about westerns, but I do know about emotion. I also don't know if it's because of James Mangold's gift to generate it or because its impeccable and flawless cast, but '3:10 to Yuma' has emotion to spare. Not every day silence touches deep inside in a world surrounded by gunshots and blood. The movie tells the story of outlaw Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) and his gang; and the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), the man who took him to the train that would send him to prison. Two men so different but somehow very much alike, two men full of secrets but also filled with honesty; one walking all by himself, another one with a family to support.Why did Mangold shoot this remake? I rather not ask him, and I haven't seen the original but I can understand. I can understand and appreciate the delicate work the director has taken under his hands; the calculation of beautiful close ups and long shots; the management of a perfect production design (Andrew Menzies); the quiet observation and the precise control of his actors.Talk about acting duos. If 'The Machinist' wasn't proof enough, Christian Bale's character study and commitment can be seen in several facets here: in the way he talks to his wife (Gretchen Mol), with care but with the silent suffering that what he has is not enough for her; how he talks to his son (better every day, Logan Lerman), with pride because he's almost a man but with preoccupation because he's still his kid. These are sad characters involved in desperate situations. Situations that lead to well-based confrontations that are well structured and that serve the storyNo gun here is shot without a purpose, write it down; and it fills me with joy. The other big star? Russell Crowe, whose look says everything. The most intense look I've witnessed since Leonardo DiCaprio's in 'The Departed'.It's a good screenplay, this one by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Hass, but it hasn't got many words. It takes an actor of complete mastery to transmit a thousand feelings through the look of an eye. Yes, it has been done millions of time and it's not so difficult; but this is a whole different context. It's a Western; Crowe plays an outlaw who is not allowed to show feelings and succeeds in staying that way. What he feels, you can see it in his look; if you sense it, you'll understand his great performance. Only a few times the main characters give long speeches; they are not so long and they explain who they are and the reason of their personalities. You have to pay attention, because you may get lost in the tension of the action. However, I think Mangold is very clever in managing the moments, supported by Marco Beltrami's best score yet, and with a performance by Ben Foster that shows he's between the best actors of his generation. There are things we say many times and they start to loose their true meanings, I want this to be true: 'Silence hurts; silence speaks'. Do an exercise and try to figure out what each character says to another when they look at him in silenceYou'll find plenty of those moments.",8,3,6,22 December 2007
The Longest Yard," Go Sandler!
","Adam Sandler is back in the game and we receive him with our arms wide open. With his pal Peter Segal's camera and a screenwriter named Robert Sheldon, he recreates the prison football movie 'The longest yard', riskily leaving his acting partners behind (not all of them, Rob Schneider gets a stupid cameo: he's not funny!) and gathering a whole new team that includes the heavy Chris Rock, the experienced Burt Reynolds and the rapper Nelly.The story, I believe, is quite the same as the original one, but probably with some updates here and there. Failed football star Paul Crewe (Sandler) gets drunk and in big troubles with the law. Ends up in prison where Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) likes football and wants him to train the inmates and play against the guards' semi-pro team led by the evil Captain Knauer (William Fichtner).Rock plays the black friend (why does that character always have to die?) Caretaker, Reynolds plays the pro Coach Nate Scarborough and those three will try to get their team complete, including the 'neighborhood', where fast guy Megget (skillfully played by Nelly) and partners reside. The rage every inmate has for the guards will make them play; with effort and dedication. The matter will grow wider, and the match will be televised by ESPN, and the team The team is the core of the film. It includes the extremely big and with problems for speaking Turley (Indian power lifter Dalip Singh), the supposedly not gay but not strong or talented Brucie (Nick Turturo), the enormous enough to kill you with a friendly hug Switowsky (Bob Sapp), the arrogant and strong Deacon (Michael Irvin), the Mc Donald's fan Cheeseburger Eddy ('White Chicks'' Terry Crews) and others.With them you experience the events, with them you sympathize, for them you want the best. Sandler finds himself in his best moment, telling the people he's still funny or even truer, that he never stopped being, and that he's doing Hollywood's best comedies (leaving 'Mr. Deeds' aside). Chris Rock provides all of the fun, but the loud way of speaking doesn't work the same in live flesh as in animation; and the racist commentaries tire a little bit.The pros; Reynolds sets himself in a type of role that suits him perfectly and could help him during the last phase of his late career, if he doesn't wan to take risks. And Cromwell manages to look very young and to keep us entertained as he uses a very monotone and serious tone of voice throughout the entire ride. While not a pro, William Fichtner also highlights as the bastard Knauer.Unexpectedly, Peter Segal is at his best making his piece look beautiful, at least, for what a prison declares. Also unexpectedly, MTV Films and Sandler's Happy Madison company, dedicatedly make us happy (without the need of any female pressence...), as they accomplish another one of those good contemporary comedies.",7,2,3,15 December 2005
Finding Neverland," Believe
","I believe in many things, truly, because believing is one of those obligatory terms of life. If you don't believe in something, it would be having no reason to be alive.That said, believing is maybe the main message of this film. In many moments, when we're watching it, maybe we can realize how simple it is, just because there's nothing totally outstanding about it, visually. But its story, is just one of those that carry you all along, no matter what. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this one, in fact, it shows adults some things also.The characters in this film are as warm and natural as possible. You know what happens here is no fantasy, it is reality. You could easily see this events any day in your ordinary life. These kids meet the man and they just can't let him go. And the greatest thing, it's that it could be because of them, but mainly it is because of him. This is a man who has so much inside waiting to let go and show, and he has found the people to reveal these things.Then there is acting. Johnny Depp is a genius, in everything he's ever done. He knows just, no the right, but the only notes, for the specific moments in this film, and in many others. How does he do it? Well, I don't mind to know if he continues to show magic every time he's on screen. Here he has given another performance of those he can only give. Freddie Highmore reaches some moving extremes, handling them very well, becoming the revelation of the young cast. And Kate Winslet is wonderful.There's just a lot of things that make this movie what it is. You just go and see it for yourselves and let go imagination to those sometimes unreachable places.But you have to believe...",9,6,7,7 February 2005
Two for the Money," In search of inspiration
","'Two for the money' is a film with a plot line with seen lots of times: a hot shot gets a big chance for doing what he does best; he meets a mentor that could play him or not; things could go incredibly right or terribly wrong...However, it's set in a different environment; and one we're not used to be around: the sports gambling business.Mathew McConaughey gets inside the skin of a man who, in real life, got the opportunity of a lifetime and then had to deal with a world he didn't rule. Brandon Link is the name of the real man and the last name was changed to Lang for the movie. McConaughey seems very comfortable with his role as he goes from one place and one accent to another and controls the various emotions the film presents with confidence.The picture has its ups and downs; its heavy and full of adrenaline moments, its quiet and well constructed parts and its dramatic instants where everything appears to be falling apart. I'm talking about the story anyway, which, for a movie of this type, exceeds the expectations. Screenwriter Dan Gilroy met McConaughey's character in real life and heard his tale and decided to write a screenplay about it. With a lot of knowledge of the business and the language, Gilroy's script is an element in favor of the film's consistency.An entertainment picture like 'Two for the money' can loose its rhythm inevitably, but for more than two hours it keeps up, mostly because of the screenplay and the performances of the main cast (Renne Russo is formidable in her best portrayal since 'The Thomas Crown Affair'), but also because D.J. Carusso's intelligence in the decision of not showing a lot of groove with his camera and keeping it neat (editor Glen Scantlebury deserves credit for the latter one).Whoever brought Al Pacino for the ride also has to be congratulated. I have a thing with Pacino I can't quite explain. The man is a theater actor; he comes from the stage. I've seen a lot of his work: some of it has left me speechless ('Carlito's Way', 'Scent of a Woman', 'The Insider', 'Heat'), some of it has been just fine ('The Devil's Advocate', 'Frankie and Johnny'); but during this decade it has appeared to me as very similar.With a bit of screaming, long beards and a position of experience, Pacino's characters seem to express a desire of his to portray people at the top of their game but at the bottom of their life. His detective in 'Insomnia', his press agent in 'People I Know', his director in 'Sim0ne'; they are all the best at what they do but show some important weakness as persons and look tired and, even more noticeable, near the end of their existence.Although, as I watched 'Two for the money', I found (during specific frames) some unique expressions coming from Pacino: challenging looks and glimpses that are inspiring and make me wonderHow inspired must have Mathew McConaughey felt having Pacino by his side as his mentor during this film, or Colin Farrell for that matter, having him in the same position during 'The Recruit'?",7,1,2,1 October 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Among family is better
","The Judd Apatow produced 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is one of the latest examples of a comedy form in American cinema that hopefully still has some things to show us. It's also a movie made in family, in which you feel everyone had a really good time and worked really hard so you could laugh out loud; and don't forget, the work of people that have respect for each other and their talents.Some time ago, the humble Apatow directed a script co-written by him and Steve Carell; 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', and gave Carell the lead role. He had already worked with him in 'Anchorman', which is not another story because both movies share, among other things, cast members. Then came 'Knocked Up', an opportunity for Seth Rogen to steal the show; then Rogen wrote the script of 'Superbad' and was also part of the cast; then Jason Segel (just Jason in 'Knocked Up') wrote a script, which ended up in the film I'm reviewing, directed by another writer, Nicholas Stoller.Essentially, everything here is about the script. What the script requires, the movie will deliver. After we meet Peter (Segel), naked, being dumped by the super famous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) and we hear him cry, we also want what his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hader, from 'Superbad'-and 'Knocked Up'-) recommends for him: a vacation.In Hawaii everything looks more colorful, and I don't know if Segel knows much about the culture and the people there, but the way the script puts it, the beach and the hotel where Peter ends up seem to be paradise; specially when a beautiful woman (Mila Kunis) salutes you at the reception. But is it paradise if your ex-girlfriend is staying there with her new guy (a British rockstar wonderfully overplayed by Russel Brand)? I don't need to tell you how funny this movie is because you should know already for the people who made it, although I'll tell you how they admirably work to make it funny. They save us discussions and dialogs about the couple breaking up by going directly to the point; they provide us a vacation with plenty of characters to meet and supply each one of them with a killer line that is not repeated later (smartly, thankfully) for a greater effect-there's only character played by Jack McBrayer that has an inevitably continued joke-; they even make sure we know some of the people we meet (Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill get us an instant smile when we meet them and we feel that we are safe among friends).Segel's screenplay is hard work, developing one character that shares the 'Apatow sindrome' (not to good looking but scoring a strikingly good-looking girl, not getting out of home, few friends, tenderly-or not-addicted to sex) but somehow strikes as different. Segel's writing and his performance make us see a sensitive and committed guy in the way Peter speaks but don't forget to show us the flashbacks of a relationship that most of the time made him look stupid (anything for the sake of a good laugh). The script also dominates the shape of the modern romantic comedy, with its typical structure, adding some elegant personal touches that are all of Segel's merit.The film is not better than others like 'Knocked Up' because in the whole development of Peter, the movie forgets about the rest of the characters and loses a bit of the Apatow humanity. The women are not fully developed (in fact, the Sarah Marshall of the title seems like a heartless doll, which is in part the point) and there's a lot of the friendship factor, values and talks missing.It's all good though, because the honesty is still there, and because the movie runs too long again and we don't complain (thank you Jason Bateman there in the credits). We just keep laughing.",7,0,3,3 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Disney...Dream World!
","I was talking to a friend today, about Disney's Theme Parks. About how beautiful they are and about how everything feels like a dream when you visit them. I think it's almost the same with Disney's films: the sensation that everything is a long colorful dream or, and I don't say it to underestimate the films' quality; a long and entertaining Disney ride. In 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', as in 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', you realize that every scene is done in an arranged set, where, sooner or later, every element present, will become something useful for the scene's development; because it is all carefully thought before. Whether the element will work as something that will explode or fall down it doesn't matter; the point is that everything is alive. With this lively environment, 'Dead Man's Chest' takes Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow and his crew into the sea again. This time there is now Geoffrey Rush, but a new villain called Davy Jones, played wonderfully by Bill Nighy. The storyline follows the events of the first movie but what's slightly negative is that you will not understand everything correctly if you haven't seen 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'.The 'Pirate's' writers give too much credit to their audience (and I wonder why they shouldn't, 'Pirates' being such a high-grossing film), expecting them to keep up immediately. This, for the general public is problematic, because usually sequels find a way for the viewer to understand what has happened before, in case they weren't able to watch the first installment. It doesn't occur that way in 'Dead Man's Chest', but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.Personally, I find the writer's decision risky and I like it so I don't mind; mainly, because the script is so well written and the connections with the first picture are intelligently placed in it. This trilogy has been blessed with incredible writers, capable of generating humor, adventure and drama not only for the children, also for the adults. This is worth analyzing: Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the writers, are responsible for 'Shrek', the best Dreamworks' computer animated film and one that finds the balance between kids and grown ups, with something for each. They're responsible for 'The Road to El Dorado', one of my favorite animated films and Dreamwork's best film in 2-D animation. Finally, they crafted the script of 'The Treasure Planet', one of the few good Disney animated films after the change of working team; where they also found the balance I mentioned above. The trilogy has also been blessed with incredible actors. Johnny Depp reprising the one and only Captain Sparrow, disappearing in the role and owning the film as is his custom. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth comes back and, although not as important as in the first movie, she makes the character look more real, with fewer make up and more dirt in her face; showing that she's not a 'princess' and that she is a woman with determination; I'm looking forward to the final growth of Knightley's character. And Orlando Bloom, maybe not as incredible at the rest, but accompanied by an incredible cast.Lastly, the trilogy is been blessed with a gifted director: Gore Verbinsky; who was chosen for the franchise after having made only a couple of films. Completely different in genre, the comedy 'Mousehunt' and the horror remake 'The Ring' were both equally complex to direct. Verbinsky took the risk and didn't fail Bruckheimer with 'Pirates'. He's also widened his versatility by directing the arty 'The Weather Man'. Going back to my main point, you can take 'Dead Man's Chest' as a long colorful dream or a long and entertaining Disney ride. Whatever the case, one thing is certain; it is entertainment for all the family. Oh, I almost forgot: Hans Zimmer is a genius.",7,0,2,15 May 2007
Hostel," Late...Too Late
","I've been looking for an excuse so I didn't have to write about this film, but I couldn't find it yet. So if this doesn't say much if because there is not much to say about 'Hostel', Eli Roth's last cinematographic project. Frankly, the movie is awful. You know when they say you should get a lot with little? Eli Roth got it, but he got a lot of the wrong elements and little of the good ones.Part of this horror 'renaissance', 'Hostel' presents a small amount of characters in a maximum of two important environments. It's a matter of short time before the characters arrive to this so called hostel and they live the most terrifying experiences of their lives.Unlike Neil Marshall and his 'The Descent', characters here are not developed or even detailed; Roth doesn't seem to need that for the development of the picture. Josh and Paxton are two friends who just want some good pot and some good sex with some beautiful girls, nothing else, and they are portrayed by Derek Richardson and Jay Hernandez with more conviction than the bad movie deserves (mostly by Hernandez).So we also find the enigmatic and weird characters that are not just common people in a film like this one. We find the receptionist in the hotel who doesn't even speak or answer questions. Then what we find is just what has to happen so we can at least see something of content in the picture.What happens, I could say, is not plenty but it's enough. You get to a point, sometimes when you're watching a movie, where you don't know how you got to watch it until that point; because you know that you're not watching anything. 'Hostel' may be appealing for the horror fans because it respects horror and gives horror what it needs. And I understand that.The part I couldn't understand has to do with the plot, and I don't know if the fans care about that. Let's just say that Eli Roth has an amazing eye for the genre but a regular eye for storytelling. His camera moves expertly and explores without limits, but his scripts doesn't make a move. When the main explanation arrives to our eyes and ears, it's so pointless that it becomes funny.We accept it as it comes, but the explanation is followed by a last scene that is actually terrific and a minimum reason to watch the piece. However, the power of this scene and the impression it generates, comes too late to compensate the other stuff.What else can I say? Well, just don't bother.",5,0,1,25 May 2006
The Notebook," Now is the time to say it: All you need is love
","I was, when I saw it some weeks ago, and still am amazed with this movie. I'm talking about one of the best romantic movies I've ever seen. The romantic movies that combine that passionate loved with drama and a perfect chemistry between the leads.My God! Rachel McAdams looked gorgeous in this picture; that's one thing that had to be said. Her performance was also great, for the kind of character she was playing (I'm saying this because of the other characters she has played; superficial sometimes). She can actually act, and this role is going to give her the opportunity to grow, although it was not recognized. I'm not saying it was overlooked, but it was impossible. Ryan Gosling got the performance of his life as Noah. He has chosen interesting roles in the past, but didn't have the chance to shine. Every move he makes here is perfect; his performance is flawless (although, as McAdams, impossible to be recognized). His way of talking remind me of Sylvester Stallone, when he played Rocky in the first film of the anthology; a little bit rough and dumb, but the perfect sum for a person in love. Anyway, the movie depended on the chemistry between the two young actors, and they didn't disappoint at all.The pros, Garner and Rowlands, have the same chemistry Gosling and McAdams have, only that they are older. Garner has been recognized with the Screen Actors Guild, for his whole career, and with his performance as Duke, he closes a cycle of an entire career. Rowlands seems pleased to be working with his son; who must admire her for everything she has done. Her work is remarkable, as Nick's. I heard Cassavetes directed this film because he wanted to. He hasn't got a great career as a director, but he knows what he's doing. He knows how to create the environment, for the whole movie, and for each frame in it. I saw him watching the actors from close, in each scene. He wants to watch everything; direct but also make the actors feel comfortable and sure of what they are doing. It shows.'The Notebook' is actually a novel. And if it wasn't because of Nicholas Sparks' hands and inspiration (when he wrote his first novel), this film wouldn't exist. How romantic a story can be when it starts with the paragraph that says more or less like this: 'I'm a common man. There are no monuments dedicated to me and soon my name will be forgotten; but in one way, I have succeeded as any other being in this world: I have loved another person with all my heart'. The answer you'll find it watching 'The notebook'. The movie has many beautiful and moving scenes; sometimes, you know what is going to happen although you don't want that to happen. But those are the scenes you will see, and enjoy as I did.I don't know if this has been said, but I had to put it. The rain is falling down, and Allie (McAdams), says angrily to Noah (Gosling): 'Why did you end it? Why was it over?'. 'It was not over', he answers with tears in his eyes. 'And it still isn't over'.And it will never be.",9,1,1,31 March 2005
Madagascar," Dreamworks' fall...
","A friend of mine told me she went into 'Madagascar' expecting something like 'Shrek'. It comes from the same studio, Dreamworks, which has grown over the years. They had a solid start producing films as the beautiful 'Antz' in computer animation, and excellent wonders as 'The Road to El Dorado' in 2D. Then came 'Shrek', their Oscar and it went all above their head over the last three years, where the best animated film they achieved was 'Spirit'.I don't know exactly what it was, but their animated characters started looking like the stars who recorded their voices and those stars' names where all over the poster, kind of with 'Shark Tale', or this film 'Madagascar'. It is a good opportunity for actors to display their voice talents (although some of them have them and others don't), but it is not as funny as 'Shrek 2'. It is not as original, and the irony and sarcasm that represented the other films is now gone.There is not even a sign of the peculiar things; it is all very predictable and the quirkiest characters are penguins (very funny penguins though). When I first heard of the film in Dreamworks web site, it looked wild; now I know it only pretended to be that.It is a shame one of the film's directors is the one who directed 'Antz', and what's most shameful is that the main character is voiced by the least talented of the cast in the matter (comedian Ben Stiller). Chris Rock steals the show and seems to be the only one having fun. Jada Pinkett Smith proves, once more, she is very talented, and David Schwimmer delivers a charismatic voice style to the giraffe Melman.The script is lame, as are the emotive sequences. However, there are some visual sceneries that show that there is still some creativity in the company. I hope the best for the company's next project, and I don't know just what more to say than: 'I like to move it move it, I like to move it move it, I like to move it move it, I like toMove it!'",6,0,0,1 September 2005
The Secret in Their Eyes," The secret of Juan José
","In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we're going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country's past, a love story. And technically, if it's the highest order, there won't be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.'El secreto de sus ojos' tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. 'You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love', Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.There are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the film's most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in 'El mismo amor, la misma lluvia'; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in 'El mismo amor...' it was a magazine staff, in 'Luna de Avellaneda' the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year's best performances. That's about everything we can expect. The fact is 'El secreto de sus ojos' is a very good movie because there are things we don't see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn't been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handy-cam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world- must be seen fully. It's quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with 'La señal'. Even though it's obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesn't take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan's 'The Prestige'. It's quoting it somehow, at least.It's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We've seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. I'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: it's enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in 'El mismo amor...'), but at the same time moving, simply because they're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I've mentioned.The fact that Fernando Castets didn't write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this film-making of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. It's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director's previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces.",9,237,281,15 August 2009
Black Book," Is war beautiful?
","Welcome to Paul Verhoeven's 'Black Book'; a world of beautiful film-making and storytelling. Beautiful film-making because everything looks like out of a painting: everyone's perfectly dressed even when they're not wearing nice clothes (even the poor look nice), every scenery seems unique and specifically designed for each scene. Beautiful storytelling because what happens in the film is very well told and the words are the right ones. However, all of this beautifulness suddenly seems so painful if I tell you what the story is about.Inspired by true events of World War II, Verhoeven's script (written alongside Gerard Soeteman) introduces to Rachel (Carice Van Houten), a beautiful Dutch Jewish woman who will later be known as Ellis de Vries because she will risk her life by infiltrating the Nazi headquarters office and seducing Chief Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch, from 'The Lives of Others'); all for the support of the Dutch Resistance and the people who saved her life. This is a movie, because what you've just read-the way I described it, at least- is the kind of thing that occurs in a picture. Well, in this particular picture characters also like to reference other pictures and their stars (Jean Harlow, Greta Garbo). In my opinion, the contrast of everything looking perfect while there's a war going on is one of the things that makes 'Black Book' a very special experience. The film takes us places; not only to those places and sceneries that invade the screen but to places beyond, like the place I like to call 'forbidden love', or 'silent suffering' or even 'unexpected friendship'. Yes, 'Black Book' is not another movie about the war. The war will always be here (as it can be appreciated near the ending), and Verhoeven uses this specific war as a background to give us, firstly; the look of that period and era, secondly; a tremendous spectacle in which things don't need to blow up all the time. A spectacle that involves drama, action, suspense and the human relationships I mentioned above. There's suspense in the way characters come up with rescue plans we normally see in the best crime movies; action in how these plans turn out, usually not well; human relationships in a romance that grows without us having to completely witness it and a friendship that emerges from need but solidifies with time. You have to pay attention, because it may be a perfectly looking world, but that doesn't mean the plot will be perfectly served for your comprehension.I forgot to mention drama, which we can find in all the performances, starting from Van Houten, whose performance isn't great because of the pain she expresses out loud but because of the pain she lets us feel in her soft and troubled face. I'm talking about a pain built on expression, in a character that uses words as a shield. Koch delivers a fine performance, and so does Halina Reijn as Ellis/Rachel's friend. This is just to mention a few names, because every performance is astounding and every scene works carefully to detail the personalities of characters I haven't mentioned yet and won't mention at all. Maybe there are scenes that don't serve the development of the film and that Verhoeven could have done without. But these are just a few, and don't change the fact that 'Black Book' is a triumphant film by a director who knows how to entertain without having to worry so much about realism; and by this I hope you don't assume I'm saying the movie is not realistic at all. But it's entirely true what they say sometimesthat it's enough with a good story.",8,2,4,22 October 2008
127 Hours," Honest inspiration
","'If I believethere's more than this', sings Dido, that forgotten British lady who gave us great hits and beautiful songs such as 'White Flag' and 'Here With me'. She always had a lovely voice, but these words she's singing in the name of Aron Ralston, the man who got his hand caught in a huge rock while climbing in the John Blue Canyon in Utah. We know who Aron is in a heartbeat; that is, James Franco defines the character in a couple of scenes. This he does not by speaking, but by actions: singing freely, running wild. Aron meets two girls and they sense he could be from another galaxy. He cares about nothing, he has not another person in mind and what he needs and loves is in front of him: big mountains.That's also what Danny Boyle needs. The mountains and James Franco are sufficient elements to make a whole movie. On the other hand, I think that by now we can agree that Boyle (alongside writer Simon Beaufoy) loves to inspire these days. That's what 'Slumdog Millonaire' was and what '127 hours' is: inspiring (and inspired –I might say this a lot, but it's true-) filmmaking. If the previous film was about impossible love and rising above the circumstances to achieve the impossible, this new tale is the same thing, without the 'love' factor. That is the factor that allowed Boyle to tell 'Slumdog' as a fable, with hopeful music, bright colors and beautiful little things (or moments) in the ugliest places. For those who thought this was an erroneous decision, disrespectful towards a country's reality, '127 hours' arrives to prove them wrong.There's no embellishment here. No other color than James Franco's pale face and the red blood that comes out of his trapped arm. As real as a man who struggles for his life, with no water and food, begging for some sunlight and the response of a raven, the tale –while never losing track of its tragic center, that Boyle and the master Anthony Dod Mantle try to represent through various 'desperate' shots, like Aron's tongue seen from the inside of a bottle of water and other camera and mise-en-scene resolutions- takes flight through imagination.In Aron's situation, in which he tries to rise above the impossible as he thinks about who he is and what he's done in life (painfully- 'every moment since the day I was born has brought me to this rock', he whispers-), imagination can be nothing but poetic (it's hard to accept it, but poetry in cinema –visual, narrative poetry- can be boring, really boring –not always-. Boyle makes it inspiring. I started with that statement so I'll try to get back to it). Aron searches for moments in the past, he envisions people in the dark and meticulously reconstructs a near future. Poetic means inexistent piano melodies in the air, or a beautiful woman saying an 'I love you' that no one can hear. Some of the things he experiences are otherworldly.The most recent movies about characters alone with the world were Sean Penn's 'Into the wild' and Rodrigo Cortes' 'Buried'. The first movie is about a boy who has lived a lie and decides to find truth in standing alone in front of Mother Earth. His personal story has affected him, and before he's completely by himself, he changes (willingly or not; it doesn't matter, it just happens) the lives of the people he meets. Chris (or Alexander Supertramp) has an ideology and talks a lot about it, but it's not the most consistent element of the movie. In 'Buried', ideology is everything, powered by a great original idea. A man is trapped in a coffin, underground, and as he tries to survive (there are some good 'survival' sequences), every line of dialogue is spoken to criticize the government. There's no personal story whatsoever, only daggers thrown at the policies towards hostages in foreign land.Let's recapitulate, because I want to get to the transparent inspiration that lies in the story of '127 Hours'. In 'Into the wild', Supertramp ends up alone in Alaska by personal choice. You can be inspired by several reasons that can be found in the journey of the film (a road trip in the end), even more if you believe in the character's ideas. In 'Buried', the main character is captured on purpose. You can be inspired if you support his political ideas, his will to get out of that coffin or his family waiting at home? There's not real inspiration there.In '127 Hours', however, Aron being trapped is not planned (this is all the more surprising), but as he goes back on who he is, at some point he even believes it was not an accident. It's that idea what's inspiring. Aron spends 127 hours revising these thoughts. He rediscovers himself as a person and we get to know him as a man who wants to overcome the impossible. What's even more purely inspiring, besides the fact that Boyle fractures the screen and races through the scenery in order to make this introspective journey more exciting (as only himself can); besides the fact that the director has found in A.R Rahman the perfect partner to tell stories that cannot live without music (now without HIS music); and besides the fact that James Franco takes on the role as if it was his own life on the screen; is that unlike a lot of these kinds of movies, Aron does what he does not to prove a point, or to set an example, or because he stands for something. He does it for himself because he wants to. In those hours, he somehow realizes he has to do it. Wellthat's when nothing can stop you.",8,0,3,28 February 2011
"I Love You, Man"," To laugh...
","Here's a comedy that, undeniably and more than something like 'Role Models', contains many elements of Judd Apatow's cinema. It's something that has to be said when you see a cast led by Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, a script that is based on the idea of male friendship and one or two characters who suffer of what I once called –actually, probably everyone did- the 'Apatow Syndrome'. However, it has nothing to do with Apatow and, as in 'Role Models', there are some differences to be found and in these differences 'I love you, Man' emerges like a good comedy. It's another thing altogether to say that it's a good movie.What the film carries (we could say 'drags' too) from Apatow is a certain familiarity of ideas. The script by director John Hamburg and Larry Levin centers on Peter Klaven, a lonely man who's about to marry Zooey. The thing is that Zooey and her girlfriends are worried about the fact that Peter doesn't have any friends. It's fair to stop and to say that the Peter character is played by Paul Rudd, in what's an extension of the role established in 'Knocked Up' and slightly modified by David Wain in 'Role Models': a laid-back man, not very sociable, dedicated to his wife and work, not sure of who his truly friends are. It's a role Rudd plays beautifully; by heart, yes, but it's brilliant. The fact that he meets Sydney and that he turns to be this lovable, sensitive, musical, honest, charming, hippie man played by Jason Segel takes us inevitably back to the character Segel played in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. Why wouldn't someone become a friend of Sydney? He's cool and he plays the guitar.Anyway, the thing is that Sydney starts gaining importance in Peter's life and this drives Peter and Zooey apartAnd they're getting married in two weeks. There's not much more than that as far as the plot goes, and you know how it ends. So, I don't know if Hamburg was trying to pay Apatow tribute or what. His last directing credit is 'Along Came Polly', a film which is far from Apatow land. But the truth is that, at the end of the day, 'I love you, Man' is not more Apatow than the things I've mentioned, and Hamburg makes a rare comedy of it by taking some chancesNot without being sentimental, of course.You see, Apatow's first idea of cinema was one of a non-stop comedy (you can watch 'Anchorman' any time) that slowly evolved into a more complex, dramatic line –probably the result of his own personal life- that, as a director, reached its peak in 'Knocked Up'. An idea of more developed characters, a detailed treatment of male bonding (friendship, yes), a particular interest in husband/wife relationship and a sometimes excessive sentimentalism recently concluded in complete failure: 'Funny People'. But what we shouldn't forget is that, no matter how and when, Apatow was always looking for comedy, and we could laugh with his films. Well, 'Funny People' is not funny.All the elements of a modern American comedy can sometimes confuse the viewer or even a director. The good news is that Hamburg knows what he wants his picture to be: a comedy, just a comedy. He plays his cards there and because he does it with balls he succeeds. The romantic elements are very few, the sentimentalism is there, but more as an excuse than ever before during this decade. Meanwhile, the friendship thing is natural and real, but not revealing, as in introducing a new light to the matter.Where 'I love you, Man' has its heart is in the comedy. A comedy that consists in putting the right characters in the right place at the right time so they can say the right things to make us laugh. This sounds redundant, but it has to because it has to be noted that it is planned: the casting is perfect (the two leads of course, and supporting characters by Jon Favreau and Jamie Pressly leading the game; with a nice appearance by Thomas Lennon) and the camera is not too risky so the actors can do what they have to.But it's not that simple, because the planning includes the complexity of characters, and that's precisely why the actors need to be perfect. Say what you want, but there's not a comic line in the film that doesn't com from one of the characters' sheer nature. The rare quality of 'I love you, Man' has to do with the fact that everything that makes us laugh truly seems like something a character, male or female, would say. That character, in that place, at that time. It's basic stuff, but it's rarely seen in a genre that depends, desperately, on moments that are simply there for the sake of a laugh. Here, in a film with not a lot of music, in a film that could be categorized at times of 'quiet comedy', we believe what people say. And of course, we laugh.",7,2,3,8 February 2010
Ed Wood," Peliculón: Round 3
","At these stakes it was four in the morning and energy was running out. Gian was falling asleep, one of the reasons why he wasn't paying that much attention; he had had some tough days. On the other hand, I was tired too, but with the disposition to watch Depp's magic.Quickly, Depp it's not the best element of the film, but achieves an uplifting performance, with smiles of his own and respect to his director, who directed him some time before in one of his career's best performances, as another Ed; in the fantastic 'Edward Scissorhands'.It is Martin Landau's show however, who studied his character to the end of the line, just to play it perfectly. It's hard that the movie gets laughs because of its fidelity with its characters' reality, but in short amount of time we understand that it was like that. We understand that Ed Wood was an awful director, writer, producer and actor, when he admired Orson Welles and wanted to be like him.Bela Lugosi was Wood's friend indeed, and worked as a star in the horrible films this movie shows. The people that worked with him (with Ed), a bunch of useless;the well known, the show business persons: they were all real. And Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski don't have to write about it, so it's like that how we can laugh.Tim Burton, at that moment of his career, known as Gotham City's 'creator', and a gifted man with the camera, was surely the right man for this job. He brought the correct cast, the correct crew (without Danny Elfman, who was replaced by Howard Shore's unfamiliar score) and I can't imagine the film in other hands. It wouldn't even be that good.Although the opening credits showed the director's ego at that time, due to the exclusion (in the credits) of actors that were important because of their characters, replacing them for important name that appear less than a minute in the film. Beside all this, when you see a Tim Burton piece, you know you won't be disappointed visually. It's amazing; even in black and white.",7,2,2,27 July 2005
Juno," Not to miss...
","To begin with, I want to put things on the table with the comparisons. Because this decade, we've experienced cases like 'Juno'; films that grow with time and suddenly are Best Picture contenders for the Academy Awards. Well, 'Juno' is better than 'Little Miss Sunshine' and much better than 'Sideways'; it surpasses the latter one on comedic and dramatic levels and, although it doesn't have 'Sunshine's' dramatic power, it features a more prominent collection of scenes and it has a script that's impossible to beat. I don't want to underestimate director Jason Reitman's delicate and inspiring job, but you can't deny there's something about Diablo Cody's first work that lies beyond explanation. If this writing seems more formal than usual, it's because Cody wrote the main character's lines with a noticeable level of superiority that is at the same time contradictory. Because Juno (Ellen Page) appears to know it all with the level of vocabulary I'm talking about, however when she gets pregnant she doesn't know what to do. And that's not all. Sixteen-year-old girls call their friends 'dude'-or at least Juno is one of them-and she has her fair share of code words that even the wisest teenager in the room may have trouble understanding; not to mention the fact that she listens to really heavy rock music and she dresses almost like guy. Yes, she's a freak, but not with the glasses and the weird dresses she describes in one of the film's many funny scenes (Cody's wonderful script includes a non-traditional form of narration by Juno that works perfectly); she's very pretty.When she discusses the reason of her pregnancy with her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), she mentions who the father is and makes obvious that she feels something for him. If you know comedy and romance, you will expect a certain number of exact, by heart phrases that the best friend would use in that moment. She uses none of them, and it's beautiful. So when we 'meet' the father in another great scene, we fully understand that Juno is 'special'. Special as a couple; Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman in two fantastically unexpected portrayals) think she is, when they meet her because she wants to 'give' them her baby. That scene, how Juno constantly refers to the baby as 'the thing'; how she ends up playing the guitar with Mark; the rest of the scenes she shares with him in which, among other things, she tells him he's a big 'sellout'; and my favorite moment of the film are pieces of a well-rounded, multidimensional character we are not used to see in a comedy.And Ellen Page? She hands in a masterclass; a bliss of understanding of character and of sheer honesty, a better performance than Julie Christie's in 'Away From Her'. She has that light; the light of a true talent; the light I saw when I first watched Winona Ryder in 'Reality Bites' and made me want to watch all of her films (I have almost completed the task). And of course Page also has that look; the look that says 'this is no game'. When it comes to performance, this movie is hers and nobody else's. And I haven't even mentioned the scene where she gives his father and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney), and how they react and the advices they give here in that moment and in so many others; or the multiple film references in Cody's script and the fact that it has clearly remained untouched. I really want to detail many scenes, but instead I'll just tell you which one's my favorite (there's plenty to choose), so you can pay attention: the moment near the end where one character's running and Juno walks to himThat moment, that scene. It has been said, but the unchangeable truth is Reitman and Cody do something many movies try unsuccessfully these days: aim directly at the heartThey don't miss. I hope I said all I had to say.",9,2,8,15 February 2008
L.A. Confidential," '...And very hush-hush!'
","Among other things, what most amazes me about 'L.A. Confidential' is that the film is just as relevant today as it was ten years ago. I don't know if the filmmaker's objective was to make a statement, but the piece, set in the 50's makes one that still bothers people everyday: the lack of justice in this unfair world. It does it with some clichéd moments and with the necessary amount of action; but with an intelligence uncommonly used these days.'You have to think while watching this film', my friend Matias said to me; angry, stopping me every time I said something. Actually, you don't really have to pay close attention during 'L.A. Confidential', because it's such a kind film that it expertly explains everything in a couple of crucial moments; but if you choose to follow it step by step, it will be a tough ride for you, viewer.David Fincher's 'Zodiac' premiered this year and it is, ten years later, a classy version of Curtis Hanson's violent and rough way of presenting his film. Yes, it's not the same story and Fincher's movie is set in San Francisco, but what 'L.A. Confidential' essentially shares with it is the genre connection (besides the closeness in periods of time). If you watch 'Zodiac' and afterwards 'L.A. Confidential', you'll notice the elegance of the first and the less careful conditions of the second; where the streets are predominant and the rules don't matter so much.Only one guy follows them closely. He is Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), an ascending policeman who plays it by the book and would even tolerate the rejection of his colleagues to get where he wants. Bud White (Russel Crowe) is the opposite, with 'brutality' as a second name and a weakness for abused women; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) stands in the middle, resolving cases but getting paid for it by a reporter (Danny DeVito) who wants to be the first to know every scoop; in a time where fifty dollars meant a lot of money.These three men (with names presented in big letters and that we never forget) are tangled up together in the resolution of a case in which nothing is what it seems. Of course that the men as I sort of stereotypically describe them, are not what they seem either; as almost everything in this Los Angeles where you 'can't live if you're born without wings'. This phrases and other are found in Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's beautiful screenplay, based on the novel by James Ellroy.I think what makes 'L.A. Confidential' such an effective movie in the way that you are filled with adrenaline and excitement can be explained in two parts. The first one: the combination between Helgeland, one of the most talented and versatile writers of contemporary cinema; and Hanson, a versatile director who's proved to be committed with every kind of genre. This decade, he's made a real-life tale ('Wonder Boys'), a family story ('In her Shoes'), a music underdog tale with rapper Eminen ('8 Mile') and a rom-com ('Lucky You'). The first three are very good pieces, the fourth I still have to watch it. This combination of versatility paved a way for something original and fresh.We don't get movies like 'L.A. Confidential' today. At least not in that genre, with that intelligence and with those performancesThe character actor Kevin Spacey; so convincing, so powerful and relaxed, so intense, so himself. Would you pay attention to his face? Please, it's unique. Guy Pearce, also so full of character and unique as well; and Russell Crowe, I haven't written about him but he's great and I'll write more when I write about 'Gladiator' someday.There are some more actors that I haven't mentioned, but I believe pleasure in cinema arrives when you watch things you don't previously know or expectTry to make of 'L.A. Confidential' one of those movies, because it was for me; and it was great.",9,1,2,17 September 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," The feelings that betray us...
","We just get more and more disaster movies each year. Actually we don't give a damn about less than the half of them, but from time to time, a super production costing millions and we got to see it. Last year, 'The Day After Tomorrow' was that super production.These movies don't get as wild as this one. German director Roland Emmerich makes a big effort to improve his style each time he makes a new movie. The movies he directs are not always potentially prepared to be 'art', but the man takes the job too seriously, and you can tell the movies are 'his'; even when he doesn't write them. He commits completely and achieves visual levels beyond imagination. He takes care of little details, like not showing some computer animated wolves closely, so they look as real as possible.Regretfully, I haven't seen any good movie under his direction. I never finished watching 'The Patriot', though; and I was loving it. And yes, Emmerich's specialty is 'disaster' films. There's a big dilemma with disaster films, because they try untiringly to mix action and, well, disaster, with emotion. I has worked for me with 'Daylight', a movie that was for me a before and after disaster films (as one of Sylvester Stallone best performances). Why? Simply because its only cliché was the 'disaster'; and that's for me the best compliment you can give a movie of this type.Other recent 'disaster' film was 'Deep Impact'; and I admit I tended to laugh in the most dramatic moments of the film; because I couldn't feel for the one-dimensional character and I preferred them to die than to listen to them saying melodramatic shits in their final moments.Now the thing is; Roland Emmerich may know a lot about disaster, but knows nothing about drama. As he has probably done before, he checks the book of clichés so he can provide some substance in what he does worse. What we get from him in this occasion is one weak father-son relationship, with separated marriages, a father that works constantly and doesn't have time for his son. Yet, when he father arrives late or forgets things, the boy forgives himThe boy loves him, and loves a girl, and has a friendAnd the three of them go to New York for a contest, but Jack is working with professor Rapson and discovers the new Ice Age is coming (and you know how it goes from that) In another ensemble cast with the stars of the moment, the father is called Jack Hall, and is played by Dennis Quaid; who has been climbing to the top since 'The Rookie'. I've heard he has been doing the same for a long time (although I was shocked by his performance in 'Far From Heaven'), but even in his clichéd character with hero moments, he passes the acting test. The mother's name is Lucy, and Sela Ward gives her agility and emotion. Professor Rapson is in Ian Holm's skin, and Holm is bored; looking for money maybe.The son is called Sam Hall, in the skin of Jake Gyllenhaal, coming as the best element of the film; with a lot of personality and charm to a role that as easy as the one he had. It's another big step in his short career. The girl, Laura, it's played by Emmy Rossum. She looks gorgeous and very natural. They are the ones that will stay with a bunch of other, few people (the 'Survivors'), as the victims with no way out, and Sam's responsibility according to script is not more than saving them. Do the 'Survivors' survive? What do you think? To accentuate things more, Emmerich supports the dramatic environment with pathetic but sweet moving music, set decorations, designs and cinematographyOnce said that, the movie looks beautiful, and the special effects are flawless; but maybe that's the only thing Emmerich can do without problems.As we will see many years from now, the movie had to be set in New YorkThey just love to destroy those thingsThe Statue of Liberty, The Empire StateIf they are going to freeze a city, New York will be the first choice.When the film ended and the credits were rolling, I wondered: If Roland Emmerich knows so much about disaster and nothing about dramaWhy doesn't he just destroys everything without leaving any trace of life? Then the screen was black.",6,0,1,26 May 2005
Match Point," Magical Woody Allen
","'Match Point' moves fast. Everything happens so quickly that you miss it if you turn your head around. Even so, the movie's length is over two hours, and when you think an hour has gone by, only thirty minutes have passed. My grandmother said: 'They say it's not like Woody Allen's films but it has the eye of the genius'. She was right; Allen has created the most common plot line with the least common results.Basing it slightly in something about a question of luck, the master places his game in Britain, particularly in London, precisely in the high class of the city. An Irish tennis instructor, former professional, called Chris Wilton (the growing talent Jonathan Rhys Meyers) requests to give classes in a tennis club. Soon he buys an apartment and meets Tom Hewett (a surprising Matthew Goode), and goes to an opera with his parents because they share the same passion.This is when you wonder if Chris could have studied Tom and known what he liked, if he just sensed it or if he just had luck. Chris says at the beginning of the film: 'There's a time in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net and remains in mid air for a second. With a little luck, the ball goes over and you win; or it doesn't, and you loose'. That statement is presented later in the movie with many situations but specifically with one crucial moment.Soon, again, Chris meets and starts dating Tom sister's Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and going to his parents' (flawless but limited Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton) country house, generating a good relationship with them. We get to know the main character (all of the characters) and we predict his ambitions and the place he wants to arrive. However, he is surrounded by people who play the game, know the rules and are aware of the consequences.But there's always a weakness; in this case, it is Chris' very believable affection for Chloe. When Chloe's parents realize that they're both becoming close, they want to help him, even if he (very intelligently) didn't ask for it. Then Nola Rice, (each time better, Scarlett Johansson) Tom's fiancée appears, and meets while playing ping-pong when he tires to help her in a provocative way. 'Didn't they tell you that your game is aggressive?', she asks him. 'Didn't they tell you that you have sexy lips?', he responds.Now Chris has done a lot to get where he is and knows that the only of screwing it up is by 'making a pass' at her'; or so she tells him. The vocabulary and way of speaking used in every scene is admirable. In the line of what Patrick Marber did in 'Closer' recently, but in a better way, Allen makes the character's seduction believable with his words. We believe it here, because we are allowed to be in their minds.Then we sit and watch, patiently, and when we think we know the characters, actions take place and we can't believe what we were thinking. That's why Woody Allen's screenplay highlights more than his direction; that's why the screenplay is the high point: it astonishes. His direction, on the other hand shows the always great acting control and a camera that makes a long movement observing each scene it shoots.The music is simply constituted by long or short or whole parts of famous Operas, which is as tragic as the tone of the story, editor Alisa Lepselter draws a lot of attention because of the rough cuts that definitely prove that Allen is not doing one of his last nice comedies. The central character does lots of things to cause an effect on people and to win them; but Chris Wilton is no Tom Ripley.Ripley was a true genius, uninterested in what his decisions would cause to anyone; Wilton lies down with a manual about reading Dostoievski so he can impress an old man. Ripley didn't feel; Wilton is vulnerable, and doesn't own a mastermind: so he depends on luck. It could be enough, or not.",9,0,0,25 April 2006
Zodiac," Personally...
","I feel like my whole life had passed in front of my eyes in two hours and a half. Many movies cover many years of the lives of their characters ('The Shawshank redemption' is a perfect example that comes to mind), but few do it so vividly as David Fincher's 'Zodiac'; the story of a serial killer who haunted the police and the press for thirty years. If you need to know, the case hasn't been solved yet.What happens in 'Zodiac' is that: a lot of years. Some of the characters really seem like they've aged with the dates we see on screen and some look the same, but we stop caring at one point because we're completely involved in the story. I wouldn't say that the movie moves fast, but it definitely moves strong; it is, as 'Letters From Iwo Jima', a piece of instant impact and a director's piece in every aspect.If you've seen a David Fincher film before, you can expect to be confused; so don't complain if 'Zodiac' is a bit messy and hard to follow; but it's not 'The Game' or 'Fight Club'. Those two films also shocked me just after watching them, but I don't totally recall them today. Maybe 'Zodiac' is Fincher's movie that will stick with me the most; maybe it is his masterpiece, and if you haven't seen any of his films, it's a good place to start.It would be fair to say that it is the development of the case what is hard to keep up with, but fortunately that's just one thing of the diversity 'Zodiac' has to offer. In fact, it's one of the beauties of the film that the 'investigation' is not everything. Fincher knows we've seen to many mystery movies where the case is the focus and where the viewer has to work hard to figure it out ('The Usual Suspects' is a perfect example that comes to mind), so he speeds up the process giving a lot of changing but easy to understand resolutions.I know it's contradictoryIt's a disorganized process with simple answers, but it's the director's choice; and we forgive him because he provides so much more. 'Zodiac' is not just the story of a murder being solved; it's a character piece of the most unusual nature. It's not just about cops and reporters doing their jobs; it's about working men bored with the routine, longing for excitement and about working men frustrated because they can't succeed at the only thing they do.The first of these explanations refers to two of the main characters: Paul Avery (a flawless Robert Downey Jr.); a reporter with a lot of guts and a fondness for alcohol, and Robert Graysmith (a not so convincing Jake Gyllenhaal, at least after having seen him in 'Jarhead'-if you like the guy you must see that film-); a cartoonist who wrote the best-selling book in which the film is based. The latter explanation applies to Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) and Dave Toschi (the great Mark Ruffalo: phenomenal); two cops devoted to the case and unable to crack it.Talking Awards (I know Matias likes that), this is not the film of the year; but it's the kind of film that due to its nature, could get a Best Ensemble nomination for the SAG Award: besides the leads it has Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Phillip Baker Hall, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue, Clea DuVall, Adam Goldberg...Not bad. And maybe Adapted Screenplay somewhere; don't know.Personally, I believe this is one of those pieces where the director is crucial; and I would be glad to see an Oscar nomination 'a la' David Lynch with 'Mulholland Dr.'; because I think David Fincher should have had one by now But that's just my opinion.",8,2,3,20 August 2007
The Prestige," A little bit of Nolan
","I told myself that I would watch this movie once more before writing about it. I have already done it, and this is what I have: Christopher Nolan has done four very good and very different films; 'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'Batman Begins' and 'The Prestige'. That the last one is a little better than the previous ones only shows his continuing growth as a writer and director. While 'Memento' was a complex tale about an amnesic man's mind and 'Batman Begins' a brave new beginning of the famous franchise; 'The Prestige' is the adaptation of a novel about the world of magic.Written alongside his brother Jonathan, the director's script doesn't take long to get us inside this world where we want to believe everything; that world of tricks and illusions. 'Are you watching closely?', a voice off screen asks as soon as the film's first frame appears; and if you don't listen or pay attention to this, you probably won't understand the story. The question is also an indirect invitation to pay attention to how the movie looks, thanks to Wally Pfister's incredible cinematography.Followed by the mentioned question, an inspired Michael Caine gives a speech concerning the three steps that complete a magic trick, while he does one to a little girl. This girl is a fundamental piece of the plot, but we find that out later. The way in which Nolan's direction and writing combine to, little by little, give way to new developments of the plot, is one of the points that show the filmmaker's improvement.It's enough saying that 'The Prestige' is about an eternal competition between two magicians, each one excellent in their own way: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackmam) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, on the way to become a Nolan regular). And you must trust me when I tell you that such competition ends up consuming their lives; ruining the ones of the ones around them.This relationship of admiration, mixed big time with obsession, envy and resentment; can be perfectly seen in the performances the main actors assume. Being separated and meeting face to face rarely throughout the movie, is like they know each other by heart and they can look at each other; in moments where the plot puts them in different times, because the film deals with three different situations (in different times) at the same time.If you hadn't considered Hugh Jackman as talented until now, or if you had seen him as a guy with luck, 'The Prestige' is the place to discover his interpretative power and become conscious of the talent he is. And Bale, he easily steals the show with another performance full of his own unforgettable elements. The presence of both is so strong that Scarlett Johansson, generally a main attraction, is clearly unnoticed.When the movie is over, you'll have a feeling of dissatisfaction that will make you want to see it again. I know that it happened to Matsan and it happened to me too. I couldn't do it because I saw the film in the cinema, but if you rent it don't think twice and do it because it's worth it: 'The Prestige' is a cinematographic pearl.",9,2,3,1 June 2007
Hotel Rwanda," One man can do miracles sometimes...
","It doesn't matter from where you look at it; 'Hotel Rwanda' is a story about Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle); a hard working, committed, kind and devoted to his family man with a very big heart. It is also the true story of a massacre that took place in Rwanda because of a civil war with civilians incapable of defending themselves, which led to this number of dead people: one million.A war with no real fundament, you could say; because it was something about the Hutus and the Tutsis and a lot of anger publicly spread by a radio station. Also a war where not many people could intervene, because Rwanda wasn't worth a dollar for the rest of the world at the time. During all of this mess, this man, manager of an important hotel, took in one thousand people from all over the world and he even accepted both Hutus and Tutsis. Being a Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi (Sophie Okonedo).Inside his hotel, a UN division in charge of Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) could only afford four guards at the hotel's gates while outside the 'interahamwes' were all over the streets looking for Tutsis to kill. A cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix) could get a shot of the army assassinating Tutsis with machetesCan you imagine all this? There's not much more to the movie than the recreation of this events, but what recreation and what an accurate vision from everyone involved in it. Terry George, writer of the wonderful 'Hart's War', deals with war again in his script; but together with Keir Person, they succeed in showing us how hard reality is, in words. They introduce us a world dominated by bribery, distrust and the ever-present racism. George also directed the picture this time, luckily with the compassion needed to shoot a theme like this one. The camera (a beautiful cinematography by Robert Fraisse) goes to the streets, to the houses and the shelters but it doesn't need the direct blood and violence I'll probably witness in 'Apocalypto' when I watch it. Performances are also quite effective. Nick Nolte (watch him in 'The Good Thief') is superb as the Colonel who knows his limitations and can't break the rules. He has a couple of great moments discussing with Cheadle's character. Jean Reno has a nice little part and Sophie Okonedo also achieves some moments of true moving brilliance when talking to Cheadle.Cheadle is, however, in the end, the star of the show. In the best portrayal of his career, the actor assumes the responsibility of being on screen all the time. He does it embodying this man I talked you about completely, with all the characteristics I mentioned above and an accent so flawless that you think of him as another Rwandese actorIt's fantastic.",9,0,0,20 February 2007
Once," 'Take this sinking boat and point it home...'
","'At first they are flirting, and by the end they're f***ing like animals', says writer/director John Carney of the scene in 'Once' where the guy (Glen Hansard) and the girl (Marketa Irglova) sing 'Falling Slowly' for the first time. It's a beautiful song, understated like the whole movie; and it's not only a beautiful scene, but also one of the most truly moving cinematographic scenes I've ever seen.I know the feeling; I've sung with people I didn't know whether they could do it well and been amazed beyond words; I've fallen in love playing music. It's not the romantic relationship kind of love; it's something from a completely different universe. Anyone who says 'Once' is a bad film has to be either a music hater ora music hater.Once in a lifetime you'll watch a movie like 'Once', because from now if you experience something similar it's going to come from here. Carney and his team, the emotional photography of the digital camera and the austere use of light; Hansard, his earnest voice and uncompromising songs; Irglova, her unique smile and the mystique that surround her; they might have created a completely new film genre I wouldn't dare to give a name to.I regret some unnecessary moments where Carney takes the viewer for granted by showing characters smiling when they listen to the music this guy and this girl play. We don't need to see the typical shot of the 'approving face'; we like it and we approve it and that should be enough.You want to laugh? You will, watching five musicians getting into a studio and not knowing what to do. You want to rejoice? You can close you eyes and listen to the music that, even when it shares some similarities with my beloved Damien Rice, comes from a parallel world that (I'm starting to think) only exists in Ireland. You might cry too, but that's depending on how sensitive you are.One last thing: this is not a romantic comedy and it doesn't even come close to one. But if it were, I would hand an immense compliment to the story because it is, yes, very romantic and unlike anything you've seen. Free of clichés, formulas and (predictable or not) convenient endings. Don't lie to yourselves, because you know those are the main characteristics of a rom-com and you wouldn't like them if they were any different.'I don't know you but I want you even more for that'  from 'Falling Slowly'",8,2,5,31 March 2008
Crash," You have no idea...
","To be honest, I began watching 'Crash' an hour before the Oscars took place. Also to be honest, I had wanted to watch it for a long time, and even when I hadn't watched it, I kept claiming, for some reason, that it would win the Best Picture Oscar. To be more honest then, I finished viewing the film after the Oscars ceremony came to an end, and to be even more honest; I might not write enough to explain what this movie generates in the person who experiences it.I find amazing how writers keep on finding ways to connect different people's lives. Writer/director Paul Haggis is not repeating any formula when he creates unions after a car crash; because he is taking his whole picture from a different angle. That's why it's amazing to me that today in Los Angeles racism is still a constant issueI don't know that, because I don't live there, but the first scene of this piece tries to analyze it.Detective Graham (Don Cheadle) has just been in a car accident, and he talks out loud, about the people's sense of touch: 'We miss that touch so much', he says, 'That we crash into each other just so we can feel something'. Moments later, Anthony and Peter (Ludacris and Larenz Tate) are walking out of a restaurant, discussing about a coffee that wasn't given to them and wondering why a white woman hugs her couple as she passes by. 'She shouldn't be scared, we should be', Anthony shouts angrily.What happens next is unbelievable as it is ironic. It shocked me and it will shock any viewer because people are not always like we think they are. Racial statements like Anthony's are all over the script, all over the film; but they're not stated just to be said: characters have motives to declare them. Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) sees his father suffering every day because he's got nothing left; he also blames (somehow) the black people in his father's industry for what happened. He is a racist because he resents black people.Due to his position, Rick (Brendan Fraser) must be partial with the black community, whether that causes them good or wrong. His wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) must also be careful with blacks and boys from gangs, even if she's naturally paranoid and asks her lock to be changed again after a young man with a tattoo (Michael Peña) fixes it. For our surprise, the guy turns out to be anything but a gang member.As it occurs with black people, it occurs with Arabs and Persians, or Chinese persons who are American citizens. They are perceived as the same thing, and starred at with the same rejection, although they are different. And I believe that this could be happening right now; this things could be being said, this actions could be taking place, when nobody is probably watching, or listening. Haggis and Moresco truly think they can show us what we could be missing.It's about films like 'Crash', '21 Grams' and 'Traffic' that we talk about infinitely; because they have original characters within; which include original and unique stories. Here, particularly, Haggis places each one of his characters (and I omitted many of them) in a contradiction and with an observing, confident camera, a lot of light and an overwhelming music (Mark Isham), he messes with them; with their heads and emotions so they can figure everything out.Some of them are already messed up and so desperately in need that they hug the only person who's beside them; for the reason that they need to let it all out. We watch closely and we feel sorry for them; for what they've got and don't appreciateAnd what they lack and will never achieve.",9,4,12,5 March 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," From the imagination of Guillermo Del Toro
","Guillermo Del Toro is Mexican. I clarify this because I know it, and I assured the fact to a friend who watched 'El laberinto del fauno' with me; but when the movie began with a Spanish accent, I doubted. And it's because Del Toro is obsessed with the Spanish Civil War, and we the adventures of little children in the midst of this important historical event (watch 'El espinazo del Diablo'); but all of this comes from his obsession with fairy tales, those that are only for children.But look at what he does: he invents the most infantile story of all, in a film that's everything except infantile. This is a double-edged sword; in fact, Del Toro is a double-edged sword himself. His obsessions come from when he was little, when he imagined creatures and monsters as part of his daily reality. He also has a photographic memory; these are all things that can as positive as they can be negative, and it is evidenced in his way of making cinema.The man knows a lot about cinema: he has experimented with cameras since his teenage years; he studied make-upThis plays against him too, mostly in 'El laberinto del fauno', which is one of the most technically perfect movies I've seen in my whole life. The impressive sound edition becomes present from the first minute; the images are exaggeratedly beautiful; the music is perfect, but only because it is directly connected to the plot.All the particularities that can be found in this film's characters come straight from Del Toro; who wrote the screenplay of his fable himself. It is an enchanting script that commences with the telling of a simple fairy tale, revealing a main fact of the story immediately. We should remember something so fundamental, but this immersing quality of the script makes us forget. And it's not a complex screenplay, because it has its predictable points; but as we get lost in a world where reality and fantasy become one, we stop caring.Reality can be so strong that sometimes we choose to escape. The images of this film are very strong, therefore the main character, Ivana, finds a magical world that keeps her constantly away from what's happening around her. And the point is not to ask ourselves if this 'magical world' is real, trying to analyze every moment to put them together and see if they fit. That's unimportant, because in this story there's nothing to resolveBut there's a lot to understand.And I think that to really understand 'El laberinto del fauno', you hace to understand its director. Del Toro's ability to bring incredible creations (from the same 'faun' to a monster with eyes in its hands) to us reflects the power of his imagination; maybe his only neutral quality. I think I'll never completely understand Del Toro, but I assume that his imagination is what makes him attractive to the people who work with him; and consequently makes them follow him anywhere.In this aspect, 'El laberinto del fauno' stands close to 'Letters From Iwo Jima'; because just like Clint Eastwood in that film, Del Toro is an example of how crucial and predominant is the influence of the director in a cinematographic piece. 'El laberinto' is excessively long, but nobody cared; the actors become insignificant, as if the characters had taken over them (and not the other way round as it should be)Everything seems to be part of a bigger unit: Guillermo Del Toro's vision.",8,5,8,14 June 2007
Knocked Up," Judd Apatow: The Man of Fun
","Picture a passionate sceneA guy and a girl are about to have sex and he's having troubles with his condom; he can't seem to be able to put it on. The girl says: 'Just do it already'. Maybe a normal guy would interpret the phrase as what it means, but not Ben Stone (Seth Rogen): he throws the condom to the floorAnd he gets Alison (Katherine Heigl) pregnant.I haven't laughed so hard with a movie since I don't know when. 'Knocked Up' is a romantic comedy unlike any romantic comedy and better than the average romantic comedy. The reason? I would have to say Judd Apatow: the guy who gave 'Fun with Dick and Jane' its few laughs, the writer/director of 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and the mastermind behind this. Apatow really knows how to have fun. Characters the same names as the actors who play them, freshness in each scene, unexpected comedic resolutions during typical moments; that is all Apatow.Take this for example, continuing with what I wrote in the first paragraph. Alison and Ben wake up after having sex and leave the house for breakfast. They encounter Alison's sister Debbie (a brilliant Leslie Mann) and his husband Pete (a brilliant Paul Rudd) with their two little kids. 'Don't ever do what they just did', Pete tells his four-year-old daughter. 'I'm gonna do it', she answers. Or another scene where Debbie thinks Pete is cheating on her; finds an address and goes there with Ben and Alison to check it out. She's angry, and as soon as she leaves the car, Ben asks Alison: 'Is she carrying a gun?'.The audience doesn't expect these lines and the laughs flow naturally. If they are improvised or not is unimportant; what matters is that Apatow is directing them and allows their inclusion in the film. If there's one problem with 'Knocked Up' is that it runs a little bit long, but it doesn't make it worse than the wonder it is.It is a wonder because in its long duration, it manages to combine comedy, drama and romance in an enviable way. It's not always the most active movie, but it doesn't have to be; it's not always funny and sometimes it is when it's not supposed to; it's romantic in the most classic way and it's helped by a classic plot line with zero surprises. However, in all this predictable plot line, 'Knocked Up' has a quality that only few comedies achieve: it knows its time(s).Besides, it creates its own language and it makes us part of it very quickly; it takes the chance to be critical about the Hollywood Business with intelligent humor. But most importantly (and this was also palpable in 'The 40 Yea Old Virgin'), and as another rare characteristic, it truly cares for its characters who are interesting, flawed and real human beings.Seth Rogen constructs a lovable creature, like one of those big bears you want to hug, surpassing the promise he showed in 'Virgin'; while Katherine Heigl looks more beautiful than in 'Grey's Anatomy' and creates a completely different and believable character from her Izzie Stevens. When I wrote about 'Virgin' I said Apatow was more a planner than a directorHe still is, if we consider Eric Edward's cinematography, with very little creativity.But the directing side of Apatow comes to light from another side: from the double sense of names (Ben Stone; you'll see once you're inside the movie), from little posters in rooms and books in bookstores and photographs and references that seem to declare his inspirations. Then, we can see him through these things. We can see the man behind the camera, and let me tell you it's a good place the one where he comes from.",9,0,1,21 November 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Razorhands!
","Ladies and gentlemen, clap your handsTim Burton has accomplished his darkest, sickest, sadistic, most twisted and perverse piece yet; and he's done it with a musical. Don't expect a lot of talking in 'Sweeney Todd', because the actors sing most of the film. It opens with a ship arriving to London, and a sailor singing about how nothing compares to the city. But a man next to him, Sweeney Todd, thinks the opposite. Already on the city streets, he sings to the sailor: 'There was a barber and his wife', as he tells a story. It's a beautifully sad song; part of Stephen Sondheim's musical, expertly conducted in Burton's version by Paul Gemignani, with an orchestra that includes nothing more than strings: peaceful but scary strings. For a short time, 'peaceful and scary' appears to be an accurate description for what's going on, from the perfect opening sequence until the moment Sweeney meets Mrs. Lovett.Helena Bonham Carter plays her in a stupendous performance. A human interpretation of a character that accepts her reality before Sweeney comes into her life (she sings the funniest song of the film, telling him hers are the ugliest pies in town) and deals with the changes the barber brings to her routine, making sacrifices for a man she secretly loves. Still, Bonham Carter leaves room for some surprises.Because when characters don't sing, John Logan's screenplay brings a subtle amount of black humor to the table and the necessary amount of character development. Of course 'Sweeney Todd' is a classic revenge tale, but if it weren't for some scenes we wouldn't empathize so much with the main character. Besides his idiosyncrasy, we immediately recognize in Sweeney the scars of a truly wounded man.Johnny Depp embodies the character from this contradiction; so he has moments of pure rage that the viewer may be shocked with or not, but there are times where we sense sadness in his face or a need for silence, loneliness and meditation. This is the key to his performance's success (not even his impressive singing talent), which works the most when he combines both sides. Like in a scene (a song) where Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett find a solution to their miseries (or something like that, you'll choose) and dance together; he with his razor she with her pie stick. The way Bonham Carter looks through the window during that song is pure marvel. Sweeney is not the typical Burton outcast; it's more like a normal human being who died and is trying to see how it feels to be alive again.To be honest, everyone works at a great level in 'Sweeney Todd'. For example, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are wickedly cruel, and (do believe it) they sing; a little kid called Ed Sanders is the best singer of the ensemble and a very convincing performer; the production design and the cinematography make London a place you want to hate as Sweeney does: an obscure, unpredictable colder than nowadays. While Tim Burton is the craziest of them allA master of fantasies and of tone changing in the middle of them, the director this time sticks to the style and world he's chosen: he puts his own touches to Sweeney (the gray part of the hair); makes him see the light only once while making sure the makeup and costume generate a contrast that makes him look like a dead corpse on the beach or a prisoner, if you may; and ultimately leads him to his dark, sick, twisted, perverse and tragic end.

The Town," Affleck's movie directing growth
","Ben Affleck's second film is one of the best movies of the year. I'll try to tell you why. First off, it's better than its predecessor 'Gone Baby Gone'. I find impressive that Affleck decided step it up in almost every aspect: 'The Town' runs longer, cuts deeper, increases in action scenes and in character development. We remember more characters and the romantic relationship at the center of the film is given more time and because the script is morally consistent, 'The Town' is one of the few crime movies in which we care more about the criminal's life than the success of the robbery of a bank or a truck. Dramatically, it's irresistible. Talking about increasing risks. After years of trying to build a better reputation as an actor by participating in films that wouldn't stain his image, and after directing a film that gained him respect even when his acting skills weren't as recognized still, Ben Affleck decides to be himself the star of the show. He plays Doug MacRay, an expert robber that works with a very skilled gang in Charlestown: instructed by The Florist (Pete Postlethwaite), they tackle the best jobs in town and, because something always goes wrong, in the middle of a bank robbery, they take the manager, Claire, (Rebecca Hall) as a hostage. They drop her in some beach and start watching her to make sure she doesn't say anything to the police. Because she knows, we know. Doug starts seeing her and later on Claire recalls the robbers told her to walk until she felt the water: 'It was the longest walk of my life; I thought I'd fall from a cliff'. Doug starts dating Claire because his impulses tell him so. He can't fight it. Women in both of Affleck's films tend to present this quality that goes beyond beauty: either they are independent and kind, women you want to fly to heaven with; or self-destructive and troubling, women you inevitably want to save. The common factor is that they are both very vulnerable. Both women co-exist in Doug's life, and we can see that he's trapped; he wants to do something. But at the same time, 'The Town' is about the things we can't help. I mean, of course, the things we shouldn't really do when we think about them.Name a character and I'll point out a weakness. The script of the fillm, based again on a novel and written by Affleck and Aaron Stockard alongside Peter Craig, provides characters with huge moral dilemmas. In 'Gone Baby Gone', this aspect made its crowning way towards a climatic ending, and it worked. Here it's all over the place, because every decision is apparently life-changing, because every conversation holds a secret. Because the past, never absolutely revealed yet always present, is devastating. Writing always from the heart but this time without the intention of generating impact, Affleck might have achieved his best screenplay. The genre conventions we find in the story are the ones that make the movie 'activate' (to just say something), but a whole different thing makes the movie breathe. The way Affleck has of capturing, again, a specific place and making it his own. He masters a special mood (thank you for that score again Harry Gregson- Williams), he dominates the codes, he drives the streets and he walks the roofs in order to leave no doubt that he knows, again, what he's talking about. The characters, and their involvement in a story that we need to see told show the growth and the natural flowing of a director who's as generous as every great actor/writer/director that, from time to time, decides to be the hero. That generosity is expressed in a way that we can realize he's the main star but everyone who stands by him is perfectly chosen to shine and still not surpass him. That's why Jeremy Renner turns in a stupendous performance as Doug's best friend, a fine step to follow his Oscar nomination; that's why Affleck gives Blake Lively of 'Gossip Girl' the –up to now- part of her life; that's why John Hamm feels at times underused and a bit caricaturized as a federal agent; and that's also why major names like Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper have only a couple of scenes.I believe these are the right calls, by a director so confident that in the end truly becomes the brightest (in intelligence and in light) star. I honestly think Affleck's performance is the winning one: I believe in everything Doug says and does and I root for him all the way. I found myself touched by 'The Town', a film not intentionally made for that effect, but with all the elements in place to end up causing it. If you don't agree with all this none sense, it's only fair to say the film is a part action, part crime, romantic and dramatic feature with family/friendship subplotsStraightly told, visually appealing, Hollywood-ish if you prefer. That should also be enough if you want to make one of the year's best films.",9,2,4,24 October 2010
Closer," 'I can't take my eyes off you'
","The first minutes of 'Closer', which involve two individuals staring at each other at the rhythm of a song that reminds me of the woman I love are so tender; so captivating, that they make you think you're going to watch the most romantic movie of your life. The thing is you're not.It's beyond imagination where words go, or what words can do. If 'Closer' knows about something, it's about words. About how to say them, when, and of course, inevitably, why. Patrick Marber's screenplay is brilliant, even when his words are far from spontaneity, because the only point is that they are spoken.When Alice (Natalie Portman) talks to Dan (Jude Law) for the first time, she only speaks two words: 'Hello stranger'. This will be a trademark for the whole film and in other words, a reminder or a sign that actually every word counts. Later on, Alice asks Dan, a frustrated writer who writes obituaries that include euphemisms, to tell her what would her euphemism be: 'She was disarming', he says.The other two characters (there are only four characters in the film) are Anna (Julia Roberts) and Larry (Clive Owen), who meet accidentally on purpose and fall in love, then get married. On the other hand Alice and Dan live together, love each other; actions simply described that lie in the standards of life.But 'Closer' doesn't like simple, and explores each detail of these standards so profoundly, so intensely, in a way I've never experienced in a movie before. Yes, there are lot of movies of this type, but 'Closer' was a play, therefore there's no sense of time in the movie, which makes it shameless.And shamelessly, characters come and go whenever they please. Shamelessly they fall in love lots of times and they do it very fast; shamelessly they screw each other so constantly that they don't even notice it, and disgracefully speak at each other with words that touch even the silence that embraces them.So I go back to my main argument, because this movie is about love, but no in the lovable way, because you can't love the characters because of their actions; there's not even one of them that seems to be doing things right. And you certainly can't love the film, that is good but leaves you unsatisfied and empty when it's over.However, there are things you can love; like the performances. This is the kind of movie where actors get the chance of showing off, taking big risks and carrying their talents to the maximum level. Natalie Portman takes every chance, in what's her most skillful and complete portrayal. Julia Roberts is at the top of her game (like if we didn't know she's a superstar), Jude Law reminds us how moving an actor can be, while Clive Own creates, dedicatedly, the film's most sympathetic and concerned character.You can also love Mike Nichols, because the credit is not all Patrick Marber's; and the German director, with 72 years at that time, directed his actors amazingly, in all these different places, these silences and musical moments, close-ups and still shots, maintaining his reputation of commitment with the work.'And so it is, just like you said it would be, life goes easy on me, most of the time'. You will find the movie hard to follow, because it becomes tedious and repetitive in occasions. It's not great, but it's confident and sure, as you will be after watching it, at least about one thing: that love hurtsA lot.",7,1,2,13 December 2005
Taxi Driver," I am amazed...
","I want to explain again that I've heard what a great director Martin Scorsese is. Now I'm trying to watch all his movies and enjoy them. Some, as 'Taxi Driver' are not very enjoyable, but are near excellence. To conclude, 'Taxi Driver' is the best I've seen from Scorsese up to now.This is the oldest movie I've seen in quite a while. I don't know if I said it before, but there was a time when cinema included passion, and movies were made with passion. I'm talking about before the 80's; Coppola, Bogdanovich, Scorsese'Taxi Driver' is an example of this, and Scorsese had just started. Robert De Niro was at his top when his career started; playing main roles in his first movies, creating sensation in the audience and gaining respect from the critics. He's one of the best actors of all time. After Coppola provided for his Oscar in 'The Godfather II', 'Taxi Driver' was the next big step. Anyway, he was a pro already, and he was determined to deliver great performances during the rest of his life. He looks younger than his character (Travis is 26, he was in his thirties), and he says the phrase often remembered ('Are you talking to me'?) while he looks at the screen and performs the story of a man who can't sleep and writes about what he does. The script, by Scorsese's long time collaborator Paul Schrader, is a wonderful tale of real, daily life, in a city where Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) observes the people, and wants to save them in some way: 'You got to clean this up', he says to Charles Palantine, a candidate for president. He's not lying.He only knows about Palantine because of a girl who likes; Betsy. This performance by Cybill Shepherd is honestly something to be talked about. She stepped out of being Bogdanovich figurine (even if she did it good in those movies), to play a main character in this film. Her interpretation is unbelievably natural and experienced as the rest of the cast. She doesn't seem someone who has just started. Shepherd did some movies in her career; some of them were good, some bad But she had the talent.For Jodie Foster (Iris), at her young fourteen years, this was the first recognition that foresaw tons of awards and an excellent career. Her performance didn't show talent in best ways, but was crucial to the film's development. In Travis Bickle's mind, he has to do something for a girl he has met a few times and senses she is not living well. Who else would ask for 'action' with a prostitute just to talk to her?Then there are two other important performances; one is Albert Brooks' Tom, in a very funny way as he spied his 'girlfriend' when Travis, the ladies-man, was talking to her. The other one is Pete Boyle's Wizard, whose wisdom encourages Travis in his impulses. They both have a talk, De Niro and Boyle, sitting on a cab. This is one of the best scenes in the movies. Travis wants to know more about the cab driver's life, or wants to know how is it that he has to do it; because he can't sleep. Then the Wizard delivers a speech of an uncertain exactness; because he knows, and that's why he is called the 'Wizard'. Travis doesn't understand; we probably don't either. As Travis goes back into his yellow cab and looks at the city with disappointing eyes, we're waiting to listen to the music again. That fine music by Bernard Herrmann that shows peace and serenity. I loved it. Let's just not forget about the movie director; this is Martin Scorsese. He manages to achieve great shots of the streets at night; completely narrative, following the story. Then an excellent visual labor in small takes like the shooting training and like the gun in the window. He follows his characters closely, focusing on them and what's behind them. He doesn't let them go. About Travis Bickle's life, and what he does, it's all in his head; taken to life by De Niro. He has good, bad moments. He changes radically and starts to eat good food, drops his pills. Although then he changes again, and he introduces another pill in his mouth. His mind gives an overturnYou'll know why.Scorsese's final shots are just an explanation and conclusion to everything. He's talking to us, and he's saying: 'This is what can happen. It has happened here'.",9,0,0,8 May 2005
Shutter Island," A freakin' nightmare
","For all the movies we've seen this last decade about men with mental problems, delusions and so on, Martin Scorsese's 'Shutter Island' is the first one that doesn't try to be too cool and modern. In fact, it inhabits its time so well, that if it weren't for some of the main character's recurrent dreams, we could easily think it's happening in this time and age. But the year is 1954, and there's still this little contradiction. Scorsese, a wise and experienced director, doesn't intend to make a period piece in which we should feel 'as if we were in 1954'. No. Because this is the adaptation of a novel, and because he knows cinema and genres like few out there, he gives U.S Marshals Teddy (Leo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) a couple of film-noir type classy hats when we first meet them and also charges the film with a musical feeling that, without being to invasive, takes us back to classic eras. However, the truth is that he is just plain interested in setting the premises for a freaking nightmare; and that's an idea that ultimately makes him and the movie more modern than anyone else.No one is pretending in 'Shutter Island'. This is not a movie that has been improvised, shot with some kind of 'let's see how it goes'. It's not the director's usual territory, but that doesn't mean that he's going to step on new territory with trembling hands. No, the one who does that will be Teddy, in a ride that haunts and frightens the viewer, confusing him at the same time. Teddy and Chuck arrive to the Island to resolve the disappearance of a demented patient, but once Teddy finds out about a conspiracy, there's no way back. 'Shutter Island' grabs you and never lets you go until the last minute. Scorsese's always been good at that.Still the territory remains new and unexplored for the viewer: it's Scorsese's slowest (yes, it's the word) film in years; there are few specific sets and locations, there's few action and very few characters to meet. We realize when leaving the theatre that the camera doesn't leave Teddy for an instant and that the director's highest interest is to keep track of everything that goes on in his conflicted mind. It's almost claustrophobic, but in the end it works because the interest the film has for Teddy is genuine and there's never an intention of fooling the viewer. No mind blowing script trick to generate an unforgettable ending, no speeding things up to jump into easy conclusions; 'Shutter Island' is the first movie of this kind that ends circularly and because of character. This means the film starts the end credits and we know it hasn't ended but we believe it, because of the things mentioned above. This is easier to understand if you've seen films like 'The I Inside', 'The Butterfly Effect' and 'Secret Window'; the last two not bad films, just movies that reached its conclusion in a convenient and abrupt way, not gradually. Every aspect of the film is handled with the most of care so Teddy's journey really seems gradual. Even the recurrent dreams in all its different shapes, which are bound to upset and tire you, appear as completely necessary. There's no trick there; just great film-making by a fantastic crew. The cinematography of Robert Richardson, Thelma Schoonmaker in the editing room. And DiCaprio's performance (another giant work) helps a lot, considering that he continues to hold the title of 'Hollywood's most intense look' and that he might be, right now, the only Hollywood star capable of delivering a tour-de-force with complete conscience of his range; of where it starts and where is the limit he shouldn't exceed. I go crazy with Clooney's abilities, but I know it's himself and it's effortless; I love Depp's eccentricity but I admit that this decade in movies he's been long gone from the real world as we know it; I admire Day Lewis' excesses, but I still can't be touched by a performance that's so intentionally over the top (I could go on with the names, believe me). But DiCaprio...He always seems to be trying really hard and his face a lot of times looks like suffering itself. And that's what makes him real. That's why we choose to believe the things he experiences here and in so many other movies could be happening to him. He's not so out of reach; he doesn't even start to buy what's going on himself. Someone like Jack Dawson with the chance of boarding the Titanic? Really?",8,1,4,15 March 2010
Capote," And the Oscar goes to...
","The Great Phillip Seymour Hoffman is, in my personal opinion, one of the best actors the industry has ever seen. I admire him so much that I recall little moments of some of his movies sometimes, and I start to laugh. I've got his image stuck on me, but not because of the actor in person, but because of the characters he creates and the impression they leave in me.Daddy's boy in 'Scent of a woman', the unpleasant doctor in 'Patch Adams' (the first time he actually impressed me), the singular Freddie in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', the crazy music man in 'Almost Famous', the drifted widower in 'Love Liza', the noisy journalist in 'Red Dragon', the good friend in '25th Hour', the incredibly funny Sandy in 'Along Came Polly', the angry boss in 'Punch-Drunk Love'; not to forget Dan Mahowny in 'Owning Mahowny'Now Truman Capote.He is going to win the Academy Award on March 5th, and it will be well earned. A performance is more recognized when it portrays something out of the ordinary than something common; therefore a character like the controversial Capote attracts attention. The change the actor goes through is remarkable, but sometimes there's more than a physical change. I'm not in the mood of giving examples, but Hoffman's is a complete transformation; and that's what actually counts.You see it in the way he puts the cigarette in his mouth, the way he grabs the phone, or he walks and places his body parts; not to mention his voice and way of speaking: it's disturbing. You find more about the character as the years pass by. He has only one trusted friend who's been with him all along: Nelle Harper Lee (a flawless delivery by the always good Catherine Keener); they understand themselves perfectly.. 'I don't lie', he tells her. But he does; he is a journalist. By the time the movie enters his life, he was a celebrity, and it is funny to see him the way he is, around his fellow journalists, telling jokes, being the attraction. There's a tremendous respect for him.'In Cold Blood' was the name of his unfinished book that told the story of a family murdered by Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr., don't forget about him) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). 'It's the non-fiction book of the decade', Capote declared. What did 'non-fiction' mean? The writer was creating a genre in the world of novels. 'This will change the way of writing', William Shawn (Bob Balaban) told him. The film goes through the five years it took Capote to write the book. The facts are detailed; the screenplay by Dan Futterman is accurate and true to the main characterI mean, it's five years within an hour and a half.Capote became close with Perry Smith while working, the movie tells; his couple Jack (underused Bruce Greenwood) spent time alone in Spain by himself while the writer traveled to Kansas almost unconsciously, to the point of waking up in trains in a way you could tell he didn't know where he was. Even though there were emotions running through, the man knew his priority. He got into the private files of Detective Alvin Dewey (genius Chris Cooper) because of the trust the detective's wife had on him. This could have brought him consequences, in fact, everything could.One way or the other, every story finishes 'Capote' goes for the black screen in every situation. It is too confident on its material, because it should be. Its director, Bennet Miller, presents his baby (alongside him, Hoffman and Futterman made it come true). Here is a man who understands and, even better, appreciates silences. He witnesses the landscapes with the camera, he focuses his characters with still shots, no music; he lets them talk. Sometimes he observes what's around; but then, when there's something we better not listen to, the music playsAnd now it talks.It's a relief when once in a while you see a film and you know the people involved in it wanted to do it. Phillip Seymour Hoffman got the role of his career, or he said so at the SAG Awards; but that doesn't me it is the best role he's ever playedHe knows that, but in 'Capote', there's not one frame without his presence; it's a showcase of the man's talent: he's grateful for itI am personally grateful for it.With the last lines, the movie leaves written an epigraph. Think about it, and try to be in Capote's place. He wanted it to happen; he couldn't cope with it.",8,1,1,22 February 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Gone...
","When I visited the Warner Studios in Los Angeles last year, my family and me had a tour; the guide was explaining to us that most of the stages, at that time, were being used for the movie 'Ocean's 13'. I recognized the Bank Casino in the film; I saw it when they were constructing it. My point is that if they were using all these stages for one movie, it involved big money, big production. Was all of this money unnecessarily spent? No, because they're getting it back with interests.However, 'Ocean's 13' is, by all means, an unnecessary film. We keep getting all these sequels (there are more coming, don't count them) and it's hard to see one doing things right. At least this Ocean travesty is not the embarrassment that was 'Mission Impossible 3', but it's too much for Soderbergh, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the guys; they've taken it too far.I invited a friend to watch the film and he said he didn't want to because he hadn't seen the first two. Well, you don't really need to watch the first two installments to watch this one, if you date to plan to. You see? The only connection between the three pictures is the cast, the director and David Holmes' entertaining and very loud score. The three films were written by different people and involve one or more big heists that develop throughout the piece; you don't need to be a genius to write something funny and the effort is less if persons like a relaxed Clooney, Pitt and Pacino (what a waste) are saying your lines. The formula worked well in the first two movies. A lot of people didn't like 'Ocean's 12' because they said it didn't take itself seriously, and because it used Julia Roberts as herself for a very funny scene. The truth is that 'Ocean's 11' didn't take itself seriously either; it was just Soberbergh and his actors having fun. And the fact that they wanted to travel to Europe and that they invented a plot line to pull the second film off there is so joyful; because cinema can be about having fun and that's the formula these guys chose: slick fun.But when 'Ocean's 13' begins, you can sense something's missing; it's the fun. Maybe it's because the script takes itself too seriously, maybe because it tries to be funny at the same time, or because the actors are not feeling their characters any longer. Maybe the whole movie takes itself seriously (which I doubt), but that naturalness and coziness I mentioned is gone; and the film just doesn't flow.Fortunately, Soderbergh's camera is still a highlight, filling the piece with complex and riveting shots, and the old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould have a blast; but Casey Affleck's Spanish speaking and an entire Mexican plot line is completely out of place. Let's just hope the honorable Soderbergh doesn't get the team back for a fourth round: it's not working anymore.One more thing: there's a character played by David Paymer...It must be one of the most unfortunate characters in movie history...Watch and tell me if I'm wrong.",6,15,30,23 June 2007
Lost in Translation," For a relaxed time...Make it 'Lost in Translation' time
","Every time I write, I think if what I'm going to write has been written. It's important to write your own personal opinion, and that's why many people write the same things. We can think equally, sometimes, and can't help it. Because I have heard lots of things about this film and I have been desperate to see it since it generated all the buzz. 'A masterpiece', said critics and movie fans (well, not every movie fan, because many have found this to be overrated). I can deny these both statements; this is not a masterpiece, neither an overrated movie. But it is really interesting to know what it accomplished because of the risks the people in it took. There are many points to discuss about this movie; it causes you to wonder. This is the type of movie I like to name 'personal experience'. Reality becomes a main character in this piece about characters.Although I haven't seen flaws in the movie (maybe some things were lacking), I couldn't say it is perfect. It has the great moments, the great times (Suntory time?). The script, for example. Winning an Oscar for a script that hardly shines and has an amazing lack of complexity. This is the type of screenplay that inspires me to write, because I like to, but I feel obliged to create emotion in words, and that stops me from starting. This is inspiring because it is not afraid of being simple, and as I said (well, didn't but...'personal experience'), treating with reality. Everyone is afraid of dealing with this. It couldn't work; but someone has to try. What I'd like to write about is real situations about real people, with words we use constantly in our daily lives. This fact itself justifies the awards the script received. It is like breaking the ice. There are not many words written, but the ones that are, are creating worthy sentences.These two characters have a whole world inside of them and destiny has joined them. To be together? I don't think so. Just to stop for a while and realize about their positions and objectives in life. One of them (Bob) has already lived, and does not have a clear objective. Just thoughts. She (Charlotte) is starting to live, but isn't please with life and sees that he could tell her the way it is. Their encounters are slow paced and naturally shot. The third time they meet, he tells her: 'I'm planning a prison escape; we first have to get out of this hotel, then out of the city, then out of the country'. She answers: 'I'm in'. This is the starting point of their relationship. They are escaping from a prison; the prison they are living in. Then they know each other, and their relationship grows into something you can't name. Love? No. Although it is the way we could see it, because of Charlotte's relationship with her husband, and because of Bob's weak feelings for his family. In a lunch scene, after Bob and Charlotte's relationship had been growing, Charlotte is jealous because Bob has slept with a singer (interesting, the thing about the band: 'Sausalito'). It could also be like a father and daughter thing.This is not romance. Drama for sure, and of course comedy. I'm not going to say the acting work is excellent, but it is without doubt funny. Bill Murray (Bob) creates faces. Faces that can make loneliness to seem funny. His faces resemble to the ones Jack Nicholson used to do all the time. Fun in this film comes naturally. This never happens in movies. If you're not laughing is because you're not paying attention to how sad and ridiculous can the life of a person become. Drama makes a place for comedy in this film. It is well handled. We can understand Bob's looks. It's human. Johansson is not great, as I heard she was (maybe because nothing in this movie is). But she has the charm and strength to play this role. She's lost; they're both lost. Stuck, Charlotte says in one scene: 'I'm stuck'. She asks Bob about marriage and kids. She thinks he is in a crisis. He just answers how great a family is, that kids are the joy of life. This is one of the best scenes I've seen. It's the best scene in the movie, also. I was talking about 'personal experience', about reality. This is a realistic scene. The rest is also real, and that's what you should expect.One friend said to me, when we were talking about 'Lost in Translation', that the film had no 'climax'. I should say that it doesn't need one. I wasn't waiting for it.",8,1,2,5 March 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Welcome to hell...
","That Meryl Streep has been Oscar nominated for a role in a movie like 'The Devil Wears Prada' simply speaks of her unique talent as an actress and of lots years and experience in the business to choose the right characters to play. I would have preferred a nomination for her work in 'A Prairie Home Companion'; it would have been a tribute to Robert Altman. But true: the presence she had there isn't comparable to the one she has as this devil.Miranda Priestly is the name of the non-human (is the best expression I can think of) character Streep portrays. Fortunately for her, the movie makes clear that Miranda is not human and it constantly finds a new example so we can see it on screen. So when Andy (Anne Hathaway) arrives to be this devil's new second assistant, a job apparently 'a million girls would kill for', she makes very clear that this is just a normal job for her, because she takes work seriously and she wants to be a journalist.Nevertheless, Miranda ruthlessly throws her a bunch of activities that the most prodigious mind couldn't even remember instantly; and she just tells Andy. That's the way things work at 'Runway', the important fashion magazine where Miranda is the queen. Emily (Emily Blunt), the devil's first assistant (yes, she has two), gives Andy an explanation of the routine on the first day: 'You just stay on the desk and pick up the phone, you can't move if I'm not here'. 'But if I want to go the bathroom?', Andy asks. 'You can't; once a girl chopped her finger with a stapler and had to stay because the phone was ringing'.Two days later, Andy goes to her 15-minute lunch break and when she has chosen her food, Nigel (Stanley Tucci) comes and says she must leave it because Miranda has called and she always arrives fifteen minutes early. When Andy gets to the office, Emily yells at her because she has to pee and she's been holding it for ten minutes. This people can't even eat and they talk almost exactly the way I'm saying they do.What happens is that Andy wears old sweaters and long ugly skirts her boyfriend (Adrian Greiner) loves but that are not classy enough to work in a fashion magazine. Plus, she doesn't care about fashion and she says it out loud, which apparently is a crime. In one scene, Miranda looks at one of Andy's old sweaters and gives her lesson about its origin and about how it relates so deeply to fashion. That one-minute talk alone is worth Streep's Oscar nomination; because in the film's heartless world, she shows no heart.I haven't read Lauren Weisberger's novel, but Aline Brosh McKenna has adapted a work that ended up in a script that has no sense of reality at all. I repeat: a person doesn't work like this, a person doesn't talk like this, a person doesn't live like this, a person doesn't do or say these things. David Frankel directed the film the same way; showing the million different outfits the wonderful costume design offers and shooting each night event with all the glamour and style. It didn't help; I became completely aware of it when the picture introduced an incredibly dreamed character played by Simon Baker.All the cast is exceptional really; it has young British talented actresses, it has Tucci at his best form, it has Anne Hathaway delivering well (and most importantly showing that she's not a vehicle actress and she can do different things) and of course, Meryl Streep. The plot line takes a turn at some point and it becomes shamefully predictable; but it occurs when you don't care about these characters anymore.",5,0,0,27 February 2007
Gone Baby Gone," What would you do?
","This is a film about moral dilemmas, about which side you take and about what you decide to do with the things you know because of how you think they'll affect you in the future; and it's directed by Ben Affleck. I don't point this out as a major thing, but the truth is I never quite liked Affleck neither quite disliked himHis 'Gone Baby Gone' made me choose one side: I like the man. Based on a novel by Denis Lehane (the man who wrote 'Mystic River'), Affleck and Aaron Stockard tell the story of Patrick (Casey Affleck), a private detective who has never left his neighborhood and sometimes takes care of finding those people the rest don't feel they have to find anymore. With his camera, courtesy of John Toll's photography (one with beautifully constructed images and sequences, if I may say), Affleck makes sure that we feel the familiarity that the main character shares with the neighborhood. Peacefully he lets us see the streets, the people who walk them and a sense of security provided by Harry Gregson- Williams' score. But of course, every place that appears really safe never is, and soon Patrick and his girlfriend Angie (an unexpected portrayal by Michelle Monaghan) find themselves in the middle of the solving of the abduction of a little girl that's all over the news. She's Amanda, the daughter of Helene (a solid Amy Ryan, though not amazing as everyone said), a drug addict and clearly unstable woman who took her daughter to the bar where she consumed as she was consuming. The character of Helene is the first and the main moral aspect that Affleck provides in his movie. Throughout the film Patrick will encounter individuals he knows-after all, he's lived in the town his whole life, and he says it- and meet others he doesn't, of whom most also have deep moral concerns. Two key players are Remy Bressant and Jack Doyle, policemen played brilliantly by Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, respectively. Affleck's narrative as a first time director is absolutely impressive, as he puts the Patrick character in the middle of the tale as the individual who not only knows more about what's going on, but apparently wants to know more than the rest. Morality takes over his actions, as he looks like Jack Nicholson's role in 'The Pledge'; a man with a promise to keep, no matter what. What's great about Patrick is that he slowly starts realizing he cares more about what he's investigating than the rest, and this makes him suspect. The thing is that, masterfully after an hour of film, Affleck makes us believe the case is close and provides Patrick with one of those speeches that usually appear when films end. So maybe personally Patrick's not so consumed with his investigation, but he inevitably becomes consumed afterwards, because of some revealing conversations that activate his thoughts again, and because he realizes the person he cares about the most is driving more away from him as time goes by. Without question, there are two keys to the success of 'Gone Baby Gone', more a personal drama than the resolution of an apparent crime (as 'Mystic River' was). The first one is Casey Affleck's starring performance. I wonder what it would be like to be directed by your brother. I suppose it would be fun, because here Casey delivers a perfect portrayal in what represents his first major role in twenty years of acting. The second key (though we already knew about this, because of what Affleck did alongside Matt Damon with 'Good Will Hunting) is the script: so plausible, unpretentious and connected to reality, it shows its magic with emphasis in two conversations; one that Patrick has with the Harris character and another one he has with the Freeman character. And it's like Matsan (who wished the film had ended at the conversation with Freeman) said: in a very good movie that doesn't take sides and leaves the decision to the viewerWhat would you do?",8,0,0,14 August 2008
Léon: The Professional," Besson, the writer/director
","Not every day you see a film that shows, as its opening credits, the actors who star in it, the composer of its score and its writer and director. Those are the only things we see at the beginning of Luc Besson's 'Léon'. Besson, a master filmmaker, a man involved in everything that has to do with movies, a movie lover himself, achieves here what lot of people only dream of; and completes his best film.Taking into account what he's done since, I can be honest and tell you that I haven't seen the four films he directed after 'Léon', all of which have nothing to do with the movie. Considering what he did before I reaffirm my statement, admiring his accomplishment because of the challenge he assumed. If you know Besson, you know there's the producer, the writer and the director. 'Léon' is the perfect combination of the two latter functions, previously seen in films mostly done in France (even though 'Le grand bleu' takes us to various places of the Earth). At this film's opening scene, we're in the United States-it doesn't matter where exactly-and the hit-man Léon (Jean Reno) is talking to his Tony (Danny Aiello), apparently his boss, who's telling him about a job. The style of Besson instantly recognizable, with cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (from 'Nikita') putting in the close-ups to Aiello and Reno's faces and setting the mood. The dialog is quick, sharp. Jean Reno doesn't speak the best English, but his character doesn't require that he does, and it's Besson's merit to confide the role to Reno, who does a perfectly convincing job playing a very difficult character. You see, Besson the writer (and the director too, of course) is a magnificent storyteller. The main character of this movie is not your everyday hit-man, with no feelings and/or psychological disorders: he is just lonely and timid and, though not less serious, he goes to the cinema and watches classics like 'Singing in the rain'. His only friend is a plant and his boss, Tony, with whom he shares a relationship like the one Besson would later detail in his script of that strangely good movie 'Danny the Dog', shared by Jet Li and Bob Hoskins.The other relationship Besson writes and details in 'Léon' is the one between the hit-man and a little girl that will unexpectedly become a part of his life. Her name is Matilda, and she's played by Natalie Portman at the age of 13 in one of those performances (like the one of Anna Paquin in 'The Piano') that let you predict the kind of actress someone will turn out to be; a wonderfully original construction of a plausible, mature for her age, charming and desperate human being. I want to leave all the scenes both of the characters share for you to discover. I'll only mention one, just to make reference to my admiration towards Besson's accomplishment with his best movie. In the scene, Mathilda suggest that they play a game. Instantly, she puts different costumes on (we never know exactly where they come from, but it doesn't matter), so Léon can guess who she's imitating. She does Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Chaplin; and then Léon does John Wayne. This is Besson's homage to the American culture, to American films and characters he admires. And it's not the only one, neither the only moment; in fact, Reno's Léon is his personal and free of compromise version of all the Michael Corleones and Travis Bickles of the world, just to mention a couple of names of characters that don't even kill people for a living. In that aspect, Besson the writer and the director unite, and we get the writer/director; the storyteller and the atmosphere creator. It's not for nothing that the only name we see of his crew besides his is Eric Serra's. Serra's music, a crucial element in Besson's filmography, takes the lead here again, sounding at full force when its required, building the atmosphere and the tension alongside Besson in the perfect action sequences and not doing anything when emotions and close-ups speak for themselves. The movie also makes room for beautiful shots in little unexpected moments and exploits the talent of Gary Oldman as an overacted villain that could well be a ridiculed version of the serious villains out there. Understand that Besson never intends for the viewer to believe the film's situations (something he would aim for in a film like 'Le grand bleu') and their sometimes impossible resolutions (here the word storyteller fits him perfectly), but in the midst of everything we do, or at least we want to. And the credit is all his.",9,2,3,21 August 2008
Footloose," Big holes...
","The opening credits of 'Footloose' are a blast. The camera shoots the feet of several people doing different dance steps while a catchy music plays on the back. There's a chance you miss the credits because the movement of the feet may distract you; I think that's effective. I also think the first ten minutes of the film are effective: with the camera showing different views of what's clearly a small town and then taking us to church, where Reverend Moore (John Lithgow) gives a speech about how dancing corrupts the spirit of young children. When the mass is over, we see the Reverend's beautiful daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) and her friends in a car racing tough guy Chuck's van (Jim Youngs), and unexpectedly Ariel gets out of the car through the window and stands in the middle of the two vehicles, knowing that a truck is coming from the other side. She doesn't die, but we understand the movie makes a statement: a girl is angry at her father because he is forbidding freedom among teenagers, and controls her all the time and doesn't let her live her life. This is not an unfamiliar plot line, and although it's interesting, the movie provides something more interesting yet: Ren McCormack. Played by Kevin Bacon with the enough amount of cockiness and the necessary humanity, Ren is the new guy in this little town and he's about to bring trouble because he dances well and he wants everyone to dance. However, that's as interesting as it gets. I won't tell you anything else about the plot because I believe everybody needs to experience a film in their own way and draw their own conclusions, but I have to tell you that my experience of 'Footloose' was a disappointing one. Yes, there's good music and choreographies, and Kevin Bacon's work is risky and worthy of admiration (so is Chris Penn's as his best friend Willard), but there's absolutely nothing more. As we wait for a new song to start playing, direct Herbet Ross struggles to keep our attention and cover the big holes in Dean Pitchford's script (there are moments where this is impossible and we're stuck with excessive minutes of background music). Take any conversation, any situation; only one is enough to see how narrow-minded Pitchford's writing is. And it's not narrow-minded because the characters inhabit a narrow-minded little town: it's narrow-minded in its nature, and it makes it impossible to us to connect with any of the characters or even remember their names (try to remember the name of Ren's mother by the end of the movie). Matsan asked me one time about the name of a guy that appears a lot in the film, but it seems more an accessory than a character. After one day in school, Ren is driving the streets with a bunch of guys we don't care about. Okay, maybe we shouldn't, but the script's greatest fault is failing in the development of the one character we should at least relate to. If you think about an instant reason for Ren and his mother to be in a new town, you won't find it. And the movie provides reasons for this situation and many others, but it does it during the wrong moments. Every time an honest confession comes out of a character's mouth, we're not ready for it and we're not able to fully digest it. I felt there was a problem of connection between each scene; that everything was either moving too fast or moving in an unexpected way, like the confession. Sometimes the unexpected is good: not here. You seeSatine had feelings, she was trapped in a situation and we felt for her (this is 'Moulin Rouge!'); Roxie Hart had aspirations, dreams (this is 'Chicago'). Ren McCormack apparently has all this things too, but when the film gives him the possibility to stand by them, two times; the first one he's not convincing enough and the second one the movie skips the scene. Of course you could say it's a musical and the story is less important and not to be taken seriously and other things, and that's why I put the examples above; but this is partly. The fact is, and this can be denied because it's something patent throughout the film, that the story of 'Footloose' and the emotions of the characters are filled with seriousness: it's the filmmakers' intention for us to take it seriously.And if that's not so, then I've seen another movie.",5,0,5,29 June 2008
The Color of Money," A character piece
","Truly, I haven't seen much of Martin Scorsese's filmography, but I have heard he's great and has never been recognized. One day I'll catch all of his directed films. In this 'catching' process, I had the chance to watch 'The Color of Money', which should be important for reasons as: the movie that gave Paul Newman's his first and only Academy Award; or the very good performances and character development.As soon as the movie opens, there's a guy talking (Martin Scorsese, wow) about a game, but, for some reason, you can also sense he's talking about life. Paul Newman's performance is splendid. He creates a man that has lived too much, but enjoys life and just wants to live it until the end. We watch him: he seems like any other man. We listen to him: he knows things the rest doesn't. He has a normal job, but also invests; in excellence, we learn. When someone asks him about his excellence, he declares: 'I study people's character'.Vincent's excellence is pool. 9-Ball, to be accurate. When he and Eddie (Newman) meet, he's just a player. A pure player who makes some money playing, but doesn't know he could make much more. There's a world he doesn't know. As Eddie invests in excellence, he wants to take Vincent on a tour. Cities, tournaments...Money. Maybe it's all about money. Eddie is, or was, a player, we realize, and we learn. He will try to teach Vincent the secrets of the game, how to do it.And Carmen. Well, she is the center. She's Vincent girlfriend ('We've been together for a year'). She met him when she was robbing his house. Vincent loves her, and decides to join the tour because he's afraid of loosing her. Does Carmen love Vincent? Maybe. There's also the chance that she loves him for the money she can make with him. But she says good things about him all the time. I think they're both really in love, and that this journey tests their love.This journey is about achieving the human sides of the people involved in it. It's great to hear a script talking about persons with pure knowledge about some special things. This is a character piece in every way and the greatest time you'll probably have it watching that part (if 'that' isn't just the whole piece). Yes, it is also about the game, but not that much. Because first they have to reach a human level before they can get to the game.Now, about the supporting performances (because there are other performances but not as deep and not as important). I like to think that there was a time when Tom Cruise could act, and wasn't much of an image. I mean, in the last years he did some good roles, but not that good; Come on! He has this habit; he screams when he's trying to show some emotion. It really works, or at least, worked here and in 'Jerry Maguire' (probably his best performance). He's fine here, he was still an actor at that time, and chose good roles. The truth is I don't like him very much, but sometimes he can really work it out.Mastrantonio is calmed in her role. Calmed and natural. An excellent performance. I would say that her character is rational and intelligent. She wants something more exciting, and she needs to find it.I loved Forest Whitaker cameo as Amos, had to say it.There's one scene, when Vincent is playing against a guy, and the camera starts to move in circles, showing Newman's face in a background, and also showing alternate faces of all the characters. The camera is looking for emotion.That's character film-making.",8,0,0,13 February 2005
Cold Mountain," Two Words: Anthony Minghella
","I want to talk about Anthony Minghella, a British director, and his influence and impact on American cinema. He is one of the most awarded directors of our time, and has done films that will be classics years from now or already are (now I know that I must see 'The English Patient'). But personally, it took one screening of 'Cold Mountain' so I could realize all his qualities as a director. First of all; perfect management of the actors. Jude Law is the finest example for this, if we explain that his two Oscar nominations as an actor were earned for his work in two of Minghella's pieces. Once in an interview, the director said: 'When I saw Jude Law, I didn't feel he was right for the role. I liked him, but he wasn't what I was looking for. But then, when I pictured Dickie, I couldn't imagine any face but his, so I called him'. And he was right, and Law's performance was great; so was Matt Damon's, and the portrayals of the whole cast. You'll never be disappointed in terms of cast when you watch an Anthony Minghella film. This is why the man has no problem in getting the best people on the industry, if only for a few minutes appearance. I'm surprised this cast didn't even get nominated for Best Ensemble in the SAG Awards. In the course of the story, we get to meet lots of wonderful characters, played sometimes for two minutes by names like Jena Malone, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi; and larger parts by names like Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone (are you reading these names?), where Gleeson clearly stands out. Continuing with actors, what I most enjoyed was when Law's character meets the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, and Nicole Kidman's meets Renée Zellweger's respectively. I enjoyed it because it was amazing to see the scenes changing and watching stars of the caliber of Law and Kidman, each of them on their own, alongside the other two, not big stars, but actors I respect and like more watching on screen. I compared the talents because Hoffman is, well, a master in acting. And topic apart, Zellweger had made clear since 'Jerry Maguire' that she urged for a deserved Oscar. Although she should have won it one or two years ago, her award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes is more than well earned. A lot of power as always; in her words, in her looks, in her way of standingShe's so confident about what she does and that makes her perfect. At last! Then I can't forget the main stars. I don't really respect Nicole Kidman, but I pretend to accept her because she is considered an excellent actress by a ninety percent of the people. I can realize she changes a lot between performances. Changes everything, but forgets some very important details I will explain when I write about another of her movies; because her performance here is good, and helps the picture a lot. One thing I'll say; I keep on examining her beauty in all of her films, and I'll tell a friend of mine, again: She's not more beautiful than Katie Holmes. I didn't mention before, but I thought it was understood: this is Jude Law's best performance. Every part of his performance is understood too; this was a challenge (a big one) for the actor. I'd like to compare it with Adrien Brody's in 'The Pianist'. When a character suffers the changes these both characters suffer, it needs to be expressed by the actor. Brody, I've said before, seemed inexpressive in his film, with all the beard and hair in his ruined moment. With the same beard and a lot of hair, Law excels in showing he's ruined, this becomes noticeable in the way he introduces himself to people, the way he talks to them; and that's the strength and brilliance in Law's work here.From the way Law talks, we go to the screenplay, adapted by Mighella from a novel, as he did in some of his previous works. There are no hero intentions in this tale, no false words, no impossible love story. Everything is close to reality, which makes the piece a lot more powerful. In one scene, when an old lady is helping Inman (Law), she asks him: 'Why are you going to Cold Mountain?', and he answers, almost crying: 'To find a womanAnd I barely even know her'. It's all very convincing; every moment. Going back to the main point; in the sceneries, the breathtaking war scenes and everything achieved by Minghella, show the committed director he is, and how he deserved and Oscar nod with this feature. He carried on a story that talks not just about love, but about several life aspects; and a very powerful work in every sense. With a constant melancholic tone, directed by Nicole Kidman's voice, that, even in the ending, talks about good positive things, but the music and the environment of the movie makes us think negative. I believe that's something terrifying but somehow fantastic at the same time.",8,2,3,24 September 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," The Question, Part 3
","Watching 'Little Miss Sunshine' you understand that a movie sometimes doesn't need a lot. Not special effects, not a big production, not an A-list ensemble and lots of other things make the movie something to talk about; but what definitely makes it an unforgettable experience is Abigail Breslin's fabulous performance. She is nine years old, for god's sake.This could be the 'Sideways' of this year, I mean. It is a road-movie; the writer finds the characters an excuse to make a trip that obliges them to talk and, like we say here; 'take the dirty laundry out', which means speaking about everything bad we think of people. In this case, it is a family; and a very dysfunctional one, unluckily.Abigail Breslin is Olive, the excuse for the trip, because she is participating in the singing and dancing contest, 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is the one who's teaching her the moves. His son Richard (Greg Kinnear) lives by a philosophy of not being a looser, when, sadly, he is one. Sheryl (Toni Colette), his wife, is a liberal housewife with a brother, Frank (Steve Carell), who tried to kill himself but failed. Their other son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), doesn't talk and will stay this way until he fulfills his dreams.With this over the top character personalities, the screenplay could have been an exaggeration of reality; but no. It is indeed a representation of reality, in the words of Michael Arndt, who is Oscar-nominated for his first and only work. Going back to the 'Sideways' comparison; as this film, 'Sideways' was nominated for best picture, best supporting actor and actress and for best director, but it won for best adapted screenplay.Analyzing it, Arndt has an advantage: his tale is original. It comes from I don't know where, but it tells the story of a family that somehow you end up loving; and I don't know how he does it. Alexander Payne was nominated for best director, and although Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton aren't, to pursue this after experiencing only with musical videos has merit.Their control of the still cameras is admirable and I expected lots of changes of frames, having read the artists they had made videos for. In the world of musical videos we find a lot of movement, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' appreciates stillness; and it does justice to it. However, it doesn't appreciate silence so much.The music is too weird and seems inappropriate sometimes, but I guess that's one of those things only the filmmakers understand. This is just an analysis, but probably 'Little Miss Sunshine' isn't great as a film, but many of its elements make it really good. Particularly the castI said that I had to watch this cast before I could say 'The Departed' was the ensemble of the year. Now I watched it, and this one is better.There are little moments for all the actors, and there are unexpected portrayals: you're not getting what you expect from Steve Carell; Toni Colette is great (watch her movements when she's not talking); Greg Kinnear moves, Alan Arkin gets the laughs, Paul Dano has a big future and I already talked about Abigail Breslin.I guess that in the end, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a very nice film that doesn't pretend. It is simple but with complex characters and, like 'Sideways', it made his mouth to mouth and critically praised road to the Academy AwardsBut is it the Best Picture Oscar of the year?",8,0,1,7 February 2007
Disturbia," A pleasure to watch...Suspense,Thriller
","Unlike, say, 'Smokin Aces', 'Disturbia' manages its elements well and it's a pleasure to watch. This is because DJ Caruso is an intelligent, effective guy who delivers. He's not the most inventive director out there but, and this is a compliment, 'Disturbia' with someone more inventive directing, would have been another movieA worse movie.However, after some very disturbing (matches with the title) couple of scenes, Kale (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself in the situation of 'house arrest', which is not good for any teenager. The monotony is boring but well managed, with scenes like Kale marking his territory because, if he goes ten meters away from his house, a device he wears goes red and the police come running. Then Ronnie (Aaron Yo) comes along, and they discover Ashley (model turned actress Sarah Roemer), and they sense something wrong about a neighbor (David Morse)And they start watching.Once this basic premise is established, things start flowing. More than once, the storyline turns repetitive, but we don't mind because 'Disturbia' doesn't play games. Christopher Landon's story and his script alongside Carl Ellsworth don't take us for fools by surprising us unnecessarily, but they make sure we enjoy the ride. In other words, the film has no twist but justifies its killings and the amount of gore.This amount of gore, however, is a trick; because the scary thing is in the unexpected images and score (the prolific Geoff Zanelli), not in the visual blood. The movie is PG-13 but it generates more jumps than so many R rated stuff. Again, this is the director; and that's not the only thing he does well (false perception)During one moment, everything is dark and a light is turned on; try to remember a moment like that and tell me if that's shot is not perfect. Also the sense of timeWhen a cop is walking down a hall and the killer is haunting someone, the cameras change several times, but they are both moving; because it is how it is and time in film shouldn't stop.Another thing that 'Disturbia' excels at (and that's why it's better than good), which also has to do with false perception, is in not giving you what you want. If you are the kind of person that likes to guess what the next scene is like, 'Disturbia' will mess with you, because when you're expecting something, it will put a cut to black and you won't have it; but you'll feel like the movie knew you were expecting it.I can't forget that the work of the cast is a big part of 'Disturbia's' success. At this point, I still don't know if LaBeouf's talent is for real. But he is convincing, his voice is powerful and I respect him because he always gets to kiss some gorgeous women. Women like Sarah Roemer, who, for our luck, can act. And Aaron Yo is very funny; and Carrie Anne Moss, who plays LaBeouf's mom, is full of grace; and David Morse is one of the creepiest guys in cinema when he wants to...Guess what? In 'Disturbia' he really wants to.",8,4,6,28 August 2007
Edward Scissorhands," On its own...
","If someone asked me what my favorite movie score is, I would instantly say Danny Elfman's 'Edward Scissorhands'. People don't normally recall scores, but there's no way for anyone to forget Tim Burton's film musical introduction and all of its wonderful moments that seem like a dream. 'Edward Scissorhands' could be someone's dream: one of those long dreams that you don't want to wake up of.Caroline Thompson (she's adapted novels as 'Black Beauty', the characters of 'The Addams Family' and the haunting 'The Secret Garden'), a very gifted woman, created the story of this film after having worked with Burton in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'; recently she's written 'Corpse Bride'. The three pieces are of a fantastic nature and situations that you probably wouldn't encounter at the corner of your house, but then that's the same with almost any Tim Burton film. Edward is the classic Burton outcast, a character that fits in his movies whether it comes from real life or from a fable. Basically, he's got scissor hands, and when a charming lady (Dianne West 's Peggy) meets him, she takes him with her home to make him part of her family What are the chances? The father (Alan Arkin) is a grumpy and strict man, the son (Robert Oliveri) is a very curious kid; the daughter is the perfectly beautiful teenager Kim (Winona Ryder, of course) who, when meeting Edward, looks at him in a very special way.Soon, Edward finds his place in Peggy's extremely superstitious neighborhood and gets along with its extremely over the top inhabitants. Because, like any other outcast, Edward has a talent; he can do magical things with his scissors (give form to plants, cut hair for people and dogs), which can be positive and negative, exciting and dangerousYou don't want to see Edward angry or upset; but that's the way he feels because, like Pinocchio wanted to be a real boy, he wants to have real hands.This desire grows even bigger when he discovers that he has a fundamental reason for it: someone to share his heart with, his love feelings. With all this elements into place, the picture takes us into a short but exciting ride of powerful emotions that change very frequently. And that's where the magic comes from.Together with Thompson, Burton here shows his capacity of going from one cinematic mood to another in minutes: he goes from humor to sadness, from sadness to romance, from romance to tragedy and from tragedy to total madness. It's true that the narrative may not flow so well, but in 'Edward Scissorhands' it is a helpful characteristic, mainly because of what I've just explained.Besides this, the movie's best moments come from Johnny Depp's extraordinarily understated interpretation, that paved the way for the rest of Burton's iconic main characters (Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, Willy Wonka) and made him a usual collaborator; Winona Ryder's gift for creating innocence and, yes, Danny Elfman's flawless score. I watched the movie for the fifth time a few weeks ago. When it ended, a friend said: 'It's a masterpiece'. It may not be Tim Burton's masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece on its own.",9,0,0,4 August 2007
The White Ribbon," Oh, yes...It's like that
","Michael Haneke is still asking the same questions. The context, the people involved in the stories he tells, they don't matter; or at least not as much as what lies behind them. We can easily discover this if we try to read the script of 'The White Ribbon', an original story by Haneke that is told, from the beginning, by the voice in off of a teacher. Eventually we learn that this teacher is a part of the story, but he doesn't even remember it well. We could imagine any other details if the images and the settings weren't the ones we see on screen and we were left only with the narrated dialogue. There's a small village, apparently normal and functional, when suddenly strange accidents begin to happen. That's all we need to know about the plot of Haneke's latest adventure: an adventure for him, to shoot, an adventure for the viewer to experience; a very particular adventure that doesn't have any element we might identify with the word 'adventure' in cinema. But it's always nice to remember that cinema itself is an adventure; and that comes before any genre definitions. With absolutely no music and with a beautiful, classic black and white cinematography (thank you Christian Berger, for providing a work that we don't need to detail in words because it's right there), Haneke deploys his cinematographic strategy. The strategy has to do, naturally, with the questions he's going to ask. What's important is that it is cinematographic. Viewers, critics, people in general have always been discussing the same thing: how filmmakers leave the viewer wondering, without being able to understand some things when a film is over. Why did this character do that? Why did that character say that? Why did the other one left that thing in that place?There are directors who have always offered more questions than answers, providing a way of filming and a depiction of characters that justify not knowing. I think the Richard Kelly of 'Donnie Darko', or most of David Lynch. These authors not only talk about many things; they also try to distort life, the nature of things as we know them. I mean, they are the guys we shouldn't ask 'why did you put the red rose in that drawer?' or those types of questions that they probably can't answer. The eternal discussion mentioned above also has to do with the fact that we can't pretend a director to control every decision and visual aspect of a film.However, and although this may not be true, Haneke always seems in control. This is related to the fact that the world he depicts can never make the viewer doubt what we call verisimilitude. The village in 'The White Ribbon' is a possible place because its basic way of functioning and the people who make it function are the things that make any small village function, with a system that prevails in many places of the world today, whatever the technical development. There's a Baron (a landlord) and his wife, there's a Pastor and his wife, there's a Doctor and his family, there's a Farmer, there's a school and there's a Teacher. Yes, as I said and as it occurs with every story, things happen. But I leave the development for the viewer's enjoyment. Let me just say I admire 'The White Ribbon' for several reasons, all which have to do with the same thing. If we think for a minute, Haneke is talking to us about the most basic things and feelings in life, those that come from the core of human relationships and kids can understand and explain in an early stage of their lives (it's not casual that many of the characters –some very important- in the film are little kids). But he does this with such rigor and command of the cinematographic language that everything acquires a new dimension. One can never question that 'The White Ribbon' belongs to a high level of movies we tend to relate with art, or whatever...It's designed that way. And within that design, among the mysteries floating in every perfectly composed shot, we understand. The ending arrives and comprehension arrives with it in a magnified form; magnified by the experience of the (a) movie. Michael Haneke (whom I consider, as you may perceive, a very generous filmmaker) is still asking the same questions, never offering answers about a (our) world that sometimes finds its most complex representations entangled with what's most simple and pure.The questions this time around sound a bit more like assertions. Not definite statements but warnings. And I believe (or I would be contradicting myself and this review) that these warnings are also in the level of the basic things, and they are only a few, maybe one. Yes, of course we had our suspicions, but learning about it like this makes it resonant, powerful...Utterly unbearable.",8,0,5,3 May 2010
Being John Malkovich," That crazy old Charlie
","It is very possible that cinema will never be able to find a writer like Charlie Kaufman again, and if it does, it will be someone too similar to him. Kaufman knows no limits, knows no endings (believe me, his scripts would never end if he could take that decision) and thinks, as a screenwriter, in creating material that at the end of the day is purely cinematographic. Luckily, he's always found apt directors to bring his words to life: Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze (sorry, George Clooney doesn't count because Kaufman's script for the actor/director's first film is adapted).In 'Being John Malkovich', Kaufman's imagination takes flight and images go right along flying with it. It's not the writer's intention to arouse questions of philosophical, even metaphysical nature. There's a scene in which Craig (John Cusack), the film's main character, explains Maxine (Catherine Keener) about a portal he found that leads him to John Malkovich's head. He tells her he went into the portal with a piece of wood and came back without it and, because he's strangely in love with her, he tries to impress her by making a speech about how this may change his life.It is in that speech that Craig asks, one after another, philosophical questions that are a clear joke; fact that's evidently seen because Maxine is laughing at him. The poor guy, a puppeteer, hasn't been able to impress her and goes back home to make a puppet of himself and Maxine; only to recreate an impossible sexual encounter. At home Craig's awaited by his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), some kind of veterinarian or pet lover who keeps a dog, a parrot, a chimp and who knows what else inside the house.Character development is perfect. Maxine is cold, disinterested, unimpressed and at the same time mysterious; an office femme fatale that Keener portrays perfectly. Craig is an insecure, depraved, depressive, almost sick artist; and his wife is very much like him (each Cusack and Diaz probably deliver their best performances). What Kaufman does is develop a classic, tragic love triangle an puts John Malkovich in the middle, as a the connection between the three players, a vehicle for the realization of their passions.It could have been any other person, but the fact that the actor is famous works as a plot device for something crucial, and that is people paying to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. So there's no philosophical meditation in 'Being John Malkovich', just a gifted screenwriter messing with himself and automatically messing with our minds too. This means, of course, that there's a moment where everything kind of goes to hell; but we're able to accept it.If you would care to look for a subject though, it would be more 'psychological'. There's a lot in the film that Kaufman later took to each one of his scripts, things that mentioned separately are scarier than the amusing visual rides directors make us experience: sexual obsession, childhood memories and some other things that are hidden in the subconscious. It's delirious, but in one scene we even see a close up of a chimp that a second later is remembering the most tragic experience of his childhood.",8,1,2,13 March 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Apatow films
","The ending of this film totally ruins the experience. These guysThey like to have fun with film-making, singing stupid songs like 'Afternoon Delight' in that scene from 'Anchorman'; but that strategy won't work all the time. It doesn't work at all in the ending of 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', a honestly made comedic film.So about these guysJudd Apatow has a company that produces films, films like 'Anchorman'. I think the man is proposing a new way of real comedy, with intelligent humor. The intelligence sometimes ironically proposes that stupidity can be the correct way of making people laugh. Apatow knows this, and he knows the people that can achieve it.'Anchorman' was written by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell. The cast included Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carell. Apatow produced Will Ferrell's recent 'Kicking & Screaming'; gave Paul Rudd a role; lend David Koechner a cameo; and co-wrote with Steve Carell his first full-length feature, about a virgin with forty years.Carell stars; he's becoming quite 'the funny guy' these days. He produced this film, and it seems he wants to make a fool out of himself by playing the fool, but that's exactly the reason; because he knows he has a gift for absurd comedy and he knows he'll make us laugh out loud with character like Andy in a movie like this. It is called self-confidence, and it is a great and basic quality in a comedian.I don't know any 40 year old man who's a virgin. I know adults that have their toys, adults that have their action figures, but no virgins. It is an issue, a serious one, and one that can be ridiculed in excess. Apatow and his partners deal with it truthfully, from the point of view of love relationships, making the ride very sincere.Carell's Andy works with pals David (the always natural Paul Rudd), Jay (a funny Romany Malco), Cal (the very promising Seth Rogen) and the foreigner Mooj (Gerry Bednop), who always encourages people to have sex with a goat (situations that repeat constantly so we understand the film's language). Besides being 40, Andy's social situation is difficult.When Cal talks to him about the weekend, he says he went to Tijuana and saw a woman having sex with a horse. 'What did you do?', he asks Andy. 'Well, I felt I really needed an egg sandwich, so I bought the egg and spent three and a half hours making the sandwich, but then I didn't feel like eating it; and I didn't even have bread'. Cal pretends to shoot himself while Andy doesn't look.These situations the virgin experiences with all his co-workers, developing a friendship that originally comes from their objective: getting this man in bed. Eventually Trish comes into his life. She's played convincingly by Catherine Keener, and has kids and Andy starts dealing with them, the relationship grows but with absolutely no sex involved. This is all very well written and is the best of the film; Andy's talks with Trish's daughter Marla (Kat Dennings) and ultimately a scene of a misunderstanding that delivers an unforgettable line, by an unimportant character: 'Dude, teach me!' It's awesome.The time will come for Andy to reveal the truth and you'll laugh constantly meanwhile, and in the end you'll realize that this is a good comedy of good intentions, that Judd Apatow is more a planner than a director (he directed correctly and simply an idea he wanted to develop), and that Steve Carell is a natural comedian; and he's got it going on.",7,1,3,19 December 2005
Jarhead," 'There's a story...'
","There were moments in 'Jarhead' where I said: 'What a great movie'. I said the same thing during moments of 'American Beauty' and 'Road to perdition' but, as a whole, all of Sam Mendes' pictures are not great. They are three works of excellent cinematography and performances, that's for sure; but there's always something missing. I don't know how to explain it exactly; maybe it's like 'Munich'That it looks too perfect to be perfect. But I believe that in Mendes' films there's an emotion problem. So many characters in all of his works, so many moving moments, but no emotion passed on to the one who's watching the film. Nothing the viewer can feel (or at least I can't), just an amount of coldness in a very beautiful world, just good-looking characters that go through very bad thing that normally you wouldn't expect them to experience.'Jarhead' the word, as Anthony Swofford explains in a typical Mendes' piece narration, is a name people use to talk of a Marine. 'Jarhead' the film is, apparently, Swofford's (a Marine) true-life experiences in the war in Kuwait. In a precisely adapted script by William Broyles Jr. that involves more and more narration, this Marine goes back on his life and tells us there are things he can show us and think he can.Played by Jake Gyllenhaal in his best portrayal, Swofford reveals his persona through his talking, and instantly appears as a sardonic and unpredictable guy, usually positive and disinterested. 'We'll be back before you can get those nuts out of your system', he tells another soldier on the plane going to the desert; they stayed there for a long time.In war Swofford meets the soldier friends: some 'latinos', a cowboy (Lucas Black), some outcasts, some sentimentalists and Troy, an unsettling man played naturally by Peter Sarsgaard. They all discuss about the girls they left home and about the family they want to haveSwofford also meets Sergeant Sykes who, for our fortune, is not the typical life- changing that usually appears in these films and that will change the life of the soldiers; and he's played by an ineffable Jamie Foxx.The days come and go as Swofford describes every activity carried out in the camp, and then as it must be, soldiers fight. You know what always happens in war movies, well 'Jarhead' stands in the middle; without too many action sequences and without too much character and relationship development. The cinematography however, as I said, is superb. There's one moment of complete silence and contemplation where after staring at a disturbing view, Gyllenhaal walks in the desertHis footprints on the sand and the sight of him are pure photographic poetry; and I said 'what a great movie'.The reason why this is Gyllenhaal's best performance is because he gives 'Jarhead' what it lacks the most: emotion. He tries so hard in bringing a little bit of true feeling to a plate that doesn't contain it; and he succeeds. And so did Kevin Spacey in 'American Beauty', and Tom Hanks in 'Road to perdition'; and they succeeded too. It's contradictory that Mendes has directed these actors in this way and hasn't been able to give the same direction to his movies.",7,0,0,16 August 2007
The Machinist," Focused observation...
","It's a work of special care, making a movie like 'The Machinist'. A work of confidence and bravery, of knowing the same mistakes aren't going to be made. The story of Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a machinist, and the problems his insomnia brings to him and the ones around him; establishes a fine premise and character development, but then it goes deep and it becomes dark and (at times) unconvincingBut it doesn't make the same mistakes that movies of its genre commonly make these days.Like those movies, 'The Machinist' relies on focused observation, which is okay if you're the kind of viewer who likes to 'watch'. Director Brad Anderson, from the warm 'Next Stop Wonderland', proves he's able to control various moods and feelings in the same movie. With big help from Roque Baños' score, Anderson accentuates the drama, the suspense, the little amount of horror and the loneliness the story contains.A story of a man so lonely that he could invent a parallel worldThis is, briefly, what Scott Kosar proposes in his screenplay; and Christian Bale gives Trevor the unpredictability only he can achieve, in a performance that's not superb but that requires the responsibility than no one else has for a role. How the guy who wrote this is the same writer of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake? We don't answer those questions, because people need to work. But this, Kosar's best screenplay, is what lets us see that mistakes can be omitted.For example, in the place where Trevor works, a place as lonely as himself, he's not the only one the camera and the movie care about. There are other people there, and they live and talk and participate; unlike films where everything is about the main character and the characters the plot requires. The same in the street, where everyone carries on with their lives normally, but they are thereThey exist! How interesting the contrast that the movie is so lonely, and its main character too, but he never finds the time to be alone. He suffers from insomnia, he's about to fall asleep, but something always wakes him up. 'We always suffer from insomnia from time to time', Stevie (another main character nicely developed, played by Jeniffer Jason Leigh) tells Trevor. 'Stevie', he says. 'I haven't slept in a year'.Then he goes to the airport coffee shop, Maria (another main character, also nicely developed, played by Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) serves the coffee and he just looks at it; and the clock, which appears to be stuck at the same hour, at the same minute. 'The Machinist' is like the awful 'Darkness', produced entirely in Spain and worked by the best technical team that exists there. Better than 'Darkness', the film could have been directed by Christopher Nolan; and it would have been even better.",7,1,2,2 October 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Well done Cuarón...
","I don't feel the need of writing about Harry Potter movies. I have read the books, I have been (in my mind) inside the magical world, I have witnessed the experiencesNow I'll try to write about the third part of J.K Rowling's fantasy. Why this and not any of the others? Probably because it is the best movie (not novel) of the first three and because I plan to write about the others eventually.People have asked me why I think this one's the best, as in asking for reasons. I don't know if I can give a list of things that define this one as the better one. I can explain it saying that it's something you sense; on the whole. This is a well rounded project in all of its parts; and it's not even perfect.Anyway, here I go with everything I think; like it or not. Alfonso Cuarón is a truly gifted filmmaker. 'A little princess' is one of the most wonderful things I've seen in my life, it still amazes me today; 'Y tu mamá también' has no shameMaybe that gift made him take Harry Potter from where it needed to be taken.So he grabbed his work strictly from the view of film-making. I explain: in the first two deliveries, Chris Columbus took a commitment with Rowling's story; Cuarón took a commitment with the plain fact of making a movie. What he chose is much darker, obscure, and mysterious; apart from Columbus' shining universe.There are deep moving issues in the novels, and Columbus knew it, but didn't show it; now there are long talks about the characters' past. The screenplay is shorter and not so 'by the book' as the last two; which explains clearly the freedom Cuarón took for the film. There's an intense development of personalities, which is a positive aspect for every element of the movie.Take the young actors that this is just as the only thing they've done in their lives and I still can't say if they've got the skill. Daniel Radcliffe's character actually faces his past for the first time in this film, and that requires a different approach. Rupert Grint's character has to deal with problems of the heart; with feelings. Emma Watson's character takes the helm of everything, has to handle a different kind of responsibility; and they all have to reach other levels.A blessing is to see the ensemble coming to life. A blessing is to imagine and think about the actors that will play the characters you've met in the book. A blessing was to see Emma Thompson in a wonderful portrayal as Professor Trelawney, to meet Sirius Black in the skin of a curly-haired Gary Oldman and meet the revelation of the journey David Thewlis portraying R.J Lupin. Plus, Alan Rickman's Snape is better every minute; Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith maintain the class and Robbie Coltrane keeps his fun going.Not to mention the visualsTo achieve his perfect world, Cuarón recurred to his old editing collaborator Steven Weisberg, who got his vision perfectly, taking everything to the sky. The cinematography by Michael Seresin is also a remarkable; in the best representation of this tale that has been able to keep one thing going during its three deliveriesFrame by frame, shot by shot, moment by moment, nothing stays still; there's always some element that connects the image with another thing to keep a continuous movement.Look closely.",8,0,2,10 December 2005
Ratatouille," Unusually unforgettable...I feel like cooking
","Maybe it's possible for anyone to cook, but we can't deny that there would have to be a clear agreement on what the expression 'cooking' means. If we're talking about the kind of cooking Remy -the main character of 'Ratatouille'- does, it certainly becomes unimaginable that, excuse my repetition, 'Anyone can cook' (the title of Chef Gusteau's book and Remy's inspiration). But as food critic Anton Ego says, 'great cooking can come from unexpected places'. And I still haven't mentioned Remy is a rat.Brad Bird's 'Ratatouille' is the most unusual of Pixar's productions and one of the strangest animated full-length pictures ever made. Unlike Pixar's previous achievements, it doesn't a hero in a crusade, with a final objective in mind. Remy wants to be a cook and expresses his desire to the amazement of others (his sense of smell is so good that he becomes the 'poison detector' of his family's food, and that's as far as his father recognizes his talent), but it's not the film's overall goal, where everything is usually directed. Remy doesn't even make friends during his journey (to call it a name), so we don't get a wide gallery of characters; only Chef Gusteau (deceased and an imaginary friend that can't really help the rat) and Linguini, a young guy who's Gusteau's unrecognized son and ends up cooking the dishes Remy's always dreamed of in the most unexpected of situations, thus providing a sort of conflict for the movie and the figure of a villain in Chef Skinner.All of this takes place in 'Gusteau's', the restaurant of the deceased chef, which is almost the only scenario of the film, that Bird exploits without rest (watch one scene in which plenty of rats are hiding in the kitchen and try their best not to be noticed: it's classic animation, classic Disney). Because it's not much what the Bird and the movie need to create an instant classic; everything is reduced to basics and works. One relationship (between Remy and Linguini) and the struggles it involves for each one to get what he wants.It's also in this aspect that 'Ratatouille' stands out as one of the most original animation pieces ever made. We've seen animals talking to each other a thousand times, and in a lot of occasions we've seen them trying to talk to humans, but humans never understand. However, even when they might miraculously get human help to achieve their goals, their success occurs entirely in the animal world, wherever that is, among animals. We never forget everything is fiction, but in 'Ratatouille' Remy's dream comes true (with human help) in the real world; in France, in Paris.I liked 'Happy Feet' because Mumble danced along and helped his race because of his own merit. But those penguins saw humans as 'aliens', and didn't understand the weapons they used to harm them (in fact, they even saw some of them as gifts). Remy and his family know what men do to rats, but deep inside this 'little chef' believes that there's some good in the world. And he makes it throughAmong humans.",9,1,2,13 March 2009
Tropic Thunder," 'I'm a lead farmer, ....' - Kirk Lazarus
","The only reason I didn't value 'Zoolander' so much is because I didn't think it was a difficult thing to achieve; a parody of the world of male models. Yes, it was originally presented and the script made a good use of the predictable character descriptions, but nothing else. I don't intend to make a comparison because both share a signature (Ben Stiller's) and in both this is established from the beginning: with a flash about Derek and how being a male model is like in 'Zoolander' and a few trailers that mock the film industry with audacity in 'Tropic Thunder'.The film industry? Well, actually 'Tropic Thunder' only messes with Hollywood, and it has no mercy. Stiller, intelligent as he is (although I don't like him as an actor very much), makes the wise choice of not taking on any political or religious issues, reducing everything down to the world he knows best; the world he lives in. After this decision, he elevates the risk by giving his comedy multiple dimensions and getting them all right. Essentially, Stiller's movie (co-written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen) is a superproduction that parodies superproductions; a film inside a film. It has all the special effects and things blowing up, the epic sceneries and score (this latest one is a great work by Theodore Shapiro) and the superstars; the key-and this is all product of Stiller's intelligence- is how it uses them. It would be sufficient to say there's a big moment for the score (you could perceive it at the beginning or the end of the film; it involves Stiller in slow-motion), a huge one for the special effects and many for the sceneries (as we see helicopters flying and watching a 'jungle' from above in scenes that seem repeated but are different every time in a plot that never looses its frenetic nature).However, the stars of the show are, wellthe stars. Stereotypes are all over the place: Jack Black (crazier than ever) plays an actor who has only done comedy involving farts and has drug addiction problems; Robert Downey Jr. is Kirk Lazarus, a 'methodic' actor, committed to his work and awards ('Second Globe, third Oscar', he says after he mentions a role he once played); Brandon T. Jackson personifies Alpa Chino, our typical music megastar that does everything and has to try acting because it can't hurt; and Ben Stiller is Tugg Speedman (or the same old Ben Stiller, but very measured and not at all out of control), the action movie man who has played the same role a thousand times but has also spent his whole career trying to be acknowledged as a 'serious' actor. When all of this characters find themselves immerse in this 'jungle' where they were once shooting a movie, it's fair to say anything can happen; and it's also fair to clarify that everything happens. Stiller lets loose and everything he keeps measured as an actor, he unloads it in the tone of the production and in every other performer, letting each and every one of them to explode. Nick Nolte and Steve Coogan deliver two short but unforgettable performances, Matthew McConaughey plays Matthew McConaughey and it doesn't bother, we have countless minimal appearances by famous and renowned individuals and there's a little- and brilliant-surprise (at least it surprised me). The film never takes itself seriously, but it's not stupid like, for example, most of the 'Scary Movies' and films alike, which also try to mock genre pictures.Us, as viewers have to be thankful for that. As I said, Stiller doesn't intend to mock a particular genre; his target is the Hollywood industry. I also said he has no mercy, which leaves the fact of being brave or not out of the question. In terms of audience response, he could have been brave; and in a way he is because I'm almost sure that he did his best effort to make the most accessible movie possible. It's clear that there are references (yes, most of them are very funny) that not every viewer will understand (I personally missed the essence of some) and refer to the actual state of the Hollywood Stiller lives in and knows by heart. But if you don't get any reference, there's a plot that's eventful enough to keep your eyes focused on the screen and jokes that are just pure (innocent or disgusting-but intelligent-, because Stiller doesn't care which one is better) comedy. People laughed, and the biggest laughs came in those moments of original, crafted comedy that is funny without the need of mocking something. This is a little balance, courtesy of Stiller who knows that any superproduction should be made to be watched by anyone. If you like the approach towards the natural comedy, it means the film works; and it means the same if the references employed, developed (sometimes even detailed) at least make you smile: I liked both ends. It's difficult to direct a movie like 'Tropic Thunder', which involves parodying something that's not as blatant and basic as the male model world. It's even more difficult to succeed in every expectation generated and fulfill every ambition presented. What sometimes is simply impossible is to set a bar; to function as an inflexion point in movie making; in this case with the comedy genreMark my words: it will be long before we experience something like 'Tropic Thunder' again.",9,1,4,14 September 2008
Enchanted," Disney on Disney
","I think that after watching Julie Taymor's 'Across the Universe' you start living with the idea that you may not find music, dancing and acting so perfectly combined in a film these days. But if you haven't watched it, you will have plenty of things to find in 'Enchanted', the real life fable of all the Snowhites, Sleeping Beauties, Ariels, Cinderellas but not Anastacias. Here the magical world of Walt Disney brings a film that brings everything back to life again. I like it because it's such an uncompromising film; so simple and predictable, and it knows it. However, it also knows that it's a film that had to be done and had a reason for existing (in case anyone had thought differently): making the viewer remember. Whether you are 10 years old, 25 or 50 or more, you'll get something of this movie that will stay with you forever. The 10-year-olds will be astonished by the musical sequences in the best 'Mary Poppins' style, the songs (they may not have shined at the Oscars, but Alan Menken's melodies are as sharp as ever and you can't help to smile while watching people in the middle of the street singing 'That's how you know'; look for the video if you don't believe me), the animals and the always winning tale of the princess looking for his true love. The 25-year-olds will recognize every moment taken from another animated classic (this is Disney on Disney people) and the parallels established with the film's characters and some of the most beloved Disney villains and heroes of all time; while the 50-year-olds will just experience a short ride in a time machine, which I'm guessing it's no so bad. 'Enchanted' is short, direct and targeted like no other Disney film this decade. The young girls will get it to see Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden (the latter one truly delivers and proves to have a natural singing talent); the whole family will get it because it's Disney, movie lovers will want to see Susan Sarandon doing a villain and, believe it or not, the boys will eventually watch it because everyone will be talking good things about it; and about Amy Adams. And why wouldn't they? She's lovable and manages to control her performance so that it never becomes annoying, something that could have easily happened. The movie rests on her natural gift, her singing and on her smile and on the commitment of director Kevin Lima, who once directed the animated classic 'A Goofy Movie'; a film that everyone should watch once more. Oh, and just in case: 'Bridge to Terabithia' this is not.",7,1,1,15 April 2008
The Butterfly Effect," The effect of 'The butterfly Effect'
","I should have written about this film the first time I watched it. Now it's been the third time and although I loved it as much as the first time, my head has added up lots of things and I can't say something straight. What I'll do, is try to summarize all my thoughts in some paragraphs. I'm just going to say one main thing, because there were bad reviews and lots of opinions; this is a great film. Other subjectYou have these two guys who got together to do something. Yes, they knew it would be a script, but the relevant thing is that their union, I believe, departures from this concept: cheating all the stereotypes, avoiding common places and typical ideas; working hard to achieve the constant surprise of the spectator, because his logical expectation is always betrayed. You may criticize this film, but you can't deny that it is anything but predictable. There are some resolutions, things or parts I thought about many times, that are not totally perfect; but it happens with any film of any type, and we tend to forgive.I tried hard (although it wasn't difficult) to find the reasons that could make this movie unlikable for some viewers. I resolved that mainly it is because it presents itself as an action piece, better yet, an 'entertaining even'; and these are usually underestimated works, with no further purpose than making someone spend a good time. If 'The Butterfly Effect' was that, I spent an awesome time. The other reason is a name: Ashton Kutcher. Yes, how can a movie with this guy who played the most stupid roles be appreciated? And he produced it? Not good signs.However, and for my pleasant surprise, this was and still is Kutcher's best performance to date. He composed something really interesting, like Amy Smart, who sows off here, and leaves not one doubt of how promising she is. Merit of the casting directors was the selection of the younger cast, occupied by very talented kids, like Logan 'Bobby' Lerman, Jesse James, Irene Gorovaia, and specially John Patrick Amedori.Those two guys I was talking about are called Eric Bress and J. Mackie Gruber, and they are not just writers, but also directors of this unappreciated beauty. What a way of telling a story and representing it visually! It is true that their feature is betraying, and has lots of twists (what could tire out our patience), but I believe for some motive they knew we would die to see what happened; that we would stick around. So they play with our thoughts, and keep us awake. When I was having little sleeping time last year, this was the one thing that woke me up. I didn't even want it to end, and when it did, I didn't want to get out of theater, I wanted to see more.It is also true that their movie is very powerful; everything. The cinematography, the sceneries: a crafted work. While it is not common in this type of film, there is an emotional power beyond. The words the characters speak, the things they live...We feel for them, and at the ending, WowI mean: Wow! They inserted 'Stop crying your heart out' and an ending so incredible that hit (or probably impacted) me the other day for the third time; but it felt just like the first.",9,21,33,24 September 2005
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Good things, it has...
","I can't be kind with this film; it's been a very disappointing experience. As the world may know (or can find out with this and other movies), Robert Ford killed Jesse James, the famous outlaw from the West. Well, Andrew Dominik's 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford' (already a bit pretentious, even if it comes from Ron Hansen novel's original title) is a long journey to the 'how', 'when' and 'why' of the fact, giving that we know the who. I'm sorry if I'm being a little repetitive; sometimes movie characteristics stick with me for a while after watching them. The music of 'The Assassination' is repetitive, as its structure and its beautifully shot sequences, sceneries, lights and use of colors, empty rooms, fast- moving clouds: the movie is just marvelously shot. Dominik's adapted script starts the film off with the kindness of telling us who the main character (played by Brad Pitt) is, as we witness a blurry screen. That's the set-up for the structure, with a pleasant narration that not only becomes unpleasant with duration time, but at times also unnecessary. What are images for if someone's telling you everything you're watching? What good does a complete description provide for an actor if the viewer will be carefully watching if the character behaves exactly as what he or she heard? Brad Pitt suffers from this in this film that Dominik wants to be a focused study on two people, but gets distracted with the 'bigger picture' and worn down by the narration and an excessive exercise of style. Roger Deakins' photography is undoubtedly the movie's highest point, but it looks like the director never knew when to say 'stop', and Deakins, an expert on camera tricks (here greatly helped by Curtiss Clayton and Dylan Tichenor's classic and well chosen cuts to black; which work every time and are not excessive, so they create a balance), kept going. I don't want you to misinterpret me about Pitt, though. His work here is very good; patient and contemplative, however unexpectedly confident and threatening in the stronger scenes. Even when his Jesse is the one who speaks the less, his speaking becomes meaningful. This is not Russell Crowe's elaborated study of silence in '3:10 to Yuma'. Actually, 'The Assassination' is nothing like '3:10 to Yuma': in Mangold's film there's a redemption that's understood by the viewer after witnessing a series of events; here the movie tries to redeem a character leaving no space for the viewer's personal judgment. In a similar way, we sense the feelings and personalities of '3:10 to Yuma's' characters in one specific scene; while Dominik's movie almost obligates us to comprehend its two main creatures before, during and after the main events, when the truth is that we may not have figured it out. Luckily, Casey Affleck's best performance to date helps us a lot, because the actor worries about creating someone we can empathize with. He presents a contradiction in his Robert Ford, who used to worship and love someone he ends up killing. The best scenes in the film are the little ones; the ones where you don't think anything relevant can happen. When Robert is watching Jesse's wife Zee (Mary-Louise Parker, one of the many underused actors in the film) through the window, he turns around and realizes Jesse's been watching him for some time. 'You'll break many hearts', he tells Robert. Try to unveil the whole meaning of that phrase. Of course there's plenty of good things in 'The Assassination'. Like Sam Rockwell's interpretation who, away from Pitt's stillness and Affleck's constant ticks, constructs a normal human being who worries about his family and friends, and does it with the naturalness that's characterized him even in his most eccentric roles. He's better than the other two and, seriously, he should be working more.",6,3,4,16 February 2008
Batman Begins," 'It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you' -- Rachel Dawes
","For me, 'Batman Begins' is the best comic book movie since 'Daredevil', and one of the best comic book movies ever; I'll explain why later. It's also, after 'Batman Forever', the best movie in the Batman series. There's no surprise in the tale; and the fans probably know everything about it. But for a guy like me, who's not a fan, but knows the basic stuff, was a thrill to hear Gordon's name, see how the 'bat cave' became the place it is, what was Gotham like in the light of day (I thought it only existed at night, in the Gothic darkness) and most importantly; how Bruce Wayne became Batman.The work of professionals that could have been easily done without a big amount of money, because the team's objective wasn't achieving something like 'Kingdom of Heaven', with all its incredible settings and mass production. However, production designer Nathan Crowley, together with partner set decorator Paki Smith and Award-Winning costume designer Lindy Hemming brought us Gotham back again, at its best; a wonderful 'Tumbler' and a Batman mask with a costume.Director Christopher Nolan brought some of the team that was with him at the start. Cinematographer Wally Pfister, casting director John PapsideraHe worked with them in the film that launched his career; 'Memento'. This turned out to be a beautiful constructed script, Guy Pearce's best portrayal and today a cult classic. He always worries about the dramatic impact of the characters in his stories, and that's, I think, why he was the best to take care of 'Batman Begins'; and that's why this is one of the best comic books movies ever. For once, it's not just about showing the action and blowing things up; it's about characters and how they became who they are. My brother though I wouldn't like the film, because this is the type of film I reject; for its action and big fight sequences. But it was not any fight sequence that blew my mind off (in fact, I tend to fall asleep during action scenes and this movie was no exception); it was the other side of the coin that did.David S. Goyer was the perfect man to join Nolan with the film's screenplay. He has worked with action hero movies before, written some of them (the 'Blade' saga, one of 'The Crow' movies, 'Dark City'), dealing with darkness, and directed other ones (the recent 'Blade: Trinity')He's in the territory. Now they are both talking about fear, mostly, and about doing what's best, but not because of vengeance, but because of the will of doing it. This is what Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) learns, in Asia, under the leadership of Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and under the instruction of Ducard (Liam Neeson); where he is about to become a member of 'The League of Shadows'. But he doesn't. He lost his faith when his parents died; his girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) lost her faith on him, and Alfred (Michael Caine) feels disappointed about him leaving behind the Wayne Empire (companies, buildings, trains, the mansion) his father left him. We learn all of this in flashbacks and we also learn about that time he fell into the cave, and about his greatest fear; bats. In an opera, he starts imagining bats, and asks his father to go out, where a crazy man shoots both of Bruce's parents. 'Your parents' death was not your fault', Ducard tells Bruce.Some time later, Bruce is back in Gotham, where Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has bought most of the city and Rachel and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) are the only ones who want to make things right. There's also Dr. Crane (an unrecognizable Cillian Murphy), who takes the crazy people to treat them instead them going to jail. It's a big net of corruption. 'I'm going to show Gotham that the city doesn't belong to the criminal and the corrupt', Bruce Wayne tells Alfred. 'But simply as Bruce Wayne, I can't do that. Although as a symbol'. 'What symbol?', Alfred asks intrigued. Now, taking advantage of his high position in the city, Bruce meets Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the guy who will provide the basics for the equipment Bruce Wayne actually built himself. In the end, the script turns to be a correct balance of wisdom and drama, with some funny and subtly juicy elements, carried on by an excellent score that mixes fantasy with darkness and sadness. This was in charge of James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, and you can really feel each one's signature.The cast is the best ensemble I've seen so far this year. The movie is worth watching just for the pros. Flawless performances by Liam Neeson with a voice similar as the one we've heard from him lately, Morgan Freeman smiling all the way through and having a lot of fun, Tom Wilkinson screaming like a crazy old bastard, Gary Oldman wearing some cool glasses, Cillian Murphy in a macabre portrayal, Sir Michael Caine with a unique accent and Katie Holmes acting and looking as beautiful as ever (I mean, as always). An ensemble cast is perfect when all its main actors are. In difference to another super production this year, 'Kingdom of Heaven', where Orlando Bloom can't keep up with the work of the pros alongside him; Christian Bale carries the whole movie with his character, wearing or not a mask. He was a perfect choice, and possesses a natural sense of depth and seriousness.After we presence everything and Gotham seems deserted, we know what comes: Jim Gordon, Rachel and Bruce's fight for justice. 'We can make it better', Bruce tells Gordon. And Gordon says there's one man, making some criminal stuff, and is leaving a cardAnyone guesses who can that be?",8,2,4,19 June 2005
Twilight," What do you want to watch? Be careful...
","Here's the deal. You have a beautiful girl, properly named Bella (the gorgeous Kristen Stewart) who moves to a small town to live with her father, a chief of police (Billy Burke). She goes to school, she's the new girl, the new toy. Suddenly, a good looking guy by the name of Edward (Robert Pattinson) comes along and saves her life in a way that doesn't seem human. Bella doesn't understand, and becomes fascinated with Edward, who keeps a secret we all know.A story like this one could happen to any of you today, leaving aside everything that's not human, because Edward is a vampire, and that changes everything. 'Twilight' is based on a famous novel Stephenie Meyer, a lot of people went to see it because of that and for the same reason they'll go to see the second part, shooting right now. Considering the fact that the novel has to be 'condensed' for the screen, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg did a pretty ambiguous job; considering that in developing an adolescent love story she included lines like 'you are my life now, Bella' and also had the nerve to put thing like 'you are like my personal brand of heroine'. Who would say such a thing? A vampire, you could answer, if you intend to defend the film's writing.While it may all be fault of the novel itself (which I didn't read but heard was lame enough), it's true that the movie develops its plot in a hurry, and we always feel we're missing an important number of conversations between the very interesting main characters. Pattinson (now a heartthrob who got the role of his life) and Stewart (one of the finest actresses of her generation) work well together and their chemistry is palpable, either when they transmit they want to be together or the exact opposite. In this particular aspect, director Catherine Hardwicke gets the best out of the movie.Hardwicke directed the fantastic 'Thirteen', so she knows about teen angst. However, this time everything is more focused: the camera showing only the characters' eyes, emphasizing their looks. The fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella can't have him so close seems to be the center of Hardwicke's attention and, as if she wanted to show teenage sexual desire-and eventually abstinence- as an important topic of the film (she mixes it up with love sacrifice, but it becomes unnecessary and tired because the images leave it clear), she shoots the film's hottest scene with deep breaths and dim lights, ending it in nothing.If you watch the action scenes-fights between vampires and other creatures-you will also understand that part of the film wasn't Hardwicke's biggest concern. The shaky camera that cinematographer Elliot Davis developed and worked so well for her in her first film, now seems out of place. The action scenes are badly shot, incomprehensible and sometimes even badly edited (or not edited with enough enthusiasm); the music by Carter Burwell sounds like out of a B-movie or a cheap TV series about murders and-maybe-vampires.At least Hardwicke will not be directing the sequel (maybe she'll get back to what she does best, with all her usual actors included-they are all in this movie-) and at least 'Twilight' is better than 'Jumper'. You can watch it for some good performances, or for some fun. That's a lot to say.",6,1,4,6 February 2009
Before Sunset," It all happens again...
","It's true that when we are watching a romantic movie we're always expecting something. I don't know how to call it. Maybe the name has been said sometimes. I mean endings like the ones in 'Nothing Hill', 'How to loose a guy in ten days'. Cheesy maybe? I really can't tell. But there's a thing that people who make these films like to do (and it works). They manipulate a little bit things just to end them that way. It is lovely to see those endings. But what if they couldn't be, right? What if we could have the chance to watch something real? 'Before Sunset' gives us that chance.We know the story and what has happened to the characters. Even if we haven't seen it, we suppose it, because it is really obvious. They show it with their actions, with of course, are normal actions. What would someone do in the situation this two persons are involved? Not anything different to what they're doing. Sitting down on a 'café', talking a little bit, maybe a lot. Nine years have since the last time they saw each other, and they were in love. The thing is that they could have not felt 'love' again. They planned to see each other in Vienna after they said goodbye. Celine couldn't go: 'It was my grandmother's funeral', she says. And asks Jesse if he was there. He says he wasn't, but five minutes later he takes it back. He was in Vienna, and put posters around the city, to find Celine, because she could have arrived later. These types of things are happening to them in their encounter. They don't say things because they don't want to offend, or be offended. But they know those things. They tell the truth, they lie. They don't know how to act because they have probably thought this would happen again and they are probably in love. Jesse has written a book that tells the night they spent together nine years before. Celine has read it and tells him: 'You idealized that night. We didn't make love'. Jesse can't believe it. He's sure they did: 'It was in the park, at night'. Celine says they didn't do it because they didn't use a condom. Jesse remembers the condom, and tells her. They feel embarrassed, but the truth right there is, that Celine remembers the night perfectly, and she was wrote a song. A waltz. She plays the song for Jesse in an occasion and he is convinced that she wrote it for him: 'Do you play that song for every guy that comes here and say his name?', he asks. She says: 'Of course, did you think that I had written that song for you?'. The truth, again, is that she has really written it for him. Many of these situations occur as the day passes by, and they're walking and walking, and talking. Talking real words written on a real script about real people. They tell each other what they have been doing, their jobs, romances...Jesse is married, but he can't be sure of being in love. He sees the love he has for his wife as respect, admiration, and his kid. He has a son, and loves him, so? It doesn't really matter for him if he's in love with his wife or not. He even tells Celine in an occasion, the dreams he has every night, about her: 'In one there's a train. You're in there and you keep passing by. In the other one, we're lying in bed, you're pregnant, I want to touch you, you don't let me, but then I touch you and I wake up sweating'. Celine asks him later: 'Did you really dream that or you just said it to have sex with me?'. Jesse answers: 'No no, I just said to get into your pants'. But darn! He has really dreamed it! The truth is that they can't do much about these situations, there's little time, and Jesse's leaving.Ethan Hawke makes his character perfectly. It all comes naturally from him, he doesn't need to make an effort. Even the laughs, which can seem forced (or I wanted to see it that way), come off naturally also. He enjoys working with Delpy, they have chemistry. And Julie Delpy is one of those fighters. She wrote this script, and she really want it to do this film, she just acts with passion. It shows.Then there's the passionate Richard Linlklater. I haven't seen all of his works, but the movies I have seen, well, are directed with that passion. The kind of passion that shows the director really wants to do what he's doing. This movie is so personal for him, that he makes it personal. His camera, in some occasions, seems to be following the characters from behind, when they are walking, joining them; as if it was walking too. Then the camera moves, not much, showing the characters from all the angles, and letting us see their emotions. They're two characters only. It's fantastic, and intimate.In one occasion, Celine and Jesse are talking (because they're always talking, amazing) about what would they do if the day they're living was the last one of their lives. They should really think about it. Because it could be their last day. Or not.",9,0,1,19 February 2005
The Chorus," We're back to Europe;France: Music
","I had some kind of a movie lesson after watching 'Les Choristes'. One person was telling me what I should always know when I'm going to write about a movie, what I should care about, what I should investigate and other things. She was right, in mostly everything she said, but she was harsh on me. Of the people I know, I'm the only one I know who stays watching film credits; but I don't write all of the credits in a piece of paper instantly, you see? 'Les Choristes' is a film with great spirit, carefully written, directed, composed and edited, that only fails to be great itself because of its trashed argument and its predictable plot line. Taken from the story of an old film written by various screenwriters, director Christophe Barratier and partner Philippe Lopes-Curval adapted the story about a teacher who arrives at a school and somehow changes the students' lives.Professor Clément Mathieu must be a very well known character in France. It has been the main element of some movies and it is a peculiar person. He is portrayed here by Gérard Jugnot, probably as respectable now as any other actor who played the character before. Jugnot directed 'Monsieur Batignole', a movie I never saw but many people talk about.I have explained my little culture about European cinema before, but I'm reading and writer Lopes-Curval has worked in a lot of the films Jugnot has directed. So I figure that the latter one knows the words and the way of writing of the first one by heart, and he speaks with the right tone and look that translate that to the viewer.Jugnot and his professor are the film's attraction; so was Robin Williams in 'Dead Poets Society' and more recently Kevin Kline in 'The Emperor's Club' or Julia Roberts in the very feminine 'Mona Lisa Smile'. ButOf the movies mentioned, two were about learning poetry and human qualities, the other one about learning art; 'Les Choristes' is about learning music.It's just a matter of time before the students who don't like the principal Rachin (a flawless François Berléand), become fond of Mathieu, the new teacher. And it's also a matter of time before Mathieu discovers that his kids can sing and decides to train them to form a choir (I was watching 'Sister Act 2' the other day and I recalled the situation).Mathieu used to be a songwriter, so the choir becomes good and they make a presentation in the school, and although the director doesn't approve it, they achieve their goal. However, they don't go to a competition where they can win or loose, because this is a more personal story, and its resolution is personal.The environment is practically one and Barratier makes it beautiful and ugly when he wants to. It's a remarkable fact that Barratier himself also wrote the music and lyrics of the beautiful songs, and that the child actors are members of an existent and, as I heard, very respected choir (probably the best). It's a must see, because of the music mainly, and the rest is up to each individual.",7,1,2,4 June 2006
Revolutionary Road," The look of others...
","It takes a while for a director to make a really good film. By this I mean a film that not only contains visual beauty or technical mastery. These where things that reigned all over 'American Beauty', 'Road to perdition' and 'Jarhead': but the first one was too wise about its limits, it believed it was better than it really was; the second one was too cold, too exquisite and the third one failed to grab the viewer completely (even when Jake Gyllenhal did his best efforts). With 'Revolutionary Road', Sam Mendes enters a whole new world; the world of a film that arouses feelings on the viewer: the world of a really good film.This new world is in a way also a world he knows. The film is set in the suburbs, where the Wheelers, Frank and April (Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) make a living. Also in a way, the context is different than the one Mendes worked with in 'American Beauty'; it's the 1950's and things were decidedly different, but the core is the same: a hell that's waiting to make an appearance in a pleasantness that doesn't seem right. The scene before the title appears could very well be 'the first day of this couple's life', but the language in Justin Haythe's script (adapting Richard Yates' novel) lacks Alan Ball's philosophical and sometimes pretentious search of meaning.However, even when I want to, it's not fair to say 'Revolutionary Road' is the better version of 'American Beauty'. This film has something the other one didn't care much about, and that's how we see ourselves in someone else's eyes; or even better, why do we have to see ourselves in someone else's eyes. The Wheelers are a couple without convictions. They do what they do in life because it was the best they could get and they chose not wanting more. A nice, well paid job for Frank, two lovely kids, the role of a kind housewife in the hands of April This is what the neighborhood knows about the Wheelers: Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) thinks they are adorable, so does their friend/neigh bout Chep (David Harbour). Yes, it's all true, but the viewer is allowed to experience a little more.The tension is developed inside a big house that Roger Deakin's cinematography captures as an unbearable scenario. Mendes works this from every angle possible: outside the house the tension can be sensed, but never comes to life. Without mattering who they are sharing company with, after a first fascinating discussion in the middle of the highway, every argument occurs indoors. There's one scene in which Frank chases April through the woods, shouting mildly, but it doesn't become more than that. In the house, however, passion flies through the walls; among the couple, with the children nearby and with two particular visits of a peculiar human being called John (a very good Michael Shannon).So? Which one is it? Do we have to care about what the people around us think? Are we making our own living or are we just satisfying someone else's wishes? And whose wishes are those? As I said, this last film by Mendes makes room for emotions. Much has been said about Winslet and DiCaprio's reunion after the success of 'Titanic', and the fact is that their work here is brilliant for the opposite reasons that made their chemistry possible in James Cameron's film. There, they couldn't be together, and the passion and the relationship was almost platonic; their encounters lasted nothing. Here, they are already together, and the relationship has lost, with the years, a passion that's still passion. But it doesn't want to bring them together; it's a passion that's tired of trying to keep alive something that's dying. Thank God that DiCaprio one day decided to make only good movies, because when he wins in intensity there's no one who can beat him.With these two fantastic main actors, technical mastery, beautiful (almost excessively correct) visuals, intriguing score (yes, Thomas Newman) and the mentioned intensity, Mendes may not even know why he's done his best movie. It's not in the screaming, the crying and the suffering of two people that's explicated to the bone. The true greatness lies -and I think the director wanted people to think this of all his movies but never achieved it- in everything else: in the silence, the looks of everyone involved in the tale, the decisions the characters take and we work so hard to figure out why. That's what strikes us deeply: the rest only increases the hit.",9,0,1,30 April 2009
The Number 23," The worst thing
","How nice of 'The number 23'Explaining us everything before the movie is over, in case we didn't understand it; or is it that it was impossible to understand. Anyway, even considering the fact that the movie tries to explain itself, there's another fact that doesn't change: 'The number 23' is a mess from beginning to end.Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) finds a novel in one of those destined moments that we let through. He starts reading it and he becomes obsessed with itWell, the novel says it's 'a novel of obsession'. He narrates what he reads in the novel, but his character had started narrating his own life before; so there's a point in which the narration and the narrators mix up and if you analyze things logically, nothing makes senseMostly near the end of the movie.Yes, Fernley Phillips' first screenplay has a premise we haven't seen before, but also yes; it uses the same tricks used in the films we have seen before. Is it true that we've not seen anything like 'The Sixth Sense' since it premiered and everyone started copying or reformulating it? For almost ten years, movies similar in style have taken some cinematic licenses and worked (I'm not giving names), but others have exceeded the number of licenses, and turned into something like this film.For me, 'The number 23' is more than a mess and a bad film, it's also a disappointment. I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey and of director Joel Schumaher. The first one is one of my favorite actors and the second one has made, among other things, three very different movies I respect and admire: 'Tigerland', 'Veronica Guerin' and 'Phone Booth'. This movie is easily the worst thing they've done in their careers.Carrey's narration is so unconvincing, so relaxed, as if he was doing 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' again. It's not that the movie doesn't help his performance; he doesn't understand his character, or his nature, and thus his performance fails. Maybe he thought that he was doing 'Eternal sunshine' because a lot of shots are out of focus and he constantly wakes up in different states and places.But 'The number 23' is a different trip of the mind, and Matthew Libatique's beautiful photography (try to catch 'The Fountain', you'll be amazed) might be the only good element wasted in the movie that goes back and forth from present time to a film-noir style of film-making, which Libatique captures perfectly.Even if we wanted to, we couldn't even say that 'The number 23' is an exercise of style, because there's an understood intelligence found in the screenplay that obliges us to follow the story attentively, although it's still mess; but there's nothing easier than realizing whether a script takes itself seriouslyThis one really does, and it makes it worse.To finish up, this is not only the worst thing Carrey and Schumaher have done; also Virgina Madsen, and the rising Logan Lerman, and Danny Huston, who had been giving some good appearances. There's one good thing the movie does though, and that's making you want to find out about what the hell is up with number 23.",3,1,3,24 September 2007
Stardust," Magic again
","Our life continues and we keep on watching films about magical words, far away from reality but with another reality altogether. I haven't seen all the most recent ones, and I won't mention them. Should we worry about all of this similar tales based on novels? Are we tired? I don't have the answer, but I also don't know how filmmaker keep coming across books and novels and take them to the screen. Maybe writers should stop writing for a while, but then again I never care about finding out if the novel a movie's based on is a recent one. Maybe most of them are old. Of the films of the type that are not so recent, 'The Golden Compass' is one of my favorites, and it presents magical elements in the reality we meet when it begins. In 'The Chronichles of Narnia', what divides reality from fantasy is a wardrobe; in the amazing 'Bridge to Terabithia' it's this bridge; in 'Stardust' (based on a novel by Neil Gaiman) it's a wall. 'Stardust', directed by Matthew Vaughn (in another one of those challenges some directors take by doing something they've never done before) and adapted by Vaughn and Jane Goldman, however, has a difference with the other two films: its hero, Tristan (the natural Charlie Cox), is not a kid. He has 18 years old and possesses the maturity to deal with the destiny prepared for him. From the start (an this is among the film's positive aspects), even before we meet Tristan-when we his father, who also crosses the 'wall' and spends the night with who would be Tristan's mother-we are liberated from the usual surprise kids usually experience when they find magical elements in these films. Tristan is surprised when he meets Yvaine, (Claire Danes, with a great British accent) a girl who is actually a star, but in his face we don't see the wonder of Lyra when using the golden compass, nor the wonder of Lucy when she finds herself standing in snow after closing the wardrobe, if you know what I mean. Therefore, the technical team isn't very worried about wooing us, or so I believe. Because magic doesn't feel so magical for the one individual that needs to transmit it to us, the magic in 'Stardust' comes from another place: characters and relationships. Unlike some of the constant jumps from one part of the story to another in 'The Golden Compass', 'Stardust' stays most of the time close to Tristan, focusing on his adventure and the people he meets along the way.First, there's Yvaine, the hero's love interest, played by Claire Danes with a sweetness we're not used to see in her. She's a serious, independent actress; and what she achieves here shows how wide her range is (even if some of us already knew that). Then there's Lamia, a selfish witch played with mischief by Michelle Pfeiffer; the greedy prince Septimus (Mark Strong), who would do anything to be king; and Captain Shakespeare (a delightful Robert De Niro), who hides a predictable secret. There are others of course, and they are all developed enough for a movie like this one. I won't tell you which role each of them plays in the story (of which I've mentioned almost nothing), because there's also a certain charm to it. But believe me when I tell you that you'll become so involved with the characters that in the end it will be just like a romantic comedy or, more fit for this matter, a classic love story in which you're waiting for Prince Charming to come and save the Princess; whether with a kiss or by getting rid of everyone in his way. Don't doubt for any second that this is how it will be, and you'll forget any trespasses.",8,3,5,12 August 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," The magic of words
","Based on something that really happened and was put down in words in an article, Frank Pierson wrote a wonderful screenplay that required putting down the first words in words again. It's a wonderful thing, words. You would never imagine the important part they play in a bank robbery: what to say to the hostages, how to treat them, what to discuss between partners, what to discuss between partners, what to tell the police or the FBI when they want to negotiate. Fortunately, Sonny (Al Pacino) is very good with words. He's so good that he manages to achieve a good relationship with the typical public that gathers in the streets every time there is a robbery. Sidney Lumet's 'Dog Day Afternoon' is the tale of Sonny and Sal (John Cazale), two guys who enter a bank and plan to rob it quickly but end up staying the whole afternoon, and night. The movie is a harsh declaration against the role of the media in robberies, with cameras and reporters all over the place, not knowing exactly what they're doing but knowing they have to do something; against the role of the police, who say one thing and do another and keep their guns up while Sonny is constantly coming out of the bank with a white flag. Of course it all revolves around Pacinos's frenetic performance, in his first major role after 'The Godfather Part II'. At one point he comes out of the bank and goes ballistic, demanding detective Moretti (Charles Durning) to tell the police officers to put their guns down, and screaming to the public about an event that happened in Attica. He didn't expect it, but he wins the public and becomes your 'freak show' of the day (as he would say); a kind of 'hero of the moment' everyone wants to talk to, which brings problems for the police to work properly.Did Sonny want this? We never know, but he uses it in his favor. We actually never know quite exactly what Sonny wants, and Sidney Lumet is kind enough to let us figure it out. The director focuses on the tension, establishing a clear difference of what's going on inside and outside the bank and then translates all this to Sonny's changes of mood. 'I'm dying here', he says to several people in different moments of the film; and we don't know if he's serious or if he's saying it to appear as a victim to the police.Because Sonny (and Sal, if you pay close attention) is not the guy who would enter a bank and rob it; that's something we can deduce because he knows things and he's, in general terms, kind and worrying. What Lumet does is putting us through a horrible experience as viewers, where we can never exactly decipher what the main character will do next and why he acts the way he acts and why people say something about him we can never get to see. It's frustrating that there's a human side of the movie and that we want to know all about it but we never get chance, unless we want to elaborate an own theory. I'm making a wild guess here, but how much could have Pierson known about this man in order to put it in his script? Probably nothing. And then we go back to the magic of words; because everything we can find out about Sonny, we do through his words. And his words are managing three expectations at the time: what the hostages expect, what the police expect and what his partner Sal expects. It's marvelous to see how he manages it and how Lumet never loses the tension, and how among all of this unpredictable things, the film never stops creating unexpected moments.",8,1,2,30 June 2008
Gran Torino," Thank you, just thank you
","I have the main song of the film, 'Gran Torino', stuck in my head. It goes: 'Engines humm and bitter dreams grow/heart locked in a Gran Torino/it beats a lonely rhythm all night long'. Clint Eastwood has always been a man to fear, even more as years go by because, as my friend Urdinez says, he's like wine; and gets better with time. What does Eastwood, the genius filmmaker feels? What does he think about life? In 'Gran Torino', probably his last effort as an actor/producer/director, we see a man completely exposed, and the movie may contain the answer.It's not that what Clint has inside is important, but his Walt Kowalski is one of his typical characters; one of those men who will do everything by themselves and don't even accept the help of their own family. His performance is so hearfelt, so perfect, that's it's hard not to imagine Mr. Eastwood keeping a Gran Torino in the darkness of a garage.Clint works hard to establish the personality of his war veteran from the first scene in which, during the funeral of his wife, he grumbles at the sight of a piercing his granddaughter has in her belly. This scene also presents, by making a fool of him, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), another of the film's crucial players as he preaches a ridiculous sermon about life and death. With his wife dead, Walt will now be almost the only American (with a flag hanging on his porch, of course) in a quiet neighborhood inhabited by Chinese immigrants; and when a kid next door named Thao (Bee Vang) tries to steal his Gran Torino, we know peace can't last too long.Walk Kowalski doesn't like priests nor Chinese or African American people, not even Irish or Italians; or maybe he does, but he certainly doesn't show it. The narrative mastery Eastwood has achieved at this point of his career lets him present two or three scenes in which some Latinos, blacks or Chinese gang bangers molest Thao and her sister (a fantastic Ahnie Her; watch the scene in which she's molested and you'll find an mild but nice social and even cinematographic commentary). When things are about to get ugly, Walt always appears, with a rifle on his waist, to save the kids who start-along with their family that leaves him all kinds of gifts on his porch-viewing him as a hero. But Walt doesn't want to be one; such as Frank didn't want to train Maggie in 'Million Dollar Baby'.As it occurs with most of Clint's recent films, there seems to be a lot unsaid between scenes, mostly in the scenes Walt speaks to the young priest. Boxes that are hardly opened, secrets from the past that haunt Walk Kowalski. And 'Gran Torino' is not about an old man trying to be better; it's about an old man doing what he always did and finding some friends because of it. These are definitely not the friends he would have chosen but the ones who chose him.In between there's a lot of beer to be drunk, a lot of food to be eaten, a lot of culture to be learnt and even some life lessons. The miracle is that everything is natural and shot with a careful eye in the light of day and in two or three main scenarios. When the night comes and the movie gets darker, Clint is very close from letting the movie slip away but never does. One shot of him sitting in an old couch, with the light on one side of his face and complete obscurity in the other one, is the highest point of his collaboration with director of photography Tom Stern and probably the movie's most painful moment.It occurs with almost no music, and the music (written by Clint's son and probably himself) is another of the pilars of this masterpiece that brings every production element together. A lot of war drums in moments of tension, an almost muted bass playing the melody of the theme song in moments of quietness. And the script, almost flawless and inevitably funny as Walt insults every person he encounters on the street, whether they have good or bad intentions; but unnecessarily clarifying after the last encounter the old man has with the priest.I wanted to express this final thought. When a man who has received orders all his life, doesn't do what he's told, there's always the chance that something goes wrong. Maybe he can fix it, and we'll listen to phrases that only Clint can say and believe them. Things that are right in the like: 'I finish things, that's what I do'. 'Gran Torino' is a film with class, not only because it has what we call class, but because it is classic; 'old-school' as Urdinez said. The kind of movie that doesn't get made anymore, in which from something ordinary you end up finding things you want to call extraordinary. Thank you Clint.",9,3,7,6 March 2009
The Illusionist," A kind of comparison...
","I knew I wanted to watch this film, but before doing so I had been asking myself a question: 'Will I able to write about 'The Illusionist' without comparing it to 'The Prestige'? Now I know the answer; which is yes. However, a friend of mine asked me to do a kind of comparison; that's why I'll highlight some information as I write about 'The Illusionist' on its own.First of all, in my opinion 'The Prestige' is better than 'The Illusionist', but apart from the fact that both contain a person doing magic on a stage, they are very different films. Mainly, the first one is the story of a rivalry; this movie is the story of a romance. As I said, slight kind of comparisons so that they don't take over the review.Without revealing too much, 'The Illusionist' the story of Edward, a peasant who later becomes a wizard (or however you may call it) and, as a young man, falls in love with a Dutchess (Jessica Biel). This we all learn from words spoken by Inspector Ull (a fantastic Paul Giamatti), who is telling the wizard's (now known as Eisenheim) life to the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) after an apparent arrest.Now, when the story is told, the camera darkens the corners of the main image, so we can be transported to the past. The picture looks beautiful with its predominant light brownish tone (accompanied by Philip Glass's haunting score), still kept when things seem to go back to the present; and with the black screen closing up as a little circle as in old films. But if I have to be objective, something basically doesn't fit: and it is that the story told by the Inspector (which constitutes the film) has facts of no interest or of previous knowledge to the listener, the Prince; which would make it sort of useless for him to listen to the 'whole' story.Maybe this comes from the fact that the screenplay, by the director Neil Burger, is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser that, as a film, runs long at 100 minutes. While undoubtedly a good film, it's betrayed by two bland performances of the young actors who fail to transmit the main romance the film deals with.This is mended by the performances of the older actors, though. Edward Norton is, once more, totally immersed in his character, obtaining (once more) a very peculiar accent and a good use of body language. There's a scene after the lovers meet again, where Eisenheim is invited to the Prince's house to perform and, in order to make the Dutchess recognize him, he says something. It's not only what he says, but also the way Norton looks at her as he says it and then again when she looks back; is a little detail of Norton's mastery.And the way Jessica Biel looks back, only in that exact moment, proves that she was a good choice for the role; even when a big number of actresses could have done it better.At last, the twistI'm not giving anything away here, but we live in a time where when a movie has a twist, it is not ruined or given away; but it is mentioned. It is not likely that someone who hasn't seen 'The Sixth Sense' or 'The Others' rents the film without knowing there's a twist.Well, you may remember 'The Prestige' has a twist; 'The Illusionist' also has one. The way I see it, in 'The Prestige' the twist generates a big impact: you're blown away and you can't believe it; while in 'The Illusionist' the twist is too much to take in at the moment it is presented. Think about that when you watch the film; and also think if 'The Illusionist' would have done better without the twist (because I do) and if you want to watch it again when it finishes (because I didn't), like with 'The Prestige'.",7,1,1,2 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," 'You never know...'
","It's an interesting premise for any movie -and the only thing you need to know about this one-, aging backwards, that's for sure. But is it enough? At times, David Fincher's latest movie seems honest and brings out laughs and even smiles from the viewer; but most of the experience lacks those qualities, and the tale grows colder as Brad Pitt becomes younger. Taking it from its tagline ('life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments'), it's not life that's measured in moments but the film itself. If you measured it in minutes it would be endless.With this contradiction mentioned, there's no doubt that 'Benjamin Button' is Fincher's most ambitious work to date and, as it happened with Boyle's recent Oscar winner, the only one that could have ever been truly noticed by the Academy. The good news is that it still has some of the characteristics of the director's cinema, in a world that is, for the first time, not populated by obsessive bad people and full of blood.Fincher's attention to detail is seen completely, as he puts his hands in all the elements he can possibly handle, and getting some things wrong because of that. Narration, always a great resource, is performed here by Caroline (Julia Ormond), a character the movie doesn't care much about. She reads a diary to her mother Daisy, an old woman who used to look like Cate Blanchett and with whom Benjamin Button -author of the diary in question- fell instantly in love.Images are beautiful and breathtaking all the way through, but Fincher never seems to let them breathe, and in moments of quietness he accompanies them with music -which is fine, because Alexandre Desplat's score is terrific- and with Brad Pitt's narration -which is wrong, because we don't need someone to tell us the exact thing we are watching on screen-. The way in which Pitt narrates (attempting an affectionate tone but sometimes sounding neutral) serves the viewer as a great guide for the best 'Benjamin Button' has to offer: an infinite gallery of wonderful characters and performances that illuminate the screen, starting from Pitt himself.The actor doesn't raise his voice for one minute. His work is not good because of what he says; it's basically built on the opposite, and his good looks help a lot. In another contradiction, his performance is a careful study of looks and gestures, in the line of 'outsiders' like Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands. But on the other hand, this is a role he can play with his eyes closed; like George Clooney's Michael Clayton, he just has to stand there. However, with all of this, he and the movie are not able to establish a connection with the audience.The film's technical work and his team of makeup artists do everything they can to make Pitt seem ten years younger, and they achieve it as the same time they make everyone else seem more than twenty years older. But it's all on the outside, it seems fake and it's out of our reach even when we want to grab it. As Benjamin keeps coming back home (as 'Forrest Gump' did many times, from war and from being all around the world: yes, the script by Eric Roth is too similar to not be noticed; but we can't blame his temptation if that script got him an Oscar and if he's among the best screenwriters alive), time takes away his beloved ones, little by little, and everyone at a big house receives him as a man they've never seen before.Even when he is wiser with time and comes into terms with his unusual situation, Benjamin becomes a stranger, a lonely man; and his life and the film's story, with all of the kindness, love and fascination we've experienced in it, becomes a tragedy. There are two cheesy lines in the script that foresee this: 'You never know what's coming to you' and 'You'll spend a lot of time alone', some people tell Benjamin Button. It's a shame that I couldn't share his pain.",7,0,2,11 March 2009
Wimbledon," Love in Tennis...
","I bet everybody wonders what's going through Roger Federer or Leyton Hewitt's mind when they are about to serve or to receive. Tennis is one of the world sports that require the most concentration and it is also one of those where there's no tie; either you are a winner or you are a looser.'Wimbledon' deals with all of this, during the tournament with the same name and in the mind of Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), an old pro that is ranked 119 in the world, and when anybody meets him they say: 'You were once 15th in the world', or 'You were the 17th'. Colt corrects: 'Actually it was 11th, and for the most part of 1996'. A player always remembers things like that; it's a big deal.So Colt is loosing his game, and Adam Brooks, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin let us know what he's thinking with their screenplay. Not one of them has written anything very respectable in the past, but they go through Colt's mind and they handle all of the clichés of the romantic comedy, and they do it very well.It's Wimbledon, and it's Colt last professional tournament because of a 'wild card', and he meets Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), a rising young player who's playing too, and they begin to win; in tennis and inBecause Paul Bettany is a great actor the romantic part is a perfect fit for him; even when he hasn't done romantic films. Because Kirsten Dunst is a fine actor and experienced in the chemistry department; she's a perfect fit too; and the most responsible in making the couple work.Characters like Lizzie's father (Sam Neil) and Peter's agent (John Favreau) are two necessary inclusions for the plot of the genre; to make us laugh or to make us get angry. That's the only reason why we are able to accept them instantly and anticipate most of their actions. We also get the best friend, training partner and coincidentally rival (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) who gives advice and says it's all alright.This is not a film about real situations at all, but there's a sense of reality in scenes like the one that shows the way Peter family lives; with all the simplicity of the world, and all their love to support their son. Even his brother, who always bets against him, loves him and wants him to succeed. Or images where the people support their best British player in their tournament; cheering him as he leaves the hotel for a match.The movie works mostly because of the performances but also because it makes tennis its main attraction and it doesn't disappoint. I play tennis, and the matches are as real as it can get, in a movie where they must have been choreographed. There's no way director Richard Loncraine could have shot an entire match, but he managed so the viewer could feel entertained.Besides, his camera possesses a lot of movement, and when Peter's thinking, it goes round and round, and when he's playing, it's changing frames constantly; and when he's going to look for his love and she's waiting, it just follows through as it should be, because of the very important moment finding love is.",7,1,1,23 June 2006
Children of Men," I wanted to...
","There's another reality presented to the viewer in 'Children of Men', but a reality not very far from ours now. In 2027, televisions are not something from other world, neither are cars or coffee shop. In the latter one, Theo (Clive Owen) is drinking a black coffee soon before everyone in the store is blown out after he leaves.The planet is falling, everyone is at war but Britain resists. Every immigrant is deported as illegal and locked up in prison; people construct safe houses in the middle of the forest. The youngest person in the world has died with 18 years old; everyone is cryingThere hasn't been a new-born in almost two decades, there is terrorism and revolution.These and many other things are what the complex screenplay written by Alfonso Cuarón and four other people based on a novel by P.D. James presents. In lots of ways, 'Children of Men' reminds the viewer of 'The Constant Gardener'A man in search of a truth; defending the dream of someone else. However, it is something different too: because of the characters and the lack of insight.I wanted to like the film and I wanted it to be good; it has many good things. For starters, Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful cinematography and his exceptional use of the light. Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland's production design; empty but full. Finally, Cuarón's unique and truly stylish use of camera. And I mean not constant and confusing movement in the signature of Tony Scott; I mean accurate movement and a camera shooting with blood all over it to maintain the reality of the environment.And a dark environment it is. Sad and dark indeed. Between all this darkness and sadness, Cuaron's seeks for a little light, while telling a tale of sacrifice. As I said, we want the light to shineClive Owen does his best in another regular film of his, where, when all of his characters are different, he generates one thing in common of them: they are unconventional heroes; and he is the only one who plays them with all the necessary elements.Julianne Moore, a terrific actress, is presented as a main part of the ensemble but does a very inspiring little appearance. So does a very relaxed Danny Huston. Michael Caine gives a little less effort after his big part in 'The Prestige', and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Claire-Hope Ashitey are true acting revelations in their roles.Cuarón, a director I admire very much, craftsman behind 'A Little Princess' and 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', a master at finding light in the dark; fell a little short in this occasion. Anyway, don't miss this one: a fine demonstration of cinematographic quality in general.",6,1,4,5 February 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Mo Cuishle...
","About Clint Eastwood's last movie I'd heard it was something we had seen a million times; very cliché. I don't pretend to get inside the story, because I shouldn't tell much of it, but it is, with a simple look, what we've already seen in 'Rocky', and maybe in 'Karate Kid'; two classic movies of the genre. But Clint Eastwood doesn't dig the classic, he digs the proper; and the fact of not winning the awards he won this year with 'Mystic River' is intriguing. And 'Million Dollar Baby' won them not because of its relation with other films, but on its own right.The emotional power this movie has and many other things, are comparable to the equally good 'Mystic River'. The thing is Eastwood knows how great he is and he closes with the credits in white; simple, over the black screen in both films. Anyway, 'Million Dollar Baby' is another movie, and if it entered late in the radar, it didn't matter because Eastwood knew what he had in his hands and what it would be, more than anyone.Again he looked for stories that excellent screenwriters would adapt (Brian Helgeland the last time, now Paul Haggis), composed the music and produced his piece. However he is not proud, and if one doesn't know what is to see, finds out about all this in the end. This round, he added an habitual detail in his directions, that turned down a couple of years ago, but concluded now in another Oscar nomination: his performance in the movie. Between the darkness and the lights sow well handled under his lead, I was able to see some faces that spoke for themselves, and acted. The pro was also thrilling in the beautifully written chats Frankie, his character, shared with Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman). With a lot of knowledge, both men exchanged words as the figures they are and as their characters, friends who have been giving each other support since always, and know that's not going to change, so they're not afraid of honesty. These chats turn out to be between the film's best moments.Clint directed and acted in top form, without forgetting about the partners around him. In Hilary Swank he saw the love and commitment with acting, getting the best of her, en what is more than a transformation. The transformation is part of the commitment, but the love enters in knowing how to use it, because: What good does a transformation has if it won't be taken advantage of? Completing one of the best ensemble works I've seen since...Well, since 'Mystic River', Morgan Freeman played his cards once again, narrating and talking wisely to receive the Oscar he should have had over a decade ago for 'The Shawshank Redemption', were he was splendid.The way Clint Eastwood has to escape from the obvious (a man who directed lots of westerns, which are pretty obvious), can be seen clearly in all those moments where you're waiting something typical and his camera, or his movie's script, doesn't give it to you. In 'Rocky', the man trained by himself, and felt proud of that; in 'Million Dollar Baby', our girl is in desperate need for one only trainer, and besides being proud of, loves him. It's amazing how he loves her back.",9,1,2,20 July 2005
Garden State," 'What do we do'?
","Tons of mixed sensations and feelings were going through my mind as I watched this film, that even if it's not great, it's something that should clearly not be missed. The feelings about my own life and things I'm willing to do, as sensations about all these other movies of this type that have seemed so great to me.It's just something that takes a lot of courage; what Zach Braff has done with this film. To write, without thinking about anything else than fulfilling his most precious illusions no matter whatI imagine what crossed his mind while he was doing it, and he might have thought it as something impossibleAn actor with the little time in the business as him, looking for a shot It's gratefully amazing there are still some brave producers out there, who look for these things. Dan Halsted, Pamela Abdy and all the others involved in this project's productionYour courage has made some dreams come true.This is the part where I get emotional and inside personal stuff, but I needed to explain because I imagine what must have been for Zach Braff, being worried if people would like what he loved. Because he could have laughed harder than anyone in his set with the scenes, and those scenes would be shown months later to millions of persons around the world. And what if it wasn't funny for them? I can't say I had a blast with the movie, but I let go because of his situation; trying to figure out what was that anything he saw that probably the rest wouldn't I felt alleviated when the images where coming through. I've always wanted to write a script; primary objectives being writing about real life situations, with no starting or ending point, creating thought-provoking words that don't seem faked or manipulativeThese things are all in this script, somehow. Beautifully written words involving characters making reflections about the moment they're living in their lives. Sometimes the characters talk too much and they seem like nonsense but you can't tell if they're stoned or drunk since they could easily be; because everybody is always in that state. They're saying words most screenwriters are afraid of writing. Yes, Braff's screenplay is a little too profound, and not very spontaneous; but it doesn't matter because you've probably never heard those things before. I think two people can fall in love in less than a week timeHe is sure that can happen too.Braff has even put his own little preferences in there, like little moments when he does crazy or metaphoric stuff that you realize it can only come from the writer and director, and not from anyone else. Little mentions of actors and movies, probably his favorites (or not), hidden in there (Robert De Niro, 'Serpico')The freedom he took, of doing another thing I've always dreamed of, that is putting the music and songs he knew were perfect for each moment. Without problems, he put those songs in the adequate places and they all fit perfectly. Those songs and other little things that probably had a lot to do with his own life, and didn't prevent him of realizing a film that is not worried about time and structure and it's living the moment. Just as Braff's characters say constantly, and then you can get what he's saying: 'This is life, that's how it is'. 'This is the moment'. And, in the most revealing part, the question I wrote at the top and we always end asking at some point: 'What do we do?' I always end up enjoying this type of films, because they're similar, not maybe only in plot or story, but in ways they arrived to their realization. 'Love, Liza' is the story of a man who looses his wife because she commits suicide, and leaves him a letter. The script was written by Gordy Hoffman, and it took his brother Phillip Seymour to get involved there so the movie was made. 'Igby Goes Down', the story of an adolescent that stays away because of the events that happen in his family. A totally unknown Burr Steers turned what he thought as a novel to a written and directed movie coming directly from his hands. 'Garden State' involves a guy whom his mom dies and his life in his home town for a few days after the funeral. This involves encounters with old friendships, plenty of talks and some romance. How do we compare these films? The first one is the life of a grown man that continues after an event; the second one is the same, but involving an adolescent; the third one involves a man in his 20's.Pro casting director Avy Kaufman achieves another excellent ensemble, which involved some of the director's preferences too. It's said Braff wrote Sam's role thinking of Natalie Portman. He has a good eye, because Portman achieves a wonderful job, looking beautiful and going crazy periodically. Peter Sarsgaard (Mark) comes from somewhere I can't imagine, to save his natural gifts as an actor and deliver greatly. Ian Holm is mayor words in the father's role, teaching acting lessons and shining in the minority. The rest of the cast is perfect, wherever they came from, they did their job right. And Braff, well, it was his whole project as a writer and director, and he did this film with a lot of passion. But he is also an actor, and puts a lot of passion into that too.",7,0,2,30 May 2005
The Piano," Layers...
","It's amazing how many layers a movie can have. 'The Piano' has enough layers for you to watch it ten times and analyze a different element during each viewing. It's also amazing how disturbing a story can be, at the same time it is touching; and how good a person can be, even when he or she is a bit crazy. I came to the conclusion that the three main characters of 'The Piano' are good hearted people, but with big mental issuesBut that's just one of the layers of the film.Set in the 1850's, the story follows Ada (Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna Paquin) Flora, as they travel to New Zealand, where Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), an intended husband she hasn't met, is waiting for Ada to begin a life with her. Ada (she explains to us during a narration at the beginning of the film where her mind is speaking) is mute and plays the piano, so when she arrives to the beach, her piano is loaded down but Stewart refuses to take it to the house; so they leave it on the beach.There will be one person who will help her get the piano back, and that's Baines (Harvey Keitel), and that's the development of the film about which I can't say no more. The way Ada looks at the Piano (it is worth putting in capital letters because it's another main character) on the beach when she's on top of the hill as she walks to the house; that's the main element of the contemplation present in Jane Campion's direction.Not only that beautiful shot of the lonely Piano on the beach, but the way she pays attention to the jungle or the houses, when the camera shows empty spaces; in a metaphorical way that really seems to be saying something. That's another magical element: let's call it 'unexplained understanding'. Through Campion's astonishing script is that we also see the layers I'm talking about. She covers a lot in such few words that Holly Hunter's look is enough to understand what's going on.Believe it or not, I'm getting stuck with this review; but because I have many things to say. The intense character study is something from another world. Campion, both in her direction and script, makes sure that every scene has total importance, without differentiating between a main character like Ada or an aboriginal from New Zealand.Every scene is so intense with the focus on the characters that you can't keep your eyes off the screen, even when the film is slow and depressing like no other. Whether it is in the house, on the beach or inside the jungle, each scene takes the action from ten different angles with a big number of different shots. This is Stuart Dryburgh's flawless achievement in cinematography; which includes close-ups so daring and compelling as the ones he uses now, more than ten years later, in films like 'The Painted Veil'.I can't forget about Michael Nyman's score, which is not the best thing in the world, but is perfectly combined with every piece Ada plays in her beloved Piano; in order to give a continuing musicality to the picture. Now, I don't know how much Nyman wrote of these pieces Ada play, butThe moments in which she plays each of them and the way she does it and how the pieces sound; I could assure that they represent Ada's feelings in their most original form. I mean, I don't know much about classical music and that's what I'm saying. However, if those pieces existed and were at least known, their title or (as I said) their form would be incredibly connected to Campion's story.I don't even know how much Campion knows about music, but if she doesn't know anything, it didn't affect this beautiful piece at all. Realize how much I've said about 'The Piano' and I haven't even mentioned the performances. I shouldn't have to, though: Holly Hunter won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance here and it is as simple as it sounds; she doesn't speak a word. Little Anna Paquin, who is know big and talented, was also incredibly talented then with ten years old; and she also got an Oscar for it. She couldn't even watch the film when this happened because she was too young, and apparently she hasn't completely watched it yet.Sam Neil achieves a remarkable job with a character that requires several big changes of mood and decisions; and that angry actor that Harvey Keitel is presents an unexpected gentleness as the troubled Baines. But as I already mentioned; they are all somehow very troubled. And between this troubled and frightening and confusing and violent environment, Ada sits down and speaks, through her Piano; that, as a colleague of mine said, is her own voice.",9,3,9,19 May 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Ladies and gentlemen...It's Quentin Tarantino
","You wouldn't believe the excitement I had as this movie started. You wouldn't also believe why the excitement was: I was going to watch a movie by Quentin Tarantino. I love movies and there must be someone great behind a film when it is promoted as 'the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino'. Already a legend with three films, Tarantino is known for his way of writing (I got to see 'Pulp Fiction') and above all, his original, if not unique, directional style.I had the chance to see all of this in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', and more. I don't know why I hadn't bothered to look up for a Tarantino film before; it didn't call my attention. Well, 'Pulp Fiction' called my attention indeed, as did 'Reservoir Dogs', but not this movie. Anyway, the thing is that I saw Uma Thurman in black and white, covered in blood, saying some phrases as being massaged by a tissue with the name 'Bill' in it.Then there's color, and I realize there's a lot of visual style in the piece. Credits roll, giving us every name except the one from the writer and director (you know who that is), who will appear after the whole ride, so you get is 'his' film. Just to pump things up, we get chapters in black screen ('Chapter one: 2'), and by chapter a blonde woman has killed a black woman. Names are not so precise; when a little girl asks the blonde woman her name, she says it, but we can't hear it because it is muted by a sound effect. The fact is, the movie is not about characters entirely, so it makes no point for us to know the name. However, the blonde (that's of course, Quentin's favorite, Uma Thurman) was known as 'Black Mamba'; but later, when in another chapter we see she could have died at her wedding we accept her as 'The Bride'. Going back, the black woman is Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and is now dead. She's now a crossed number 2 in a list The Bride has, butThe camera shows a number 1; O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)What happened to her? And we go to the past.The script provides a narration by the main character, which will encounter many people and tell us their stories. Tarantino takes the job of letting us know not only The Bride, but everyone involved in what she's doing, of course, in her own words. What is that she's doing you're wondering? She's avenging the people that literally 'took away her life'. There's nothing else you need to know about it. This script doesn't probably contain the refined dialog Tarantino is known for, but he's not going to use that dialog in a film like this; he'll take another elements. Always making references about real life with his unreal characters, Quentin lets you know that he's having fun at the same time he's being serious. He gives freedom to his actors, and that's how they triumph. His beloved Uma is on the perfect note for her character, as is she was made to play it; and I'm just talking about her, because if I name actors, I'll name characters, and I don't want to spoil the interesting story.In the end, you could consider the movie merely an action film; and even when it is that, it is beautiful. I'm not fan of action, but this has got everything it needs, with personality of course. Tarantino is crazy about violence, letting the blood out of heads, arms and legs. With a lot of intelligence, in a scene where there's a lot of killing, he passes the image to black and white, I think probably because he knows he'll show a lot of blood, and tries to make the journey less painful for us. Until The Bride blinksEverything is colored again. And we enjoy the fights, the environment, the locations, the performances (they used real Japanese actors for the shooting in the country of Japan), the details of a director that doesn't rush time, because he wants the viewer to see how real it can all actually be, in his fantasy; his fable. When he puts '4 months later', it's because that time doesn't fit in the final cut; but I think he'll shoot the entire four months if he could.Don't even talk about vengeance, and The Bride's rage, when Vernita Green apologizes while she's about getting killed, and proposes something like 'getting even' if she could. 'Don't tell me about getting even', The Bride declares. 'To get even I wouldn't have to kill you alone; I would also have to kill your daughter, wait for your husband to come back from work and kill him too'.",8,1,5,16 June 2005
Saw II," 'Yes, there will be blood...'
","James Wan is gone, and the studio needed a sequel for what was being regarded, incorrectly I think, as a new type of cult horror. Leigh Whannel stayed, and the studio decided to turn a man's interesting screenplay into 'Saw II'.The film doesn't begin where it ended up, but it didn't have to. Later on, you could say it really has a lot to do with its predecessor, because manipulating plot lines connections can be created. Most people don't care if something actually makes sense, but I do; and there's nothing in this film we could have understood without the multiple flashbacks the movie presents to help us.'Saw' was original and in a way its sequel is original too; but not as risky as the first part, that wasn't even that risky. If the writers give us something to make our minds work, why do they provide us all the hints to resolve their madness? Maybe because they know it's impossible for us to figure it out! And then what are we watching? In terms of directing, the same thing Wan did last year. A lot of loud sounds, quick shots, constant camera changes, the wanted problems and confusions with time; and if I hadn't seen the name of Darren Lynn Bousman (that's the director), I would have thought it was Wan again. But then maybe it's a comfort, because Wan did it differently.I said when I wrote about 'Saw' that it had accomplished something that wasn't all 'blood and death'. He had the courage of putting no more than two persons in a room for over an hour. But when the number of persons increases, the complexity decreases. In 'Saw II' we get around eight persons (I don't even remember) in the same environment that, according to Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) have something in common; and to get out of there they have to play a game.There's no complexity because it becomes the typical lock-up script ('Cube'); with different types of stereotyped characters, suspicions, distrusts, anger andYes, killing everywhere. A lot of blood all around in a lot of varied ways, that betray Wan's vision of a subtle and well constructed film. There was no need of most of the things included in this sequel, and the intentions don't work either. The blood didn't even make me squeeze. Does that mean that I'm brave? No, it doesn't; it means that the elements were out of place.Miraculously, at least one thing felt right. I'm talking about Tobin Bell and his expansive portrayal of which is, while not presented as it, the main character of this films. His commitment goes way beyond what's written in the screenplay and the duality of his interpretation remains to be the strongest connection of this film with the other one, which is saying a lot.I forgot to mention lots of things; some actors, some plot lines, some surprises, I don't know. But I know this: 'Saw' was a regular film; 'Saw II' is worseIt's bad.",5,2,4,15 December 2005
The Big Blue," 'Everything is better in the bottom of the sea'
","I have watched a lot of cinema; I love it. But through the years, I haven't locked myself up in my own world, with my own types of films and actors. That doesn't work. I've tried to listen older people, and learn from them. They know much more and they always want to show it. I wasn't even in the world when some of them probably saw 'Le Grand Bleu', Luc Besson's third full-length written and directed feature. They were the ones that said to me in some occasion: 'European is the best cinema'.'Le grand Bleu' has encouraged me to watch more European movies. I have watched some, but not enough. In this world full of the American films (I mean USA), which is the most distributed cinema, we don't get much more. We get French movies spoken in English so everyone can understand them; I'm talking about 'Swimming Pool'. These movies try to show what European cinema is about, and they fail most of the times. 'Le grand Bleu' is spoken in three languages; English, French and Italian. But that's another story, because of the characters in the script. The film was realized by French people; it's a French movie.Now the characters are incredibly complex, and we get to know them with their own cultures and thoughts. The film manages to amaze us with the language exchange, so we can hear every accent without missing the plot. The characters were written this way. Enzo (Jean Reno) is eating pasta at a restaurant. He's Italian. One minute later his mother arrives and he gives his dish to Johana (Rosanna Arquette). Her mother doesn't allow him to pasta unless she cooks it! Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) is a unique person. He lost his father when he was young; he died diving. Enzo was there. However, Jacques dives every day of his life. It's his nature maybe. He reaches depth levels that human beings can't. Johana sees the uniqueness in him; and falls in love, without knowing that uniqueness could betray her feelings later on.After many years, Enzo and Jacques meet again in an unbelievable event. 'Get me the petit-français (little French in English)', Enzo says. There's a diving competition and Enzo, the world champion, invites Jacques because he could be beaten by him. They haven't seen each other for years, but it's like they know everything about them; you'll find out. Enzo is arrogant and selfish, knows about women and about love. Jacques is the opposite: honest, humble and he needs to ask questions about everything but he doesn't know how. His honesty is remarkably raw: 'I'm going to beat you', he tells Enzo. Of course he will; he knows it more than anyone. The situations you'll see in this movie, you won't see them ever again. As I was trying to explain, Besson's movie escapes the world of clichés and simplicity, creating a whole different world for each of its scenes.Wonderful scenes, I must say. As Besson tells the story, he takes us to every kind of place (countries) and does it magically. Starting in Greece, then Italy, USA, Perú...It's amazing. And the sea...Well, the film's about it, but I don't want to spoil much. I will only say: If the sea could be a country, because Besson makes it look like one. He wanders over the water as if he owned it. He also goes underwater, introducing us to the dolphins (my favorite animals) in Jacques' world. They are his family and he admits it. 'No human being has this type of family', he explains to Johana. He belongs with them, somehow; he belongs with the sea. The last scenes are gifts from cinematography to us. The music is another world of its own. What a man must Eric Serra be! I make music, and this is a dream score for a film. It just fits perfectly in every frame, with its peaceful sound. For a moment I thought I would dive into the sea, and listen to those melodies, because I wouldn't mind at all.Many things are left to be said here that I wouldn't finish today. The ending has an emotional power I haven't seen in a long time. We understand it if we have watched the film. It's right there for us; we don't need to be guessing because the movie is not trying hard to achieve the metaphor. But long before, Jacques is lying in a jetty and watches the water. Then a few dolphins arrive. He looks at them, they look at him and he speaks: 'Thank you'. He's happy.",8,1,3,22 April 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," 'Let's Boogie!'
","I was talking to my mother the other day, telling her how I loved to see Johnny Depp on film. I was thinking about the excitement I get when I'm going to see one of his pictures. Anyway, besides Depp's presence there were plenty of elements that made this an expecting ride for me. Roal Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is still (or I like to think so) my favorite book. I often remember some parts and I haven't read t many times but the first time I did I couldn't believe my eyes. Charlie Bucket; that extremely lovable character, and even more lovable in the skin of the talented Freddie Highmore.I could neither believe my eyes once Depp's Willy Wonka opened that little (well, not that little) door and I was driven to that fantastic production design, colors and environment that I'm getting convinced I'll only see again in a Tim Burton film (even in an old one). With Alex McDowell at the top of the production design team, Burton made sure everything look beautiful, and it did. With 'Big Fish' a couple of years ago, I was amazed, but it was actually long ago, probably in 1990, when I discovered he was a genius. In 'Edward Scissorhands', in that unique world...Which takes me to Johnny Depp, another genius. Maybe that's the main reason why he and Burton work so well together: all the things they have in common. A friend of my brother and a friend of mine told me some weeks ago that Johnny Depp was gay. Gay because he chose to play gay characters and so. 'The pirate, the writer, that investigator was also a little gay...' I would prefer the word eccentric, or better, another word comparable to Tim Burton; unique. He's been, since ever, choosing characters the rest of the actors wouldn't even dare to get near of.This and many others are Depp's qualities. When he and Burton get together, we're grateful of watching unique (yes, again) film-making. This is not, however, his best collaboration yet, which in my humble opinion continues to be 'Sleepy Hollow'. It doesn't make a difference anyway, because it is a different movie, with different characters, with an inside sad story about heart and family and a very good piece in the end. It's also a very good performance by Depp. 'The magician', as I call him, stands out as another completely different being in a memorable composed portrayal of the ever known Willy Wonka. He worked his ideas over the original book before the screenplay was finished; he is that committed. Memorable portrayal, however polemic (for reasons I won't detail); and that could be a disadvantage for the recognition.I say ever known Willy Wonka because it is ever known by me. I got somehow moved when I saw the glass elevator going up, or the Ompa Loompas working inside the factory; but it will be just as fun for anyone who hasn't read Roal Dahl's beautiful book, because John August (who also wrote Burton's 'Big Fish') created a screenplay that brings the fable alive, with perfect narrated moments and words each person will understand. This is what I call a movie for the whole family. Don't even mention Danny Elfman's score, with the beautiful songs (he also sang them!...with machines and effects of course).And last but not least, two, if not three supporting performances for the times. David Kelly, splendid as Grandpa Joe; Deep Roy, perfect as the funny and adorable Ompa Loompa(s) and if I may say, a deep and moving Christopher Lee as Willy's father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. In the film's most moving scene, they both meet again, and you wouldn't imagine how the father admires the son, when we are made to believe he wouldn't.The screen went black and people started cheering, clapping their hands. I hadn't witnessed that since 'Titanic' in 1997, because there are times when I feel like clapping, but nobody else does, so I have to stay quiet.",8,4,6,16 August 2005
Big Fish," Like Tim Burton...
","Have you seen when something's magical? But I'm not talking of the magic magicians do, I mean when something is so incredible that it completes you inside; therefore it's magical. I'm talking about the unavoidable feeling when watching 'Finding Neverland' and about the obliged feeling when watching any Tim Burton movie. All of the magical things we live in life, one way or another, Burton has expressed them in images throughout his career...In movies.That I have seen a big part of Burton's films and that until today I have only written about 'Charlie and the chocolate factory' is beyond me; but I'll try to make it up talking a little bit about his, undoubtedly, best film. By far the most underrated movie of 2003, 'Big Fish' is a journey of the imagination to its greatest extreme; the vision of life in the eyes of a man who couldn't seem more ordinary.This man is Edward Bloom, and I would like to see life the way he does: ill and about to die, and telling his son Will (Billy Crudup) the true story of his existence, in an attempt to reconcile their differences. The thing is that Will ha always questioned his father's 'distortion' of the truth he has had to deal with all his life; and maybe this last story of Edward has the same little amount of truth as the others...Or maybe it is the whole truth.'I tell stories', the father simply declares to his son. It's a fact that everyone who likes listening to stories (and even the ones who don't) likes people to tell them with a little bit of seasoning; as you'll see Edward does. And that's also Tim Burton's main characteristic as a director; to give something extra to all of his films, which becomes a completely personal touch.So it is like if Daniel Wallace had written his novel knowing that John August would adapt it creating a marvelous script that Tim Burton would later turn into this excellent film. With the images of Phillipe Rousselot's photography, the filmmaker lets his imagination loose, letting us see that he has pretty much in common with the main character of the story.The movie is, of course, coherent as a whole; but it's nice to say that it is a collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us for a minute. One scene is particularly spectacular, for any cinema lover as for a lover of love itself. Edward is narrating the day he met his wife. 'The say that when you meet the love of your life, time stops'. Burton literally freezes the whole image, allowing the movement of the main character only, who takes some 'frozen' popcorn in the air out of the way, to get to the woman he's looking for. Instantly, everything's moving again and the scene reaches its end in a funny way you must appreciate.That scene is pure cinematographic art, the magic I'm talking about: flawless. Actually there are not many flaws in 'Big Fish', with Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney portraying the young and old Edward, respectively; both in a way so moving that it's difficult to differentiate them. Starting from Billy Crudup, the rest of the cast is perfect: inspired Danny DeVito, big presence from Matthew McGrory and Steve Buscemi playing a role that couldn't have been for another person.Burton knows which actors to choose, and which actresses. Jessica Lange shines unstoppably in her role of the faithful and loyal wife; Alison Lohnman (a promising young actress) gives interest to a part that doesn't seem to have it, and the always mystical Helena Bonham Carter doesn't do more than stealing the show. Danny Elfman's score also steals the show but it's really one more character, as in any Burton film (if you haven't seen 'Edward Scissorhands', give yourself a chance: it's a great movie, but the music...).In conclusion, 'Big Fish' is no more than the piece where all the things Burton has worked on come together. That fantastic atmosphere of each film is present in this film with a lot more characters: here we find, at least bits, of a Jack, an Ed Wood, a headless horseman and even the other Edward; scissorhands. Coming to think of it, I would like to see life not so much like Edward Bloom, but maybe like Tim Burton.",10,3,4,19 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Why so serious, right?
","'The Dark Knight' is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor 'Batman Begins'. It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline. It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: 'You complete me'. That phrase reminded me of the great movie 'Unbreakable' is. But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design. 'It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you', a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in 'Batman Begins'. Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart). Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of 'The Dark Knight's' treats to the viewer. Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town 'deserves a better kind of criminal'-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose. Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in 'Batman Begins'. Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.The rest of the ensemble, as in 'Batman Begins', is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but 'The Dark Knight' is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?",8,9,18,17 July 2008
Into the Wild," Welcome to wherever you are...
","It's a fact that some images are so beautiful that justify the whole viewing of a film. That's what I thought of 'Into the wild' the first time I saw it: I found it beautifully shot, owner of breathtaking images that tried to dissimulate its dramatic and ideological imperfections. I also thought of it as a film where ideology and drama where the same thing. Now, on a second viewing I've found a lot more, primarily because I was able to separate the dramatic part from the ideology. Ideologically, I still think it's pretty basic, but it's so dramatically powerful that it buries the ideals, or something like it. We worry about the fate of a character whose life choice (which involves living by himself in Alaska with the sole company of nature and nothing else as a final destination) has been defined by an ideal –a philosophy- and yet I find the places he goes to, the things he witnesses and the characters he encounters, more interesting than the words he speaks and the quotes he cites from a dozen books. This is probably because there are hundred guys out there who want to do what Chris McCandless (a phenomenal Emile Hirsch) did, for the same reasons too; but it's his life that Sean Penn decided to show on screen, and his work as a director is so dedicated that we have to end up caring. Penn faithfully adapted Jon Krakauer's homonymous book and personally interviewed the McCandless family to give full life to a side that the book may have left untreated. Chris relationship with his parents was difficult, he had to live many lies for many years and he could only find comfort in his sister Carine. Jena Malone plays tenderly this role that has her more as a narrator than someone with a physical presence. But that's enough for the viewer to get and idea of who Chris really was, without the philosophy included, something Carine didn't understand completely. And that's also enough for Penn. With Malone's voice, Eric Gautier's ('Diarios de Motocicleta') photography, Eddie Vedder's powerfully sang songs and the accurate casting for the marvelous supporting characters; the director commences the journey. Shot entirely on location and without the use of risk doubles whatsoever, 'Into the wild' emerges as a liberating road trip, and one that Sean Penn, eternal rebel, probably did (or would have done for that matter) when he was young. If the man was younger, I bet he would have also starred the film. In part, this is why the movie also has a documentary feel, with honest moments of Hirsch almost improvising and looking at the camera that give a sense of intimacy; with conversations overheard, or observed from a distance, as if being closer meant prying. The sceneries, all beautiful and not only admirably shot but also shot with admiration, seem as something discovered for the first time; and some people who appear to describe them are surely from the whereabouts. I don't really know if Chris actually learns anything in his journey, his ideals being so simple (something questioned by the people he meets) and him being so stubborn. He feels there's nothing new to be learnt, but what does occur to him is that he discovers. He discovers the places we experience with him, places of extreme materialism, places of extreme misery, and the balance; he discovers, with Jan (Catherine Keener, brilliant) and Rainey (Brian Dierker, very natural) that one person can have an enormous impact on others, even if it's for a few days; he discovers, with Tracy (marvelous Kristen Stewart, watch how she can't take her eyes off of him) that there's a room for romance even if we don't want it; and that one can be someone's last chance for happiness, as an old man (Hal Holbrook) expresses.These things are all the same, and conversations in the film are few because this time images say more. The construction of the film works that way, and works well because it shows us its moment of total silence -the days Chris spent in Alaska living on a bus- combined with the rest of the story, so that it doesn't become tedious to watch it all at once (we've all seen 'Cast Away'). Remember that Sean Penn is an actor, and his film has the dramatic power to survive on images only; but he knows without words we wouldn't be able to feel the way every character feels about Chris, regardless any philosophy: we don't want him to go away.",8,0,1,27 July 2009
Annie Hall," 'Write about what you know'
","'Write about what you know', or so they say. In 'Annie Hall', one of Woody Allen's first films, we can sense the application of that common phrase. Allen and Marshall Brickman wrote the script of the movie, but we can never imagine Brickman's collaboration or influence. I say this meaning no disrespect, but Woody is the man we've always seen; the beautiful neurotic we've learned to love and recognize in many characters he never even played (Mia Farrow's character in 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' or Jason Biggs' in 'Anything Else', to put to examples distant in time). And that man is the same Alvy Singer, the protagonist of this movie, to whom Allison (Carol Kane) says: 'You're cute'.And how can he not be? A comedian who divides life between the miserable and the horrible, Alvy looks at the camera and talks to us, wondering why Annie (Diane Keaton) left him; trying to understand what he did wrong. So he takes us through their relationship, and we learn that once he tells Annie about his division of life: 'You should be happy that you're miserable'. We learn about Annie and about him, but mostly about him, and we instantly understand what went wrong. There are a million ways to look at it, but Alvy, an irreparable egocentric, passed his depressive view of life to Annie: he bought her books about death, told her to visit an analyst, shut down her social life little by little. But that's not the point, because Alvy we'll never admit it, and he'll never understand. His prejudiced view of everything, his need to always teach the rest something and the thought that he knows better will never change. He tries hard to show us his childhood, which he revisits once in a while as if he was daydreaming-by himself, with Annie or with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts)-, his previous relationships and a mix of what he did as a comedian in the past and what he does now. In a monstrous editing work by Wendy Greene Bricmont and Ralph Rosenblum, we share Alvy's disappointment in life. He looks at the camera in the middle of conversations so he can analyze a situation, and stops people in the middle of the street to look for solutions.As I already said, it's in vain; and maybe Alvy's relationship with Annie was doomed from the beginning. We also get a look at Annie's previous relationships and we can understand what drove her to a man like Alvy (yes, he's a man in his forties, who tells us about being in the middle of a life crisis as he looks for explanations to what occurred to him). So if everything was lost, what is it there to find? Well, contradictorily, everything. I'll tell you...The first encounter they both share, which involves a whole afternoon, is a lesson of cinema; of character creation and writing in a genre that exists no more. The romantic comedy we watch today and that I love is so different from this fantastic piece that shares its genre definition, that if you walked today into 'Annie Hall' and they told you what kind of movie it is, you'd come out of the theater saying you've been fooled. The psychological reflections, the moments of quiet observation, the scary plausibility of the performances and the risk of making something so seemingly autobiographical (that makes you hate and love a character/human being in different moments of the ride) and re- declaring it again inside of it make 'Annie Hall' the masterpiece it is. And it's also a masterpiece because it's the essence of a cinema that has disappeared or is at least in extinction, and that Woody Allen tried to keep alive.Never taking the easy way out, always in the search of an unpredictable surprise, the writer/director bet on characters, writing about what he knew, knowing that, that way, he could never go wrong. And he never did.",10,1,2,16 December 2008
Blood Diamond," Character Strength
","I've never been over this but there's what's powerful and will never be other thing, without mattering how much violence it shows; and there's what's powerful because we're obliged to think it is and because violence simply never stops. In the first category we find 'Hotel Rwanda', a film that didn't need visual violence to get to the viewer; in the second category, Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is a perfect fit.It is undoubtedly a strong film, but it is supposed to be because of the amount of violence in it. Like in 'Hotel Rwanda', the rebel army of a location (Sierra Leone here) is killing everyone, so Zwick and his team go over the streets and generate a frightening environment with explosions, brutal killings and of course gun shots everywhere. However, the strength within 'Blood Diamond' doesn't come from its images, or at least that's what I think.It doesn't come from its story either. C. Gaby Mitchell and Charles Leavitt came up with the story for the movie; then Leavitt, writer of a very good film called 'K-Pax', worked on the screenplay. There's a problem today with films that try to deal with recent issues: most of the time they don't get it right. I didn't like 'Children of men' because I think it lost its way; I liked 'The Constant Gardener' even when I thought it didn't have its problematic all that clear. 'Blood Diamond' tries to be interesting in terms of its story; Zwick tries, but he doesn't get there.In Leavitt's tale about conflict diamonds and illegal smugglers, anyone could say that they don't understand the issue completely (even when they try) but that they find the story really interesting and entertaining, which is true. We want to be a part of the issue and be interested about it and we are in part, when we get lost in the jungle with Zwick's flawless technical team, with a lot of experts in action and war films. A very special mention to James Newton Howard's touching score, with the kids singing and the strings reaching to the heart. The man should've won an Oscar by now.But then again, 'Blood Diamond' is not a war film when there's a lot of war in it. I would dare to say it isn't even an action film because people is always escaping from the action. So where does its strength come from? The answer is from the characters and their personal story, which is really close to a dramatic event. And that's Leavitt and Zwick's greatest achievement; telling that story with compassion and shooting it with care.The story is about Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), an African man who, like many others, has lost his family. He hides a big and soft and rare diamond in the mines; Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a smuggler, wants it, so he contacts Solomon and promises him to get his family back in exchange of the diamond. He will do this with the help of Maddy (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist who needs Danny's smuggling facts to write a story that will bring the real issue of the film (the market of conflict diamonds) to light.It's amazing how Djimon Hounsou always seems to be playing the same role but gets a different approach every time and amazes again. His emotional range here is admirable and it's not clear to me that he's been nominated for an Academy Award two times when he probably should have been nominated for 'Gladiator' and won; but that was Benicio Del Toro's year.It's true: DiCaprio isn't perfect here. It's also true that he was nominated for the wrong movie (just watch him in 'The Departed') this year. His time will come, but we can't deny his South African accent is great and that he delivers a performance that goes all the way, playing a cold man we shouldn't empathize with, but we do. Most of the times we like the main character, whether he is good or bad. Here, the fact that we like Danny Archer is more because of DiCaprio than because of the story.What Jennifer Conelly does is very brave. She has been choosing the right roles since 'A Beautiful Mind' and here she goes right into the jungle and her merit is that she appears to be just another normal human being. She's beautiful and you don't even notice her. She tries to bring the part of the issue to life and we care even when, as I said, we don't totally get it. But 'Blood Diamond' is a very good film, better than 'The Constant Gardener' and way better than 'Children of Men'. If you don't relate with the issue, you will find the characters interesting. Watch it; you won't regret it.",8,0,0,10 March 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Young women with female leads...Keira Knightley
","To write about this movie is almost as difficult as watching it. Jane Austen wrote a novel that became famous in the whole world which has had, as other recognized books ('Vanity Fair', 'Little Women'), lots of cinema and television adaptations; as well as lot of actors playing its main roles. In these specific novels I mentioned, the main characters are females.This takes me to my statement about how a young woman can carry with a movie by herself. Recently, Reese Witherspoon starred in 'Vanity Fair' and she did an excellent job; but she was near her thirties. However, Keira Knightley (Oscar nominated for her role in 'Pride & Prejudice') is only twenty years old, and Winona Ryder was twenty three when she became the soul of 'Little Women'.I don't mean to compare, but it's not acting talent I am comparing, but acting situations and character similarity. The acting situation is the chance of walking the red carpet having a nomination with twenty years or a little bit more. I don't know much, but I know that many men have been nominated while being young, but not many women.In this case, Keira would have more merit for being nominated being younger; but that's not the case. The character similarity is instantly felt. One of five sisters, Lizzie Bennet (Knightley) is not the eldest but probably the wisest about life, the most charming and the most difficult when it comes to love relationships; kind of what Winona's Jo March was like.Also in both stories, the five sisters have to be presented in society because they may be beautiful, but they are not classy or well known. As I see it on film, Luisa May Alcott's story is more about all of the girls, and Jane Austen's is focused on Lizzie's life. Either way, it's the actress who plays the character that has to stand out.Deborah Moggach had the task of adapting the novel to the screen, in her first screenplay presented in theaters worldwide. The words the characters speak are beautiful, and she puts them together professionally; I also said it when I wrote about 'Vanity Fair'. But for some reason, 'Pride & Prejudice' is less bearable than the latter one, which lasts more than twenty minutes longer.Joe Wright, the director (and also in charge of his first project to be shown in theaters), also did an admirable work (achieving a perfect and unforgettable ending); perhaps too correct as Spielberg's direction of 'Munich'. Mainly, I guess it's the price to pay for adapting a novel in its whole form, or the fact that Winona Ryder and Reese Witherspoon had a noticeable cast behind them, that made the movie more entertaining.Here we have Donald Sutherland, who seems to be trying for an Oscar with roles as kind, old men (see 'Cold Mountain', 'The Italian Job') mostly fathers, which are always acceptable and notable. We have Mathew Macfadyen, who has got the role of his short career as Mr. Darcy, and who slows the movie down at times with his face of sadness; but the viewer understands it's part of his character.We also have Jena Malone, Brenda Blethyn, even Judi Dench and there's nothing exciting we get to see on screen. It's the incredible Keira Knightley who makes the picture only and just watchable. The young and beautiful actress has done little things with great results, and even though her portrayal isn't the greatest of all time, it becomes the high point of the movie and enough reason to honor her on growing gift.",6,2,7,20 August 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Nice? No; magnificent
","I've just finished watching a wonderful piece of work. I'm not going to say a piece of art, because I could be wrong. I was talking with my father, who said about the move: 'It's not a piece of art', but couldn't even say what a piece of art was for him.It was without question one of last year's best films, and the cult audience loved it; but I'm not willing to expand on that. But I'm willing to say how disappointed I am because Hollywood keeps underestimating the very best they have in their hands. Just because Jim Carrey stars in the film, as he starred in one of my favorite movies, the underrated 'The Truman Show'; or underrated movies like another of my favorites, 'Almost Famous'There's a long list of underrated films; Michel Gondry's feature is definitely in that list.When you think of it, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is not just wholeness as a movie, but for all the persons involved in the project. From the top; if you think about Michel Gondry's work as a video director, and his early full-length projects, this is the best he has achieved; he's starting from now on. He did a correct work in 'Human Nature', but I didn't think his direction was at Kaufman's script level. But now it's a different thing. It's the correct commitment with team working one of the reasons that make this movie great. And Kaufman, wellI know we've been disappointed because he hasn't been recognized, but the way I see it, this is not a merciful OscarThis is the best he has written (although I admit I haven't seen 'Being John Malkovich)! I know Kate Winslet (Clementine) is one of the best actresses working today. She never disappoints and always adds personality to her roles, but has never been recognized for that. However, surpassing her remembered Rose ('Titanic'), she confronts a much complex role; deeper and flexible. And she does it as perfectly as she has always done it, and even better than her 'forgotten by me as I watched her performance in this movie' Rose. Jim Carrey (Joel) is one of my favorite actors, and he has built a spectacular career. As it happened to me with Adam Sandler and his performance in 'Spanglish' (although it's not exactly the same situation); it has happened with Jim Carrey playing dramatic roles. I'm in love with both of his sides as an actor; comedy and drama. 'Liar, Liar' is my favorite comedy, and I think Jim Carrey is great in it. But then, he can make you cry; he's that great actor, and while he won't be recognized for it, leaving behind 'Man on the moon', 'The Majestic' and even 'The Truman Show'; Carrey has arrived at his best dramatic performance. I don't want to reiterate too much in these circumstances, but it's another voice, another innocent and warm look; magic in his movements: 'I could die here, Clem; I'm exactly where I wanna be'. This and many other phrases written in another thought-provoking, messing with human mind and conscience, wise realistic screenplay from Charlie Kaufman.With Tom Wilkinson (Howard) in his wonder years, Kirsten Dunst (Mary) shining as I hadn't seen her since 'Crazy/Beautiful', Elijah Wood (Patrick) in his career's most calmed and natural performance, and another amazing interpretation in his own territory of independent cinema by the grand Mark Ruffalo (Stan); wholeness in a movie. Positive aspects for everybody.Michel Gondry's camera takes us to a fantasy world where he makes things appear and disappear, move and stay stillBeautiful music composed perfectly for each moment by Jon Brion (these are his types of movies)Eye-shocking cinematography by Ellen Kuras in every frameAnd so they make us watch and cry, laugh, feel for the characters; we want the best for them when they keep on meeting in the present, in the past, in the future; and we let ourselves go to those unreachable places you will only reach if you're flying in the world of wordsWords written with wisdom with the power that relies on the actors, because they must bring these beautiful words to life. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of those movies you can't regret watching even when you like them or not. One of those that keep you talking an hour after experiencing them Now it's the second time I've watched the movieI don't give second viewings to moviesI have watched my favorite movie only once.",9,0,1,23 May 2005
Taken," Reshaping...it's possible, but you gotta know how
","'I'm retired, but not dead', Brian Mills, a former CIA agent tells a friend in Paris when he can't understand how he manages to get any kind of information about anything. Mills, played by Liam Neeson with unstoppable force and as an old-fashioned vigilante who fears no one and kills everyone in every room he sets foot in; is in Paris because his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, 25 and capturing the essence of a 17 year-old) was kidnapped by some Albanians while on vacation with a friend.That's all about the plot, and even if you know how it ends, it's not everything about 'Taken'. It's no coincidence that Pierre Morel, the director of the movie, was the cinematographer of 'The Transporter' and 'Danny the Dog'; and of course it's less of a coincidence that Luc Besson, writer of those films, wrote this film (alongside Robert Mark Kamen, who also wrote 'Transporter') and produced it.Besson never ceases to amaze me. This whole decade, he has created a new kind of action piece and reshaped it, again and again. I'm not sure if I know the exact formula yet, but I can tell you some of the elements. I use the word 'reshape' because Besson's writing material is never original, but it never sounds repeated. The same happens with the action itself; whether it's Corey Yuen's fantastic use of cars in 'Transporter', Leterrier's excellent management of the fight scenes in 'Dog' or Morel's wonderful car chase scene around a trailer-or any single frame of a gunshot, for that matter- in this movie, the producer always gets the best out of the directors he chooses.'Taken' is so straightforward in his development, and this is respected by the whole cast and crew and assures the success of every moment of every scene in front of the viewer. The parental relationship Besson is so obsessed about and never fully developed (watch 'Dog', 'Wasabi', 'Leon', 'Nikita' to experience the pieces) is the basis of the moving content of the film, and it's written with enviable intelligence. When Kim is kidnapped and his father decides to look for her desperately, we don't know very much about him, or her, or their relationshipAnd somehow that's precisely why we root for him, for a man who burns down every place he visits. By not giving us enough information of the characters, Besson leaves us no choice but to believe in Neeson's confident face-and fate-, no matter what.Brian, with this confidence, says (and not to a friend): 'I'll hunt you, I'll find you and I'll kill you'. The movie doesn't waste time in unnecessary dialogs, shots, or scenes. This father always goes right to the point, and the camera goes with him skipping everything in the way. As I told you, you may know how it ends, but you can't imagine how impressive the ride in between is.",7,0,1,26 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Imagining Tim Burton
","It's a challenge for someone like Tim Burton to do an adaptation of the Alice books by Lewis Carroll. You see, Burton has never been and could never be recognized for his writing, most of which he doesn't do. What I mean is that he always starts from scratch, as he bases his movies on things to create especially breathtaking worlds. His art has always been more on the visual side than on the storytelling, and in many ways his 'Alice in Wonderland' is a confirmation of this and of his talents as an author; his capacity to remain unchangeable through everything. He doesn't have to, but apparently he wants to and, if anything, his 'Alice' is the new expression of a co-existent universe that persists among all of his films. This universe is also coherent, because visually it has a special, recognizable mood, always accompanied delightfully by Danny Elfman's original music. Seeing Alice opening that little door and entering Neverland is not very different from Ichabod Crane's recurrent dream in 'Sleepy Hollow', or from Edward Bloom's arrival to Spectre in 'Big Fish', for that matter. What else can I tell you about a story we all know? What else can I suggest than going in and see for yourselves what Tim Burton has made with it, visually? Cinema being a visual art and Burton being a visual master, the result is, and this should be a unanimous thought, one dazzling set after another, with a particular choice of color and light that should be related to the characters who inhabit each one. The most interesting of these choices might be the normal world Alice lives in; a boring, organized, aristocratic, choreographed London that Burton shoots with irony, occasionally transforming it into something more edgy with the thoughts of Alice's imagination (imagination is the key to every Tim Burton movie). If you don't know the characters, any review should say nothing about them so the movie ride becomes a bit more unpredictable and surprising. It's clearly a story that screenwriter Linda Woolverton (who wrote 'The Lion King' among other Disney features) thought about once and wrote without expecting many changes, and probably Chris Lebenzon treated the editing process the same way. The story and its development, obvious and rudimentary, adds nothing new to the table. But the movie reminds us that the co-existence of a whole universe among all the Burton films is not only visual; this universe also exists thematically. Maybe the director was never able to sustain a complete story â€“he doesn't achieve it here- and maybe now I realize (I was telling Grillo) the reason I love 'Big Fish' so much is because, like I said in my review, it's a 'collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us'; therefore so many little stories that don't have to be explained and completely resolve, have more weight than the story of a man and his son that is the movie, which, by the way, is the movie's point: 'The man becomes his stories'. But that man, Edward Bloom, was one of Burton's outcasts, nostalgic and imaginative (again, the key to any Burton movie), constantly going back to his childhood years, where unresolved dreams and issues always awaited the mentioned Ichabod Crane, and an Edward who wanted to have real hands, and a Willy Wonka who wanted his father to be proud of him. In this way (and there's probably things I'm missing that will come back soon or revisiting the director's films), it's perfectly clear that the Mad Hatter (the most developed character in this movie; there always has to be one above the rest) has lost his head and is always looking for a sense of 'whatever you wanna call it' in his life; you can see it in his crazy eyes. With or without Alice. Before and after her.And some people still wonder why Johnny Depp is the absolute protagonist of the film.Special note: The portrayal of Alice by Mia Wasikowska, which will never be recognized, is one of the best performances you'll ever see in this genre. The idea of a child who wants to dream but knows that it should be impossible at a particular stage of life; a constant disbelief for everything she sees that can be perceived in her look and annoying tone of voice; a little girl who's becoming a woman but knows her father spoiled her too much and it will be difficult to change that and accept maturity. A girl without self confidence, even when she knows she has all the answers.",7,1,3,9 March 2010
Saw," Being different...
","I was truly looking forward to see this movie. It was one of the most talked about films from the last months. Some consider it as one of the best movies of 2004; some think it's a terrible movie; some didn't get it; some were amazed by itOne friend of mine, who loves movies, or so I think, told me: 'It was too weird for my taste'; and another friend said it was great. Maybe I'd explain 'Saw' from the first idea (although I won't), but I would never start from the second one.The movie is different in its own good. Different is great, and more when it comes to horror movies (wait, 'Saw' is not exactly horror, but I'll explain later). It's one of the bravest movies in the genre I've seen in a while. It commences with James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who are probably close friends and workers. I imagine they had this incredible idea that could step out of everything we watch every day, and developed it. Later, it became a phenomenon. What they got with the project? Recognition and probably (although not luckily) success. Wan has an eye for this stuff. His style is riveting as it is exuberant and in some way trapping. He got his team, he worked hard and that's why he generated what he generated.The special effects in the movie seem exaggerated but unforced at the same time, so they can seem realistic. Julie Berghoff, for a first important job, did an outstanding job designing the production. Excellent visuals in this piece. Mysterious sceneries and characters wander through the set; prepared for anything. When Wan uses the typical compilation of scenes with strong sounds, so everything seems scary and freaky (then we can say 'weird' here); or when we sense the problems the movie has with time, because during most of the film you can't tell if a thing is happening or if it has happened We just keep watching, and don't care about it, because he has done the rest so well (but we still can't forgive him everything).Don't say about the narrative. Both Wan and Whannell managed to create realistic characters that are also quirky. I mean; quirky is common in movies from the genre, butRealistic? Not common at all. Then he drives us to his unbelievably original story, which involves the 'weirdest' villain mask since 'Scream'. This plot is extremely intelligent, dealing with the issue that a crazy sadistic killer bastard might have the purpose to save people trying to take their lives away. It could be. Even when we don't see him, he says phrases: 'People are so ungrateful to be alive', or 'no one appreciates their blessings'. That's why this man invents perfectly detailed games for people to kill themselves. Anyone can call him the 'Jigsaw Killer', but Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) explains: 'Technically, he is not a murderer. He's never killed anyone'. These games you'll see; I won't even say the most important one of the movie, because is one of the great things the movie has. What the hell has happened? This is what Dr. Gordon and Adam (Leigh Whannell) are wondering when they wake up in an isolated room. A whole movie ensues in there.Performances are adequate and precise. Without risking too much, actors level up with the complex material. Even Leigh Whannell gets his acting chance as Adam (writing has benefits). His performance is alright; he could have done better when he wrote the screenplay and new more than the rest. Cary Elwes remains unrecognizable in every role he does. I hadn't seen him since 'The cat's meow', where I didn't recognize him either. He stands out, and made me forget about the stupid character he played in 'Liar Liar'. Danny Glover, away from movies since 'The Royal Tenenbaums', plays Detective Tapp as he only can. It was good to see him again. I can also talk about Monica Potter (Alison) who had clearly been away since 'Along came a spider', where she was as unnoticeable as she is here.It happens to me, as I see some movies of this genre, that I notice a certain complexity. I recently saw 'My little eye'; I'm talking about movies when not everything is blood and death. There is also an amount of persons, who have their own personalities. It's not, I told a friend, 'the guy with the gun', 'the other man'. And that's another adding to the movie's stand out originality. It's not horror; I would take a chance to say. It's suspense, and even drama. You won't jump off your seat. You get what I'm saying? But what is it that makes this a regular movie, if there are so many great things about it? It's about taking the risk of finishing the challenge; about not falling into the abyss of cliché and ordinariness. This film's triumph would have been achieved if they had written everything with the same intelligence. But they arrived at the ending and met the dilemma. Did they finish the challenge? No, they didn't. And it doesn't matter what their objective was.",6,0,2,2 May 2005
Up," It's where I'm going
","Intentionally or not, with its latest movies Pixar's been trying to get closer to reality. They've invented every imaginary world possible so they started thinking about the possibilities of developing animated fiction in real life. In 'The Incredibles' this could be seen in the normal life of a family and the existence of, primarily, a real world; but the characters were superheroes. Brad Bird doubled the bet with 'Ratatouille': the non-verbal communication between a rat and a human, the logic possibility of thinking anyone can cook and a rat finally doing it, in an entire human world. You may object this initial development, but there's fact and it's that Remy the rat is the first (and only) Pixar character that wants and tries hard enough to get out of his parallel world; the animal world. If Ratatouille wasn't perfect it's because the reality would have been total if rats didn't actually speak. It was not possible, and even when in 'Up' this has a coherent explanation, the 'speaking animal' factor isn't eliminated. However, in an animated world that lives because of animals that speak, Pixar's recent greatness uses this as a secondary element, something merely comical. It works perfectly that dogs have special collars made for them so they can speak, but remain as stupid as we sometimes imagine them in the real world, therefore are capable of leaving aside any kind of seriousness at the sight of a squirrel or a tennis ball. The dogs in the film appear long after it's begun, when Carl Frendricksen is in the Paradise Falls of South America, a place he arrived at by flying his own house with balloons tied to it. Frendricksen is a grumpy old man that waited until the day before his home would be destroyed to realize his and his deceased wife's (Ellie) lifelong dream. Not used to getting help, Carl discovers when he's already in the sky that a little boy scout called Russell has come along with him. As it has always happened, the movie's center is the relationship between the old man and the little boy, but director Peter Docter ('Monsters Inc.'), co-director Bob Peterson (who also voices the film's two funniest characters) and their writing team drive 'Up' away from every sentimentalism in this particular aspect. The movie is too short and doesn't seem to want to waste time. That's why, during the beginning, in the presentation of Carl and Ellie's love, specifically in a musical visualization of their lives brilliantly handled by Michael Giacchino's perfect and familiar score (Oscar anyone?), the filmmakers get rid of all cheesiness.Essentially, 'Up' is (in this aspect we can relate it to 'The Incredibles') an action movie: packed with the usual Pixar dose of comedy and endearing characters, with the particular addition that it goes, within a frame of reality (the dogs speak because of the collar but no other animal speaks this time), to places no other movie –animated or not- has imagined. 'Up' is about what its title strategically hides: reaching the limits, of the animal and human world, of the animated world, in every scene, and surpassing them; by giving us a hero in the skin of a grumpy old man, by including an element of surprise, by putting its characters on the edge of death and by making something breathtaking of every scenario. And don't get confused. 'Up' is not only visually breathtaking, but breathtaking in terms of an original story that comes along and leaves before you even notice it, literally taking your breath away. If you pay attention, you'll realize that Carl and Russell get to South America from USA in a frame of second. It's the only element that may question the film's embrace of reality, and that's because a great adventure, in Pixar's terms, can take place anywhere; it's just that this time they decided to situate it up high in the sky, which is also the direction in which their film-making is headed, if they haven't been stopped by the highest existing cloud yet.",10,0,1,18 June 2009
The Descent," What horror is all about
","I'm really glad with this so called 'renaissance' of the horror genre. Well, I call it like that, but there are different names of course. A time has come where filmmakers are determined to frighten the viewer and not just with sounds and images and blood, but with a story and characters that help creating the tension in the environment. In other words, not a remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'The Fog'.Kind of what 'The Others' did, memorably, in its time. Neil Marshall is the name of the British man who made all of this possible with 'The Descent'. He's made a motion picture that's very, very scary. In the line of 'Saw', but gratefully with more intelligence, Marshall wrote his centered story focused in a little number of characters and one particular place; six girlfriends and the mountains: a cave.At this moment I'm regretting not having seen 'The Cave', which I assume must have been a piece of crap and a perfect example to compare with this movie. It sounds simple, yes; some friends, an expedition, an inconvenientIt's not. Before we are taken to the encounter, we witness an accident: Sarah looses her daughter and husband. With this, Marshall is able to draw the relationships between the girls and explain future actions.You know when a movie is working on the characters when you can think about what the will do next. In 'The Descent', there's a lot of that. After these friends go down the cave and events start unfolding, it's clear that survival comes first but: whose survival? Marshall allows us to watch, accurately, how the situation or the atmosphere may change the attitude of a person.As the movie advances, we began to wonder about what's going to happen; to whom. We start making our predictions and we think we've got everything right when, unexpectedly, Marshall survives the test of predictability too: he constructs human beings with feelings and the capacity of reasoning even in the most difficult situations. It's not that I won't, but that I can't tell what happens, which is different.Luckily, the characters do things that help every inconvenience, and any thing that seems supernatural is not; all is kept between the limits of reality. The film is very good because it drags you inside; it drags you inside the cave when you could have stayed outside, if you know what I mean. It is very good because Marshall coordinates his cameras professionally, with shaky movements and a lot of darkness that becomes another main character.The girls are portrayed by several British actresses with lots of roles in T.V and an Asian actress with a Latin name. They are all perfect, but ultimately it's not about them; it's about Marshall's accomplishment with his independent company and surprising film that shocks you with its ending and instantly activates a conversation about the film itself and the world of movies.",8,2,5,7 April 2006
Inside Man," Lee is there...
","You get the feeling with Spike Lee films that they tend to become longer than you expected; that the ending doesn't seem to arrive. At first, you want the movie to end because of this, but then Lee grabs your attention again, and when the movie is over you are left wanting for more; it doesn't matter what kind of film it is.'Inside Man' starts off with the incomparable face of Clive Owen, as he gives a superb introductory narration. The camera shows his face and we can see constant changes of light and movement in the background, apparently a brick wall. This speech demands your attention and you should listen because, even when 'Inside Man' is a thriller with all the basic elements, it contains a little more.When the speech's over, we go to some classic Lee shots of Manhattan (quick changing cuts courtesy of Lee's frequent editor Barry Alexander Brown); reminding us how good he is at depicting the location's mood, either with a statue, a building or just the American flag. You should take this time, while the main credits roll, to try and remember what Owen said; because after 'directed by Spike Lee', everything moves at high speed.There's a bank robbery, detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are assigned to the case, they encounter Captain Darius (Willen Dafoe) and suddenly people start coming in and out of places without a pause; including hostages inside the bank. Owen says in his speech that he's planned the perfect robbery, and it sure looks like it; but that's all I can say.The pace of the images was a wise choice by Lee to really get the viewer into the film, and this aspect works all the way through. The problem, however, comes with the words. The screenplay is, surprisingly, original. Writer Russell Gewirtz is the guy who's written the script that will probably get DeNiro and Pacino together again: that's something. His work for this film is also something, with an unexpected amount of cleverness for the simplicity his premise has. It's contradictory, but in the good way; with some innovation but never forgetting the 'thriller' essence.But what's admirable about Gewirtz' writing is that he doesn't try to play the viewer (like 'Derailed', recently, also with Owen); he lays out the results with honesty and professionalism. Maybe this aspect sounds strange but, although people like being tricked, there's a good way to do it and I'm getting tired of no one doing it right. On the other hand, not tricking could be even better than tricking well, if you follow.Now follow Denzel Washington's work during this decade; virtually every role he's played involves carrying a gun (you should check his whole career, he's got a good relationship with the weapon). I love Denzel Washington, I really do; and that's why I've tolerated most of the crappy things he's been doing. Also because he's always good in them, just thatGood. But I've got news for you: his portrayal here is the best since his last Oscar for 'Training Day', where he also played a man of the law. I could easily say that Denzel Washington is the only megastar today who delivers good performances and also has a lot of fun. You can see him excel here; comfortable, all over the place, even more solid than in his directorial debut: 'Antwone Fisher'.Another thing I could easily say is that Washington plays a similar line of characters; always ending up triumphant, and Clive Owen is the same. He does it again here, and he doesn't have to show his haunting face to triumph. And Jodie Foster's character, wellYou see, she appears on screen, being the megastar she is; and I don't know how she manages to make us think she's a normal person. That's something megastar Denzel Washington hasn't achieved in a long time.The fact remains that, among all the polished though not great word, Lee's influence is still there, everywhere. His feelings are not left out in this action-packed piece; and you get all this little moments where you stop doubting that this thriller is 'a Spike Lee joint'.",7,2,3,22 June 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Entertainment at all costs...
","Should I say it or not? Well, I will: 'The Da Vinci Code' is a film made for two kinds of people; the ones who have read the book and the ones who haven't. Being a part of the first group, I could be a little subjective, but I'll do my best and just review the movie as what it is: non- stop quality entertainment (I think I said that about 'House of Wax', without the quality part).Why do I say this? Because as a reader of the book, I find myself in a position many may have encounteredThe movie and the book are not the same thing: the book is an entertainment literature piece, with very accurate descriptions of important places of the world and a not very complex vocabulary or technique, but a very detailed view of the facts; the picture is a gift to the interested viewer and a clearly modified version of Dan Brown's novel, however done with the eye for entertainment, which becomes the only thing in common between both elements.You see, Ron Howard is a truly gifted director and Akiva Goldsman is a truly gifted writer, but 'Da Vinci' as a film was, above all things, a marketing project to them, and to Dreamworks of course. If Dan Brown had adapted the screenplay it would have probably been the longest this year; he couldn't have taken anything of, so that's what Goldsman did. And that's also why the movie moves so fast. The viewer senses this too, but he doesn't mind because, just like in the novel, when 'The Da Vinci Code' begins, you can't stop until you get to the end of it. This said, Howard is also very loyal to the viewer, giving him what he wants to get; showing him what he wants to see, the way he wants to see it. So basically, if the spectator hasn't read the book, he'll be amazed; with the accomplished frames and shots of places from all around Europe, as the book exposes. Because of the same reasons I've been explaining, the cast is not given a chance to shine And it is an all-star cast! Tom Hanks in the main role of Robert Langdon is extremely measured and calm, but you can see clearly that it is not his fault and that he enjoyed playing the part. Audrey Tatou portrays a calm character in some way, so her performance just fits. Jean Reno is also inside the ride, speaking his very best French and stealing every scene he is in. Alfred Molina participates a little bit as the Spanish Opus Dei member Manuel Aringarosa, who built his first church with the albino Silas, played fearlessly by the unique Paul Bettany. And do I have to mention Sir Ian McKellen's gracious presence as 'Sir' Leigh Teabing? Yes, a Sir playing a 'Sir', having a lot of fun.That's what everybody had in 'The Da Vinci Code's' set: fun. That's what the movie is and that's the feeling you get when looking at the audience trying to find out if they're buying the story or not; specially if you've read the novel. By the way, Hans Zimmer 's score is remarkable, perfect: the man is a genius.",7,0,1,22 December 2006
Mystic River," This is where we bury our sins...
","If someone had told me what a great director Clint Eastwood is, I would have rented all of the films he directed and watched them in an entire day. I just couldn't believe (as I was watching this film) that this man was behind the camera in all this process. Behind everything. He has created an environment for his characters, a place and time for their development. This doesn't come much often.An event happens, and it establishes the bases for the rest of the story. But it's not just about that event, I thought myself as I heard the words said from Brian Helgeland's real screenplay. It's about the people involved in that event. It's about the lives these people carry with. There is so much focus on the characters that in occasions we let the event aside.Sean Penn made two great performances in 2003. One was the man he portrayed in '21 Grams'. The other one is Jimmy Markum, and I can't tell which of these performances is greater. So many words are trapped in his eyes when he is crying. Jimmy wants everything to be alright, and he would do anything to achieve that goal. Penn is the kind of actor that makes you feel the way he does.Tim Robbins found the note here. Well, he always finds it, but this one sounds better than any other. Maybe this is just the character he was looking for. Dave Boyle is the person that could become a phantom. He could not know where he is. He could have been somewhere else for too long. He could be in a trance. And to know that, you just need to look at Robbins's face.About Sean we sense loneliness. He is waiting for his second chance, and doesn't mind to wait. He would wait a whole life. Bacon has never been recognized for his work. I don't know if he had the chance with Sean's role. But I can give him the fact that he is a risky actor. He doesn't mind going deep.And women, always there, for men. They don't seem to be that important for their husbands. But they really are. Celeste loves Dave, and trusts him. But she can't do that when some other things are happening, although she wants to. There's a limit. Marcia Gay Harden is great. She shows a lot of emotion always, you can't keep your eyes off her. Her performance here could be, or is, as good as the one in 'Pollock'. There are also those wives who know all, and wait until things happen. Annabeth is that kind of wife, and Laura Linney shows it in most of the film's key moments.The cinematography is wonderful, as the music and the details in each frame.But these three friends, I mean: ¿What has happened between them? ¿In who they've become? ¿What do they feel for each other? There's a strong string that unites them. They have been in the same places and they truly understand why they do what they do. They grew together, and know that some things changed them. Maybe they are not the same persons anymore, but how could they find out.How.",9,1,2,8 February 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," What they offer...
","I have said that I've fallen asleep during action sequences in movies; and it happened in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'. The noise, the energy, the adrenaline are all stuff that should easily keep me awake, or wake me up if I sleep. But it is impossible, even more when they're pointless, like in this movie. As an action film, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' sucks.Now you're wondering if it works as the other things it seems to be trying to achieve. The answer is that it could, but lacks the potential in few but important details. It is not a terrible movie, no, but it has its things. Whoever wants to accept those things, because of reasons I'll explain now, there they go; but I can't.'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is the typical summer film that arrives at the time of the year where the audience wants to have fun. The package of its type includes two hot and well known stars playing the lead roles, an attempt for chemistry and fun and stuff blowing up everywhere, generally ('Bad Boys II').All those are nice elements, and even if they work well or not, the package comes with a mix of genres that confuse the ones who look for something more than amusement. It's not that I'm always looking something more than having fun, but when the fun comes from nowhere, I can't laugh. Simon Kinberg's script is a union of unfinished ideas put into paper, including confusing time fixation, incoherent scene connections and very (really) very little plot substance whatsoever. The rest of the team, very familiar to these types of film, makes its best to get the visuals correctly and not to screw up, which turns impossible because of the script and Doug Liman's direction that tends to mock his own style and film. The man has done interesting films; I don't know who dragged him into this.The thing is that it happens to me with these movies, where I am never satisfied. I couldn't explain what a movie needs to satisfy me right now, but it's never enough. I compare this film with 'Hollywood Homicide'; it could have been so much better. There you had Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford having fun in a stupid story that lasted for two hours. Here, the theme is similar, although ironically opposite (you'll understand if you saw the latter one), and you have the 'hot as hell' Angelina Jolie playing Mrs. Smith and the 'sex symbol' Brad Pitt playing her husband. We also get well known directors in small roles, the authentic Vince Vaughn (Eddie), who's always nice to see, as Pitt's ally, and my man from 'The O.C'; Adam Brody (Benjamin Diaz). He is not given much to do, but for a start he shows his comedic talent in every one of his words. I don't want to say much more, but I find the boy a very promising actor; great things are ahead of him.The package, as what it tends to achieve, it's perfect. There's an excellent chemistry between the two leads, who besides being hot and well known, are good actors. The best scenes of the piece, where they show their comedic timing, are developed in a marriage consultancy office; you can tell they're both having fun. And the people, yes; they'll attend. There'll be money butWhere's the movie?",6,6,13,23 June 2005
The Departed," The Question, Part 1
","Remember when I said 'Match Point' moved fast? Well, 'The Departed' moves faster; so much faster that the name of the film appears after the movie has begun developing the plot and it would have been the same if it appeared at anytime. Characters speak without pauses, throwing intelligent lines from time to time; the music is too loud and it never seems to stop. Every time I paid attention the loud music was in the back; as if the montage of the first scene was still running.It's fine, but I was thinking about the beginning of 'Goodfellas' and how much I loved the speech he gives; gentle and slowPaused. Here, Jack Nicholson gives a wonderful opening speech but it goes so fast that if you close your eyes you miss its essence. The same goes for some talks between Vera Farmiga and Leonardo DiCaprio and between Matt Damon and Alec Baldwin that lie between the best little scenes of the movie.I didn't watch the original piece in which William Monahan based his script, but Monahan still doesn't convince me. There's a lack of seriousness to his work and he'll get an Oscar for it. However, when his 'Kingdom of Heaven' was short of words, this screenplay has words to spare. I probably miss the days of 'Taxi Driver', when Bob drove through the streets and there was no need for words to express his feelings.Here we encounter the great Martin Scorsese in a rush, as his movie of course. The pictures of Scorsese I've watched made me understand he was a calm and observing director, with a lot of messages to give in each film and a lot of importance to give to the screenplay. 'The Departed' doesn't instantly find messages, but the screenplay rushes; and Scorsese doesn't stay behind. With his ability, Marty followed his characters rapidly, moving constantly his camera; whether in a chase scene or in a chat inside of an office where the close ups are instantaneous and the frames show a character by the second. In addition, he still found the time of creating new and interesting filming shots that go along with the film's rhythm.That 'The Departed' is far from being Scorsese's best picture is a fact; but it's probably the best he's done this decade. And that's enough to get him an Oscar before he starts desperately trying for one and goes back to make films without a burden or a personal pressure; because he won't give up the crusade for an award he simply deserves.As I said, a part of me wants the old Bob back, but as the years go by, Leo is kind of growing on me. I mean, he'll never be my favorite actor or anything similar; but his performance is the finest of 'The Departed' cast. I look back at his retarded kid in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and I think to myself that when DiCaprio isn't on the main focus (because it's where he's always been), he can hand in some great portrayals.And what an ensemble! I mean, Scorsese can get big names that are among the biggest talents. Don't even mention Jack Nicholson, who's not in the run for the big awards because we are rewarded when we watch him on screen; it's his present to us. Mark Wahblberg, an actor I've always liked, could have gotten recognition for a couple of films where he outshined the leads some time ago; but is perfect here in a role that was definitely for an older person. If we say older persons we find the fabulous portrayal of Ray Winstone and two underrated performances of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin (what a year he had). What was even more underrated was Matt Damon's incredible turn as Collin Sullivan, the second in line after DiCpario's performance in the movie and easily his best labor since 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'.Is anyone sure if Vera Farmiga has nothing to do with the Arquette family? She looks a lot likeAnyway, she's a good actress. I refuse to talk about Anthony Anderson, but the question remains: 'Is 'The Departed' the Best Picture Oscar of the year?'.",8,0,0,29 January 2007
When Harry Met Sally...," When everything changed...
","Whenever I hear something about him, I wonder; what ever happened to Rob Reiner's career? What ever happen to that man that could direct any genre? The man who made us cry in 'Stand by me' or made us scare to death in 'Misery' is now out of the focus. I saw his last film, 'Alex & Emma' (which I tried to tolerate because of the actors who starred in it) and it was shameful to see he was promoting it with and advertisement saying: 'from the director of' The director of 'When Harry met Sally', this movie, Reiner's most successful romantic comedy and film ever and by now probably a classic, because of Meg Ryan's famous scene and because of its general charm. Believe, everything is pink in this film, and the romantic story it proposes is something everyone has experienced. In some ways it reminded me to 'The mirror has to faces', but that couple relationship was totally different.Here there are two guys in their 20's, travelling to New York for a better life, arguing about the things they think, do, and expect of their future, and so on. These scenes in the car driving to New York could be extremely boring, but writer Nora Ephron (who would write for Meg Ryan again in 'You've got mail') makes them very interesting. 'How can't you be afraid of death?', Sally tells Harry, and he answers: 'I'm just prepared, when I read a book I always read the ending first in case I die and I can't finish it'.Years later that trip is history, and they both have various encounters through the years. She pretends he doesn't recognize her, because she remembers him perfectly. She was actually captivated by him on that trip but never told him. On the other hand, he pretends to be casual, but hasn't erased her from his mind; after more than a decade! Soon they start hanging out, telling each other everything, and become best friends; but if you saw them on the street you wouldn't doubt to think they are a couple.Why don't they confess their feelings? You've got to see the film to figure it out; you've got to witness what happens, how it happens and most importantly why. In our original time, Rob Reiner did this picture more than a decade ago, and he directed it simply and honestly. Without knowing he also brought us one of the first climatic endings in a romantic comedy; those when the guy declares his love in the last minutes, in a powerful touching final speech, you know.But what he actually got right was the cast. Yes, he got together two actors that achieved a unique chemistry in a movie that needed it entirely. Billy Crystal, showing that way of speaking that is only his and a mark for any good comedian. Rob Reiner helped him to become the super comedic star he was already becoming. And Meg Ryan will be ever grateful to this opportunity that showed her unusual beauty, natural talent and all the other things that would make her the queen of the romantic comedy.",7,4,5,18 August 2005
The Holiday," There's always next time...
","A long time ago, writer/director Nacy Meyers did a glorious romantic comedy, 'What women want'. It was funny, it was romantic and it had its main actors in completely unexpected roles. With time she was apparently captivated by nice sceneries, and left the city to show her characters in wider places, living longer, almost ending love stories. This led into 'Something's gotta give', a film full of repeated moments in which actors still shone bright. With 'The Holiday', Meyers' finest attributes (the direction of actors and her writing, that is) are still in top form; the problem is that in every other aspect she's trying something more ambitious than her previous efforts. This film presents us four main characters that live two major love stories (that include, we might say, other two) in two different places in the world. It's not what I would have prescribed for someone like Meyers.Although 'The Holiday' is better than her previous piece, some things are almost embarrassing and show us a writer that might be running out of ideas. To do a whole sequence with the old joke of 'driving on the wrong side', the typical American problem when in England; to give Jack Black a role completely different from what he's done and finally asking him to do his classic act (singing and dancing like a fool, but like nobody can); introducing a plot line involving an old writer and comparisons between the modern Hollywood and what it used to beIt's not that the words characters speak seem off, it's the presence of all of this things that make us doubt the director's originality.About the words, well, it isn't too different from what we've seen from Meyers before or what we get in the typical contemporary film of the genre. As in every script, there are things that shouldn't be spoken by the characters, silences that should be respected, musical montages that are unnecessary (this is more related to direction). To her favor, Meyer hasn't followed the typical developments of the love relationships and has been able to introduce a couple of unexpected funny and dramatic situations; and while there's an important lever of corniness that some characters admit to be looking for, expressions are never too far-fetched to be doubted. It's understandable that Meyers does a balance. After all, 'The Holiday' is for every kind of audience possible, and it has to contain an obligatory familiarity. For this Meyers takes the wisest decisions related to acting. The four main characters are kind of familiar, and it looks as if the roles had been written for the actors who play them. Kate Winslet (is it possible to be that good of an actor?) plays the depressing Iris, who's in love with someone who doesn't love her backShe's the one who gives the movie's initial speech, about relationship.Cameron Diaz plays Amanda, an also depressing woman who worries too much about herself and is on the movie trailer making industry. Amanda and Iris are the one who take the holiday of the title and meet Graham and Miles, respectively. Graham is played by a subtle and calm Jude Law who abuses of his oldest winning trick: the smile. Meanwhile, Black delivers a confusing performance that doesn't decide between the serious and the ridicule and that finally rests in his typical act, as I said. 'The Holiday' does no harm, but it still could have been a better ride. With fewer characters and a more centered love story, and some other things that don't come to mind right now. Anyway, maybe next time, right?Hans Zimmer's scoreNo words for that magic.",6,1,3,28 December 2008
War of the Worlds," Spielberg; an A-List director...
","They are going to make money with the movie, and there will no problems for that. Steven Spielberg is a director that knows how to handle any material and take the best out of it. He has worked in films of all types with extremely good results. People said before that he was an A-List director making B-Movies. 'Jaes' 'Jurassic Park', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'; all of them important productions where Spielberg use his techniques at their best, which are not just the cameras' movement, but a screen plagued of incredible effects. It doesn't bother with him, because he even does it in romantic movies; but he does it brilliantly.Today he does it again, with a super production that could be as excellent as it could be bad. While I think it is regular, others could say the opposite, because Spielberg surprised with that super star Tom Cruise is in the cultured 'Minority Report'. Now with a lot of production, in what looks more like fun than like a serious cinematographic commitment, the effects overcome the story in the two adventurers' new project; 'War of the Worlds'.I didn't read H.G Wells' recognized novel, a fact that could have helped my perception of the film, too much typical Hollywood which I though Spielberg was out of. I remember the fantasy movies he did, with all his machinery, in which he got to balance it with a personal story, convincing and close to reality that moved us like 'E.T'. When I see an American family with a separated marriage, a father that expects his sons' love (one older boy and another younger girl) and a sudden extraterrestrial invasion. I was lucky the music here was managed by a pro like John Williams who achieved one of the best scores I've heard so far this year. Adequate and touching, his notes are between the film's few high points.That the trailer reveals almost the film's first hour doesn't change anything; the camera was focusing in anyone else than Tom Cruise and the thunders in the sky didn't generate adrenalin. There's a lot of noise, but the script written by one of the best reduces to phrases as 'humans don't live nor die in vain', which besides being in the book, sound stupid in frames.Adrenalin had the scenes in the basement, because of the tension and a good Tim Robbins. In acting, well, Fanning has a future and Cruise doesn't even cut his hair anymore. The rest remain unnoticed; also Spielberg's fault, who shouldn't have made the movie.",6,0,1,18 July 2005
Love Actually," Actually...
","There are films that one sees and find very nice; but that just at seeing them a second time, discovers the magic they contain, the charm and above all things, the quality in their genre. 'Love Actually' is one of those movies; it is enchanting and very good as a movie, however excellent as a romantic comedy.Although no one admits it, the genre of the romantic comedy is pretty underestimated, or in other case, left aside. I mean that there are no romantic comedies considered actually as movies, they are mostly entertainment and fun for a while; but I, as a fan of the genre, find more difficult developing a script within these terms than writing an action film, or on the other side a shocking drama ('it is easier to make cry than making laugh').Specialists for this are people like Richard Curtis, who has been collecting hits as a writer in the last decades and now has had the chance to direct, and for the first time, what is the most delightful of his tales. I forgot to confess I prefer a drama to a romantic comedy, because of the variations that one can find. Dramatic writers (and this is easy) take things from any part of everyday life, and turn it into a story.Instead, as I said a while ago, the ideas in the comedy field are drying out. The plots don't change much and sometimes we find ourselves watching the same thing, especially in the romantic comedy. As I was saying, Richard Curtis knows his theme, how it will begin and how it will end; the incredible thing about his scripts is what happens between that. How he makes us arrive to that satisfying final moment is what says everything about him. He has already proved it, creating different emotional impacts in movies like 'Nothing Hill' or 'Bridget Jones Diary', which could have been exactly the same.And it is after more than ten years, that he grabs the camera with his hand. Maybe he felt the need, or maybe he realized he had to take possession of the lives of these characters. Because in 'Nothing Hill' and 'Bridget Jones' the central characters were two in a relationship, or three in a love triangle, and everything was more reduced; but in 'Love Actually' they are neither two nor three, but a dozen of persons, which in some cases don't even relate, although they are united by a same bond: love, that is actually all around.From that, we become witnesses of these people's hearts most deepest feelings and through the words and superb leadership of Curtis, and the portrayals of Hugh Grant (he should never change what he does, he's an expert), Colin Firth (keeps on growing in romantic terms), Emma Thompson (always talented), Alan Rickman (incredibly funny), Laura Linney (good in anything), Martine McCutcheon (a revelation), Bill Nighy (from other world), Keira Knightley (still divine and promising) and Liam Neeson (he reminds us what is the passion for work), plus an excellent ensemble; we understand, as a friend of mine said, that we must fight for what we love, without fear and against all odds, and that for loveNothing is impossible.",8,0,3,13 September 2005
Wedding Crashers," The talent...
","It's only a matter of time that the supporting characters begin to shine and get their own movies. Agree or not, Owen Wilson was always the shadow of Ben Stiller. They have something in common; they always seem to be doing the same. But he started getting recognized for his charisma and some people thought he could carry a movie on his own; and 'The Big Bounce' came Vince Vaughn is a similar case; no, I'm lying, a different case. He is one of those actors who have always been talented, but time gave him a wider recognition. He had to be in some determined films so he could be now working as continuously as he does, and end up paired with guys like Owen Wilson, in films like 'Wedding Crashers'.They make an excellent team. They are two types of comedians and the writers of the film (Steve Faber and Bob Fisher) created two types of characters (Wilson plays John, Vaughn plays Jeremy); two working friends that 'crash weddings'. That's the expression and what it implies is shown in the movie; extensively.There's one scene where both of them go to the 'first wedding of the season', and they cry on purpose, invent names to be part of the family; sticking their eyes on two women, so they can later gain them with cheap strategies that include dancing or being nice with children or grannies, to ultimately end up with them in bed.After that first routine, loud music starts playing and the routine repeats itself a lot of times, with quick cuts and lots of different images, as if it was an extended trailer. It could be a waste of time, you could see it as a sign of laziness; but not if you understand that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it is made with dedication.Director David Dobkin makes sure of keeping his characters and his comedic timing real. Therefore this is the most natural comedy I've seen in a long time, because there's not a trace of gross humor or bad taste in it. If there is, it is very subtle, because for once, there seems to be a little more of concern for the characters.Consider John and Claire (Rachel McAdams), two sarcastic persons, not too serious about life; they click. But she is taken, by Zack (Bradley 'I always have the same hair cut, I always look the same' Cooper), man from a wealthy family and loved by her father (a very classy Christopher Walken). However, after a series of events, John wakes up in the middle of the night and walks towards Claire's room and then goes back. Instantly, Claire can't sleep and she does the same thing.Although is hard to believe inside the film, something's happening; and the movie is good because we think it can be possible. The cast spreads laughs all around. McAdams is beautiful as always and charming as ever, Vaughn is completely effortless and what I said about Wilson that, like Stiller (and I don't like it), he always does the same thingBut you know what? I love it! 'Wedding Crashers' is a good contemporary comedy.",7,0,0,10 December 2005
There Will Be Blood," 'I drink your milkshake!' It's a classic...
","The title of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest adventure sounds like one of those taglines or announcements you would normally see in a movie trailer 'There Will Be Blood'. Well, there is an upside for those going to see the film in a movie theatre; the title is definitely a promise that won't be broken. Anderson, a gifted filmmaker and an expert when it comes to uncommon titles, achieves with 'There Will Be Blood' not his best picture, but his most recognized one. It's a shame though, that this praise comes so late in his short career, because there's no difference between 'There Will Be Blood' and his previous pieces. Whatever the length time, the characteristics of an Anderson film remain: unexpected endings, classic, focused cinematography and editing, well drawn characters courtesy of the director's sharp writing, chaotic score (I've got to admit Jonny Greenwood's work here takes it too far), characters that are always mature and relatively old and usually live desperate situations that require desperate measures. A few years ago, Anderson reduced his typical ensembles into a smaller cast for the effective and weird 'Punch-Drunk-Love'. Now, he puts a risky number of three or less main characters but stays true to the rest of the things that define his signature. Is 'There Will Be Blood' weird? You can bet it is, in its own way. It's a movie that can't be compared to any other; it's so different from everything you're used to watch that it naturally stands out.No, it's not better than 'Atonement' or 'Juno'; but that's not the point. The point is that if you found a movie of 'There Will Be Blood's' proportions, you probably wouldn't think about comparing them. It deals with business; the oil business, and with an oil man who says he can't do anything but speak frankly and is actually full of crap. Besides, he uses his little cute son to convince people into selling him lands. This is Daniel Plainview, portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis as a man truly possessed by the devil. The second main character, Eli, a somekind of a priest played wonderfully by the on growing Paul Dano, is represented as Plainview's karma; his obvious opposite, and it's a comparison that Anderson keeps throughout the long, slow paced movie that deals with a big part of the characters' lives. One of the film's best scenes consists of a confession that Eli gets out of Plainview, that's supposed to be serious, but during a few moments, the audience was laughing out loud. This scene is important because it marks the beginning of Plainview's decline, and the ongoing increase of Day Lewis' tour-de-force. Better than Clooney's lack of effort in 'Michael Clayton'; better than Depp's ambivalent eccentricity; better than Mortensen's precise silence; Day Lewis' works covers every side of every era of Daniel Plainview's pathetic life.If that's not enough for you, both Anderson and Day Lewis create a human being that we can feel not the slightest empathy for. We want nothing good for this oil man; we fear him and his eyes make us want to look the other way.",8,1,8,21 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Come in...
","Come in and watch, please come in and seeIt starts with a long still shot of a landscape. The most eccentric characters are present in this ward; a place, though another possible character in Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', a film about what Harding (William Redfield) describes accurately in one of many passionate scenes: interpersonal relationships. It's a beautiful piece, with inspiring dialogs, well constructed sequences, peaceful and nerve- wracking moments, daunting images, brilliant performances. The beloved Czech director doesn't leave any emotion out of the table and risks it all on a film (and here comes one of my fixations as a writer and one that in cases like these is impossible to avoid) as real as you and me. Real as reality, as Ken Kesey's (the writer of the novel the film's based on) experience when he worked at a hospital with mentally ill people. It's clear that, besides the writer's true point of view (I haven't read the novel but sometimes it gets lost in the making of a film) and a highly disturbing ending, Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman's (the latter one wrote the script of 'Scent of a woman') adaptation is a very delicate work.There's a model scene, one that's repeated several times throughout the film. It involves Mildred Radchet (Louise Fletcher and her fantastic cold look), the nurse in charge of the mentioned 'ward', discussing the patients' personal problems in a group. Every one of these group scenes, measured by masterful quick close-ups (that are part of the whole film but work strongly here) ultimately leads up to a mess, which involves shouting and fighting that is not fighting but more like constant complaint. In films like these, I like to stay with my first impression; but if you really want to analyze Forman's complex movie, you should watch it several times and choose a character each time to pay attention to. Without taking it too far, you have Mc Murphy (Jack Nicholson, crazier than ever in a time where he was more natural), the movie's natural main character that, at times, seems just another character of the cast; a secondary player.This happens because the rest of the patients are very interesting and unpredictable. Take the insistent Martini (an unrecognizable Danny de Vito), or the silent gambler Taber (an unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd), or the rebellious Cheswick (Sidney Lassick), or Billy (Brad Dourif), who in one scene shows a major demonstration of courage and instantly becomes a coward again;or Will Sampson's silent Chief Bromden. Talking about it, silence is an important part of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'; something that the characters seem to appreciate, therefore we respect it too. Whenever the music comes in, it's because something's not right, in any perspective. Because music may play in a cheerful moment for this patients, but at the same time it's making someone else's day worse. The same goes for the mood of the film. At times, the patients are so funny that we laugh out loud; but what makes us laugh gets other people's nerves. On the other side, there are moments were we feel like crying because the reality of the film is truly devastating and we realize that maybe we hadn't noticed yet. However, what makes us feel sad, is what others feel it's the right thing to do.There are many characters I didn't describe and I missed characteristics of the ones I did, but I'm no psychiatrist and I don't know so much about personality. But if I could give an opinion (one of those we express when we watch a movie even when we know that's not going to change), I'd say that I don't think nurses are doing a fine job here. You watch and tell me what you think. But come in and watch, please come in and seeIt ends with a long still shot of a landscape. Have you ever really felt complete freedom?",9,0,2,7 March 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Social issues in film...Current affairs and all that
","At the moment, my English teacher is giving us some kind of current affairs lessons, and we've been talking about the situation of Darfur, in Africa, and the thousands of people who are dying while the world sits back and does nothing. I'm talking about genocide, and what Idi Amin did in Uganda in the seventies has no difference.Kevin Macdonald brings these events to the screen, taking them from a screenplay by the daring Peter Morgan and by Jeremy Brock, based on the novel by Giles Foden. These are the times when I regret not having read novels before watching films based on them. My teacher read the original novel and was a bit disappointed by the film but, then, that's something that happens all the time. In another contrasting way, maybe it's better I didn't read the novel before; otherwise I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the film as much as I did.I found the screenplay fascinating, for example: full of clever phrases and of interesting use of the African language. In this Uganda full of hope, as Macdonald first show us, is where Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) has ended up. We first meet him sitting at the table with his parents, celebrating his graduation. His father, also a doctor, congratulates him but doesn't forget to mention his degree was more impressive. We clearly see the tension in the family and Nicholas decides to get away.Now we are in Africa and, as the movie sees things from the doctor's perspective, everything seems amazing. The scenery, backed by the never-failing African traditional music, inspires happiness; mostly when Nicholas is scared by the presence of an army with guns and a woman tells him: 'It's OK. There's a new president. This is a good day for the people'. Young and innocent are the word to describe this doctor, who arrives looking for adventure, willing to help, but ends up tangled in the most unexpected events.Director Macdonald, a documentary filmmaker, takes on his actually first fictional film (his last film 'Touching the Void' was a mix of fiction with documentary), but it wouldn't be wrong to say that he is 'documenting'; because in the end, he's telling a true story. Right now he has completed a new documentary about a Gestapo commander; and the documentary that got him an Academy Award is about the Munich Olympic Games in 1972.This is a man making movies with social conscience; and I don't if it's his team or what, but 'The last king of Scotland' is so gripping that you can't take your eyes off the screen, whether it's showing massive killings or passionate dialogue. In this latter aspect lies the film's best quality; showing the terrifying relationship between Nicholas an Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). I'm talking about two people who look at each other and may be hiding a big amount of things; people who thought they knew each other but started witnessing revelations about the other, basically in their looks.'The last king of Scotland' relies on looks a lot, because the camera is always looking. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is something I enjoyed very much. He leaves no doubt that Africa is a country where violence is an everyday issue, when he clearly lets us see the gun Idi Amin is carrying the first time we see him. And his men, armed all the time and carefully looking. The way Mantle moves the camera up and down in an unpredictable manner; the way he picks up things, little details in every scene and takes the time to show them as he shoots the environment as a whole; the way he observes Forest Whitaker's face are parts of his more than effective work. There were some key moments where the film implemented flashbacks I think weren't needed, and the impact and comprehension could have been better achieved without them.Anyway, what a fierce, masterfully controlled and insuperable look Whitaker has on his face; popping those eyes which come from this superb performance, because, among other things, he takes on the role as if he had ruled the country himself. James McAvoy's Nicholas doesn't stay behind, having a hard time to swallow while he looks at the dictator with the terror I was talking about. The young actor is apparently establishing himself among the rising British talents, now with leading roles in various films. Kerry Washington is also very impressive as Amin's wife, with little moments of great strength.Also apparently, Idi Amin was a charming man; one that you would want to give a chance to, as Nicholas says early in the film. Well, Uganda gave him a chance; and look what happened.",8,1,3,19 June 2007
August Rush," Movie rush...
","I can't get enough of saying that there are formulaic movies that just work. Today I was watching a film with some friends about a girl who does ice skating and plays ice hockey at the same time. She has to choose between both, but the movie is arranged so that she can do both...How great! Of course; extraordinary events take place so this can happen, but as they say: 'The end justifies the mediums'. Kirsten Sheridan's 'August Rush' is, surprisingly, not about sport. There's no team or single player who wants to win a championship; there's just a boy who wants to find his parents and believes music can help him, guide him. 'All you have to do is listen', the little boy played joyfully by Freddie Highmore whispers. He's so charming that a Child Protecting Services worker (Terrence Howard) gives his number to him. Soon, the boy finds himself in New York: 'How did you get here?', a truck driver who leaves him on the street asks him. 'I followed the music'.There's another story being told apart from the boy's, and it's the one of his parents (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and a lovable Keri Rusell). It tells how they met in New York and it's all really nice and perfect at night and they spend together the most beautiful night of their lives, with more music and contemplation than words. This is during the whole film. The contemplation is not part of the filming style and it's not there to serve the story; it's that the script is too short and the filmmakers waste time with musical numbers and visual passages. From time to time, like during some of the magical numbers, 'August Rush' makes us believe that music can connect people in the way the movie wants it to. It would be easier to believe if the boy's parents weren't so related to music (the father is a rock musician and the mother is a cellist) and if the film's circumstances weren't so predictable. But then, if everything was different, we wouldn't be charmed by the movie and it wouldn't be the same. In these types of things, it has to be all or nothing, so it seems fair to say that Sheridan made all the right decisions. For example, there are like two moments where the film could skip a predictable moment (some formulaic pieces do); but it doesn't. 'August Rush' gladly admits its 'clichés', so we also have an evil character played by Robin Williams as a man with good intentions but who ultimately cares about himself and no one else.On the other hand, you find Terrence Howard's comprehensive face, or that one of a priest in a church where the boy spends one night. When he wakes up he learns two things in the piano from a little girl and when the girl comes back from school she tells the priest: 'Remember when you said that Mozart was a prodigy? Well, I have one and he's living under my bed'. That scene brought a smile to my face.Because this is the best these films can do; they can make us escape from reality for a while and hope for a better world. I'm not making any statements or trying to say the world is a bad place, but the world is nothing like 'August Rush' and it will never be...That's for sure. I want to add that I haven't explained most of the plot and I've skipped many important details you'll find in any review and even a simple plot description of the film, but it's on purpose: I honestly think you can enjoy this one. You should give it a try.",7,2,4,2 February 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Will Ferrell is making it
","Every time I watched Saturday Night Live (a program I don't watch at the moment), I always thought all the cast was good. They were all funny, and still are. But there were these two guys who were the funniest (in my personal opinion): Norm McDonald and Will Ferrell. Both of them were destined to movies. The first one chose television, and he's still stuck there. The second one, well, has the lead role in 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'.This movie is funny, very funny. And the main reason is its cast, with Will Ferrell at his best, as always (he also co-wrote the screenplay). He makes his character believable, although he's always overdoing it. He gives Burgundy the charm and ignorance he needs, and the good heart he shows to have. I laughed a lot watching him.The supporting cast finds the place in this piece. I find in Paul Rudd a gifted actor. I loved him in 'The Shape of Things', one of my favorite recent films. There, and here also, he does things naturally. Christina Applegate is the important female character, and probably the only one. She seems to be having a good time, overacting most of the scenes, but making them fun ('Take me to Pleasure City', funny). Steve Carell is fine, but his character seems very familiar to the one he played in 'Bruce Almighty'. And about David Koechner, well, he doesn't have much to do. His Champ could have been a better character.And I have to say the small appearance by Danny Trejo and the cameos of Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black were awesome! About directing and writing, I must say. McKay and Ferrell did the whole thing right. They have worked together in Saturday Night Live and they sure know what they are doing. They know each other, and it seems they had fun writing this stuff. I have no doubt that they'll be doing some other things soon. They love doing this! The rest of the environment is pleasant. There's a constant joy feeling in the set and it's contagious. The film has some scenes that reach stupidity. Maybe what this people were trying to do was that. Make a fool of them, or at least, of the characters they were playing. The scenes I'm talking about are the ones that make you feel like a total fool('Afternoon Delight', who responds to love with that?, very funny).I could describe many more things, but I don't want to spoil the ride for you.So I will just put it like this: 'When in Rome...'",7,1,3,13 February 2005
American Gangster," And he's done it again!
","When someone knows how to do something, they can do no wrong, and Ridley Scott knows his drill very well, by heart actually. He could do the same thing and fail, but he has the miraculous gift of making really good movies like 'American Gangster', which make you pay attention, think and even provide entertainment. The film shows the rise of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in the drug-dealing market during the early 70's. He was black and of low profile and making more money than anyone; imagine how the Italian families and the rest of the mob felt. Denzel plays Lucas as a patient listener who listens every advice carefully and always worries about protecting his back, but also is fearless when it comes to take responsibility. It's a beautiful contrast to watch him giving wise advices one minute and killing someone in the middle of the street the other, and it's even greater to see how his work rises to another level when he works with true authors like Ridley Scott, not his brother Tony. He had fun in Tony's 'Man on Fire' but he had a blast and delivered better in Spike Lee's 'Inside Man'. Going back to Ridley. It takes a mastermind to do all the tricks in almost three hours. He gives the camera no specific role: Harris Savices' camera sometimes stands watching from a hiding place, other times it's a permanent part of the action; the rest of the time it dedicates to create compositions like a plane passing through the middle of two street signsThat's as close as I come to explaining something that is only wonderful when you see it.Like seeing Russel Crowe perform; knowing he's played a role so similar in 'L.A. Confidential' and that he's the only one able to compose something so different. Knowing that whether with Ron Howard in 'A beautiful mind' or with Ridley here, Brian Grazer can always get something spectacular out of the Australian.And together with Scott he also gets a lot out of the entire ensemble (without counting a truly underused Cuba Gooding Jr): Carla Gugino in a formidably unexpected role, a scary portrayal by Josh Brolin, a joyful turn by Armand Assante, a living proof that if you forget about Chiwetel Ejiofor's performances is because he always seems one more human being, and a scene of incomparable emotion in the hands of a flawless Ruby DeeFeel that one. High point? Steven Zaillian's script. Low point? Marc Streitenfeld's score, not the soundtrack. The secret of risk? Having Denzel and Crowe in the same movie not putting them on screen together until the very end and not delivering something breathtaking in that moment. That's a great director. The secret of excellent film-making? I'll tell you in some kind of comparison but I won't give names because it's pointless.In an everyday picture of this type, the bad guy would be a monster and the good guy a heroic martyr. You would only remember their names and know nothing or not care about their families and friend; if the movie provides the characters. There would be a small valid reason for the good guy to start killing; you wouldn't question it and there would be a shooting scene every five minutes, with cars flying through the air and all that. In 'American Gangster', besides the three dimensions of the characters' family and friends, there's only one shooting scene; and when it comes not only a character wants it but we do also. Because we know the character and we know how important it is for him. Read carefully: we weren't asking for a shooting scene; we would have been fine without it but we accept it because a character needs it. Oh, and we enjoy it of course. That's Ridley Scott.",8,0,3,12 January 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," 'Beautiful Tragedy'
","'What would you do if you knew you were going to die soon?', says Harold. 'Do I have a superpower?', asks Dave. 'Yes, you're great with maths and you're invisible'. Of course, the first one is just an ability, but Harold is really good with number and the second is not a superpower, or at least not for Harold, who is so lonely and unnoticed that he considers himself invisible.That scene of Marc Forster's 'Stranger than fiction' is really beautiful, but it doesn't contain a touching moment; it's beautiful once you're inside the movie's world and you start appreciating its vocabulary. Essentially, Zach Helm's script is about Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an ordinary guy who one day realizes a writer (a fantastic Emma Thompson, narrating brilliantly) might be creating a novel about his own life, and everything she says occurs to him; or everything he does she explainsNow you tell me if that's not a poetic connection.What's funny is that Harold is indeed like a character you would find in a book: he counts the times he brushes his teeth, the steps to the bus stop and the numeric details of every place he sets foot in; he has a very special watch with a life of its own and he's not so good with women. He meets one, however (a baker played superbly by Maggie Gyllenhaal), and they develop a relationship so honest that culminates in a phrase that never sounded more beautiful in film: 'I brought you flours'You'll understand.It's a great screenplay, Zach Helm's work here; and I'll tell you why: it's not faking it. It's not a script that tries to make something real of its characters; it's just pure literature and it respects that quality. But this doesn't occur only in regular conversations, it also takes place during talks about literature. There's a clear literary knowledge in the way Professor Hilbert (a perfect Dustin Hoffman) says things and refers to life; and I'm not even mentioning the obvious references to writers and genres.Now that I mention genres, I would have loved to classify 'Stranger than fiction' as a 'beautiful tragedy', but sadly I couldn't; there's a moment where the story kind of betrays itself. It's still a great story though, and Forster's direction generates the perfect climate; and Roberto Schaefer's photography is as beautiful as in 'Finding Neverland', with special light connections with the story I think I noticed; and Britt Daniel and Brian Reitzell's score is a perfect partner for the film's atmosphere.And Ferrell is the best leading man. Even if he tried really hard, he couldn't keep us from laughing, but his Harold is so well constructed that we learn to love him with his clumsiness. 'We want him', like when he walks decisively towards Maggie Gyllenhaal and tells her: 'I want you'.",8,0,0,7 October 2007
The Green Mile," Movies as a journey...
","I sure loved 'The Shawshank Redemption', as a moving story of personal relationships, with an amazing script.I sure loved 'The Majestic', giving the opportunity once again to the great Jim Carrey to show his talents.And I sure loved 'The Green Mile'.I must declare. It's something weird what happens when we are watching a movie and we are waiting for something to happen and it doesn't. Alright, some movies might be slow, and may not say anything, but that's something you can't expect. 'The Green Mile' is told in a wonderful way, and it introduces it characters to us magically. So magically so that we can understand them and join them in their journey.Maybe because that's the only thing we have to watch in this movie. A journey alongside these characters, not expecting anything, just watching what happens to them. Just watch the great performance by Hanks, the amazing revelation by Duncan (where had that guy been before that?), and all the support from the characters. You just have to watch them all (I love Rockwell and Jeter). When you go on a journey, you don't expect. You just buy the ticket and see what happens.I say, you must be sure at the time you're buying the ticket...",9,0,1,16 April 2005
Hancock," A new race
","It's not so difficult to realize, on a first glance, the intentions 'Hancock' has as a motion picture. It has Will Smith in the lead role and as a producer; it's an action picture with a lot of adrenaline and visual effects; it's, and this is never a little fact, a superhero movie. This said, it's also easy, with one look, to notice that the film presents a turn on the typical superhero plot development. We've got to be fair: the script by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan is original and character driven, but 'Hancock' is not the first recent film that tries to bring something different to the superhero table; animation plays with the concept of superheroes all the time, and this will continue to happen. However, when it comes to live action and in an era of mature 'Spider/Iron/Super/Bat Man', 'Hulk' tales (which never lack sense of humor), John Hancock represents a new race. Precisely because he didn't came from a comic book and because his story doesn't necessarily emulates the steps of the other stories, this is also a race of superhero film we won't see very often.Always comic but never a parody, 'Hancock' presents us a man with powers, who fights crime and saves lives but has recently lost his popularity. We look at him and we sense something profound in his eyes. He's not a millionaire, or a doctor, or a lawyer He's just a man, an immortal human being with a lot of strength who drinks all the time and isn't able to do his job right. But is this his job? We don't know anything about Hancock, but Smith never plays him with a pose: too smart, too cocky, too serious, or too drunk for that matter. There's a short sequence, with beautiful music by John Powell, in which we see Hancock by himself. He's not comfortable with who he is, and it's never the film intention to mock him, even when everyone keeps calling him an 'asshole'.Therefore, on a second glance, it's once again easy to perceive that story and characters mean more to Peter Berg than the bad guys Hancock has to fight (or what I call 'events'). There are a few action sequences, but they are not necessarily impressive. It seems to me it's always more about what Hancock will do, for him, in each case, than the shock the audience will receive, visually and in terms of sound. At the same time, there's a more detailed construction in the conversational scenes. Missing elements and unsaid things in the dialog combined with strong looks on one hand; unexplained warnings on the other. Of course, this is not entirely serious or dramatic, but it's obvious and transparent. Always comic, the movie has silly musical montages and there are comic touches in a lot of situations but the actors are –when it comes to drama- well directed, focused (specially Jason Bateman); and if I don't tell you anything else is because there's a story worth watching and the way things unfold is natural and not at all definitive. Also, even though it's a short ride, when it's over it's not like there was a big case closed, a mystery solved or a lot of people saved in an event. There's just life, with its (sad) comings and goings, and we want to know more about the people whose lives we've witnessed for a while.Everything in the film is, nevertheless, completely entertaining, given the fact that Will Smith is a winning actor who understands what the audience wants, in any genre he's doing; and because Charlize Theron is beautiful and we can't take our eyes off of her. I saw in 'Hancock' other things, specific elements I chose not to mention that made this for me a different, enriching experience. The elements are there. You can think of them as part of an uninteresting whole or you can give them more credit. Anyway, is as The Dire says: when there's a good story",8,3,5,11 January 2011
Ray," Standing out...
","A good biopic (I'm sure no one responsible for 'Ray' wants to say that word) needs to have one and only that important thing to be done: it must honor the person it is making a picture about. Recently, we have seen many biopics; but these three are on a higher level: 'Capote' and 'Walk the line', which I have written about; and 'Ray'.If we think awards, these three films allow the people who made them happen to stand out: 'Capote' made director Bennet Miller stand out and gain an Oscar for the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman; 'Walk the line' should have given James Mangold a nomination, but gave one to Joaquin Phoenix and gain an award for a perfect Reese Whiterspoon; 'Ray' got a nod for Taylor Hackford andWell, you know.But Ray Charles didn't think awards, and he didn't t think pennies either; he thought dollars. The Oscar for Jamie Foxx was not a gift; he earned it, and what he has done after it is not as remarkable as the career he constructed before. We should give him some time, because his portrayal of the genius is magical that you can clearly see a great actor in himOf course, the fact that he looked like the musician helped him, but the rest was Foxx's work.Charles had, as every other worldwide famous musician, love problems and a big drug situation. 'Don't let nobody turn you into a cripple', his mother told him after his brother died. He went blind at the age of seven, soon after he had played a piano for the first time. He was sent to a school for blind people, and the movie misses the part of when and where he developed his abilities as a pianist; but you don't wonder that about a genius.Later on he made his own way and got to Seattle to audition alongside Gossie McKee (the always reliable Terrence Howard), who played him; but it was going to be the only time. With a total modesty every time he saw a music he liked, he met Lowell Fulson and went on tour with him. Soon he made a record and started getting some girls: 'He touches their wrists to tell if they're pretty', explained Fathead Newman (a notable Bokeem Woodbine).Until he met Della Bea (a refreshing Kerry Washington) and he makes the viewer think she'll love her and take care of her. However, it's the ups and downs lives of the geniuses; and they can get involved with girls of their choirs called Margie (a fantastic Regina King) and be locked up in jail for drug use or they can put an end to segregation and get a better record deal than Sinatra.'Boss', everyone started to call him after some time. He was in control, but he was actually loosing control up to the point where he didn't even know who his real friends were and let people like Joe Adams ('Commander in Chief's' Harry Lennix) manage his career. Taylor Hacford illustrates all of this moments passionately with his camera, and James L. White puts them (also passionately) in written.The cast of 'Ray' is more superb than you could think; especially a black man called Clifton Powell, in a performance that should have gotten a lot of more people talking. The rest of the castI don't know why they didn't get the SAG Award (oh, that flawless little cast of 'Sideways'); everyone stands out.",8,1,1,22 August 2006
Lord of War," 'I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there'
","For some reason, these days I keep coming back to the same films. Whether it is because of repetition of actors or because they share similar locations, I continue to talk about these types of movies. And I'll tell you what the reason is; it is that they deal with the same issue: War; and I put it in capital letters because it is definitely a big one.Let me recapitulate: 'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of a massacre because of a big Civil War; 'Blood Diamond' goes through the 'conflict diamond' smuggling among the War in Sierra Leone; 'Lord of War' pretty much explains itself: it's the life of a Warlord. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a man who does the only thing he is good at: dealing with guns. If he cares about it of if this makes him a good or a bad man lies in the plot for you to discover.Though this 'job' has given him enough money to get the woman of his dreams (Bridget Moynahan) and support treatment for his drug-addict brother (Jared Leto), who used to help him but couldn't take it. I forgot about another film, 'The Constant Gardener'. When it comes to dealing with real-life issues, that film was better than 'Children of Men', but not better than 'Blood Diamond'. However, 'Lord of War' is above all of them; because it treats the issue right, almost perfectly: and that's its blessing.Courtesy of dynamic writer Andrew Niccol, the screenplay of the movie has the main character telling us his story in the first person, which is a different and appealing narrative structure. This way, we don't miss anything and the script becomes automatically the driving force of the film; explaining everything in careful detail and providing a documentary feeling in the way it gives information; however never loosing the movie style.This style is also supervised by Niccol, who wears the director's hat once again, but this time in a way that accompanies the fast pace of his writing. Achieving a better balance than in his last directing effort ('Simone'), Niccol's work is figuratively a gunshot, beginning with a wonderfully constructed first scene which follows a bullet that ends; of course, in a gunshot. But the screenplay is so intelligent and well based that it concludes in a film that escapes some conventionalisms 'Blood Diamond' sadly had to take.Everything feels true because it actually is, and that makes it less predictable and more of a pleasure to watch and follow. We get the experience of Nicolas Cage to make it all more worth it. Cage, and actor who apparently doesn't take supporting roles anymore is as well cast in this as he is in 'National Treasure' or 'The Rock' and in a romantic journey like 'City of Angels'. Here, he was also a producer of the film.The cast also includes Eamonn Walker, putting in another great performance, you'll realize; Ethan Hawke is flawless as the good cop who can never get to Cage's character; Jared Leto is more than good as the loyal brother; and it is so nice to see Moynahan again: she is such a convincing actress. And 'Lord of War' is the most convincing of films like the ones I've talked about yet.'Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names, like Freedom Fighters; I guess they can't own up to what they usually are'. That's' one of the great phrases in Niccol's script. I suppose that what he means is they are just killers; and that it's a big word, WarStill.",8,1,2,10 April 2007
Music and Lyrics," 'Ok...Pop Face!'
","I had been waiting to watch this movie. It's like the perfect romantic couple on screen; the king and the queen: Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. He is Alex, a 'has been' pop idol who now plays in high school reunions. She is Sophie, a woman who washes his plants and because of those things life has ends up writing a song with himThat's the plot line summarized. What can or will happen and if you can predict it or not depends on the posture you take when watching the film. I, a big fan of romantic comedies, just like to sit back and enjoy the ride, as I always say. If you are on the same group, you might just have a really good time on the whole; 'Music & Lyrics' has all the formulaic elements and doesn't break any rule. On the other hand, if you generally don't like these rides, luckily Marc Lawrence, the film's writer and director, has other things you may find interesting. For example, the culture references of the 80's and the contrast with the contemporary times, or the clear mockery towards the 'pop' groups of previous decades. If you like music, you'll appreciate the musical knowledge, completely displayed in a scene where Hugh Grant records all the instruments of a song by himself; or the mentions to the musical poets: Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder. And if you like acting, it's impossible to reject these two giants of the genre creating magic together.Okay, maybe Hugh Grant will never achieve again what he did with Julia Roberts and maybe there won't be another 'Wedding Singer', but you can't deny the chemistry between the stars here. Grant is great as always, doing his role by heart with his usual charm and some newly incorporated facial expressions.But the one who surprises this time is Barrymore. She is beautiful as always, that stays the same, but there's something different in her performance. Her Sophie is a character that stands in a different line from her work in '50 First Dates' and 'Fever Pitch'. She adds complexity to her silences and to her emotions, and it makes me long to see 'Lucky You'.Of course that if you love music, good or bad, you'll feel and extra sentiment that goes beyond romance and comedy. But if you love comedy, I can assure you'll laugh a lot; and you'll fall in love if you are fond of romance. All this said, I'll leave you with two things: it's not an impossible movie to miss if you don't have special reasons for watching it; and there's a teenage pop star, superbly played by Haley Bennett, who does things in a live stage that the music business wouldn't accept today. I mean, I haven't seen Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff reach those levelsAt least not yet.",7,1,2,19 December 2007
The Queen," Another level of everything
","We know, when we're watching a movie about true events, that we are witnessing the lives of people who existed and did things. In politics, we see recognized persons doing good or bad for their community. I have come to like biographical films (in the end, telling someone's life is a biography), without caring which period of the person's existence it is showing.Stephen Frears' 'The Queen' is another level of biography, however, because it is about something that happened only ten years ago. It is about the Queen Elizabeth of England, and about her discussion with Prime Minister Tony Blair to decide if Princess Diana should have had a private funeral or a public one for everyone to see.Of course, each one of the parties had his beliefs about the matter. It was acknowledged that Elizabeth wasn't fond of Diana, but she was a massively popular phenomenon. I mean, my mother loved her and she doesn't even live in England. 'It's her family decision to do a private funeral and since she was no longer a member of the Royal Family I can't intervene', the Queen says to Tony Blair, a young and intelligent man who wanted to change the classic monarchic rules. 'Wouldn't you say that given her popularity Diana should have a funeral in which many people can take part?', Blair replies the Queen.With respect he treated her; I imagine he still does. Because don't forget that 'The Queen' shows personalities that are still alive and doing their jobs today; which is fairly risky. Peter Morgan wrote a screenplay commencing from the facts and took it deep inside the Windsor and the Buckingham Palace, right to the Queen's bedroom and even to the Prime Minister's family house. Morgan deals with grief in every possible way.Prince Charles' grief for loosing the mother of his children; the Royal Family's grief, between acceptance and resignation for the troubles Diana caused them; the people's grief for all that Diana did for them and the children; and the Queen's silent grief. She went off by herself to the countryside and stayed quiet, thinking. Her majesty alone, dealing with her pain. Here, Frears understands that he needs to analyze his main character in every possible way; so he does and Affonso Beato's cinematography gets the mood perfectly. The cinematographers of the Best Picture Nominees were definitely overlooked this year: 'Babel' looks beautiful; 'Little Miss Sunshine' looks so lucid; 'The Departed' choices are the right ones...Luckily, the nominations are not simple works; I'm going for 'The Prestige'.'The Queen' is also about loneliness in the most difficult times and about two very different individuals (Elizabeth and Tony Blair) who, probably, admired each other in silence. These two characters and the actors who play them sustain the picture; even when James Cromwell portrays an accurate Phillip and Alex Jennings makes Prince Charles as laughable as in real life. We could also say that the actors are helped big time by the press and the images of the news that covered Diana's death all over the world (put together by Lucia Zucchetti's masterful edition).Tony Blair is played by Michael Sheen with a lot of personal strength and determination that leave him at the character turn of his career. I hope to see good things from him in the near future. What I can say about Helen Mirren is that the Oscar she's going to win, besides her acting skills, is because of the courage it takes to play a character of this magnitude; an emblematic figure that can easily watch what the actress has done. Her work is dignifying; beyond admiration.There's a lot more to be said about 'The Queen'Let's just leave it at: 'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown'.",8,1,2,21 February 2007
Casino Royale," 'The name is Bond...James Bond'
","James Bond movies are not just about BondIt's Bond and the action, Bond and the fights, Bond and the cars, Bond and the Martinis, Bond and the villains Bond and the girls. 'Casino Royale' has all this elements and uses them brilliantly and for that simple reason it is the best Bond movie I've seen in my life; considering I haven't watched all of them.Maybe it was the fact that I truly detested Pierce Brosnan's arrogance, or that the action was too heavy, or that things didn't make much sense; but I just couldn't enjoy the last emissions of the saga. 'Casino Royale', with its long duration and different settings, becomes thoroughly enjoyable. A big part of this result occurs because the action scenes are mostly short and exciting, until the last sequence, which is a satisfying climax that you can tolerate and appreciate.I believe that 'Die Another Day', for example, was too over the top in every element, but it's not difficult to notice the perfect balance here. Take the plot, with its simple development of a mission we don't have to analyze much, and wittily scripted love relationship, accurately managed by the leading stars. And I must say that it is a film with well-drawn patterns; the villain is a bad man with his beautiful woman and a huge boat sailing in the oceanTalk about good cliché usage.And the technical work is masterful. The camera looks like taken from an old movie, with elegant and easy shots, so the film looks old and consequently everything does; the edition, the chilling score and the general mood that generates a contradiction, because the devices used by agents are as modern as ever but the environment is not.However, the true magic lies in the agent himself: Bond. Director Martin Campbell understood his task and made 'Casino Royale' so we could see that this was the beginning of his work as a double 0 agentHow does he do this? Details, for example: in persecuting a fast running man at the beginning of the film, Bond doesn't have the ability to jump from the highest roof without getting injured; so he uses what he has around him because he is intelligent, but when he does jump he gets hurt. On another side, he makes such stupid mistakes due to his ego. But it is a human ego; and Daniel Craig's performance captures it in a breeze of fresh air that leave Pierce Brosnan's portrayals looking like something coming out of a perfect robot. The same goes for Eva Green, who manages her chemistry with Craig in order to look not just like the beautiful woman she is, but also as a human being capable of showing true love that refuses to be another disposable Bond element.There's one scene where they both have a conversation in a train, analyzing each otherDid I enjoy that scene! I didn't enjoy some performances because they didn't convince me, but I smiled during the action sequences and during so many moments that I just stopped thinking about it. There's a new level of action films, prequels or eternal sequels or something like thatNolan's 'Batman Begins', Stallone's 'Rocky Balboa', Lee's 'Inside Man', I heard the new 'Die Hard' was goodWatch them all!",8,2,7,5 September 2007
Trainspotting," Choose...what?
","Choose life. What does that exactly mean? Well, to me it means a lot of things but if you want to explore what 'choose life' doesn't mean to some people, you should experience Danny Boyle's cult classic 'Trainspotting'. In a way, all these characters seem to have chosen a way of life, but apparently see it as something closer to death. Not with those exact words Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) explains the commitment of being an addict, but somehow he manages to expose his philosophy to the viewer while introducing us to his friends; some who support the philosophy, some who don't and some who don't even care. But I don't think that's 'Trainspotting's' main point: showing how drugs can affect people. For instance, there's one character, Begbie (Robert Carlyle), who doesn't consume at all but has (maybe) a bigger problem: an obsession with violence. He enjoys kicking people around and making them bleed. That's another point, another issue that affects Renton and the rest of his friends; the silly Spud (Ewen Bremmer), the unpredictable Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the lost Tommy (Kevin McKidd). The real star of the film is John Hodge's screenplay, based on Irvine Welsh's novel. It contains a heavy dose of character development that can be spotted clearly among the heroin injections and delusions of his creatures. It reminded me a lot of Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' (with the exception of character development) because, like that film that also focused on drugs, 'Trainspotting' has no defined plot line: it's like a roller-coaster ride that finishes and starts again without you being able to get off your seat. There are two times where you clearly sense the movie's coming to an end, but suddenly Hodge and Boyle bring something new to the table. Like in 'Fear', 'Trainspotting' has a heavy load of narration (by Renton) that helps and confuses the viewer at the same time. It helps to understand the inner feelings of someone so consumed by an addiction like Renton. There are two beautiful scenes that leave no doubt of Boyle's inventive visual style: one follows Renton to a hospital after hi faints with a dose of heroin, another shows him in his own room recovering from his problem (this meaning not having a 'hit'-an injection-for weeks). Both scenes are visually stunning in a way that I would like to detail but don't want you to miss; so I'll just say they almost border surrealism.Some time before these scenes, something occurs that provokes a major change in the film. At that point, if you have gotten used to the fact that the plot is not defined and lies beyond confusion (Renton's narration is confusing because it has some contradictions and sometimes doesn't let the viewer to think by itself), you might appreciate the final moments of the movie, like when Renton goes to London and Boyle creates a ten-second take of the city's most iconic places and it looks like a tourism commercial that doesn't fit with the tone the movie is employing at the timeBut it works; because it's funny and original. Unlike Ewan McGregor's performance, for example. His Renton is the kind of role that gets a Scottish actor out of Scotland and catapults him to Hollywood. It involves being 'too Scottish', fairly good-looking and very charismatic. I'm not saying it's a bad performance, I'm just saying it's not difficult to achieve, and it helped McGregor's career greatly. The rest of the guys basically have to do the same, which is something I adore in a way. I adore how British writers/directors/actors or whatever deal with friendship. It's a more disinterested way; you feel like no matter what happens, they'll always be there at the end of the day. It's just a true feeling, and I'm not telling you to expect it in this film, but if that were the case; it shouldn't matter whether you choose life or any other thing.",8,3,4,18 March 2008
Munich," The Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg is an icon. I know nobody who doesn't respect him as a filmmaker, innovator or producer. In any conversation about movies, you've got to mention Spielberg, in fact, the other day me and some friends were talking about him. It's difficult to explain what 'Jaws' was at its time, and how a director could make box office hits like 'Jurassic Park' that were actually good pieces of cinema.The man never did the same thing. He always changed genres and took different roads and decisions. From the extraterrestrial world and his beautiful 'E.T', going trough dramatic love ('Always') and children adventures ('Hook'), to profound movies that really have something to say. Here we found the double-faced Spielberg we've seen since forever; the man who did 'Minority Report' in 2002 and had fun with Tom Hanks in 'Catch me if you can'.Both were good movies, don't get me wrong, but one was more audacious than the other. Last year proves the same. I was talking to my friends and I said to them: 'You have to choose one Spielberg movie to watch this year; only one. If you're stupid, you'll choose 'War of the worlds'; if you want to see good stuff, you'll choose 'Munich''. Not one of them answered, but it didn't matter; because this year it happened: 'Munich' was a good film and 'War of the worlds' wasn't.It comes after long periods of years, that Spielberg makes a movie like 'Munich'; a movie with a statement that means something to him. For this reason, it is a picture he directs with a lot of commitment, playing close attention and checking every detail. Ultimately, the film is beautifully shot, the images are breathtaking, the score is accurate (to expect from master John Williams) and the screenplay (Tony Kushner and Eric Roth) is disturbing; thought provoking.At the beginning of the film we witness the events occurred in the 1972 Olympics, in Munich. I was watching the images and thought: 'This is actually what happened?'. My dad gently confirmed my answerThe intelligent Spielberg made a subtle and right decision, leaving the paranoia off the critical scene, which was already real enough for any viewer to tolerate (you'll understand when you watch).When a director cares about his movie, he shows things as they are, so we can reflect about them; and that's what I mean with audacious. Courage was to shoot that first scene; courage was to shoot a couple of strong sex scenes and some extremely violent, merciless killings. This is an admirable Spielberg because he has nothing to hide.About the controversy of the film, I'm not taking sides; but if Spielberg is defending the Jews for their actions, he has all the right: he is a Jew. If he doesn't defend them; well he doesn't. Don't try to take sides when you watch it; it's something that happened years ago. Just listen, better watch, the statement 'Munich's' director is declaring through his images. The story is so important, that the actors become smaller than it. Sadly, the movie is so perfect, that it becomes tiring, and not very good in the end. But I assure you: you will want to get to the end.",7,0,0,7 March 2006
Casino," The Scorsese spell...
","During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's 'Casino' is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in 'Casino', I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film. When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own. As Nicky himself puts it: 'The dollarÂ…Always the dollar'. But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: 'It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved'. We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.If you approach 'Casino' as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in 'Goodfellas'.Ultimately, you may choose to take 'Casino' as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with 'Goodfellas' and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe. Here, as in 'Goodfelas' (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie. It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development. The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours.",9,1,1,10 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," George Lucas' world and its beginning
","I can't say anything about George Lucas coming directly from my opinion. I have never (maybe) seen any of his work; It's not interesting for me. I don't hate science fiction and futuristic films (because that's why he's known), it's just that those are not my types of movies. Anyway, I know some people that say he's great. He made 'Star Wars' thinking he would make a trilogy, this was number 4, then he did 5 and 6; he probably thought it was over, but some years later he showed us the beginning of something we had already known the ending with 'Episode I' and 'Episode II'. What happens before this film, departures from a movie that has not been released yet: that's 'Episode III'.There's a time (now) where the special effects are 'show ups'. I like to think there was a time when they were used to serve the story; for sake of entertainment. Now, plots are merely complex, but effects are totally outstanding. 'Hero' was lauded by critics, but it was just the visuals for me; beautiful visuals, of course. Then the plotThat's why I'm thinking of passing by 'House of Flying Daggers': same actors, same directorNo, thanks.Well, special effects weren't remarkable in 'Star Wars', but they were definitely the best they had at that time. I didn't care about them, anyway, because Lucas has fun creating his own world of adventure, fantasy and whatever you want so say; but it was fun! What can you expect of some big letters flying in space that say: 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'? The thing is Lucas' whole team worked their asses to develop this fantasy full of pleasure, and gave us the costumes, the sceneries, the charactersUnique stuff!I wasn't alive at the time the movie was the phenomenon it was, and still is; but it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride that everyone should take the chance to experience. Getting out of TV, and very young, Mark Hamill looks natural as Luke. He seems very promising in his role; the role that assured his career's 'take-off'. Alec Guiness passed away some years ago, with the Oscar in his merits, and the recognition for his performances; including his classy and for always remembered Obi-Wan Kenobi. In this film specifically, Carrie Fisher wasn't much used and not as pretty as her character should be. However, intelligent enough to provide the qualities that launch a career. One paragraph should be dedicated to Mr. Harrison Ford. I heard he wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for George Lucas. The whole story I won't say, but I'm glad Lucas discovered some of the genius in Ford. Lucas gave Ford the character of Han Solo that would bring Indiana Jones after the trilogy. After Indiana Jones, Ford's career would be irregular, with some little peaks. But here, hereFord is magical. Incredibly natural and very good'Star Wars' is one of those movies that make you be supportive with the characters. We want their good, we want to join them in their journey and watch them survive; even when we already know what's going to happen. Excellent performances by Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and Kenny Baker as R2-D2: considering they hadn't got much to do but they were important They were funny and an excellently teamed up for their rolesThe ending announces a sequel; filled up with happy images, simple shots and that wonderful music by the amazing John Williams; who hasn't been more than five years without being nominated for the Academy Awards (he won it for this one). All of this, of course, all of this wouldn't exist without George Lucas' mind (he'll be remembered for this!). How he did it is a long story hidden behind one of the most fascinating cinematographic experiences of all time.",8,2,3,13 May 2005
Honey," The star of the show
","Jessica Alba is the star of the show; in this movie and in Hollywood since I don't know when. Her situation is something to detail about. Personally, I look at her and I think she has acted her whole life. Everyone talks about her everyday as if she had decades in the business, but she doesn't. I could say I believe she's done over ten films, when this movie was probably her fifth important role. She did a TV show I never saw for two years, but even before that, her name was on the poster of the movies she appeared in. She is a star by nature, a leading star; and 'Honey' is the evidence that proves my statement. When the film starts, Honey Daniels (Alba) is working at the bar in a disco serving the usual free drinks to her best friend Gina (Joy Briant): 'One, please', the friend says, and two guys standing right by her get closer: 'Make that three'. Honey, with a big smile in her face, tells the guys: 'Today is your lucky day', and then Gina interrupts: 'Don't get to excited though; she'll not be here much longerShe's gonna make it'. So the guys ask how she's gonna make it.Right away we find out Honey dances; and that she dances awesomely well. If Alba did her own dance moves I don't know for sure, but it always looks like her; in the dance floor, in the videos, in the dance lessons. OK, the film: Honey has a great talent for dancing and she could be a classic ballerina but she prefers to teach hip-hop in a place her mother owns. She goes to auditions, she works hard, and she ultimately gets recognized.But Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson's story is not about 'making it'; it is about the good-hearted people who fight for what they want, don't sell and don't quit. I don't even know if this is a veridical portrait of the hip hop world, but the video shoots seem real and I guess the artists/directors relationships should be how the movie shows them. What I wanted to say is that in the music world, mostly with hip hop (which I consider the easiest market today), when people make it, it goes over their heads, and they leave everything behind.Although not Honey Daniels; she'll not fall into temptation, and she'll be there for the ones she cares for. It may sound too formulaic, but it's beautiful. Debutant director at the time Bille Woodruff, with previous experience from musical videos, shows us the nice face of his characters' world. Everything is shiny, everyone's happy, everyone's smiling. Yeah, sure some bad things happen, but everything will be ultimately worked out.Great casting work with the youngsters, especially with Zachary Williams as a little boy, Raymond, who needs someone to watch over him; and Lil' Romeo in a tremendous and talented performance as the teenager Benny, who debates himself about being a gangster or a normal child. This plus Missy Elliott's cameo and Mekhi Phifer in the most charming performance of his career, and the some of the best lines as: 'You peoples? Playa, playa, how'd you swing that? I've been trying' to be her peoples for weeks; ain't had no luck'. Not enough? Alba looks gorgeously beautiful in every outfit she wears and her acting skills are way above the film's requirementsShe's stunning now and it is only the beginning.",7,13,20,22 October 2005
Click," I would have liked that remote to turn the screen off...
","'Click' is Adam Sandler's latest attempt at making us laugh. Last year I saw 'Spanglish' and said that Sandler's true acting talent emerges when someone else but him has written a screenplay, and when someone other than his usual directors has taken a project. Frank Coraci directed Sandler in 'The Wedding Singer': good; he directed Sandler in 'The Waterboy': regular; he has just directed 'Click': awful. Maybe it's not Coraci's fault, but 'Spanglish' had inspired me to watch Sandler in a different wayThat illusion has vanished.'Click' plays with different genres and it aims at different targets, but it ultimately gets confusing and it ends up playing the audienceBadly. I saw this film with a friend of mine who had already seen it: 'It made me cry', he told me; and I got excited because of the 'Spanglish' situation. I couldn't cry because it isn't a drama; and I couldn't even laugh because it is not a good comedy (although pay attention at a commentary of Colin Farrell: the best).The story is very similar to things everyone has seen before: it's about a guy who is able to go forth and back in time as he pleases, and his present life changes because of it. This time, the element is a remote control given to Sandler by a very classy Christopher Walken; and I don't know I f the movie could have been bearable without Walken.So Sandler's character has his wife and beautiful kids but doesn't pay much attention to them because of his job and because he wants to become partner of the company he works in. Soon, he meets Morty (Walken) who gives him this remote control; and Sandler starts playing with it, not without Morty telling him that it could be dangerousAnd it is.At first, things go bad for Sandler and we worry about his situation. But you know those films where the screenplay plays so much with the viewer that you just can't believe any more of it? It could have been like that during 'The Butterfly Effect', but Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber handled it well. Here Steve Koren and Mark O' Keefe take it too far; they wrote 'Bruce Almighty': what happened to them? The reason why I said Sandler so many times above and didn't say his character's name is because he is playing himself: he's playing Adam Sandler. Where did the nice guy of '50 first Dates' get lost? What ever occurred to the quarterback of 'The Longest Yard' or the charming cook of 'Spanglish', which I dared to say had been his best portrayal? I don't have the answer.His female lead, Kate Beckinsale, looks so beautiful but appears completely underused as his wife. On the children's side, Joseph Castanon (whom I met in 'Ghost Whisperer') is always likable to watch; and the adults are a Sean Astin who is prepared for better things than this; and two solid comedic supporting roles in the flesh of David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge.And how can I forget about Christopher Walken; who without doing much saves the rainiest of days: 'Man on Fire', 'The Rundown', 'Gigli' and most notably 'Joe Dirt'",5,6,12,18 August 2006
A Walk to Remember," A picture to remember...
","The first time I saw 'A Walk to Remember' I was blown away, but this second viewing helped me analyze each element of the film separately. I'm not talking about a deep analysis, but about an analysis this movie deserves, because it appears as a romantic teen drama, but it is truly a great film; and it deserves a great film's analysis.The story of 'A walk to remember' is about a popular high school boy (Landon) who hangs out with a popular group and a self-exiled high school girl (Jamie) who hangs out with the telescope and stars, the bible (her father is a reverend played by Peter Coyote) and religion and the retarded students she tutors for fun. They are portrayed by Shane West and Mandy Moore, and the plot line says they are 'thrown together' so make a guess. Sounds familiar? Well, it's not: it's different; just about every other thing in the movie.When Landon screws up and gets to be in the high school play, he ends up asking Jamie help with the lines. 'Alright', she says. 'But with one condition: promise me you won't fall in love with me'. 'That won't be a problem', Landon replies. What happens after Jamie's warning is nothing else than a story of true love courtesy of Nicholas Sparks; author of the book the movie is based on and author of another true love story: 'The Notebook'.It was the job of Karen Janzsen to turn that love into a screenplay, and she did her work very well, considering the little number of screenplays she had written before. It is Janzsen's screenplay (with the main help of Sparks' novel) what makes this movie so different; because the reactions of the characters in the crucial moments, which should be predictable, are not. The simple words we are expecting them to say are changed by other words as simple that become surprising.This fact is supported by the labor of the castA labor of wondrousness. Shane West, a now grown up actor I admire very much and who has divided his career between the series 'Once and Again', the bad guy in 'Get Over It' and a better act than Sean Connery in 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'; achieves here what's still the best performance of his life. His sarcastic commentaries, his anger and his happiness are flawless.Mandy Moore's performance is just remarkable, and mostly inspiring considering her situation (her first and in my opinion her best lead role of her career). She transmits sweetness and tenderness in her voice that when she sings it doesn't even seem out of place. Al Thompson's and Clayne Crawford's parts as Landon's best friend are very solid and more credible than most of their 'characters' in other films.But what I hadn't appreciated was Peter Coyote's portrayal. His character seemed so typical and obvious the first time I saw the film that I didn't pay attention to him. This time, I carefully watched his manners. His lines are so carefully spoken, so well appreciated; and his looksHis looks are so honest that you care about his worries.Adam Shankman, a choreographer and probably not the best option for directing the film; astounds with his measured view of the strong events the story tells and leaves behind the regular 'The Wedding Planner'. In one scene, during the high school play, his camera slowly observes each of the main characters in the audience to contrast what's happening onstageDaryl Hannah is there, and even David Lee Smith's short appearance becomes noticeable.Their expressions say a lot for a romantic teen drama; but much less for a great film.",9,2,4,17 August 2006
Sin City," On your knees for Rodriguez
","Robert Rodriguez has a reputation of blowing things up, making a lot of noise, creating a lot of fire, a lot of chase scenes (in any ways) and a lot of shootings. It's a well-earned fame because that's one of the things the man does; but come on! He's big now and things could change but he directs, produces, writes, scores and edits his films. It's admirable from any angle you view it. None of his films is a wonder for me, but at least now I know I've got to see 'El Mariachi'.I grabbed a seat and watched 'Spy Kids' some years ago: pure joy. After generating a new type of childish adventure piece, where the real heroes are the kids (and sometimes the whole family); he made the sequel: not as good but still promising. What was next? Why not three dimensional cinema? Is it to crazy of him; to take chances? His third deliver of the spies wasn't the most watch able experience, but it was an improvement; and it had Sylvester Stallone.The ones who didn't like the 3-D stuff wouldn't be interested in what was coming; fire, fights and guitars in 'Once upon a time in Mexico'; a great ride if you ask me, but not if you ask those other guys, who would answer 'that's not film-making'. Anyway, the amazing Johnny Depp was there, and he's not the kind of actor who participates for the money (even though he's got to earn it); there's always something more for him and he saw that. I also got the chance to see Enrique Iglesias acting, fact I thank Rodriguez for; but that's a fan thing.All of the things above are a warning; because if you want to call the man a genius now, you're too late. Now you're going to say that blood everywhere works, like when you praised Tarantino's style in 'Kill Bill'? Because 'Sin City', while not a masterpiece, is the work of a master; a genius. Don't blame a director for overfilling the screen with effects when he's giving you one of the most incredible pieces of entertainment of the year! Because in the end what is cinema all about?The things Rodriguez did to finalize this movie his way, you wouldn't believe. What he had to sacrifice so Frank Miller could direct his life and work alongside him. And that's what they did; marvelously. Their directing work shows innovation and passion in every possible way; starting with the total lack of background: risky. Or the black and white shooting, which can be tedious (like in Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood') but not if you manage it correctly. The precise touches of colors, yellow and orange in details as signs or a box of pills, or a blinding red in intense parts; because red is so much I don't need to explain.Blood is red, sometimes, or white in other occasions. Cars are blue, and blue is the constant mood factor of all these characters in the final line of their lives. Consider Marv, who's willing to give his life for a woman that, he finds out, is nothing more than a prostitute. Consider Hartigan and his crucial words: 'An old man dies; a young girl lives: a fair trade'. This is the language in Miller's world, I suppose. I didn't read the graphic novels, but I assume it could be like that: short, cold; accurate. At least that's what you get from Dwight's voice, while he talks in present tense, as the rest.What about girls? Men's motives, of course; as it should be. What keeps them going. About the cast I'll talk, but I won't say a name. I'll say tat Rodriguez called some people who had worked with him before (no, not Banderas), and included some new participants. It's a flawless ensemble, and even if some actors appear only for a few minutes, they deliver within their limits. I couldn't believe my eyes the first time I saw the trailer.What the future has prepared for these two has positive results written all over, but if they get lost in the way, as we do in their movie, they can always go to Kadie's, the only place where the divided parts become one, and the colorless obtains color.",8,0,1,8 November 2005
Coach Carter," Great men, the Carters...
","There's a lot to say about 'Coach Carter' leaving aside the simple fact that it is a very good film. Its director, Thomas Carter, is surely a very determined man and a dedicate worker. His camera moves like it knows the territory by heart; it moves with a lot of freedom and confidence. Sometimes, it seems to be in someone's hand, because it moves a lot; because there's a lot to see in this movie.The same happened in 'Save the last dance' a very well crafted piece directed by Carter, that dealt, among other things, with racial problems, as does 'Coach Carter' in some ways. But Carter is no writer, he's a director that could seem like a writer because he really wants to direct. Anyway, here the writers are a mix of experts about what the movie needed to deal with.Mark Schawn created 'One Tree Hill', a TV show where the main characters play basketball, as the characters of this film do. He also wrote 'The Perfect Score', a picture I haven't seen but I imagine covers a lot of young students personal issues, as 'Coach Carter'. The other writer was responsible for two sports movies; one about love ('Summer Catch') and another one about dreams and inspiration ('Hardball'). It is a perfect team.And a perfect result, too; because their screenplay is flawless, at least in the issues it presents. 'We're going to treat ourselves with respect', Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) says during his first training at Richmond School. He must be a good coach, because his son (solid Robert Ri'chard) moved from an esteemed high school, to one that graduates the 50% of its students just to train with his dad.Ken Carter is a good coach, but in his own ways. The year before he arrived, the school's team the Oilers won only four games; now they're undefeated. The man is accomplishing his job, but not the totality of it. The other part relies in a contract every student signed before being in the team. It includes attending all of the classes in front row, maintaining a 2.3 average and wearing tie on the game's day. Technically, by not following the rules, the students are failing.But for Coach Carter they are all failing, because they are team, and this among other things is what he intends to teach them, indirectly. 'What is your deepest fear?', he asks Timo Cruz (impressive Rick Gonzalez), when he has to complete an impossible task to be back on the teamWhat does that mean? 'What does your father do?', he asks Jason Lyle (debutant Channing Tatum). 'My father's in prison', the boy answers. 'Ask yourself if you wanna end like him', Carter finishes.His methods will generate controversy, he will be questioned by everyone, but what really matters isn't what the parents think, or what the school principals think; what really matters is what the kids think is best for them, and what they want for their future.The whole young cast is adequate. Nana Gbewonyo, Antwon Tanner. They're all talented, especially Rob Brown (that boy from Finding Forrester) as Kenyon Stone, an intelligent young man with a pregnant girlfriend (young pregnancy is dealt with, as in the director's previous film) played naturally by Ashanti. I would like to see a lot more of Brown, because he's got a lot to give.However, the generator of the environment and the head of the project is Mister Samuel L. Jackson, with a bald head and an ambiguous look. Used to play 'the man' (ironically that's the name of his last film), as he did in 'S.W.A.T', 'Shaft' or going back in 'One Eight Seven', puts the soberness away and creates a humanly defined character, in what's his best performance in three years; since his dedicate father in 'Changing Lanes'.I will make no commentaries about the cheesy music I despise so much and forgot to mention in 'The Longest Yard'; but I'll say it works, no matter how hard we try to reject itFinally, the fact that 'Coach Carter' is based on a true story, leaves me even more amazed than how I already am of this film-making achievement.",8,0,0,15 December 2005
Happy Feet," Honorable...
","The last time Matias and I randomly voted for who we thought would win the Academy Awards, he chose 'Cars' in the Best Animated Feature category; I chose 'Happy Feet'. The funny thing is that I hadn't even seen it but, coming from Pixar, 'Cars' was a disappointment. Now I've seen 'Happy Feet' and it's not great, but it is so much better than 'Cars'.I've got to say, though; there's something about penguins. Either they're really cute or they're beautifully simple, but for some reason the public has developed an affection for penguins. 'Happy Feet' shows penguins living in their own icy world, speaking their own language ('penguin') and, as not seen in other animated films, actually unaware of the existence of human beings and speaking of them, as 'aliens'.It's probably these and other things that seem truly new (the movie looks gorgeous and the sea and the sky look 'live action') what differences 'Happy Feet' from the other animated movies. I mean, when have you seen a penguin dancing like Mumble? Mumble is the film's main character who, unlike all of his friends, can't sing. Singing is the only way he could find his true love, but Mumble dances; and this may not give him love, but it will take him far.Yes, like in a classic animated film, our hero meets some friends along the way; he wins them over with his contagious dancing ways. I remember the hero in 'Cars', who was pursuing a selfish dream and then realized that life was full of loveMumble knows it from the beginning and his crusade is utterly giving and noble; ironically turning everyone against him.The screenplay is a bag of fun, written by people who know about friendship (John Collee, 'Master and Commander') and by George Miller and his co-directors. Director Miller has produced and written movies like 'Babe', so it would be fair to say he knows the field. But this script is non-stop one-liners and non-stop jokes; and most of the time they work.The music is another main element that plays more importantly than in your usual animated movie. 'Happy Feet' could also be a musical with fresh and original songs and very intelligent versions of old and new classics from every type of genre (we get Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Salsa, Mambo), courtesy of the masterful John Powell (the fantastic 'The Road to El Dorado' and 'Antz', among others), always backed by some nicely choreographed tap-dancing.However, the highest point of 'Happy Feet' is its message. I won't say what the message is, but even when it is simple and not completely explored, it has the best intentions and, more importantly, shows that we can say something even in animated films.

Slumdog Millionaire," 'It's our destiny' , 'Kiss me'
","'Slumdog Millionaire' may not be the film you'd expect from someone like Danny Boyle and, although it has some elements that could refuse this statement, it's certainly the riskiest work he's completed, and maybe his best. About this last thing I'm not entirely sure, but if this is the movie that gets him an Academy Award, it's precisely because of not doing the same thing he'd been doing until now.That's right, against all odd, Boyle's little film about a story bigger than life is a classic tale that you'll find yourself defining with many important words: love, poverty, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, familyDestiny. And the trick my friends is that, among all these beautiful but unlucky people, in this enormous city where the British director took his camera, everything seems perfect; but the viewer who knows Boyle's pessimism can never know for how long it will last. Is it really possible for a guy from the slums to become a millionaire? Can he also get the girl of his dreams? 'The most beautiful woman in the whole world', that's how Jamal (Dev Patel) speaks about Latika (Freida Pinto), the girl he met when he was living on the streets of Mumbai with his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal); the girl he gave shelter to when he saw her crying under the rain. In the most unusual of circumstances, Jamal will tell a police inspector everything about this girl who he never forgot, his brother and their suffered experience through life. 'I don't know where she is now', will be the last thing the inspector will hear from him.The movie reveals a lifetime to the viewer's eyes. There's never a clear indication of the moment being showed in this lifetime, but the edition (Chris Dickens) and cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle, finally recognized) present the structure of the plot and we never get lost. The score by A.R. Rahman, although mostly made of songs and not too showy, sets the mood for every new exotic and captivating location the picture presents by the minute.Three different actors (most of them children and unprofessional) play the main roles in their different ages, but Patel and Pinto stand out because the movie demands it so. The love Jamal has for Latika is what keeps him and 'Slumdog Millionaire' alive, as he imagines her everywhere and remembers her face constantly.If the movie has a problem it's this one. The constant remembering and repetition of images is an unnecessary reminder of things and a factor of distraction for the viewer in some of the film's most moving scenes. Because, yes, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is moving on its own terms; because in the end it chooses the light and it has its heart in the right place.Maybe you could think there's manipulation involved, but you're wrong; the manipulation occurs inside the story and its structure (and we can't even blame it so much for that because it looks like it really needed it), but there's nothing being forced towards the viewer. Patel's performance makes the love Jamal feels for Latika so sincere and believable that we don't doubt for a second when he tells her he loves her, that it's their destiny to be together, that he will always find her.And yes, 'Slumdog Millionaire' may not be a true Oscar deserver or a great film, but it is, for the viewer, definitely a well done fairy tale that makes you root for its heroes no matter what; for the critic, a little film that silently and with time wins it heart (of course that works for the viewers too), kind of like 'Juno'; and for institutions like the Academy the picture that, in this time and age, apparently has the virtues to take home the biggest prize they deliver.'Kiss me', says Latika to Jamal.",8,0,5,22 February 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Good.Period.
","I've mentioned in many occasions that sometimes it's good to let yourself go with a film, let yourself carry away by a story even when you know exactly what's going to happen. Well, if you know movies, you'll realize that you know the whole development of 'The pursuit of happiness' when the film begins. Of course, it's such a touching film that I don't even have to recommend that you let yourself go, because it will come automatically.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is a fighter who wants the best for his family and tries hard to get it but apparently is not enough. His wife (an overacted Thandie Newton), incapable of dealing with the poverty they're immersed in, leaves him. Chris doesn't make much (in fact he's due with the rent and there are scenes where he just has five dollars in his wallet and he has to run from a taxi driver because he can't pay), wants to keep his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) who goes to a caretaker that has the word 'happyness' misspelled on a wall. 'It's with an I', he tells the janitor. Chris deserves a shot like the one he eventually gets. A movie like this one needs to establish familiarities, because it's about family, and probably Gabriele Muccino, whose wonderful 'Ricordati di me' deals with family, was a wise choice for the job. He shoots the city, accompanying Chris in his endeavors and takes the time to show us iconic characters that will appear from time to time throughout the film; like a bump who thinks a product Chris sells is a time machine, or a couple of hippies who steal this product from him. Muccino also makes sure that we believe the father-son relationship that defines the film, filming the kid with tenderness, as we see a shot of him walking alongside his father, but we see the kid's face and body and only the father's waist and feet. But it would have been the same if Muccino hadn't paid attention to this 'family' issue, because the chemistry between Will Smith and his son is instantaneous, natural and the main reason to watch the movie. Smith, a charismatic, versatile and popular actor, gives here what I can simply define as a winning performance; because he wins as an actor by fulfilling a new challenge, his character wins in the story, and he wins the audience, that is amazed by scenes in which Smith and his son, and no one else, generate magic. Going back to what started this review, I ask: does it matter that 'The pursuit of happiness' is inspired by a true story? Yes, because it instantly changes the perspective of the viewer, who will deliberate how 'true' the events presented are. I believe that if I'm going to let myself go, a movie has to be fair with me; this means it has to keep things between the limits of reality, and if things happen that are too unreal, there only has to be few of them. 'The Pursuit of Happiness' is unfair to the viewer, because it plays with him by repeating situations that at some point he has to stop believing; or at least that's how I felt. Is it possible that man doesn't find a pen in his own house after his wife has taken everything and has to go to a store around the block to write a number down? Yes, it's possible, but I couldn't find it believable after all the similar extreme situations that the film's main character had been constantly going through before that exact moment. I don't think this is a bad or a regular movie; I think it's a good movie. Period. Could it have been great? I really don't care, because the fact that it's based on a true life story and Smith's performance make it more moving, and because Steve Conrad finds a great help in the narrated parts of his script, that make the repetitive parts of the movie seem less repetitive. Also, I don't doubt the real Chris Gardner went through all these things; maybe it was just too much to include in a two-hour movie.",7,0,1,4 July 2008
Goodfellas," Scorsese on Scorsese; Scorsese's best...Or the best I've seen up to now
","Martin Scorsese has had a delicate career. I'm not saying he has had bad times as a director; I'm talking about his recognition as the pro he is. And I'm talking about the times he was overlooked, even with this movie, which is without doubt the best work he has done (or at least the best I've seen). I don't want to say what everyone says but we've seen Marty lost his Oscars with actors turned directors in those that for most people where his best movies. But many people waste a lot of time talking about those things; and I'm writing about 'Goodfellas'. Yes, that Scorsese movie that is so his as most of his projects are. That movie, one of the few directed by Scorsese that he also wrote, in collaboration with Nicholas Pileggi; who would write with him again for 'Casino', a movie I haven't seen but I watched some parts and there's a clear parallel. In 'Casino', it's a guy talking about how the casino works; the movement. The guy works in the casino. In 'Goodfellas', it's a guy narrating his life as a gangster. He's a gangster, and if you don't realize at the beginning, it'll happen soon when he starts by: 'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster'. 'Goodfellas' is based on a true story, about characters that really existed and could have had talks with the movie's main actors. There's an unusual magic in cinema when it comes to narration; and this is one of the first movies that dealt with that. Frank Darabont was having doubts as he was writing his first feature, based on a book, as 'Goodfellas' is. He was writing and discovered he was using a lot of narration, he was afraid it wouldn't work. Only just then he sat and watched 'Goodfellas' again, and probably again and again'The heck', he must have said. 'This is pure narration'. Of course that movie is 'The Shawshank Redemption', today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts. When you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. I've recently seen 'Paid in full', where Ace, the main character, is telling a story. He takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. This atmosphere came before with 'Goodfellas', where Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. He introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. So we know that no matter what, Henry won't be dead at the ending. He'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. In 'Paid in full', Ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. He narrates the story; he's our hero. 'Goodfellas' is another type of enchantment: where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. Is Henry the hero because he tells the story? No; neither Jimmy or Tommy. This is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. As in 'Paid in full', we get to know everyone: women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. This is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. The important wife role was in Lorraine Bracco's hands. Karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. This is all correctly managed in Bracco's astonishing performance. We get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like 'The Godfather'. The man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. He's Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...In the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...It's all too big to be described.Ray Liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. Joe Pesci, with one Oscar he'll always thank to Scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. De Niro was already a pro at that time, butIt is something amazing to see him in any performance. He graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. I didn't use to admire him as an actor; but I'm starting to realize, and Scorsese has a lot to do with that.With that and with everything, Marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. Again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. Sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need toIt can be living the moment, or planning that violence Scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings. Scorsese, like Jimmy, Henry, Tommy or any other says; is a 'good fella'. 'He's with us, he's OK, you can hang out with him; he's a good fellaYou know?'. And his 'Goodfellas' is another underrated cinematographic brilliance; as one of those all-time movie classics.",10,0,0,2 June 2005
Dodgeball," Ben Stiller movies...
","There are some things we've (I) got to admit and others I've got to accept. I've got to admit that Ben Stiller keeps reinventing himself, always succeeding; but someone needs to tell him he's still giving us the same thing. He might change the tone of voice and the hair, but he still invites Hank Azaria to do the same stupid accents (no disrespect with Azaria), if you know what I mean.I've got to accept that Rawson Marshall Thurber's first full-length feature has its great moments. I've got to accept that although Christine Taylor keeps working with her husband, she is a talented and charming actress, not mentioning a strangely beautiful woman. And last I've got to accept that Ben Stiller is not the only reason to watch a Ben Stiller movie.In 'Duplex' other reason to watch his movie was one of the loves of my life, Drew Barrymore; in 'Along Came Polly' it was the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman: in 'Dodgeball' it's Vince Vaughn. Arguably the most natural comedic actor of his generation (and also a good dramatic performer if you want to watch), he leaves Stiller painted in the wall. And this is not a comparison; I just wanted to make clear that Vaughn never seems to be making any effort.Effortless is as much as this film accomplishes too, due to the fact that it has the most predictable script I've witnessed in a long time (well 'Honey'). In addition, the writer/director relies on his cast presence to make us laugh, without realizing his lines are funny but not the way he places them in his picture. We know we could laugh, but it just doesn't come out.What surely gave Thurber the confidence in his project was his main factor: the sport. Yes, 'dodgeball' or that kind of game we were watching Rip Torn training the characters. The man knew that with this, he would keep the audience until the end, no matter what; this is something everyone was going to stay tuned for. It was widely original, and that's the reward.Maybe it is just about bringing the audience in, like Robert Rodriguez did, when he gave two short appearances to a second-billed Salma Hayek. My point is that Hollywood these days is extremely dependable, and there's a scene in the credits that talks about it; stay so you can watch it.So what I mean is that the stars move a lot inside a movie, and I just wanna know what Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn's projects are. The second one will make a romantic comedy with Jennifer Anniston, and the first one will do 'Madagascar 2' or something?? Anyway, you have to choose because they're both big stars and I'm not sure they'll be pairing up for you; again. I'd go see Vaughn; I bet he'll surprise me The underdog story, always seems to be true, but somehow this is 'the true' underdog story. I'm just joking because it is the same resolution with an always interesting road. So I met the characters, the situations, the tournament transmitted by a once Brady (it's sad) and the final and most fundamental decision taken byChuck Norris (yes, Norris) leading to two different opinions: 'Thank you, Chuck Norris''F***ing Chuck Norris!'",6,0,0,27 November 2005
Up in the Air," 'What do you want?'
","What do we want? Sometimes our life isn't enough to answer that question. We live day by day and we don't have the time. Ryan Bingham is asked, two times by the same person in Jason Reitman's 'Up in the air': 'What do you want?'. He can't come with the answer. He travels through the world firing people for a living and doesn't have trouble sleeping; we hear his voice-in off saying the air is his home, the airports a reminder that everything's fine; we listen to his conferences that are all about leaving any luggage (literal and metaphorical) behind, and yet he seems unable to decide what he wants. He lives by a philosophy. And it appears that it's something he chose and defends, we can tell in conversations with the two women that get in the middle of his systemic, comfortable life. Well, not everything we choose is necessarily what we want.Ryan Bingham is played by George Clooney as the kind of man you wouldn't want to mess with. It's not the most appropriate thing for his line of work, but Clooney has that ability to make us believe he's the best at what he does and that's what we think of Bingham: unstoppable, flawless, cold hearted man with a perfect smileAnd classy too (you know, we're talking about George Clooney here). He did almost the same thing in 'Michael Clayton', except for the smile. In fact, Bingham is so confident that he falls in love and is sure that everything will work out fine.I think 'Up in the air' is a very good movie because Reitman makes sure that we never leave that place. He presents a character and provides him with a 'turning point' that any Hollywood movie would end up in plain happiness –in fact, his own 'Juno' did just that- and decides to put everything on hold. Every time Bingham is on the ground, whether it is for a family wedding or a job meeting, we can sense that the air is calling him. It's something the movie makes us feel with elements: a melancholic music filled with acoustic guitars, some looks from Bingham, some smiles that don't seem completely right. The trick is that this doesn't have to be something sad. It's just what it is.We listen to the sound of backpacks closing, magnetic cards beeping, cell phones ringing. That's how it is in the air. A woman, Kate (Vera Farmiga) arrives and sounds like the perfect mate for that safe, suspended life. She seems to share Ryan's philosophy. Then another woman, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), younger, impulsive and willing to learn, sounds like cheap psychology –she has a major in psychology- and promotes, with and without intention (because she's young and impulsive) a version of a 'real' life, the life of married couples and kids; the life that seems planned out; the life Mark Loring was so scared of and the life that more than one character in this film don't feel prepared forYet the life every man and woman that Ryan fires treasure.The contradiction is obvious, and it's Ryan's 'turning point'. But the characters in Reitman's films are never obvious. They are smart, quirky, sometimes weird people capable of resolving contradictions. The script by the director and Sheldon Turner, based on a Walter Kim novel, is insightful and powerfully dramatic without any melodrama. The employees getting fired suffer and speak the truth, we listen to every one of their words and we empathize.But we empathize with Ryan too, because we can see him wondering. The conversations he shares with Karen on one hand, the (mostly) discussions he has with Natalie on the other, and one particular three-way talk about life and love, are the moments the movie needs us to pay attention the most. The moments without music, the moments in which Ryan hardly says something that doesn't belong to his philosophy, but at the same time the moments in which he thinks or, at least, he's left with something to think about. We can see it in his eyes, even though the conviction of the performances by Kendrick and Farmiga help to generate this effect (performances that, if anything, confirm Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner should have had more chances in the Awards period with 'Juno').Does Ryan need a second chance? Does he deserve it? Of course 'Up in the air' offers more questions than answers, and I don't think that the journey of its main character has anything to do with redemption. With the risk of analyzing something that might not even be suggested by the movie, I think that Ryan Bingham's journey ends once he finds out what he wants. There are a couple of scenes that show people truly delighted and joyful when thinking about the things they want. One involves the perfect J.K. Simmons; and the other one a map of the world with a lot of photographs. I've always believed the world would be different if everyone did what they wanted because I've always known that it's not what happens most of the time. I don't know if it would be a better world, but differentDifferent is good.",8,2,4,15 February 2010
From Here to Eternity," Those classics...
","Movies are one of the things I love the most in my life, and I really want to know about the things I love. So I believe that in order to appreciate films, you should watch everything; to become a cultured person in the matter. Not just watch the contemporary films, or in Descartes mode, watch only the films made after I was born.Everything includes classics like 'From here to eternity'. Made in black and white: with pure passion. While I watched I tried to think about the way movies were made at those times. The power the big female stars like Deborah Kerr had, the money actors like Burt Lancaster made per movie, the low budget of the projects, the little shooting time.What were the results? In the case of 'From here to eternity'; an Oscar winning film where everything fits perfectly. Because it was not easy to make it work, or at I least that's what I think. I think that at the time there was an honest cinema, with lots of true spoken words. Nowadays we have P.T. Anderson and his encounters between people, but in the 50's it took a man named Daniel Taradash to make moving a two people chat.When Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) arrives in Schofield, he has a little 'catch-up' talk with a soldier. In three minutes, with non-exaggerated words, we understand the essence of Clift's character. The army is his life; and he's destined to end his days there. He'll have his problems, he'll have to fight, he'll have to gain his place, but that's how things go with the hero. Then he'll meet his woman Alma (Donna Reed) and fight for love, too.But it's not just about him and his love story. There's another man, Prewitt's superior; Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster), who has another superior, Captain Dana Holmes. However, Holmes goes out with friends and the honorable Warden does all the work. From time to time, Holmes' wife Karen (Deborah Kerr) visits the base, and the Sergeant approaches. Later both of them experience two of the most romantic scenes I've ever witnessed.And here comes an issue probably discussed many times. In a movie where the character that highlights the most is Prewitt, Montgomery Clift is second-billed, and Lancaster is first. Yet Lancaster goes into the water and the sand with Deborah Kerr, third-billed. Who is the leading man? Lancaster or Clift? And if they're both leading men, why is Clift's woman supporting actress and not Lancaster's? Well, supposing the latter four are the 'leading team', each of their performances is incredible and impossible to detail about. On the other hand, supporting performances or a supporting performance is from another world. Frank Sinatra's Angelo Maggio is priceless. We don't get many given friends in today's cinema. In a story like this one, Prewitt needed someone beside him, and that little guy was there from the start until the end. They'll meet again.The work of Fred Zinnemann ('cine' is cinema in Spanish, and 'zine'..Zine man: The man of the cinema) is wondrous too. Now the final product of a film depends of lots of people, and influences come from different parts of a production; but I think back then the director was like a king. It was his word in his world or something like that. Zinnemann's camera always makes close ups in the characters' faces.Maybe he believed it was very important to show feelings and maybe the face is the part of the body that expresses them best. I would do the same.",8,0,0,29 October 2005
Atonement," 'Our story will resume...'
","I always recall Roger Ebert's comment on Anna Paquin's character in 'The Piano'. He says she plays a little girl who is intentionally mischievous; who sees things and uses them to hurt others. Well, there's a little girl in 'Atonement', called Briony (the intense 14-year-old Saoirse Ronan), who's exactly the opposite: she reads something, she witnesses something and makes a mistake that will chase her for the rest of her life. It's England in the 30's; formality and distance between one person and another are the basis of Ian McEwan's famous novel; what Briony witnesses are two young people bursting in love and passion as you didn't see every day during those times, but how could she understand? And she drives Robbie (James McAvoy) and her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) away. He ends up in a war, she whispers 'come back to me', he writes 'the story can resume, our story can resume'; we wait. However, this is not the 'Cold Mountain' storyline in which the blue knight has to face impossible obstacles to get to his princess, no. These are two lives that have fallen apart and before they did they sat together in a family table full of unspoken secrets, sexual tension and disappearances, all in one single day. And the little girl experienced too much in such a short period of time: too much to take for a joyful soul, writer of plays full of fantasies. 'Atonement' is also the little girl's story, we come to realize; and in a way, the story of every individual present that night when everything collapsed. Joe Wright teams up with Keira Knightley again after 'Pride & Prejudice' and I can't help comparing both pieces. I was expecting at least something better, but 'Atonement' makes Wright's screen debut seem like a piece of broken glass in the floor you don't want to step on. The appropriate, correct direction it's gone; characters don't seem like puppets with final destinations anymore. There's a creative turn this time around, with the British director worried about the camera work (Seamus McGarvey brilliantly inspiring cinematography); a work of immense proportions that shows affection for the characters it's shooting. When you watch 'Pride & Prejudice' you say: 'how beautiful this looks', and it stops there; when watching 'Atonement' you say: 'how beautiful it looks and how powerful it is'. I think Wright has done something more powerful than what he imagines. Keira Knightley may not live up to her work as Elizabeth Bennett, but she is perfect and looks beautiful in a completely different character with more strength. And James McAvoy takes another huge step; you may want to watch 'The last King of Scotland' and then thisWhat a leading man! I'll say no more. Maybe it's the novel: how different it is from Jane Austen's beloved tale and how well Christopher Hampton adapted it, covering the time changes and the different stages of life it goes through. Dario Marianelli's score, unnoticeable in 'Prejudice', is definitely present here; loud, clear and meaningful although a little repetitive if you pay attention. Now that I mention repetition, if you think the film abuses of flashbacks, you are right; but it has a purpose. You see, every flashback is from 'that day' and 'that night' and, in different moments, each of the main characters relive the events in their own way.Take the little girl as an example. I mentioned above that she makes a mistake that haunts her lifeBut she thought she was doing the right thing! Then she grows up, and when we see her as an old lady, portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave in a heartbreaking final speech, we wonder: How long does it take for someone to realize the wrong they have done? And everything that question means.",9,3,4,11 February 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," 2nd Round for the guys...
","I had great expectations with this film; the return of the Adam McKay/Will Ferrell duo after the very good, funny and successful 'Anchorman'. Like Ron Burgundy, Ricky Bobby is a NASCAR driver, a unique character, one of those that only someone like Ferrell can bring alive. It's almost like it doesn't matter what the character does in the film, as long as he entertains an audience that expects a lot.As I said, I expected a lot. I expected to be entertained, to laugh and to discover what new range of characters McKay could bring to the table. Alongside the unstoppable Ricky Bobby is his best friend and teammate Cal Naughton Jr. (the underrated John C. Reilly), his gold-digger wife Carley (the beautiful Leslie Bibb), a scene-stealing performance by Gary Cole as Ricky's father, and Sascha Baron Cohen as a French driver called Jean Girard that instantly becomes Ricky Bobby's rival.Everything you've just read, from the names to the story and whatever else you may think OK, is borderline ridiculous, as it was in 'Anchorman'. I'm glad both Ferrell and McKay (who wrote the script together) were able to honor this kind of humorous tradition, where laughter is the only disease and also the only possible medicine.There's no point in judging a film like 'Talladega Nights' for its performances, however intelligent and accurate they are; or for how well shot the race sequences are, as the cars try to get the number one spot; or for how conventional may the storyline be. This film is a statement that reassures what we could perfectly sense in McKay's previous effort: making cinema is fun.Should I say end of the story? Maybe, and I don't want to sound simplistic but it's obvious that something's being done here and that if you want to feel it, you'll find the movie is alright. So when you watch 'Talladega Nights' (if you decide to watch it), take into account the whole concept and not every part. Even when there are some scenes and a few jokes that work more than others (which also happened in 'Anchorman'), but this is the typical piece where the whole triumphs over the separation.For me, it worked; even though 'Anchorman' worked better. This is the kind of parody, like 'Zoolander' and 'Dodgeball' that, whether good or bad, stays with you.",7,0,0,27 July 2008
