Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Too much Bond / Bourne
","While the interactions between Holmes and Watson were classic Holmes; the rest of the movie played more like James Bond or Jason Bourne. Very disappointed. The inclusion of Mycroft was a nice plus, however, having him naked seemed very much out of place. Nice to see Watson's wedding as it sets a foundation for a continuing story line. Moriarty and Holmes fighting at the falls was stolen directly from the Doyle, but in this case it felt forced and out of context. Not nearly as solid as the original, I'm hopeful that any future movies in this series return to the 'true' Sherlock Holmes roots.Overall, very disappointed.",2,2,4,23 December 2012
