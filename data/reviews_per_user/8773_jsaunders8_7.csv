Casablanca," Casablanca (1942)
","What an experience it was to watch Casablanca for the first time. It is truly an amazing film. The director Michael Curtiz did a superb job when he chose the casting for this movie. Humphrey Bogart plays the perfect leading role as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman plays heartbreaker, Ilsa Lund.While watching the film, you get a feeling that Rick Blaine is a cynical man, who holds little value and respect towards women. Maybe it's because his heart was broken after his lover betrays him in Paris, leaving him to wonder what went wrong with their relationship.After leaving Paris, Rick opens up a casino/nightclub in Morocco during World War II. This night club is a refuge for those trying to escape German (Nazi) leadership. Blaine is a well liked man and many refugees from other European countries travel to Morocco seeking Rick's help to obtain exit visas.Rick is soon reunited with Ilsa and the unspoken truth is revealed as to why she left him stranded in Paris. Does the man get the girl? You'll have to watch the movie to know for sure.",Null,1,2,16 October 2014

The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
","What a great film. During High School I read the book, but this film caught my interest so much more.The Great Depression took a toll on so many parts of the nation. Many businesses and factories saw a drop in production, weather conditions weren't the best and many farmers in the mid-western states suffered with droughts. As you watch the film you understand how greedy banks were and what they put farmers through. To me, the banks showed no sympathy or compassion towards individuals during the depression. So many families were forced to give up their land and uproot loved ones, so they could travel west in hopes of a better future.This was a very dramatic film. The casting was good. I didn't know that this was another film directed by John Ford.",Null,1,2,18 October 2014
Annie Hall," Annie Hall (1977)
","I am not a fan of Woody Allen, so I was disappointed when I heard we were watching a film that he directed and starred in. I am however a huge Diane Keaton fan. I think she is a brilliant actress, however I didn't care for her role in this film.This movie is about a troubled relationship.However in the long run, the couple try so many times to but in the end the couple decide to part and go their separate ways. There were some funny parts to the movie, for example- when he had to kill the spider in her apartment. The film was all over the place and bored me. I had a hard time following it.",Null,0,2,4 December 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin in the Rain (1952)
","I love musicals, so I was so excited to watch this film in class.Singin in the Rain is a classic musical which is featured in color, starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. This film was also directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.The movie is about silent film star Don Lockwood, who happens to drop in on an innocent bystander, Kathy Seldon while attending a premier of one of his movies one night. It was instant flames for Don, however you can tell that Kathy isn't as interested in him. In the end the guy got his girl, as in most typical love stories.I think the co-star Donald O'Connor was much more interesting to watch, than Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. His comedic style was priceless. I loved watching his creativity in this film.",Null,0,1,30 October 2014
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction (1994)
","Pulp Fiction (1994) was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. This film is both comedic and also has violent scenes as well. I love the cast that was chosen for the movie. The leading characters are some of my favorite. The movie stars, John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson.There are many twist and turns to this movie. First you have two hit men who are on patrol to retrieve a stolen briefcase (who run into a few mishaps along the search). A fighter, Butch Coolidge, who is suppose to lose his fight, however that doesn't go as planned either...He ends up killing his opponent. And is now on the run from the crime boss...I am not a huge fan of Quentin Taratino. I just don't understand his style of directing. However I would recommend this film to others, just so they can have their own opinion.",Null,0,1,9 December 2014
Psycho," Psycho (1960)
","This is a classic horror film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When talking about Hitchcock, people most refer his directing towards this film.This is a black and white, which stars Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates), Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) and Vera Miles (Lila Crane). The movie itself is an icon for all other horror movies. The house on the hill can be recognized by all, and when questioned, you'll hear a response- the house from 'Psycho' You basically have a woman who's on the run for stealing money from her boss (Marion Crane). A motel owner, who has psychological issues (Norman Bates)and a woman who is in search of her missing sibling (Lila Crane).In a nutshell you have a man who commits murders, while dressed up as a woman. However if you never saw the film, you would suspect that it was a woman...and would point fingers at Norman Bates mother.. however that is not the case.",Null,2,3,4 December 2014
