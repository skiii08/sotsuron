Men in Black 3," Nothing Special, But A Huge Step-Up From The 2nd Film
","While it's still nowhere on the same level of the first film, Men In Black III is a huge step up from the second film and works good as a fun popcorn flick.Will Smith does a good job reprising his role as Agent J, but who really shines is Josh Brolin playing the role of a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones character Agent K. The story here is not anything we haven't seen done before, but it actually works for the most part and the film is entertaining enough to keep your attention for most of the runtime. While there are some very funny moments in the movie, there's also a lot of moments where the humor just falls flat and feels very outdated. The villain in the film also had a lot of potential, but seemed like he was just wasted in the end. The film has a good start and really picks up once the time traveling aspect comes into the film, although there are some parts in the middle of the film where it really drags. I did really enjoy the ending to the film though as it had a really good and heartfelt twist that I thought was a nice way to wrap up the trilogy and was a good payoff.Overall, Men In Black III isn't a great film or even a memorable one. But, it's fun and works as a popcorn flick and it's worth seeing if you are a fan of the first two films.",7,1,4,1 June 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Fun Action Flick That Delivers On Exactly What It Promises
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is exactly what you would expect from the title. A ridiculous, over-the-top, and fun action-horror flick. The serious tone and silly premise may turn off some people, but the serious tone actually works to the films advantage and actually made the movie more fun. I actually think a goofy and comedic tone could've hurt the films in some ways by being a bit too tongue and cheek. The action scenes were well done and incredibly entertaining to watch. The final action scene was actually worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed how they included actual parts of Lincoln's history into the film. Benjamin Walker also surprisingly did a good job as Lincoln. The dialogue is corny but I actual think that played as a strength to a film rather than a weakness. The 3D effects are also used very well in the film and delivers a good mix of depth and gimmicky moments and really enhanced the action sequences. I would highly recommend seeing the film in 3D if you have the option. If I had any complaints it would be that I did feel like the film dragged a bit in the middle.Overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a fun flick that delivers on exactly what it promises. Abraham Lincoln kicking vampire ass! If you don't go in holding the films premise against it, than you'll have a blast with it!",8,161,251,23 June 2012
Ted," Not Great, Not Bad. Just Alright
","While there really isn't anything wrong with Ted, there isn't anything that great about it either. For his first film, Seth MacFarlane did a good job, but he's still got a lot to learn as a director. The film feels very much like his material and some scenes felt exactly like a live action episode of Family Guy. Mark Wahlberg did a good job in his role and MacFarlane and I really enjoyed the character of Ted. He really carries the movie and the scenes without him on screen really seemed to go by a bit slow. As for the comedy in the film, there are plenty of funny scenes, but most of them deliver on a level of chuckles instead of big laughs. That's not to say the film doesn't deliver some laughs at points, but not as many as it should. The one thing that did kinda bug me about this film was it's constant references to the 80's. Some of them such as the references to Flash Gordon were funny, but the film relied way too heavily on them and some of them felt forced. I also felt the film was a bit too long and could've easily been 15 minutes shorter. Overall, Ted isn't as good as it could've been, but there really isn't anything wrong with it that will keep you from enjoying it either. It's much better than the new episodes of Family Guy, but there's much funnier films that have come out this year such as 21 Jump Street.",7,0,6,29 June 2012
Underworld Awakening," Another Lame Sequel
","I should probably start off this review saying that i'm not really that big of a fan of the Underworld franchise. I thought the first two films were OK and I thought the third one was awful. When I saw the trailer for Awakening, it looked like it would finally be what I had wanted from this series all along. A fast paced over-the-top action movie with the addition of some great 3D effects.Unfortunately, Underworld Awakening is exactly what I feared it would be and that is a poorly done sequel that should've gone straight to DVD.Despite some good action sequences, this is just another lackluster installment in a franchise that was never that good to begin with. I probably wouldn't have hated it so much if the story haden't been so horrible and stupid.It's not as bad as the third film, but it's still not worth watching.",4,2,5,26 June 2012
Coriolanus," You Don't Have To Be A Shakespeare Fan To Enjoy This Film
","Going into the film, I really didn't know anything about it. Which is why i'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.For a first time director Ralph Fiennes really did a great job making a modern adaptation of one of the lesser known Shakespeare works. I'm not a huge Shakespeare fan, but I have to say that the use of the his dialogue here actually worked in the context in the film even with the modern setting. Fiennes and Butler both do an amazing job and really carry the film as does the rest of the cast. The action sequences are also shot very well and realistically. I hope Fiennes continues to direct because he shows a lot of talent here. Don't let Shakespeare's name drive you away from this film! You don't have to be a fan of his work to enjoy it!",8,21,26,26 June 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," The Horror Film Will Never Be The Same Again
","Even with all the great things I heard about The Cabin In The Woods, nothing could prepare me for how great it really was. Hilarious, Twisted, and Insane, The Cabin in the Woods perfectly bends the genres of Comedy and Horror together and creates not only the best Horror Comedy i've ever seen, but one of the best Horror films i've ever seen and some of the most fun i've ever had at the movies. However, this is a really easily film to spoil and I highly recommend going in knowing as little as possible. The most I will say is that the last 20 minutes blew my mind. So stop reading this review and anything related to this film until you see it! It's too good to be spoiled and for anyone to spoil it would be criminal. All I will say is once you've experienced The Cabin In The Woods, you will never see a Horror film the same way again.",10,3,8,1 June 2012
