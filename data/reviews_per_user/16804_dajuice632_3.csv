Raiders of the Lost Ark," Fantastic!
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one of the greatest action films of all-time. At its core, the movie's a popcorn extravaganza but there is so much more to it. For instance, the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is perfect, which brings the romantic element of this film to a degree far above any other action film I can think of. In so many cases, love interests in any action film seem tacked on at best, but 'Raiders' is the exact opposite of that.Of course, what would an action film be without some exciting chase sequences? This movie certainly has its share of them, and they are all spectacular. It certainly doesn't hurt that Ford does many of his own stunts, which helps a lot when one is looking for realism in an action movie. Also, John Williams' musical score moves along the action at an exciting pace. It might just be my favorite film score! 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' comes with my highest recommendation!",10,1,2,18 March 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Funny, scary and great!
","Great dark comedies are few and far between, but we'll always have 'Dr. Strangelove' to watch! It's easily one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Once again, Peter Sellers shows us why he's one of the great comedic talents to ever grace the silver screen. He plays three very different characters here, and each performance is brilliant. George C. Scott is also fantastic; he's perfect for his role.What's so amazing about this film is that everything is equally funny and scary. The actions of the characters seem so ludicrous, but there's another side of me that feels like some of this could have actually happened during the days of the Cold War. 'Dr. Strangelove' is one of the best films I'v ever seen, and it just might be Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece!",10,2,4,18 March 2007
Rocky," One of the great sports movies.
","'Rocky' is probably the most heartwarming movie I've had the chance to view. I absolutely love the characters that Sly Stallone has created in the 'Rocky' universe, and the first movie is certainly the best. The romance between Rocky and Adrian is genuine, and I find myself smiling throughout every scene they have together. They're definitely one of the great movie couples of all-time.The actual fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed has a very real presence, and Rocky's training sequence is as memorable as everyone says it is. Bill Conti's music is iconic and for good reason. The film might not be the perfect boxing/sports movie as 'Raging Bull' proved just a few years later, but 'Rocky' still packs a punch and has its place in movie history.",9,1,2,18 March 2007
