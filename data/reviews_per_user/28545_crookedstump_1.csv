Blade Runner 2049," Cinema goes up a notch
","I've seen this movie in the theater and I've seen it at home and the more I see it the more I see. It grows on one. It has elements that continue questions from the original Blade Runner in my mind and Ryan Gosling does a brilliant job as an unemotional replicant Bladerunner who is caught in the cross hairs of manipulated existence to the extent that he learns that he may well have a soul after all. Humans that are so 'fragile' they have to enlist replicants to do their dirty work but cannot abide any change to the order of things suppressing any hint of a biological 'miracle' when a replicant became pregnant. Why I'm not certain because the head of the Tyrel Corporation is attempting to do just that. Overall I give this movie a 10 for it's story line, acting, scripting and sound effects. A total package that takes cinema up a notch imo.",10,3,15,27 October 2018
