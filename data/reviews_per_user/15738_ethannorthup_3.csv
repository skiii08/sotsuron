It," A modern classic
","Anyone who's a horror fan needs to watch this movie, even if they don't like the book or the original show.This movie cuts out all the filler from the book and made a perfectly concise standalone movie. Making this film only focus on the kids and not flashing forward to the adults was a great decision because it makes the story way more cohesive. The kids are all great and the scenes with them together are very happy and funny, and they serve as a good contrast to the sad and scary scenes.The only flaws I can think of with this movie would be the editing. Whenever there's a scary part they play really loud noises which seem like they're telling the audience 'here's the part where you're supposed to be scared!'. Other times, in some intense parts where pennywise runs towards the screen, the camera gets all shaky and there's a bunch of motion blur around him. Also there's a couple parts where they show pennywise in broad daylight which makes him less scary in my opinion, it takes away from the mystery of the character. But these are just filmmaking nitpicks that don't really affect the story.Even if you don't usually like horror, this is still a must-watch",9,0,0,20 September 2019
The Lion King," A waste of time and money
","Imagine taking the original animated film and sucking out all the emotion and fun out of it, and that's what you get here. It's a lifeless humorless slog. The main draw of this version was all the celebrities they got for it like Beyonce, but the voice acting is terrible too. It sounds like they're just reading their lines from a piece of paper and making no effort at all. And the actors that are actually trying just come across like cheap imitations of the original. But even if this wasn't a remake and it was an original film it still wouldn't be good.Years from now everyone will just forget this version exists. It genuinely disappoints me that they even made back their budget for this movie and Disney didn't lose millions of dollars on it, because now we're just going to get even more garbage low effort remakes like this was",1,52,77,10 August 2019
It Chapter Two," Some cheesy parts but overall still a good movie
","It didn't live up to the impossibly high standard they set with the first, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.That being said though, this movie was more funny than scary. The scenes with pennywise hunting children were kind of played off as jokes instead of being very tense like in the first film. Pennywise was a borderline comic relief character in this one. Also the parts that are supposed to be scary come across as silly because they have so many huge CGI monsters. This movie also resorts to cheap jumpscares for horror and the atmosphere isn't as nuanced as the first.However, the acting is fantastic and the casting is perfect. All the adults look and act exactly like their younger counterparts, to the point where I forgot they weren't the same people. The characters are definitely the main thing driving this movie. All the scenes with them together are just fantastic. The weakest parts of the movie were the ones where they split up.This movie's also way more accurate to the book than the original tv movie and it selves into more of the lore a little bit.Sometimes this movie reminded me of Evil Dead 2, which can be a good thing or a bad thing for different people",7,0,0,20 September 2019
