The Avengers," Avengers is an amazing movie
","So Marvel finally decided to bring all its superheroes together. Something that I had been waiting for from a long time. Until now there were only independent stories for each of the superheroes.The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, is the very first movie from Marvel that unites all the heroes into one great action packed movie. The movie brings Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr. Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) together to save the Earth from the actions of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The story is similar to other superhero movies with the general 'save the earth from danger' plot. Even though it may have a simple plot however it does have some amazing action sequences and impressive special effects like the much more realistic Hulk, who (through motion capture technology) finally looks like the actor playing him. The interaction between the superheroes as the movie progressed was also something to watch out for. It had great performances by all the actors, good humor, and many others which I will leave as a mystery. Avengers is a general sci-fi, superhero movie, but it sets the stage for more eye-catching sequels to follow.According to me what Whedon and Marvel have created here is one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet. This movie is a must watch for the Marvel fans out there. I would give it a rating of 9/10.",9,0,2,7 August 2016
