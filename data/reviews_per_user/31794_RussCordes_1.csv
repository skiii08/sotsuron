Sucker Punch," Worst film for a long time
","Having been quite keen to see this film,being a big fan of watchmen,I have to say this is absolute garbage. No point,no passion and devoid of any sort of worth while plot. it made no sense to me at all and I must confess I could not watch more than 40 odd minutes of this god awful crap. you know a film is pretty bad when you look at the run time and think you have had your fill way before the halfway point,glad this didn't cost me anything to watch,otherwise I would be absolutely furious. So in summary CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP. Luckily only 40 odd minutes of my life wasted (and trust me my life ain't all that!),unlike the poor cast of this movie who have wasted their talents by signing up for this. Personally I am amazed that the cast didn't just walk away during filming,I guess the money was good and due to the obvious over use of blue backgrounds,maybe didn't realise till it was too late.",1,12,23,7 August 2011
