E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Very much a let down.
","I have just seen recently that ET is being re-released for a 20th Anniversary. My question is why? I first saw this film in 1982 aged 11, and I couldn't believe how boring it really was. All throughout the film you could hardly see what was going on everything was so dark. I remember being so excited about this film and couldn't wait to see it however as a kid I was very disappointed. I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark the same year and that was so much better.
