Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite Entertaining
","I know i will probably get in trouble for thisBut i enjoyed Star wars Episode I The Phantom MenaceThe Movie had great special effects and yes the writing could have been better, but i guess this movie was just trying to introduce all the characters.The Battle Droids and Gungans were cool but out of all the gungans Jar Jar Binks probably got a bit annoying at times. Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon-Jin and Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan-Kenobi were perfect in there roles...in fact Qui-Gon_jin was probably my favourite character in this movie.Darth Maul was also a good character i loved his look, but as a sith he was a bit of a amateur but the double edged light saber look was great. Overall i enjoyed this movie but it had it faults and it could have been better, but it will probably better once the whole series comes together.",7,1,2,27 May 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders Of The Lost Ark...Great, Great Movie!
","Sadly I only saw all the Indiana Jones movies on DVD when they came out, and i can't believe what i missed out on. This First Movie Raiders Of The Lost Ark is Great...Pure Adventure, I loved it from beginning to end. Indiana Jones was so greatly made and Harrison Ford played him perfectly, Karen Allen who portrayed Marion Ravenwood was also well done and is my favorite Indy girl out of all the movies. The Villain or should we at least say Competitore Dr. Rene Belloq Played by Paul Freeman also was done excellently.Some Of My favorite Scenes were the Boulder Chase, The Market Fight, The Truck Chase and The Ceremony scene at the end.You have to see this movie it's GREAT GREAT GREAT ADVENTURE!!!!",9,0,0,5 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Keep Them Coming...
","This is my most favorite sequel so far, dark like the second film...and we sort of take a break from voldemort trying to kill harry! and we are introduced to another great character Sirius Black...Harry Potter's Godfather (but people and read and own the books like me knew that ages ago)...and the bit with aunt Marge is terrific...here's the plot...For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard 'accidentally' causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the non-magic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? The best sequel so far and i have i high expectations for the next film...the only disappointing part was Richard Harris passing away and now a new actor plays dumbledore...sure he ain't as good as Richard...but i still think this new actor does a great job.",8,0,1,10 July 2005
Batman Begins," I Never Thought I Would Say This But...Aye Carumba!!!!
","I Was Surprised I went into the Theater with My Dad, Brother and My Brothers Boyfriend and i had low expectations expecting to see another failure....I was Proved Wrong! This movie entertained me from beginning to end it was just excellent. My Dad and I are big Batman Fans so we were blown away when we saw this , Christain Bale as Batman was perfect, Michael Caine also was perfect as Alfred, Liam Neeson was great and tricked me into thinking he was good and Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were great in their roles to. It Really was interesting how He Becomes Batman...To me This is The Best Batman Ever and I don't Think it's a prequel, But an Opening to an entire new batman series...if you haven't seen this movie yet quit looking at this review and race to your closets movie theater now and experience Batman Begins!",8,0,1,18 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Great Adaption Of The Book
","I enjoyed Harry Potter And The Philosphers Stone (or Sorcerer's stone as they call it in America), it was wonderful the writing was great, and the characters and setting and the magic was all there...A truly Great Film...here's the plot..Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the non-magic human world--the world of 'Muggles'--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, pig like cousin Dudley. A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: 'We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.' Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, 'I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!' Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. defiantly worth watching, and if you like it buy it on DVD or video...I own it and watch it all the time.",7,0,3,10 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An Even Greater Sequel
","I Loved this more than the first movie they really took a step forward, dobby i was really impressed by and got to see much more of snape (my favorite character)...and Harry and Ron and Hermione (Daniel, Rupert and Emma) were more settled in there roles now...here's the plot...It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, 'The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware.' But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful Movie is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. You will Love this movie...and i bought it on DVD as soon as i saw it out, trust me a much better sequel.",8,0,1,10 July 2005
Scream 2," I actually enjoyed This as much as the original
","I'll only do a quick review here as i don't have much time, but i did actually enjoy Scream 2 nice follow up good performances by the main cast, and the scene at the start where that girl gets killed by old Ghostface is awesome...you know you could probably do that and get away with that....what the heck am i saying, anyway while the story was a little bit dodgy like most teen slasher flicks today it still holds up, and the kills are more elaborate in this one as Randy points out.Once again i kept saying when Dewey gonna die when's Dewey gonna die, until YES HE DID WOOHOO!!!!!!....but wait no at the end it turns out he still alive....damn you ghostface you didn't stab him enough. Overall i enjoyed this as much as the original and it worth seeing.",8,0,0,15 August 2005
Scream," The Best Scream.
","I have always had a soft spot for the Scream movies, come on there fun they don't scare me they make me laugh...though i loved the costume Ghostface, good performances by Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquete ( i forget how to spell his last name so i don't know if that's right), there is some story in this movie but could greatly be improved...and though not to up to match with movies like Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street this is still a fun watch.Love the whole phone thing 'What's your favorite scary movie' hehehee..some of my favorite scenes are the start scene, the garage scene and the ending band a few others in there...i don't mind Dewey but i kept saying when's Dewey gonna die when's Dewey Gonna Die....Overall a good 'recent' horror film.",8,0,0,15 August 2005
Halloween," My Favourite Halloween
","Sadly i never got to see this great horror film in the cinemas.But I saw it in my home which was good enough, heh and the movie did scare menot just Michael Myers but The Story And The Menacing Score.Nick Castle Was the Best Michael Myers cause he made the Character, the mask was perfect, the clothing was perfect and the walk was perfect. Donald Pleasence was Also perfect as Dr Loomis and Jamie Lee Curtis was also perfect as the scream queen Laurie Strode.The story was well done and it was the movie that set up the rank for the horror movies to come. Halloween is One of the greatest Horror Movies Of All Time.",10,0,1,18 June 2005
Fantastic Four," Impressive...But Not Impressive Enough.
","I walked into the theater with medium expectations...and i didn't receive much, The Special Effects were impressive and well done. But The Story was dodgy and could have had a lot more work...i also thought this film was sort of rushed.....the character i liked the most would be Doom or in the comics he is called Dr Doom, the villain is always the most appealing character in superhero movies to me...impressive more and enjoyable enough, probably a bit to much comedy and not enough action...but it worth getting on DVD. I Give this Movie about a 6 out of 10 for most of the special effects, and the story was pretty decent but as i said could have been much better.",6,0,2,9 July 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Ahh Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade...My Favourite Of The Whole Series!
","Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade is the greatest out of the Indiana Jones movies, it surpasses both Raiders and Temple. Harrison Ford plays Indy at his best here, and we introduce INDY'S DAD!! Professor Henry Jones played by none other than the original James Bond.. Sean Connery, who was great. We also get two see two other characters we missed from Temple Marcus Brody and Sallah, and Marcus gets more screen time in this one which is great. The Villain Donovan played by Julian Glover was a good addition to the series, but my favorite villain in this one is Vogel played by Michael Byrne. The writing and story in this movie is perfect and the action sequences are great, Indiana Jones and his father this time must get the holy grail from the evil Nazis.My favorite scenes in this movie are the fire scene, the boat chase scene, the tank scene and the ending scene where they ride off as with them finding the grail at the end.You'll love The Last Crusade...it's the best Indiana Jones film out of them all.",10,7,14,5 August 2005
