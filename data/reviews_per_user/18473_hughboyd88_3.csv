10 Cloverfield Lane," A surprisingly tense and well-written movie, this sequel easily surpasses the original
","I was skeptical about the new Cloverfield going in. The first movie was good, but not great, and it's rare that a sequel is as good as the original. Coming out, however, it was clear that not only is 10 Cloverfield Lane a clear step above the original, but also a great movie in its own right.While clearly set in the same universe as the original Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very different beast altogether. It uses a completely new cast of characters, is pretty much set in one location, and forgoes the found footage style of the first one for a more traditional direction. While I thought the found footage was fine in the first one, it definitely wouldn't have worked well in this one.Basically, the plot is about a woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who after being in an accident wakes up trapped in a doomsday prepper's (John Goodman) survival shelter with another man (John Gallagher). There is also a cameo by Bradley Cooper. Goodman's character warns that there has been an attack and that the three of them must remain in the shelter for an indefinite amount of time. As you can guess, the situation in this bunker soon turns south. All three give strong performances. This is clearly the best performance of Winstead's career, and the never disappointing John Goodman also gives one of his better performances. Like his character in Barton Fink, Goodman does an excellent job of playing a character who, while not outwardly evil, clearly has something off about him. With only three characters and one location, the performances alone carry this film a long way.That being said, the script also doesn't disappoint, which is penned in part by Whiplash director Damien Chazelle. All three characters are well developed, and while some plot points are predictable, the well-written script never lets the audience know exactly where the movie is going.10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense and exciting movie definitely worth checking out. It's admirable that in this sequel this get smaller rather than bigger (the actual budget is even less than the first). I think this film could become a sleeper hit, and is a must-see for fans of John Goodman or the original Cloverfield.",8,4,7,13 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," Another classic by Tarantino
","The Hateful Eight is a great film. In my opinion, QT has yet to make a bad film. Death Proof is an average film and Jackie Brown is a bit above average, everything else is exceptional.First and foremost, this is a Tarantino film through and through. It leans heavily on its dialogue and has lots of over-the-top violence with characters who have a propensity for the n-word. Basically, if you don't like Tarantino's style this film isn't for you. I've seen a lot of hate on IMDb for this film, but truthfully I feel as if there is a vocal minority of IMDb users who hate on any popular recent film (the new Star Wars comes to mind), with The Hateful Eight no exception. However, take it from a Tarantino fan that this is a movie worth seeing. At no point was I bored during the film's 3 hour run time, and found it to have every ingredient that makes up a great QT film, with enough violence to satisfy, some moments of hilarity, and lots of great monologues.Three of the best things about this film are its great cast, excellent score, and beautiful cinematography. Of course, this is to be expected. Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth never disappoint, which is why Tarantino keeps casting them. Jennifer Jason Leigh is probably the standout performance, however, convincingly portraying a truly disgusting human being with ease. Channing Tatum also gives a solid performance, no matter what his haters have to say. Another predictably great part of the film is Ennio Morricone's score. He's probably my favorite film composer, and makes a soundtrack that would please even Sergio Leone. The cinematography also is astounding. While the outdoor scenes are obviously the most dazzling, the interior scenes still do not disappoint in terms of cinematography. I would also recommend that anyone who lives near a theater showing the roadshow to check it out, as the wider screen makes the pictures even greater.The weakest part of the film to me, however, was the twist reveal near the end. I felt like revealing Demian Bichir's, Michael Madsen's, and Tim Roth's characters to all be working with Daisy to be a bit of overkill. While I see why QT employed the twist of having more than 'one or two' characters to be allies of Daisy, it seems like he took the least developed characters and lumped them all together. The one I found most disappointing was Michael Madsen's character, as I felt he would have been much stronger if he had his own back story and motivations. I found his fabricated story of visiting his mom to have been a more interesting path his character could have taken.In the end, Tarantino falls short of a grand slam but still hits a home run with his newest film. I would highly recommend it to anyone who does't hate Tarantino and has a stomach for violence. I left the theater feeling that my ticket price was more than validated.",9,2,17,29 December 2015
Straight Outta Compton," A solid look at one of the most influential music groups in modern history
","Anyone who knows anything about hip hop knows the influence and importance of NWA. Even today, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are still some of the most well-known rappers in the game. I suppose that it was almost inevitable that a movie of this type would come out, and after watching it I can say it definitely doesn't disappoint. For those who don't know, Straight Outta Compton is the story of NWA, an immensely influential hip hop group consisting of Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr). The first half of the film chronicles the group's formation from the streets of Compton. The second half shows their eventual falling out, the starts of their solo careers, and Eazy-E's death from AIDS. Personally, I think the first half is the better of the two. You can almost feel the anger of each group member pulsing off the screen directed at racist police, lack of opportunity, and society in general. However, the last half loses a lot of steam. Once the group has broken up, the films changes from a grand statement to more of a 'where are they know?' approach. We see the beginnings of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre's solo careers and Eazy-E's struggles of making it solo. At this point in the film, MC Ren and DJ Yella are more or less forgotten, sidelined to focus on their more famous counterparts.Cast wise, there are certainly some great performances. Paul Giamatti adeptly portrays NWA's crooked manager Jerry Heller. O'Shea Jackson, Jr. bears a striking resemblance to his father, and gives a strong performance. The best of the bunch, however, is probably Neil Mitchell as Eazy-E, who does a great job of portraying his inner turmoil. Corey Hawkins seems a bit miscast as Dr. Dre, but still does a good enough job of portraying him.Reading through some other reviews on IMDb, it seems like these reviews were hijacked by some sort of Baptist church or something. There is no 'explicit sex' in the movie. The most shown are bare breasts, but it really wasn't anything noticeably more graphic than any other R movie. Also, it shouldn't surprise anyone that NWA would have parties with lots of naked women. I mean, it's not like they were ever shy about rapping about all the women they got. Other reviews call them 'terrible role models' and 'thugs'. OK, the movie never tries to act like they're good role models. And the people calling them 'thugs' and 'gangsters' seem to be referring to the fact that they grew up in South Central and Compton. Oh well, the movie isn't for everyone.There are definitely some issues with the film. As touched upon earlier, the second half of the film doesn't replicate the energy of the first. In addition, it becomes pretty clear that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are the ones producing the film, as they, along with Eazy-E take up virtually all of the screen time while MC Ren and DJ Yella are delegated to standing in the background for most of the film, even though MC Ren was a larger factor in NWA's success than Dre, who really came into his own after he went solo. In fact, once the group break up MC Ren and Yella aren't even seen for at least an hour, only reappearing once the group reassembles, coming back into the fold with no explanation of what they've been doing or why they came back. Another member of NWA, Arabian Prince, stands in the background for about 5 minutes before disappearing altogether with no mention of who he was or why he left the group. While he did leave before the group became successful, his face is still on the cover of the Straight Outta Compton album yet gets less screen time than Snoop Dogg and Tupac, who weren't even part of NWA. Dr. Dre rides his high horse the whole movie. The director makes sure to show him standing up to Suge Knight's evil, but seems to forget the allegations of abuse directed toward him. Ice Cube is similarly portrayed as never doing wrong. Eazy-E is the only character shown to have flaws, which makes him the most interesting character in the group, and is portrayed in a more sympathetic light. Ren and Yella don't really have any development to speak of. Also, the movie makes sure to not address the often homophobic and misogynistic lyrics of NWA's music, instead making it seem like their lyrics are completely innocuous, with everyone taking offense to them being in the wrong.Criticisms aside, this movie is certainly one worth watching if you are a fan of NWA, hip hop, or even music in general. If you are easily offended by language, or hate rappers just because they're rappers, make sure to avoid this movie. If you are interested in learning more about the World's Most Dangerous Group, this movie is a must watch.",8,16,57,23 August 2015
