Deepwater Horizon," Environmental disaster not dealt with.
","This boring movie only deals with the events happening up untill the explosion.A bunch of rednecks, whose southern accent I could only understand with subtitles on, works on an oilrig. *SPOILERS AHEAD*A boss, played by always slimey John Malkovic,h is responsible for the accident, al though Im not sure how. There is alot of technical mumbo jumbo that only makes sense for people working on oilrigs. Mark Whalberg plays Mark Whalberg and Kate Hudson plays his annoying wife whose only job is to worry if her husband survived. Kurt Russel plays another boss, but he is one of the goodguys for some reason. If you expect an actionmovie you will be dissapointed. Nothing happens for 51 minutes. Youre introduced to alot of rednecks that you wont get to know or care about despite the movie taking its time before the explosion. And when the action does happen, its hard to tell whats going on, because its dark and there is alot of shaky cam. Afterwards there are videoes from a hearing and investigation into the accident. The characters played by Whalberg and Russel looks nothing like the real characters. Which is lazy and dumb. The impact on the environment from the explosion isn only dealt with, showing a pelican covered in oil and dying. And a text saying it was the worst oil disaster in US history. And then we see pictures of the real 11 killed rednecks with some annoying countrysong playing in the background. This movie doesnt know wether it wants to be drama or an actionmovie. And as a result its neither. Not worth watching.",1,6,14,8 August 2018
It," Don't believe the hype...
","This movie is not nearly as good as the original mini-series. It doesn't even come close to 'Stand by me' or 'Stranger things'. A movie and a series this crap has been compared to. Which is an insult to to the movie and the series. As this is not even in the same ballpark. This version of IT is not scary at all. And the movie is filled with so many plot holes it will give you a headache, just thinking about them. SPOIILERS AHEAD!! First of all, the original first episode of 'It' was far superior on every level. Tim Curry was far more scary as Pennywise than Bill Skarsg책rd. Skarsg책rd does his best but his performance is ruined by over the top CGI effects every time he appears. Maybe he simply wasn't scary enough and they thought they could improve it with special effects. The glowing eyes for one, was just dumb and infuriated me. This Pennywise is apparently much more a shapeshifter here than he was in the original. Because each kid is afraid of something different and instead of letting Pennywise scare them, he looks like the things that scare the kids. And that don't work. As for the kids themselves, they're not bad, but not very good either. Me and my friend were bored at the cinema, and made fun of the kids during several scenes where we were suppose to feel bad for them. They just seem like kid actors playing their parts. Unlike the kids in Stand by me or Stranger things, that ARE their characters, the kids here are just kids acting, nothing more. The same goes for the bullies that are way over the top as far as bullies go. As far as the horror goes, it's predictable and have way too much gore just for the sake of gore. I don't mind blood at all, but when it comes to a Stephen King movie, I expect psychological horror, mixed with a little gore. What we get here, however, is cheap jumpscares mixed with gore while showing each kids fear, one at a time and it gets boring after awhile. Cheap jumpscares is what I would expect in crap like The Comnjuring movies. Not in a so called horror movie based on a Stephen King book. In another gory and boring, but suppose to be scary scene, the ginger girls bathroom is flooded with blood coming from the drain in the sink. Her father (get to him later) comes in, because of her screams. He cant see the blood, which means its not there, but made by Penywise to scare her. Yet later on all the kids see their shared imagination of the blood soaked bathroom and starts to clean it. If the blood is not really there, then why clean the bathroom?? And if each kid has a different fear and blood is only the ginger girls fear, then the other kids shouldn't be able to see the blood. This makes no sense what so ever. The fat kid writes a poem for the ginger girl, but knowing he wrote it and saves her life, by kissing her, after the final battle with Pennywise, she still chooses another boy as her boyfriend, which makes no sense and makes her an ungrateful little bitch.*MORE SPOILERS AHEAD*But Pennywise is nt the only monster here. Evidently some of the parents are monsters too. As in evil. And get this: two of the kids kill their dads, one, the main bully, who is later on killed by one of the kids were suppose to care about and the other one, the ginger girl (who is way too sexualized to make her character believable) goes to live with her aunt in another state. She killed her own father and doesn't end up in an institution or in prison. Yeah right!! Even though her father was a scumbag that molested her, this doesn't justify murder. And with no witnesses to the father molesting her, there is no proof, so she should be in jail. And of course they're lining up a sequel as this movie is called chapter one. I for one will not see the sequel. Nor will I see this movie again. Everything here just made miss the first episode of the mini-series where the kids were great and believable and Tim Curry was truly scary as Pennywise. If you enjoy a good Stephen King movie adaptation, this is not for you.If you want something scary with really good acting from everybody, watch Stranger Things. It is amazing and everything, this movie isn't.",1,11,21,16 September 2017
It," IT SUCKS!!
","Dont believe the hype.This movie is not good. BillSkarsg책rd pales to Tim Curry as Pennywise. 
Instead of psychological horror this movie does what all modern 'horrormovies' does. It relies on jumpscares and way too much cgi. 
Skarsg책rds performance is ruined by cgi that allows the character to move around in physically impossible ways. Every time he appears its very predictable. And whenever Pennywise preys on the kids fears appearing as something else, its 'scarier' than Pennywise himself. And that is not a good thing. Pennywise himself is suppose to be terrifying without cgi and without appearing as some other monster. The one monster that does work is the woman with the flute in the painting. That is good and clever horror. A movie with the flutelady as the main monster might have worked.
The kids are decent although forgettable. The kids in thetv mini series were much, much better. Several of the kids annoyed me. Lkethe older brother to the kid was eaten by Pennywiseand the redhaired girl. The only good kid was the main bully. But he was so over the top mean, that it became cliche. 
Also this movie is a ripoff of Stranger Things, the Netflix series that is much more scary with better acting. It even has Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things in it. Some might enjoy this movie for being R rated, which means lots of f-bombs and lots of blood. I usually enjoy that too. But if the story and the acting just dont work, then the rating is not important. The mini series were of course cencored for tv, but it was still psychologically scary. Now if you can make something scary with a small budget and cencorship, then youre good. Tommy Lee Wallace, director of the mini series was that good. Andy Muschietti has all the money and all the toys but not the skills to bring the horror to the big screen.
 
IT sucks, get one star, becauseof the flutelady. Do not waste your timne on this crap.",1,6,11,29 July 2018
Hereditary," Pretty bad.
","The acting is generally very good. Except from Gabriel Byrne, but he doesnt have much to do in it. Alex Wolff and Toni Collette are outstanding as the tormented son and his mother. The weird looking Milly Shapiro, who seems to be the lead in the very misleading trailer, is okay, but shes not much in the movie. And the movie is more weird and ridicouluys plotwise, than it is actually scary.
*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*It starts with Annies (Toni Collette) mother who has just died a while before the movie starts. They go to the funeral.
A few weeks later, Charlie (Milly Shapiro) who is allergic to nuts, is forced to go to a party with her older brother Peter (Alex Wolff) At the party she eats cake with nuts in it while her brother smokes weed with his friend. Peter rushes Charlie to the hospital , but they never make it there. Charlie cant breathe and opens the window. To avoid hitting a dead animal on the road, Peter makes a hard turn and Charlies head hits a post and she is decapitated.
From this scene on, the movie gets really weird and really bad. Now instead of calling an ambulance and the cops and his parents, like a normal person would do, Peter drives home to his parents, house with his sisters headless corpse in the backseat and goes to bed. This is not normal behaviour in a situation like that. The next morning his mother finds Charlies corpse in the car.
She starts goes to a sorrow group therapy session. At the group she meets the seemingly nice Joan, who later on tricks her into a spiritual session that awakens one of 8 kings of hell. Apparently Charlie was never Charlie. She was this demon king. Her body was just a temporary vessel and the older brother Peter is the vessel the demon prefers at it has to be a male body.
And appeearently Annie and her brother, that killed himself as a teenager were nothing but pawns in the late grandmothers scheme. She was a satanist (whos only goal in life was to give a body to the demonking) and leader of an insane satanist cult, whose members walk around naked when they perform rituals. So appeerarently this plan to resurrect that demonking has been the cults plan for at least 45 years. Yes its that ridicoulus. And it's very long.
I dont mind major twists in horrormovies. That is usually what makes them good. But it's just not believabe that this had been planned for nearly 50 years and the grandmother only had kids to have vessels for the demonking.
I'm only giving it 3 stars, because of the acting from the two leads and because of the cinematography, which is also really goodDon't waste your time on this crap.",3,2,4,23 December 2018
Spider-Man 2," The worst of The Spiderman movies
","For some reasons, superhero-comics turned into movies are always done by directors, that take the subject way too seriously. Which means way, way too much talk and way way too little action. Which is the main problem with Spiderman 2. Nothing works in this way too long movie with so many moral talks and lessons to be learned, that me and my buddy stopped counting, after the annoying Aunt May, gives Parker lesson number 30, about always doing the right thing. We both felt like throwing up. The best thing about the third installment, besides from the added and constant actionscenes is definitely that Aunt May is only in one scene. Lets hope they kill off her character in the fourth movie.The biggest problem is the geeky dork Tobey Maguire. He is just so annoying and has the most annoying face and his character is so clumsy and always screws up whenever he is not in his Spiderman suit. And Peter Parker in the comic books are taller than Tobey, better looking and not that much a dork.The scene in the beginning, why does Parker ride around delivering pizza's on his crappy scooter, when he is Spiderman?? Why is he so obsessed with MJ played by the unattractive bad actress Kirsten Dunst, when he could get laid all the time as Spiderman?? And why doesn't he sleep with his landlords daughter who is clearly into him?? The part where he loses his powers is dumb and unnecessary and happens at a point in the movie, were there has been almost no action at all, and we had just watched Parker screw everything up for himself for about an hour. Not to mention all the constant scenes with his Aunt May.The villain is dumb and pathetic and badly played by Alfred Molina. And definitely the worst villain in all the movies. And the scene with the train, is the only big actionscene in the entire film. Not acceptable in an 'actionmovie' like Spiderman.The scenes between Parker and Harry where Harry blames Spiderman for his fathers (wonderfully played by Willem Defoe) death in the first movie, doesn't work. And when he finds out that Peter is Spiderman a real confrontation is not allowed in the horrible script, because the annoying MJ has to be rescued once again.The scene where Harry finds The Green Goblins equipment and suit should have been the final scene if you ask me, but no Sam Raimi had to add one last nauseating scene where MJ runs away from her own wedding and into the arms of Parker. Probably one of the worst endings in movie history.Fortunately the third movie has all the things that this lousy sequel builds up to for nearly two hours but never follows up on. Lots of action and a a selfish mean Spiderman and more violence.Lets hope they fire the entire cast for a fourth movie and find better actors that are better looking and give it a higher rating. Like 16 or 18, so we can have even darker movies than the excellent third installment. I read that Leonado DiCaprio turned down playing Spiderman. Lets hope he changed his mind if a fourth movie becomes a reality.How great could these films have been with him. He is handsome and a far better actor than the short annoying dork: Tobey Maguire.This movie gets zero stars from me.",1,5,12,20 November 2017
Ready Player One," Pointless cgi movie for kids
","Apart from the many references to all the greatest movies made in the last 40 years and great rock songs from the 80'ies, this movie dont have a lot going on. The main character Wade, is in the movie less than his Manga toon looking avatar in the Oasis (the VR world) where people spend most of their time. Appaerently they never work. Wades story in the real world (the cliche-ridden dystopian future, where everyone is poor, but can some how still afford VR glasses and suits and tread mills and yet they live in slum) could have been interesting. But after less than 8 minutes Wade is is his avatar in Oasis. And for the rest of the very long movie Wade is only himself for a total of 30 minutes. Halway through the movie his aunt is killed. His last living relative. And yet Wade doesnt seem too bothered by it. He doesnt mourn her death for even a second. I guess that's rule number one in 21st century scifi movies: when somebody dies, nobody gives a shit. Like when Han Solo died in the afwul The Force Awakens.Wade falls in love with another avatar, who also looks like a manga toon, even though the human girl Samantha who owns the avatar is way more hot. This very attractive girl has a huge birthmark on her face, that she for some reason tries to hide, like it's something hideous. Some dead rich nerd who invented the Oasis offers a reward of his entire fortune to whoever can find three keys and an easteregg. Everytime he appaears in the Oasis, he looks like Gandalf from LOTR. And even though he died long ago, he appears very much alive in one of the final scenes of the movie. This makes no sense. You cannot talk and interact with a dead person. The other characters are some black kids and some asian kids. I'm sick of annoying asian kids appearing in Hollywood movies, just to please an asian audience. And sell tickets in asian countries. Mostly because they cant act, they hav no personalities. And theyre forgotten very fast. This movie is so dumb. Dont waste your money and time. No Spielberg is not back. This movie is not as fun as Spielberg was in the 80'ies. Only good thing: not one movie reference refers to any of his old movies. At least he got that one right.",1,12,21,13 April 2018
Taxi Driver," Typical 70'ies trash...
","Taxi Driver is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I'ts considered a masterpiece but let me tell you, it's not. The running time of a little under two hours drags a long at such a slow pace that it feels like 3 hours. Robert De Niro is convincing as the unstable Travis Bickle and he's the only reason I was able to watch the whole movie. This is a typical 70'ies movie. It's depressing with an annoying misplaced soundtrack. And peoples clothes and haircuts makes it impossible to take it seriously. If you expect this movie to be a vengeance movie, you will be disappointed. Nothing happens for the first hour and a half. Travis drives fares all over New York, dates some pretty blonde, until she dumps him and every 5 minutes you have to listen to his annoying monologue. And then when something does finally happen, it's over in 5 minutes. Realistic? probably, but also extremely boring. Harvey Keitel is unconvincing as Matthew the pimp selling out Iris (Jodie Foster) Jodie Foster is hardly in the movie at all. Save yourself the boring torture and find the famous 'you talking to me' speech on YouTube. I sure wish I had.",1,15,38,9 October 2016
Barry Lyndon," I've had more fun, starring into a wall.
","This is not a masterpiece. It's not even a good movie. A poor man's Heath Ledger plays Redmond Barry. A man who falls in love with his cousin and has an incestuous relationship with her. Evidently this was okay in those times. When she accept another mans proposal, Barry challenges that man to a duel and kills him. Or so he thinks. He flees to avoid being arrested and is soon enrolled in the British army, later the German army. And then he becomes a spy and later a gambler. He goes after another mans wife and marries her, treats her like crap, impregnates her and cheats on her. He abuses her son and adores his own son. More boring crap happens and Barry ends up childless and with one leg. For reasons unknown he is paid off to leave England by his wife's son. Sounds like a lot is happening, but really nothing happens. Because Barry is such a bastard, I don't give a rats ass, how it ends for him. If you're allergic to men with white powder, rouge and lipstick on their faces and wearing ridiculous wigs and acting like women, avoid this crap. Nothing ever really happens in this snooze fest from no other than Stanley Kubrick. And whenever nothing happens, an annoying soundtrack starts playing very loud that has nothing top do with what happens on the screen. Maybe Kubrick thought it would wake up his bored audience. And the narrator explaining everything makes the movie even more boring, which you would'nt think was possible. The main character Barry is basically an idiot, a sexist and an a-hole and not the least likable. The guy screws his own cousin and 'kills' a man that she chooses, out of jealousy. He lies and cheats to get what he wants. And in spite of his experience and growing older Barry never evolves as a character or learn from his mistakes. It has generally bad acting, especially from it's star RyanO' Neil. He can't even get his accent right. He is American in real life but plays an Irish man. Later in the movie he speaks with an American accent. Pointless scenes that could have easily been cut out drags on and on. What little action there is, is badly made and completely ridiculous. Like the British army walking in a straight line towards a french army only to be shot at. Yet they never take cover or run towards the enemy or shoot back. They just keep walking into bullets and are killed fast. The complete lack of blood except in a ridiculous fist fight scene, makes the action scenes, even more dull and even less believable. With a budget of 11 million dollars in 1975 and making only 20 million dollars, the movie, well deserved, bombed at the box office and prevented Kubrick from making a movie about Napoleon. This is even worse than the awful A Clockwork Orange.Avoid this like the plague.",1,9,29,2 February 2017
Interstellar," 169 minutes I will never get back
","Complete crap!! Christopher Nolan is the most over-rated director in Hollywood!!!I only watched it because I have just seen Matthew Mcconaughey in Dallas Buyers Club where he was fantastic. He was good in this too....But the movie sucks ass and balls!!It is no masterpiece!! Strap in for 2 hours and 49 minutes where nothing happens.'SPOILER AHEAD' Farmer and some astronauts goes into space to save his kids and the people on earth because our planet is dying and people are starving. Because of hyper-sleep and a black hole and some other nonsense they spend 84 years in another galaxy, looking for a new planet that the human race can populate. They don't age at all because of hyper-sleep and because time is different.Then they find Matt Damon, who was send out there to find a new home for humans. For no reason at all Damon's character is a bad-guy, because maybe Nolan at this point realized something had to happen after 90 minutes of boredom. Damon tries to kill Matthew the farmer and escape in their spaceship but accidentally kills himself. Oh and two of the other good guy astronauts are killed.More boring crap happens and Matthew wakes up at a space-station, now 124 years old, but physically only 40, like when he left. He sees his daughter on her death bed and goes back into the black hole or whatever to find the always annoying Anne Hathaway (the only other surviving astronaut) who found the planet the human race needs to survive.The end.Save yourself the torture and avoid this stinking turd. It makes the boring Inception seem like a good movie.Apart from nice visual effects, some taken directly from Inception, this is Nolans worst movie so far.I just hope Hollywood will wake up and realize Nolan had ONE good movie in him: 'The Dark Knight' and stop green-lighting his pretentious over-bloated crap.I quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park 1 to sum up this movie: That is one big pile of sh*t!!",1,6,14,4 November 2016
Pacific Rim," You know Lloyd, just when I thought they couldn't get any dumber...
","They go and make something like this. And totally redeem themselves!!
I thought this slightly changed quote from Dumb and dumber was fitting as a headline for my review of Pacific Rim.This movie is about gigantic monsters attacking humans, so humans build gigantic robots to fight them back. That is the plot. And yes its dumb. Yes the effects are impressive. But good CGI does not make a good movie.I cant think of a single good film Charlie Hunnam has appeared in in the last 5 years. King Arthur, The Lost City of Z and Triple Frontier are those I have seen. And they all suck.Hunnam has proved that he is a good actor in Sons Of Anarchy, but he seems hell-bent on on disproving that as his performances in the before mentioned movies as well as in Pacific Rim are wooden and bad. No matter what character he plays he always seems to be Jax Teller, with a different name and a different haircut or hair color. He is basically a poor mans Christian Bale.I cant wait for the day Hollywood realize that Pacific Rim (Dumb) and Godzilla (Dumber) based on Japanese anime and japanese movies is not the way to go, when making American movies. Most annoying part: because these movies are based on japanese cartoons and movies, were forced to deal with horrible asian actors to please the asian audience. who in part paid for these movies to be made in America with American actors. Asian actors are annoying, not only is their english inept, but so is their so called acting. This is why they dont make these movies themselves in Japan, because they know their actors suck.Avoid this. Even if viewed as a harmless scifi movie where you check your brain at the door, you will still be annoyed and not entertained by Pacific Rim.
I give 1 star because 0 is not an option.",1,3,7,8 July 2019
The Lost City of Z," The lost city of ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
","One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Charlie Hunnam is a terrible actor. At least this time, we don't have to suffer through him trying to fail at an american accent. Robert Pattinson is obvilusly trying to shed his Twilight image. Unfortunetely for him he is not nearly as good an actor as Daniel Radcliffe. And he is giving nothing to work with in this crap. He only accomplishes being almost unrecognizable with a huge beard and glasses. I dont know what kind of man the real Fawcett was, but he's not very likeable. He choses, time and time again, to leave his wife and kids, to look for a city in the Amazones, that will prove that a civilization was there, long before our own. 
 
He already has a small boy, before he goes on his first expedition to map the Amazones in order to clear his fathers name. I know these were different times, but why he cares what some old snobbish a-holes thinks of his father and why that is more important to him than his own family, is beyond me. He then porks his wife and leaves. He comes back, porks his wife again and goes on one more expedition. After he comes back from his second expedition, he now has three kids. Then WW1 breaks out. He considers it his duty to serve and once again put his own honour and country before his family. His eldest son is understandably pissed at him for deserting his family again and again. Fawcet survives the war but temporarily loses his eyesight. Finally he decides to stay home and take care of his family. But all of a sudden his eldest, now adult son, for no reason at all wants to help him find Moby Dick, ehr I mean the lost city. They leave, as heroes of all England. They meet some tribe and live with them in the rainforrest. They are carried down to a river in a scene that made no sense. They're not injured and seem fine. And later were told they dissappeared. Nobody ever took Fawcett seriously. And he died as a failure. Both as an explorer and as a husband.  The EndWhy we should care about some military man and explorer, that wasted his life, looking for his white whale, who died 93 years ago, is a boring mystery. This movie is boring, pointless and a complete waste of time. You would have more fun watching paint dry. Avoid this at all cost.",1,4,10,2 March 2018
Doctor Zhivago," Doctor Malarkey
","Why this crap ever won 5 Oscars, when it was disliked by even the critics and most people who watch it today 52 years later, will remain a mystery.Omar Sharif, who has the nastiest eyes, I've ever seen on an actor, plays Doctor Zhivago. A medical doctor, a poet and a guy who marries his step sister, have kids with her and cheats on her with an icy blonde. Yet he's suppose to be this romantic hero, when he's basically an a**hole.Oh and it takes place in Russia, during WW1 and the Russian revolution. It has a lot of snow and very cold weather in about 95 % of the movie. The most annoying soundtrack you will ever hear, wooden acting, a gross nasty Rod Steiger, male actors, often wearing visible eyeliner, saying ridiculous lines and taking themselves way too seriously. Long boring pointless scenes that could have easily been edited out. Not to mention the two pointless very long intermissions. And on top of all that: a running time of insufferable 3 hours and 20 minutes.Avoid this crap!!!",1,3,12,22 February 2017
Salt," Incredibly dumb movie with an unattractive terrible lead
","No wonder, Angelina Jolie no longer gets work in movies. They finally realized that she's as terrible and actress as she is bony and unattractive.The bony tattooed skeleton Angelina Jolie, who couldnt act if her life depended on it, plays a double agent, as both a CIA operative ands as a russian spy. Not only is her acting terrible, but she's completely unbelievable as someone who can kill men twice her size and weight. She should have gone to the gym to make it believable, but then they would have had to cover her nasty tattoos with makeup to show her toned body. I'm glad they didnt do that. Liev Schreiber is also in it. Usually a good actor but here, like the rest of the cast, he just cant deliver here. This bloodless PG13 thriller has a completely ridicoulus plot and some twist at the end. The action itself is boring. And the directors cut version that I watched that lasted 101 minutes, felt more like 150 minutes. Again I cannot believe Brad Pitt left the very attractive curvy Jennifer Aniston for this nasty woman. Not worth watching. You would have more fun watching paint dry.",1,3,8,10 August 2018
Dunkirk," Nolan's first good movie since The Dark Knight...
","And that says alot, coming from me, because I hate most of Nolans movie. They're bloated, pretentios and very, very boring. Interstellar being his worst movie., And The Dark Knight Rises, his second worst movie. Because he ruined his own Batman triology with that abomination of a movie. Dunkirk, however, is a very good movie. Al though not the masterpiece, Im sure all of the wannabe-intellectual movie snobs, here on imdb, praises it to be. First of all, it's not too long. In these days when pretty much all movies have a run time of at least 2 and a half hours, a run time of 1 hour and 43 minutes, it never got boring. It kept me watching, with its constant suspense. And it was surprisingly brutal, despite, its kiddie friendly PG13 rating. Best acting I've seen in a Nolan movie, since Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Except from Kenneth Branagh. I cant stand that man. Fortunately, he's not in this movie much. Also nice, to not see Michael Caine in a Nolan movie for once. I hate that old fart and I widh he would retire, sooner rather than later. Surprisingly good performance from Harry Styles. I dint expect that. There wasn't really any leads in this movie. It was just alot of nameless soldiers and a few civilians. And it worked very well. It showed what its like to be a soldier in the middle of a war constantly being afraid and unable to trust anyone, that isnt british, and it does so, without becoming cliche. That having been said, I hope Christopher Nolan is done using the same actors over and over and over again. Watching pretty much the same cast for the 5th time or so, is like watching movies made in Denmark, where I'm from. Where the same handful of actors appear in movies over and over and over again.This movie does have some new actors in it. But since there are no leads and all of the young soldiers have dark hair and look pretty much the same, I still have no idea who they are. Except from Styles. And he's not even an actor. But after his performance here, I think we will see him in many more movies in the future, if he wants to continue acting. This is the first movie I can truly recommend in a long long time.",5,0,4,5 June 2018
Get Out," Best horror movie I've ever seen!!
","Something is wrong from the very beginning. The opening scene shows a black guy being attacked and put in the trunk of a car. Then we meet Chris (amazingly played by Daniel Kaluuya), also a black guy, and his white girlfriend Rose. They're gonna go visit Rose's parents who lives in a secluded estate in the country. They are very friendly, almost too friendly. Except from Jeremy, Rose's creepy brother. The reason I'm mentioning race at all, is because it's an important part of the plot. Nothing is however as it seems at the estate. I can't say anything else without ruining it. But this is genius film-making. If a horror movie should ever get Academy Awards, for best script and best movie and best lead 'Get Out' is it.Everything from the way its filmed, to the music, to the acting, it's pure genius. It's mostly psychological horror, mixed with a little gore.A must see for horror fans that want intelligent adult horror, without cheap jump scares or clowns or annoying kids. But truly scary horror. Watch this. You will not regret it.",10,11,22,14 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Best one since the original.
","First one that is almost as much fun to watch as the original. EVery other sequrl before this one has been dreadfull. This is also the first movie with Johhny Depp, Ive seen since the original Pirates movie, where I didnt wanna strangle him for looking bored, constipated and half asleeo, phoning in his performance for a very big paycheck. Depp actualluy has fun here, which makes his performance that much better. He is not cunning and cool like he only ever was in the origfinal movie, but he IS Jack Sparrow. And that is a big compliment to him. This movie has the best special effects in the series so far. And I'm not talking about the young Jack Sparrow scene, which is also well done, but every movie these days has to show a younger version of one of the main character these days. And just like the others: Carrie Fisher. Kurt Russel and so on and so on, its a little creepy and a little fake looking. A young Robert Downey Jr. is the most convincing youth version of a character/actor yet. With Depp coming in as second. It is also nice to see a female lead played by Kaya Scodelario, who unlike the flat chested and no ass- Keira Knightley is actually sexy and a real woman. Ive never liked Keira Knightley. Ive always found her body repulsive and her acting wooden. She has that obnoxious smirk that Lena Headey also has, that makes them good at playing upper class british women and pretty much nothing else. Kaya Scodelario who is not beautiful like Keira Knightley all though easy on the eyes is a much better actress. The actor playing Will Turners son is nothing more than a discount version of Orlando Bloom. Who is also not a very good actor. *SPOILER AHEAD*This movie finally concludes the story of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. And Hector Barbossa I will not tell you how. Will and lizabeth is not in the movie much, but a post credit scene could make them the stars of the inevitable sequel. All though Disney should quit while theyre ahead.

Mission: Impossible II," Politically correct and boring
","Considering that this movie is made by John Woo, known for graphic violence, this is a very PG movie. Had they given Woo free reigns, like they did with Face Off, who knows, what kind of movie this might have been. I know that the M.I. movies are PG13. But this movie is the only one that feels like it's made for children and not adults. It is that bad. In this M.I. movie and only in this M.I. movie Hunt for some reason has a problem with killing people. Which means he acts out of character, compared to every other M.I. movie. Also, when people are shot, it's almost always happening off camera. Which is annoying as hell and reminds me of the awful fourth Indiana Jones movie. If the rating don't allow you to show people being shot, complete with bulletholes and blood, then don't have people being shot in your goddamn movie. I really hate the MPAA. They have ruined, what could have been so many good movies with their cencorship. Nyah is unattractive and too skinny and annoying. And the signifigant height differrence between Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott, makes it laughable that Scotts character can impersonate Cruises character just by wearing the famous masks and nobody can tell the difference, between the two.The plot is a joke. And besides from the last half hour of non stop action, this movie does not deserve to be a part of the M.I. franchise. And enough with the goddamn doughs. Do not watch this. you can easily skip it and enjoy the rest of the movies, without misssing out on anything.",1,4,7,13 January 2018
The Mummy Returns," An abomination
","Worst CGI ever: check Wooden acting; check Zero chemistry between Fraser and Weisz: check Zero chemistry between the annoying kid and his 'parents' check Most annoying kid ever, that I wanted to see dead from the first moment he showed up: check Actors having no fun this time around. Thery're just there to get paid: check Oded Fehr: worst actor ever, with the most ridiculous white teeth I've ever seen: check Even worse than Indiana Jones 4: checkOnly good thing is the stunning, sometimes half naked Rachel Weisz fighting and kicking ass. How Stephen Summers could muck this up after making an awesome original The Mummy and accept what was horrible CGI even 16 years ago, is beyond me. They must have had a much bigger budget and yet this comes of as so much cheaper looking than the original movie. Every action sequence falls flat and is ruined by horrible CGI. Just don't ever watch this. Stephen Summers and his CGI effects team should be taken outside and shot for making this turd of a movie.",1,0,3,16 June 2017
Mission: Impossible," Like watching a bad play.
","Considering how truly awful this movie is, itys a miracle, it ever became a franchise. And I love these movies. Up untill now I've always thought the second movie was the worst one. They didn't truly get it right until the third movie, which is still the best in the franchise.But back to the one that started it all. It sucks. Plain and simple. First of all, there is no action for the first half an hour. The team actually sits around a table and talk about how bad the coffee is. And Ethan is shown how some plastic explosives is disguised to look like chewing gum.The movie is filled with these scenes where the characters talk and talk and talk. And then talk some more. And the way its filmed, its like watching a bad play.
When the action finally comes its done really bad. You know how Tom Cruise always does his own stunts on location? Well not in this one. It's clearly done in front of a green screen with a big windmachine. And it looks awful, even for a movie from 1996.Considering it was directed by Brian Palma, who can do action very well, this feels like some amateur made for tv movie with a very low budget.You get the feeling from the very beginning of the movie, that they didnt know how to make the movie. Like they just edited some scenes together in a way that doesnt make much sense. The badguys are cliche. And they dress in long trench coats and hats like its a movie from the 1960's.I really wanted to like this movie, but I can not think of a single good thing to say about it. Im just glad Tom Cruise later on gained control of the franchise and pushed it in the right direction with lots of action and great stunts and great stories and great acting. Everything this movie don't have.",1,7,10,24 February 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Murder of fun
","Never has a director/slash actor staged himself more as the star in his own awful movie. He is litterally in every shot of the movie. With the most ridicoulus over the top moustache I have ever seen. And the fakest sounding french accent ever. And never has a cast of that many famous stars, acted more wooden and dull. They all look extremely bored and uncomfortable. And the 'acting' spands from looking as bored as the audience to acting way too theatrical ilike they're in a bad play. I hate Kenneth Brannagh. I hate the way this movie is filmed, like its a play on a stage and not a movie. I hate how fake it looks, everytime theyre 'outside' the train, clearly filmed in front of a bluescreen, no visible breath and lighting that dont match the background. This movie is incredibly boring and as about as much fun as watching paint dry. And the awful, constipated, old looking Johnny Depp, really needs to retire. The last time I saw him act well, was in Donnie Brasco, a 21 year old movie. I'm as sick of him as I am of Brad Pitt. Theyre both a couple of old douchebags, that only gets parts, because their names still sell movie tixkets for some strange reason.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.",1,4,8,20 May 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," Meh...
","I had zero expectations, before watching it, based on all the shitty reviews.Dakota Johnson is actually pretty with a very nice body. And I enjoyed seeing her naked alot. Since it's not possible to give zero stars on imdb anyway, that one star goes to her body. The acting is not as horrible as I expected. But certainly not impressive either. There is chemistry between the two leads. Why people say there isnt any, I dont know. The movie is not PG13 either as I expected it to be. Having finally seen Fifty shits of crap, I can understand why women enjoy this. As a man however I was pretty bored.Why Anastasia put up with Christians behaviour and the way he treats her, his BDSM-needs and pretty much everything else is hard to believe.Anastasia being a virgin, when meeting Christian (even though she's an american) is also hard to believe. Her not knowing what butt plugs are and appearently having never watched porn either, is also unbelievable.Those scenes where he gets mad about her visiting her parents and actually follows her there, would have made any sane woman break up with him. Just as the ridicoulus contract as well as him saying he will pretend to be her boyfriend one night per week. What the hell is his problem?? Yeah, yeah Ive read about his troubled childhood and the woman who had him as a BDSM slave for 6 years. But that does not justify Christian being a complete asshole to Anastasia. Why women would be turned on by someone treating ther that way, I have no idea. But Anastasia does put up with it. Untill the very end of the movie anyway. Where he whips her ass cheecks six times and she suddenly has had enough and leaves him. She puts up with his dominant abusive attitude during the entire film, but him whipping her is appearently too much?? 
 
Avoid this unless youre a dumb middle aged housewife, that finds this more interesting than actual porn. No men should ever watch it. Not even to please their girlfriends or wifes.",1,2,5,8 February 2018
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen tries to copy Almodovar and fails miserably!!!
","Do not believe the 7 stars this movie gets. I'm guessing this is enjoyed by Americans that are too lazy for subtitles and they accept this politically correct lame attempt at copying Pedro Almodovar. The reason I compare the two directors is because this movie takes place almost entirely in Spain, it has Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in it. And the plot could have been fun had the master Almodovar directed it. Let's pretend that this was actually made by Almodovar. No annoying narrator. The two American girls would have went with Javier on his friends plane without Hall judging him and turning him down. They would have had sex in a passionate threesome and the girls would have shown their tits (or in Rebecca Halls case, lack of tits) and Javier would have sucked on them. Penelope would have shown up and one of the girls (Hall) would have ended up dead. And the others would have buried her and maybe gotten away with it. There would have been lots of Spanish dishes with references to sex. The characters would have acted immorally. Sex and lust and desire would have been what have driven the story forward. And it would have been fun to watch. In Allens movie the so called sex-scenes are reduced to kissing, one time in slo-mo (what the hell Allen??) And after the sex which is always skipped the women cover up their tits from the man they just had sex with. Oh and apparently in Spain artists are rich and successful. As one of Javiers artist friends own a small plane. And of course Javier can fly it and lives in a very nice villa and he has a sportscar. It's ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the fact that Scarletts character just accepts it when Javier brings home ihis psychotic ex girlfriend who tried to kill him. A normal girl would have packed her bags and left. But not only does Scarlett stay. The three of them eventually becomes lovers until Scarlett gets restless for no reason at all, except that that is how her character is suppose to be and leaves them. So Hall can come back into the Picture with Javier.Come on, Allen, that's just poor writing. It's also bigot and racist the way Spanish people are portrayed as irresponsible passionate people who only care about sex and never about the consequenses. Yes that is also how they behave in Almod처vars movies, but its in a bizare yuniviverse and it's pure comedy. This movie however tries to come off as a serious drama. Where the uptight Americans in the movie are the ones acting like people should be acting. The fact that Javier and Cruzes characters have that love/hate relationship, Means that they will never be happy. According to Allen. But at least they have passion and are alive, unlike the boring Americans. What made it possible for me to suffer through this snooze fest, is the stunning Johannson and absolutely beautiful Cruz. The chemistry between Javier and Johansson and between Javier and Cruz is amazing and very real. Hall, however, is too tall, flat chested, boring and annoying and the kind of woman I would slap around as she's judgmental bitch from the get-go of the movie. Her character was not needed and had she not been in in the movie, it would have been more fun. Also the fact that Hall and Johansson are best friends as they're complete opposites, is not believable. Also they're clearly at different stages in their life and Hall seems to be 10 years older than Scarlett. Avoid this and watch Jamon Jamon instead by Almodovar. And also with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, only with passionate sex scenes, Spanish food, horny people behaving irresponsibly and lots of fun.",Null,1,1,30 May 2017
Annihilation," What the hell?????
","This movie is total garbage. Aside from the eyecandy: Natalie Portman and swedish Tuva Novotny, nothing can save this weird mess. *SPOILERS AHEAD'Lena (Portman) is locked up and questioned by a man in in a contamination suit about what happened inside the shimmer. I get to that later. Flashback to Lena at home crying over her supposedly dead husband. We see flashbacks to them having sex. The husband shows up, but he acts weird and out of character. Later he gets sick. On the way to the hospital the ambulance is attacked by masked men who take Lena and her husband with them. Lena wakes up in a prisoncell inside some mysterious governement facility. Her husband is dying. And she goes with some other women into 'the shimmer'. Some portal to another world, much like the portal in 'Stranger Things. Some of the women have been in the facility for months or years. They are being held their against their will. Or so it seems. And theyre fine with that. Theyre not asking questions, theyre not trying to escape.. They just accept being captives there. And they accept going into the Shimmer, knowing all former expeditions have dissapeared. And later as it turtns out, they have all been killed. This makes no sense what so ever. In the shimmer all the women lose track of time and have collective amnesia. They find weird animals and bushes that looks like they were once human. One of the women is killed by a weird animal. The women start to turn on eachother. More of them are killed. During all this we see Lena in flashbacks. cheating on her husband with some black guy. Who he is and why she cheats on her husband is never explained. Evventually Lena gets to some lighthouse, that is the goal of the expedition. She finds a videocamera where she sees her husband killing himself with a grenade. Then a clone of him appears in the video. Inside the lighthouse is a tunnel to a cave. Inside the cave she finds the womant hat had her and her husband abducted to the facility. a. Some weird crap happens. And a humanoid creature apppears out of nowhere. It follows her out of the cave. And it start to change its appearance and it clones Lena. Lena makes it hold a grenade that kills it (I think) At that point the movie is beyond grotesque. Lena escapes and somehow makes it back. Atthe end she is reunited with her husband. We see them hug and we see Lena's eyes are not human eyes. Wether its the creature or her being turned into an alien by the creature is never explained.This movie is goddamn bullcrap!! Avoid it if you dont like to be messed with and feel like taking a mental shower afterwards. Also avoid it if you dont wanna waste your time on pretentious weird crap.",1,16,30,18 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Much better than Prometheus
","Hear me out. I hate Prometheus. I absolutely hate it. And I still hate Ridley Scott for abusing his power in Hollywood to prevent Neil Blomkamp from making his direct sequel to Aliens. That having been said, Alien Covenant (despite being a sequel to the shitty Prometheus, only loved by wannabe-intellectual movie snobs, who hate Aliens and the whole franchise) is actually a good movie. Possibly Ridley Scotts first good movie since his original Alien. I am not a fan of Scotts movies. Except from Body of lies (which is more because I used to be a Leo fan) and Thelma and Louise, the man has made nothing but shitty movies. Including Gladiator and Blade Runner. However this movie cater to us fans that love Aliens. Despite the arrogant Scott denouncing Camerons masterpiece as well as all the other Alien sequels. This movie has the Xenomorphs, it has gory deaths, excellent special effects and great action. And it can be seen without having to suffer through Prometheus. It works as a stand alone movie, despite being a sequel. What it does lack is memorable characters making smart decisions. And that is just not good enough from Scott of all people. He should know better when he acts like a spoiled little boy who wont share his favorite toy (Alien) and wont recognize that other boys has bigger toys (talent) than him. We all know and love Ripley, Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez and Bishop in Aliens. In Covenant however, I cant remember a single characters name, nor did I care when they died horribly. Which means that Cameron way back in 1986, was a better director than Scott. And still would be if he stopped making those shitty Avatar sequels and returned to dark gritty violent scifi. The reason Covenant, only gets 4 stars, is because of Scotts arrogance. Which is shown when there is no alien queen. And the aliens themselves are 'man' made. Or actually made by a synthetic, who has gone psycho. This is retarded. As well as the flute scene with two synthetics and the homo erotic kiss. Despite these things this movie is still much better than the abomination Alien 3. And the best alien movie since Alien 4. If you havent seen Prometheus and you just dont expect too much, Covenant is an enjoyable R-rated violent scifi movie, which is nice to see when all we get these years are PG13 superhero movies.",4,2,4,10 February 2018
