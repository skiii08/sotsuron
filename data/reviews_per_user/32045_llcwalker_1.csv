Hereditary," REALLY?
","I rarely dislike a movie, But when I left the theatre, I felt like asking for my money back. It started strong and had 1 good horror scene, but at least 4 times I was aware it was really dragging and I kept waiting for it to 'tie together in the end', but when it did end...I just said NO....this can't be the ending....really dumb./laughable..hard to imagine anyone previewed this without suggesting a rewrite. Thank goodness for the acting, so I didn't hate it til near the end.",1,4,9,27 June 2018
