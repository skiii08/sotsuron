The Incredible Hulk," prefer previous Hulk by Ang Lee
","I am usually open and don't look for too much logic in this kind of movies but after seeing rating on this site I decided to make my own comment...First of all this is not a bad movie and is quite fun with actors i really respect, but i can't help the feeling the story is not interesting enough with lot of pointless scenes just to show more CGI... All the relations between characters are just weak and u don't feel anything just want to see the end of movie, the final fight which is for me not satisfying.I think Ang Lee added a special touch (more psychology) to the previous Hulk and maybe that was the reason why it was so criticised. For me this new version is on the same level as Fantastic 4 and I was truly disappointed...I hope Louis Leterrier will show more of his talent on the forthcoming remake Clash of the Titans, favourite movie of my childhood!",7,1,4,14 June 2009
