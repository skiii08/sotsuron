The Blair Witch Project," Excellent Film, that relies on your imagination for the horror
","I saw this film late last night and let me tell you... It spooked me.  The filmmakers do a very good job of making this look like an amateur documentary like it is supposed to be, even to the point of the shaking camera.  The movie follows the final days of 3 young students on their trek through the woods to film a documentary on 'Blair Witch' and when they get lost, everything goes downhill from there... I am not going to tell a lot for it would ruin the whole ambiance of the film, but I will tell you 3 things:  1.  If you are in the mood for gore, this is not a film for you. 2. If you want a good scary movie that makes you think, this is the film. 3.  There is no music, but the sound is the true villain....  I highly recommend this film.",5,2,3,18 July 1999
