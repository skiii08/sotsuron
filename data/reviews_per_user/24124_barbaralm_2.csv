The Ring," Creepfest falls short of the mark
","This is the second of two films that have had me sleeping with the lights on.  The other, in case you're curious, is 'The Sixth Sense.'  But that is about all the two films have in common.Where 'Sense' had an excellent plot and superb acting, 'Ring' has plot holes big enough to drive a semi through.  Much of the backstory involving the Morgans and their evil adopted child, Samara, is ambiguous.  We're supposed to know that Samara's bad but we don't know why or how she got that way.The entire film appears to have been shot through a blue-green filter, which does make for some interesting cinematography at times but later becomes a distraction.  The shots of Samara's victims are suitably creepy, as is Samara's own demise at her mother's hands.The acting is pretty good, with Naomi Watts proving she can carry a film. Daveigh Chase is not nearly as frightening as some other evil children in films past (notably Damien from 'The Omen').'Sense' had scenes that literally made me jump out of my chair; 'Ring' did not.  As remakes go, it's all right but not spectacular.",Null,1,2,2 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A masterpiece in filmmaking
","The sequel that is better than its predecessor is rare in Hollywood.  But from the main titles to the end credits, every frame of 'RotK' is perfect. This film is an absolute masterpiece.  Jackson's obvious love for Tolkien's work shines through in every frame of this film as well as through 'Fellowship' and 'Two Towers.'  Jackson could write a book about the making of this trilogy and it would become required study material in film schools.Of course, the director of any films relies on his actors to convey the emotions and reactions to what is going on around them.  Elijah Wood gives a stunning performance; we actually feel his pain as he staggers through Mordor to Mount Doom.  But the film's standout performance belongs to Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee.  Meek and shy in 'Fellowship' and protective and brave in 'Towers', Sam becomes a man of action in 'Return'.  From his battles with Gollum to taking on Shelob to save Frodo, to taking on Orcs in Mordor, Sam is true to his purpose: to watch over Frodo.  Astin's performance is simply perfect.  Why the Academy chose to ignore this for the 2004 Oscars is beyond my comprehension.Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn ably takes on the task of transforming a wanderer into a King.  Lending support are Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Pippin, who face battle for the first time in their lives.  In particular, Boyd's palpable fear before the battle of Minas Tirith as well as his heroic efforts to save a dying Faramir prove his mettle as an actor.The battle scenes in this film are beyond description.  The ride of the Rohirrim is jaw-dropping, as is the final confrontation at the Black Gate. And never does Jackson allow the multiple SFX and CGI shots to interfere with the story or with the acting.And finally, tribute must be paid to the man who is ultimately responsible for it all: J.R.R. Tolkien.  It took him 12 years to create Middle-Earth and to write the 'Rings', which is the touchstone of all fantasy novels.  The novels and their sequels in themselves represent an achievement in literature and Jackson faithfully adapts them to the screen, resulting in an unparalleled achievement in moviemaking.",10,0,2,2 February 2004
