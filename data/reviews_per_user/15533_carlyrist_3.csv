The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Shining moments, but overall dull (from a fan of the books)
","When I read Mockingjay, I really liked all the character development that happened in the first half of the book. Seeing it translated to screen was disappointing and boring. Jennifer Lawrence stole the movie once again with her phenomenal acting, but I thought that Katniss's character was handled poorly. Her PTSD was prevalent in the book and here it only took hold in a couple of scenes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the other standout for me, giving depth to Plutarch. I especially enjoyed the scene where he is in command while being bombed, as he brought real emotion to that scene. Apart from those two, I thought the acting was overall flat. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth both had strong moments, but for a lot of the film they paled in comparison to Lawrence. I also didn't like how they put Effie in district 13. She felt awkward and it made me uncomfortable rather than making me laugh. I was also disappointed with how Finnick was replaced by Gale in many of his scenes with Katniss. Finnick and Katniss had a really great bond in the book as two of the only people who understand what they are going through and a lot of that was lost by the script and by Sam Claflin's on-and-off performance. There were shining moments, such as Katniss singing 'The Hanging Tree' and the bombing of District 8. I also liked that they let the audience see the rescue of Peeta and the others. However, Peeta's clearly CGI weight loss was sloppy and annoying. And, other than a few scenes, the movie was mostly just people talking which is not what we come to the Hunger Games to see. I enjoyed it in the books, but it didn't translate well on screen. It was also frustrating that despite the fact that they are making two movies when they only need one, they still could not fit in many important scenes from the book. Overall, this was the weakest movie to date and I can only hope that Mockingjay Part 2 provides the epic finale we are all hoping for.",6,16,29,24 November 2014
The Theory of Everything," Wonderful Performances All Around
","This movie is definitely worth seeing, if only for the performances given by the talented cast, led by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. The performance that Redmayne gives blew me away. The physicality that he brought to the role was incredible. The way he made his lips twitch in the most subtle and effective ways was honestly captivating and he showed the pain of what Hawking went through in such a real way. I didn't know much of the story of Hawking's life going into the movie, so I didn't really know what Jones' role would be. However, her performance equaled Redmayne's in every way. Her pain was so real and the conflict she felt was evident and touching. I had tears in my eyes for the majority of the film. There were parts of the movie that bothered me slightly, such as the clich√© way they showed Hawking getting his ideas and the sequence at the end where he imagines that he can stand. However, those small bits are quickly forgotten thanks to the incredible performances given by the actors. The awards recognition is well deserved and I hope that this leads to big things for both Redmayne and Jones.",9,0,1,29 December 2014
Jurassic World," Solid Fun
","I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. I've only seen the original, which I thoroughly enjoy, but I had heard that the sequels were terrible. Because of that, I did not expect this one to deliver anything special in terms of plot or character. With a dinosaur movie, there's only so much you can do and, as this was intended to give the franchise new life, it is unsurprising that they would ignore plot and character in favor of really cool dinosaurs. And after seeing the movie, I was totally okay that they did. Yes, we had seen the stock characters before, but they were likable enough and didn't detract from the movie at all. In fact, I really liked Chris Pratt's Owen and his deep care for the animals he worked with and his paternal nature. I also really enjoyed the genetic modification aspect of it because it did ring true to our society where we are so easily bored and demand more without thinking about consequences. Apart from that, I liked the dinosaurs. It was a fun run away from the monster movie that delivered on the action. While there was nowhere near as much suspense as in the first movie, that did not make it unenjoyable. In particular, seeing the film in IMAX, the final showdown did not disappoint. All in all, if you're looking for an unique plot or great character development, this is not the movie to watch. However, it did succeed in being a fun summer blockbuster, which is exactly what it should have been.",7,6,15,25 July 2015
