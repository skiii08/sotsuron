Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Why would anyone watch this?
","It's already awful that because of Stephanie Meyer's ridiculous book everything and everyone is VAMPIRED. Vampires playing baseball is one stupid thing but an American President, a historical icon and hero being a vampire hunter? Is Hollywood really that low now? I rather read the stupid fifty shades of Grey book than watch this crap! Just because the CGI is good and the story is almost not bad, it does not give people the right to make Abe Lincoln a ridiculous character. The guy has a memorial for Christ sake! I'll bet he can't sleep in his grave because of this movie. Vampires... give me a break. The next movie will be about a werewolf trying to kill Abe Lincoln to stop getting his 13th Amendement trough? Or that John Wilkes Booth was a werewolf? Just, please, I beg you: STOP!",Null,5,9,28 April 2014
Captain Marvel," Can't wait for endgame
","I really liked this movie. I liked ms Larson in this movie. Her acting wasn't stiff and she wasn't angry the entire time. Her story was complicated and turned out really good. She plays this confident woman, even though she can't remember her past, it isn't holding her back by it like Logan and fights with spirit. Her only weakness was the Kree and she is stronger than everything she went through. It's a great movie. Brie is a badass.",10,4,18,8 April 2019
