Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Fantastic!
","If you haven't seen the Volume 1, RENT it before seeing this movie, or you will be LOST.  This is what Quentin's all about - uniqueness.  You will NEVER be able to say 'oh, that movie reminds me of 'x' movie...' with QT movies.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 is no different.  I dont have to go on a long spiel about it, just know the movie is very entertaining, all questions are explained that may have arisen in Volume 1, and Uma Thurman absolutely kicks ass.In advance, I'm sure there will be at least one guy that says 'that movie sucked,' to which I would reply:  If you enjoy QT movies, which are a genre all to themself, and you DONT like this movie, then you should consider yourself NOT good source for opinion, as you lack imagination, humor, and a certain level of depth required to completely appreciate this movie. Everyone else will love it!",10,1,2,16 April 2004
