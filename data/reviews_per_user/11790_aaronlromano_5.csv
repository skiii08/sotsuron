The Perks of Being a Wallflower," All I Can Say Is That It Was Wonderful
","I read the novel in high school and as of now, I am in my freshman year of college. Having loved it when I read the book, I felt some trepidation about the movie but went to see it all the same. The film is incredible; all of the actors did a wonderful job with Ezra Miller as a highlight. Patrick is one of the most believable gay characters ever created and being a gay teenager about his age, it was wonderful for there to finally be a character out there for me to really connect with. Miller nails his performance. Lehrman was also wonderful as Charlie paired with an even better Emma Watson as his damaged heart-throb. The whole movie was wonderful, if not wholly perfect, and I definitely recommend it. There can probably also be something gained by watching it not long after high school. No one really likes high school, but this movie set me to viewing high school memories through rose colored glasses.",8,1,2,13 February 2013
Chinatown," A Cinematic Slug to the Gut
","Of the films this reviewer has seen (and that is quite a lot) this film is one of the select few to come as near to cinematic excellence as possible. From the first shot to the infamous final line, you belong to Polanski; in his hands for the whole ride - and those hands, I think it safe to say, are the hands of a master. The film features a phenomenal cast with Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, the beautiful Faye Dunaway as femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray and the excellent director John Huston in an acting role as one of the most horrifying villains in the history of cinema: Noah Cross. Now this is one of those films where little of the plot can be revealed because it's all just far too complicated BUT it's also a film you aren't likely to ever forget. Ever. With beautiful cinematography, a heart- pounding story line, fantastic acting and one of the most atrociously heart-rending finales this reviewer has ever seen, this film is an absolute must. My rating 10/10",10,9,14,1 August 2012
Au Revoir les Enfants," A Beautiful Tragedy
","I'm writing this review primarily as a means to decompress after just finishing the film. First off, the film was beautiful, probably one of Louis Malle's most beautiful films and has just toppled 'Murmur of the Heart' as my favorite Louis Malle film. The film made me weep openly and unabashedly in front of my roommates (perhaps I'd be embarrassed if they weren't also weeping)and I am weeping still as I write this. I'm too emotional to even think of anything else to say other than it is an amazing film and utterly timeless. Whether or not you are Louis Malle fan, I urge you to watch this film, it is important and very much a masterpiece.",10,1,2,3 October 2013
Barry Lyndon," A Grossly Unacknowledged Masterpiece
","Having been a great fan of Kubrick's meager but stunning output (it's quality, not quantity) I of course resolved to see all of his films. Barry Lyndon was one that I had not heard of before and from inquiries, found that few people had heard of it either. Not knowing it that was I good or bad thing, I picked up the film and gave it a watch. What I found was one of the few films I have ever given a perfect rank. The film grants sumptuous viewing from start to finish with perfectly framed and elegant shots, stunning costumes and fine acting. Know that this is not like any other Kubrick (which is partly why I believe it's relatively looked over), but that his trademark brilliance is there. His perfectionism permeates the film and of course creates the only possible outcome - something perfect. In spite of none of the characters being necessarily likable (there are anti-heroes and villains abound) they resonate greatly, bringing much emotion to the film. The scenery also is beautiful; even in the film's slowest moments one can not pull one's eyes from the screen. Kubrick has certainly created a work of brilliance in this one and it may perhaps be one of his best films. If you do enjoy Kubrick's body of work, be sure and find yourself a copy. You will not regret it. 10/10.",10,1,2,8 September 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Sheer Charm!
","Wes Anderson's latest delivers a beautiful and sweet depiction of first love. The film, with its whimsical humor conveys the tale of twelve-year- old lovers Sam and Suzy perfectly. The children who deliver great performances as youngsters bumbling through their first romance are surrounded by a fantastic cast which includes Frances McDormand, Bill Murray (whom is always best directed by Anderson), Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton as Social Services. I have heard many complaints of the kissing scene which has already had much buzz of discomfort, but in reality the scene is very touching and sweet in its awkward innocence. This film, which admittedly is a tale of puppy love, is beautiful, charming, and simply very sweet. It is most certainly Mr. Anderson's best work to date and it is a must see! My rating 10/10",10,2,4,13 August 2012
