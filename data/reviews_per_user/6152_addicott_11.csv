Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More subtle than Volume 1 (what isn't?) yet almost as much fun.
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is by far my favorite movie in recent memory. I've seen it 4 times and I still love every second. I love it for its outstanding boldness and relentless intensity.Volume 2 is quite different from volume 1  that should be a given. Originally conceived as a single movie, one shouldn't expect the second half to mirror the first, especially when it's written and directed by Tarrantino. Don't expect another sassy knife fight or Kung-Fu bloodbath  expect the unexpected.This pertains especially to the pacing. Volume 1 was fast and furious but Volume 2 is more contemplative. There's more word play than sword play and all the characters get ample room to blossom... before they are killed.Everyone is colorful and amusing. Tarrantino has a way of simultaneously building fondness and contempt for the players, such that when one heavy back-stabs another, you feel a mix of elation and annoyance. Go ahead and like someone, but don't get too attachedKill Bill is brimming with great performances, any one of which would single-handedly carry an average movie. Michael Madsen is Budd, Bill's estranged brother. (The two have a complicated relationship.) Although he appears to have gone tender, Budd is not to be under-estimated! Larry Bishop is hilarious as the sleazeball boss of the strip club where Budd is slumming as a bouncer. Darryl Hannah plays Ellie Driver, a truly bitchy villain you'll love to hate.David Carradine is the charismatic Bill. (aka: The Snake Charmer) In the opening sequence of Volume 1, we saw him at his very worst but most of the time he is surprisingly pleasant to be around. But by his own admission he is a murdering bastard and he seems to have a knack for royally pissing people off. We see this with his former mentor Hattori Hanzo, his brother Buddy, and most especially the film's protagonist, The Bride (played of course by Uma Thurman).Uma continues to dazzle as she did in the first volume. Seldom has a heroine been cast in so many different lights. Depending on the scene, she can look plain or glamorous, confident or vulnerable, exuberant or despondent. Her moods go all over the map but they're always convincing.There's a few very cool dual roles. Gordon Liu played the 'Crazy 88' commander from Vol. 1 and in real life he's the fight choreographer. In Vol. 2, he plays Pai Mei, a lonesome hermit who is the high priest of all martial arts. (Apparently Tarrantino dubbed the voice in Cantonese!) It's highly amusing to watch him put Uma through her paces. (This sequence also helps to illustrate how Uma's character became the deadliest woman in the world and is able to prevail in one particularly hopeless situation.) You won't even recognize Michael Parks, who was the Texas Ranger in Vol. 1.Volume 2 relies heavily on dialog. This has always been an exceptionally strong point for Tarrantino and he comes through as strong as ever in this picture. It takes some strain, however, to reconcile the more cerebral high of Volume 2 with the sensational absence of subtlety in Volume 1. You have to shift mental gears to appreciate the entire package. It's well worth the effort.",9,1,2,23 March 2008
28 Weeks Later," A worthy vehicle for the near-invincible rage virus!
","After a second viewing on DVD, this sequel really grew on me. At the theater, I was put off by what I thought at the time were absurdities in the plot. The incompetence of the U.S. military brass seemed too absolute to be believed. But when I think about it, a little disconnect can go a long way, especially when you're dealing with a beast like this virus.This film is not a simple rehash of it's predecessor - it spins it's own yarn. While the horror elements are undeniable, Weeks is structured more like a disaster movie. The first act provides plenty of buildup and foreshadowing. I don't think I'll be giving much away if I say that at a certain point, things proceed less than perfectly. The writing is solid enough that I felt for the characters. Certain scenes delivered extra dramatic and/or tragic weight and there were many visual images that suitably conveyed the most ghastly of occasions.Following an original breakout like 28 Days Later is a thankless task. If not quite as bold and original, Weeks acquits itself well, successfully maintaining my fascination with the overall scenario established in Days. If sensational bleakness is what you crave in your entertainment, this franchise is hard to beat.",8,1,3,19 March 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Hauntingly beautiful, subtle and engrossing.
","This is one of those rare movies that takes on a life of it's own. The cinematography & direction transcend average competence to blend seamlessly with the script, adding textures and moods as rich as any novelist's prose.The cast is excellent. Brad Pitt is in familiar territory as the charismatic but treacherous Jesse James. Casey Affleck delivers a very complex and courageous performance in the not so flattering part of the coward Robert Ford. Sam Shepard, Sam Rockwell and Jeremy Renner round out a rock-solid lineup.An action thriller this is not. The plot is very unhurried, but with a bit of patience, you will be rewarded with a complex and fascinating tale. This is one of the most sumptuous-looking, natural-feeling movies I have ever seen.",10,4,9,7 April 2008
The Mist," Quality horror - what a concept!
","Let me start by saying I think The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both vastly overrated. They're solid competent films, definitely a 7 out of 10, but the greatest ever made? No way!! So now you how I feel about this writer/director combination, going in to this film.My expectations were modest, and they were greatly exceeded. This is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time! I would rank it up with Misery and The Shining as the best of the Stephen King adaptations.I found myself very much drawn in to the story, very uncertain and fascinated by what would happen to the protagonists. The obviously-computer-generated monsters didn't spoil things too much because ultimately their menace proves to be secondary. Director Frank Darabont has the good sense to allow strong writing and acting to trump the slightly-above-average special effects.Thomas Jane is well-cast in the lead. I don't quite buy him as an artist, but he is very effective as the slightly vulnerable alpha male, trying to get himself and his young son out of a nasty predicament. Marcia Gay Harden plays one of the most odious villains you will ever see on screen, every bit as loathsome as Kathy Bates in Misery.For the two hours this movie ran, time was suspended for me. What more can you ask from a film of this type? I won't spoil the ending, but I do need to thank Frank Darabont for not ruining the tone of the piece, the way they do with so many other films.",9,3,7,9 April 2008
I Am Legend," No 28 Days Later, but much better than Omega Man.
","Of course, that's not saying a whole lot. Low as the bar was, Will Smith's version raises it with ease, with better acting and much better production design. (Always helpful when the deserted city is at least as important a character as the protagonist.)I was impressed by how quick and morose the hordes of the infected are. Though they look a bit digital, I still say they're much more effective than so many idiots in white makeup and sunglasses.This movie was surprisingly well-paced. They took great pains to establish a tangible eerie stillness, which in turn set the audience up nicely for the inevitable outbursts of activity.I was pleased to see the climax didn't spoil the tone of the movie. And yet, the overall package was only moderately convincing. The narrative lies somewhere between empty calories and world-class fiction. Since I'm a sucker for all things post-apocalyptic, I'm glad I checked this title out. If not the creme de la creme, it certainly could have been much worse.",7,0,1,18 March 2008
Kelly's Heroes," Clint who?
","I thought I'd seen most of Clint Eastwood's stuff. This title of his is more obscure and after watching it, I can see why.Clint doesn't stand out very well in this ensemble cast. They don't give him so much as a single devastating one-liner - just flat dialog. Everyone else steals his thunder. If you look at this as a Telly Savalas / Don Rickles / Carroll O'Connor / Donald Sutherland vehicle, your expectations may be better served. The above mentioned names are all great talents in their own right and they make the comic relief suitably potent. This would be the film's greatest asset.This film does boast some impressive action sequences, rendered almost too realistically for what is supposed to be a screwball comedy.My biggest gripe might be the soundtrack. Could the song they use for the opening and closing sequence possibly be more corny?? It's hard to get in a WWII frame of mind when the audio is SCREAMING 'late '60's'. (All those expensive locations, props and costumes, ruined by some idiot with a guitar...)Overall, it's not that bad, but it's certainly nothing great. The modern remake Three Kings is funnier, more exciting and even manages to sport a conscience without spoiling the rest of the package. And, very much unlike this flick, the stars are all utilized to their greatest potential.",6,2,3,31 March 2008
Children of Men," My pick for best of decade.
","This is a truly stunning, groundbreaking, masterful piece of film. They'll be talking about this one 50 years from now, analyzing it in film school for its radical yet ultra-effective direction. Director Alfonso Cuaron has created a masterpiece.Clive Owen rises to new heights as the bedraggled protagonist. Chiwetel Ejiofor stands out as the sinister rebel leader - this film established him as one of my favorites. And check out Michael Caine playing a hippie with such aplomb, it's one of his best performances ever!You could say Blade Runner was the Children Of Men of the '80s or Apocalypse Now was the Children Of Men of the '70s. It's that deep, it's that solid, it's that freaky, it's that bleak. All the while, it's one of the more compelling tales of personal redemption I've ever seen. And the events that unfold (in the world as portrayed) are beyond biblical in their gravity. What a yarn...If anything else this decade tops this, I can't wait to see it!",10,5,12,14 February 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tremendous fun!!
","Let me just get one thing out there: this movie kicks ass!!! That thought repeated through my head many times as I leaned back in my seat, eyebrows raised, and took in the film for the first time.There is little in the way of emotional attachment. That might be for the best. While you can certainly empathize at times, Uma Therman's character 'The Bride' (a.k.a. Black Mamba) seems mighty grim as she pursues a quest of revenge against her former colleagues.The plot, like the title, is laughable. Black Mamba gets ambushed on her wedding day. She survives, drafts a hit list 5 names long and sets out to get her revenge.So how could such a simple storyline with limited emotional involvement turn into 3 hours worth of sheer movie bliss? Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, that's how! The genius is in the details. There's an abundance of nasty surprises that will challenge your tolerance and keep you wide awake. The slower interludes are loaded with tension, intrigue and humor.No one's lovable, but everyone is memorable. Uma Thurman is terrific in the lead. You see her character from a few different aspects. Usually she's nasty and pitiless. Occasionally she's cute. At one point she has an outburst of grief that's pretty riveting. Lucy Liu is great as O-ren Ishi, the boss of the Tokyo underworld. While obviously lethal, she somehow maintains this beautifully elegant, almost fragile presence, all decked out in her kimono. Her henchmen are colorful and imposing, like the earlier James Bond heavies. Bill (David Carradine) is genuinely mysterious, all the more so because they haven't shown his face yet.And then there's the action. The combat is phenomenal in its execution and mind-numbing in its scope. Just when you think that has GOT to be it, they keep piling it on. One sequence is the new Mt. Everest of Kung Fu. Seriously. That alone is more than enough to keep this film on the map. Be warned: it's not harmless Jackie Chan-style slapstick combat. The blood and gore is overwhelming.As you would expect, the music selections are devastatingly cool, and they come from all over the map. There's '70s funk. Pan flute w/ orchestra. Tex Mex. A Japanese schoolgirl power trio. You name itIt's not just the music that's eclectic. Kill Bill is a very vivid fusion of American, Chinese and Japanese genres. (At least these are the most visible elements  bear in mind that Tarantino seems to have seen every movie ever made anywhere.) The Japanese settings are stunning, and there's an entire segment beautifully done in a Japanese animation style called anime. This degree of savvy and reverence for the region is extremely rare among Western filmmakers.All these elements are combined with great virtuosity to form a supremely entertaining movie thrill ride. You never know what's going to hit next, but whatever it is, it is likely to saturate the senses and challenge the brain. I didn't want for it to end, but I must admit: that level of intensity for 3 whole hours would be a bit much. So I can understand why they split it into two installments. Some people bitch about the severance, but I enjoyed volume 1 enough to see it twice and I can't wait to go shell out more dough and see volume 2.Most American action films indulge in their gratuitous carnage behind a veil of contrived morality. This has come to irritate me enough to turn me off the genre. One thing I find very refreshing in Kill Bill is the absence of such pretense. It's all thrills and spills; no apologies, no disguises, no lectures.Critics who object to this film seem to do so because it fails to pander to their various expectations. Here's a little news flash, people: it's Quentin Tarantino. If you go in expecting a repetition of his previous work or a movie that is in any way conventional and/or predictable, you're going to be disappointed  and you deserve to be. I went expecting something bold, exciting and original, with plenty of violence and a few surprises. I couldn't have been more delighted.",10,1,3,23 March 2008
30 Days of Night," The visuals are more memorable than the story.
","I enjoyed this film as a quick empty-calories excursion. I was very impressed by the look and mood throughout. Kudos to the cinematographer for lots of very powerful, stark images. This isolated Arctic town is a pretty cool setting for a yarn like this - very original.Alas, the story didn't knock me out the way was hoping it might. With an elemental struggle like this one, there's plenty of dramatic potential. That makes it all the more disappointing when said potential isn't realized. I'm assuming that the graphic novel was way hip but this movie feels like it lost its way somewhere at one of the script meetings.But then, I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. So I give it a 7. It didn't sweep me off my feet but I was entertained. Josh Hartnett was very solid, by the way (though maybe a bit young for a sheriff).",7,1,1,6 March 2008
There Will Be Blood," A bit self-indulgent but quite engrossing at times.
","In his director commentary track on Boogie Nights (still his masterpiece in my books) Paul Thomas Anderson talked about making the movie for himself. No pandering - no compromises. I applaud that approach from any artist, but it seems that Paul gets WAY more 'into' certain scenes, & sub-plots than I ever will be! I would usually pick a 'director's cut' in a heartbeat, but with this director, maybe a 'studio-mandated cut' could be a good thing.PTA always gets off to a roaring start and this film is no exception! I found the first three quarters to be utterly fascinating. The silver mining scenes established a sense of toil like nothing else I've ever seen. The desert landscape becomes a potent if silent character. And the score was very refreshing (in a bleak, psychotic sort of way). For 2 hours, I was transported.HERE'S THE SPOILER I really didn't care for the epilogue. It seemed disjointed, melodramatic and redundant. Daniel beating Eli to death seemed to me like a metaphor for the storyteller beating this story to death. OKAY, Danny's a sociopath, WE GET IT!!Don't get me wrong. I'm still a Paul Thomas Anderson fan and Daniel Day-Lewis was undeniably superb. The film was exceptional but not iconic in the way so many reviewers would have one believe.",8,1,5,14 February 2008
La Vie En Rose," A genuinely moving biography.
","I don't think I'll be spoiling anything if I reveal that in a later scene, we see Edith sing 'Je Ne Regrette Rien' and it's a moment powerful enough to put a lump in my throat.Biography films so often fall into that boring formulaic quagmire, it takes a lot to get me interested in the genre. It's very impressive, the way La Vie En Rose manages to rise above all this, to make the story feel fresh and exciting. Instead of dutifully reciting established highlights, the film seems more concerned with mood and emotion, the very things that make Piaf tick. It eschews the standard narrative arc in favor of more convoluted time-lines that seem to imply that the various stages of Piaf's life are interchangeable. (Wherever you look, it's a struggle.)I was not a great fan of Edith Piaf, or of her brand of music, prior to watching this film. The music is so well-done, it won me over. The same can be said for the acting and the direction. Just like the subject, this is a tragic, beautiful, passionate work.",9,1,3,13 March 2008
