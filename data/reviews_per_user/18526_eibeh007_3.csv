The Ring," Overrated
","Many critics heaped praise on this film, some even calling it the scariest film since 'The Exorcist'. I can name several horror films that were far more scarier than this film. Is it is a good horror movie? Yes. A great one? I don't think so. 'The Ring' is just as overrated and devoid of scares as 'The Blair Witch Project'. If you want a good scare, I suggest horror films like 'The Omen', 'Suspiria', 'Rosemary's Baby', and 'The Changeling'. 'The Ring' isn't a patch on these horror classics.'The Ring' is obviously a remake of a 1998 Japanese film called 'Ringu', which is a much better and scarier version. I liked some things about this film--the sense of foreboding and atmosphere of the film, the background score, most of the performances. I thought Naomi Watts gave a fantastic performance, as did David Dorfman, who plays Noami's creepy young son. Brian Cox and Jane Alexander were both quite effective in their small roles. Daveigh Chase gives a chilling performance as Samara. I didn't like Martin Henderson's performance. I thought it was rather empty. All in all, 'The Ring' is a good horror film, but its not really that scary.",6,0,1,21 May 2007
Hero," Good, but a tad overrated.
","What many people probably don't know is that Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' spent 2 years on the shelf before finally making it to the big screen, in America, anyway. Before it made it to American theaters, It was a smash hit in China and has already garnered a Best Foreign language Oscar nomination. I can say with absolute certainty that 'Hero' is one of the most aesthetic films ever made. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie more visually breathtaking than this one. Every single frame of this film is like a Van Gogh painting. It simply has to be seen to be believed.As a life-long martial-arts film enthusiast, I expected more in terms of entertainment but found the film a bit on the slow side. I'm not gainsaying that fact that the film was very well-made, I just wasn't very entertained by it. The story could've been a bit better. It was a bit too simplistic and prosaic for my liking. There isn't much to this film plot-wise. The fight sequences were a bit of a letdown for me. I prefer the fast and furious type of martial-arts fight sequences as opposed to the Peter Panesque, slow-mo ballet dance.There were certainly several moments of sheer brilliance in the film, and for that reason, I'm recommending it. The performances are impressive. Jet Li isn't exactly a great dramatic actor but he's effective here. The beautiful acclaimed actress, Maggie Cheung, never fails to impress. She shines as 'Flying Snow'. Zhang Ziyi is wonderfully understated as 'Moon'. Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who appeared in Kar Wai Wong's masterpiece, 'In The Mood For Love', with Maggie Cheung, also makes his presence felt. Donnie Yen, an accomplished martial-artist, had such infinitesimal screen time, much to my chagrin. I was hoping he had more fight sequences featuring him and Li.In the final analysis, this is a very good film, but it isn't the masterpiece 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' was.",7,0,1,30 April 2007
Trainspotting," Exceptional, powerful film
","'Trainspotting' is a bleak, powerful and harrowing indie film, which propelled then unknown British actor, Ewan McGregor, onto the world stage. Its a controversial examination of the exploits, simultaneously humorous and poignant, of a coterie of Scottish drug addicts. Amazingly enough, this is only the second directorial effort from Danny Boyle after his acclaimed debut, 'Shallow Grave'(1994). Shot entirely on location in the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh, it revolves around six key characters--Mark, Francis, Sickboy, Spud, Tommy and Diane. The film is narrated by Ewan McGregor's central character, Mark 'rent-boy' Renton, who decides to change his self-destructive lifestyle. His struggle to quell his heroin addiction subsequently effects his relationship with his family and drug-addled friends. Some will extol the film's unsettling and harsh depiction of a gang of drug junkies whereas others will rebuke the film for glorifying and advocating drug use.'Trainspotting' is like modern-day 'Clockwork Orange' in terms of temperament and setting, as it were. There are a few scenes that are somewhat reminiscent of 'Clockwork Orange' but aren't necessarily identical. In essence, its a film about youth culture as well as drugs. and its incredibly funny. Its not easy to watch, though. Its not for the squeamish, that's for sure. There are really disturbing images that will haunt the viewer days, if not weeks, after seeing the film. I've seen a lot of great drug-themed films(ex: 'The Man With The Golden Arm', 'Drugstore Cowboy', 'Down to The Bone' and 'Requiem for A Dream' immediately come to mind), 'Trainspotting' joins the list. I don't know if its the best one out of the bunch, but I like it the most. Its a rather strange film in the sense that there's no concrete story. A great deal happens inside the character's head and some of it is quite disturbing. Only toward the end is there a semblance of a chronological narrative. Boyle deserves credit for eschewing social realism because the film isn't as depressing as a result. Instead of basking in the depravity of the characters, he has chosen to celebrate the prosperity of life, even in the hardships of these junkies.The performances are simply exceptional through and through. As the flawed yet redeemable Mark Renton, Ewan McGregor turns in an outstanding performance, probably the finest of his entire career. He reportedly went to extremes, like Christian Bale did for 'The Machinist', to make his character look more believable as far as physical appearance was concerned. Bravo!. The great Robert Carlyle, however, owns the film as the alcoholic, violent, mercurial psychotic, Francis Begbie. He exudes a sense of danger and ominousness whenever he appears on screen. Its a shame that this brilliant, chameleon-like actor has never received an Oscar nomination. Its been long overdue after so many great performances in his career. Johnny Lee Miller, despite the brevity of his role, gives an excellent performance as the James Bond-loving heroin addict, 'Sickboy'. There are other performances well worth mentioning as well. Ewen Bremner is quite superb as the funny nitwit, 'Spud'. Kevin McKidd really shines as Tommy, a drug-free but curious athlete. Kelly MacDonald makes a stellar acting debut as the lovable 'Diane', the voice of reason for Mark Renton. James Cosmo and Eileen Nicholas are effective as Mark Renton's parents.Technically, the film is really top-notch. Besides the uniformly great performances, the film has a great script, solid screenplay by John Hodge(received Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay), clever editing, arresting cinematography, sharp and witty dialogs. The narration by Ewan McGregor is excellent and helps propel the story. The direction by Danny Boyle is truly superb. The soundtrack and innovative techniques really add to the film's drug-soaked atmosphere as well. 'Trainspotting' is a film that will age well. After 11 years, its still as powerful and influential as ever. One of the classic chronicles of addiction. Make seeing this film a priority.",9,6,7,24 June 2007
