Captain Phillips," fantastic movie
",A really great movie. i had never heard of the movie and saw it on tv in 2019...so probably even not as good as the original after tv editing. i thought it was fiction because i didn't believe that the us navy would go so far to save one person but then i read the final info saying it was a true story. i am interested in knowing how the somali captain is doing in us prison. i almost think his life in us prison is more comfortable than a somali pirate. although based on the movie he did save the captain's life.,10,3,4,28 October 2019
