Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Profiteer George Lucas Cares Not Against Artistic Distaste
","I have heard a lot of people criticize it because their expectations were not coincided with, the generation of devotees were sadly in tears due to the continuity errors with their franchise they devoted towards and I have also just heard it's pop corn entertainment; however, the movie, while yes it does fit the bill with those things is not really what makes it fail. What makes it fail is its target audience - what was this movie actually geared towards? Kids?... From what I have seen the movie fails to even appeal to a single kid, as kids really enjoy political disputes in such times of turbulence; do you think kids even give a monkeys about a blockade stopping trade routes to Naboo? Even though the movie contradicts the fact that they're against Naboo and want to destroy it notwithstanding that, even though all Naboo have is an imperial(played by the great Brian Blessed) living underneath a dome in the water.Is the movie for Adults? Well, not really... Jar Jar, to exemplify, is family friendly; however, he is an unwholesome brute, who is superficial and has the grimace and voice of an African-esque figure; perhaps not coincidental as he is a slave to the Gungans and Boss Nass, so Lucas gets trumped there. Yes adult debates take place, but it falls under a really pimped out kids movie; you got the young whipper snapper Anakin (Played by Jake Lloyd) who is the remarkable young man with a special forte for manufacturing pods, he is a nuisance. Who is this movie for? Star Wars fans absolutely went to the streets with it. Do you know what the movie was geared towards? Profiteering in the hope that this coverage could prove George Lucas has got this miraculous talent and that it only lies as an undercurrent; true art shouldn't need to be thought of through marketing. Eye candy? Yes, it is Eye Candy, but so are many other Sci-Fi movies like Blade Runner (1984), Alien (1978), one of my favorite directors '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) while they're not intrinsically eye candy, they're visually impressive... heck, even Black Lagoon was visually impressive and so was Forbidden Planet... what distinguishes it from these movies? The fact that the movie is not even visually pleasing. Eye candy is quite derogatory, however, but the word hyphen basically indicates that it's attractive, yet not interesting a tall; this movie is not even attractive; it's a hodgepodge of disjointed cutscenes.The movie only resonated with me in the vignette of 'Duel of the Fates' in which the chopped up, orchestrated ensemble fight against Maul with Qui Gon and Obi Wan happens; Palpatine (Darth Sidious played by Ian McDiarmid) doesn't fight them because he knows in folklore the good guy always triumphs? Heck, if he was there, Obi Wan would have been potentially killed and it would have stopped the string of sequels... However, the potential of death wasn't even present here. I was 5 years old when this movie was launched into the mainstream theater. I could not remember the midichlorians, Coruscant or any of the scenes in the Pod Race (the most boring thing ever), all I remembered was the fight scene, and being annoyed when George kept segueing away from that as if to establish cross-cutting; I swear the only reason I tolerated Jar Jar when I was little was because he was there; that was all.The whole story is bent on showing you this sanctimonious kid getting debased as a bigger threat; perhaps this movie shouldn't have been made. It has things that are 'all right' in among the naked scenes that were so woeful they make you want to poke your eyes out. It's like Batman - I do appreciate Nolan's 'Dark Knight' for how lavish it was and for its story arch; however Batman is looked at further in as to what drives him to the motivation determining his unceasing vigilante ways; in 'Batman' (1989) The Joker is the more focal character, where we can only wonder what this does to Batman by the cause and effects that interlock with the story. However, Tim Burton's version happens to be my favorite because I see why it was given that approach - this black, cloaked, deeply confused and ethically troubled human being does not need to wear a badge of honor; he needs to follow a code that enables him to detect and identify those who matter.I think Darth Vader, this enigma didn't need and could have been given ANY backstory apropos his time in the past and instead he is given the most physically sickening story that takes the elements from 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Pinnochio', 'Charlie and The Chocolate Factory' and 'Little Man Tate' to apply this to a sugarcoated 'complexity' that this altruistic little Cherubic boy is nothing more then this... yes, leaving nothing to the imagination of any intertextualised bad guy and totalitarian of the darkside; no, no, we'll let him be degraded by being taken away from the slave trade and becoming a jedi too old to be trained! Good lord, I know why he countered the Light Side of The Force - It's because nobody respects him as a human being!However, I have researched into Mike J. Nichols' 'Phantom Edit' which is a really interesting assessment to transvalue with the other version. J. Nichols admits that he can't totally get rid of everything in order to give this movie life because we're acutely aware that there are important plot points; however, he gets rid of that behemoth in the sea that pays homage to the other movies because, like all others, we know it's not necessary.Also, Lucas is utilizing certain past conventional methodologies in these movies, and yet he fails to communicate the myth of Star Wars. Characters under an alliance to take over the sennet - not trade routes and mind washing Anakin!",4,2,4,2 July 2011
127 Hours," A Decent Movie
","I have to admit off the bat that I'm not part of a big fan base when it comes to Danny Boyle. He's made movies that were valuable to my collection, but he never seemed to give me any emotional resonance or even that much extensive thought after his movies were over; you hit play and then subsequently when it's over you press off and don't even have a second's thought.Here, I rented this with not a lot of tentativeness, even though I wasn't a disciple of Boyle beforehand; but James Franco gave a better than expected performance (I have to admit from 'Milk' (2008) he never really impressed me and I didn't really have any empathy for him; I found him dull and one dimensional; that's not saying he didn't do well, but he didn't do AS well as I would have thought).The movie is on a true story, and I was then hooked to the idea of watching it; the beginning is already giving you catalysts of the need for water; it was moderately interesting how the three sights on screen were sometimes edited together in a sinew of images, like Franco (Aron Ralsto in the movie) going past a McDonalds joint and drinking on the way; initially, you notice a tap dripping, dripping and dripping... the only place left where he could fetch water.However, he still has the teenager and reckless life style, and yet is still extremely lively as a human being. He meets these two girls, and he shows them the sites of Utah.Boyles' cinematographer gives the landscape great width, predictably and uninhibited crane moves into the field of it; however, it does not add much to the story, but it is still immensely enticing to gaze at. We get a full glance at the area that Aron climbs regularly.And of course, Franco falls into the cave, and his hand is stuck underneath a rock; I would have thought that the whole thing would be boring after that, and then I was immersed into the common, yet fascinating back story of his life, and how he copes in the whereabouts with such little advantage; it grinds on the visceral and nostalgic and hopeful future that compels one man without any help to go way and beyond. It does have some shocking bits, but all in all, it can be dampened with the chopping and pretenses that he is about to do it, and then stopping. Also, I feel it is heavily inspired by Aronofsky's editing style, where the water is involved (the only thing he can drink) and then it may shoot a trivial and important thing at the same time, like the juice from his car. However, my favorite bits were definitely when he exchanged his sorrows so that he could replenish his hope, like telling his Mum he's sorry he didn't answer her or how he was unable to attend her Sister's Wedding and so on; he does this in a humorous and moving way. I also love how his camera is constantly being used; however that was rather mind boggling because you're wondering 'Why is this guy using his camera within such a limited time of survival?'... at least he wanted to document his last times, but he doesn't even take the camera with him when he escapes... However, the camera is there for his comfort as well; it's his only tool that could have been his last means of communication - there was also a scene where his face is in three frames concurrently through the camera, however this is not important.The charm to it is that everything he sees and feels in his state becomes his only instinct - he yearns for the open area just like any man would and yet he does it with some pretty savage consequences. The movie even beguiles you at one point with how he gets out in a sequence! It is important to note that the story doesn't have a moral and in fact the ending is possibly not going to gel with everyone and that was it really.So my last thoughts on the movie are that Boyle has set up a surface and a peregrination for the viewer; he may then take it away for the character to be developed but I am certain that the most powerful elements are definitely the cautionary thought and careful consideration of one man forsaken and then impelled to the edge. The movie does run its course eventually, though, but it's safe to say the scene where he saves himself was worth the wait in the way it was shot with sufficiently mind altering effects... we are then free and so is he! That's the brilliant thing about the movie despite minor flaws with its timing and the characters bold and unidentifiable way... and then you see him develop and you're moved by it.",7,1,3,5 July 2011
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Compositions that will never leave you and emotions that will haunt me each viewing of the film
","I would like to note that I advocated Carl Theodor Dreyer way before I was seated in front of this film, which became to most critics, his crowning moment. He took cinema into sacrilegious areas and instilled ideas about the existence of a deity. These theocentric and glorious disembowelling of the truth of this and the truth of death are amongst a subject matter, which was picked up by Goddard, Bergman and Allen. It's good to know that it has been done, but Dreyer was ahead of this in condensing philosophical things to his films, such as this film, Vampyr and Ordet. What makes him more potent then Bergman (given that Bergman is a genius and undeniably knew how to make a film that tried to thwart any believe that he wanted to debunk. Powerful example of this is found in 'Winter Light' (1963)), but let's just say Bergman tried a film that represented symbols rather than words. In Prison (1949), a film in which he dismissed as terrible, he uses visual ideas in quite crude ways. It's an anticlerical film in a way and it showed his passion in silent cinema, until he formalised his own approach head on. But he took ideas and brought them into nuanced complexity. Dreyer wanted to actually bring forth something as a standalone work and he never really wanted his opinion to be influenced into his films. I even think Bergman liked Dreyer; his works seemed to be influenced by him. Dreyer was a Danish director; he was one of the first masters of abstract images. It's bizarre to see overtly on his IMDb credits that his first film was 'The President' made in 1919, even though it tackled similar ideas, it's unlike anything that his style encompasses. I discovered him by a feature that I fell in love with called 'Vampyr' 1932; its mysticism, demythologising of the vampire and technological effects that set the way we move in Allan Grey's ventures, where he enters a world that we shouldn't have entered and he shouldn't have either is amazing and the demonology of the film is in my opinion really overlooked. It exploits death in such a way especially how Leone died by a ghost we don't see (similar to 'Blood of a Poet' when Jean's character peaks through a painting to see a cowboy shooting a gun – the same nervous effect). The film is expressionistic, dominantly white and metaphorically about us as thinatophiles and in doing this, reifying legendary figures. When the Vampires Accomplice gets killed, the ending is perfect because it's a time glass and it symbolises the memento mori and again we want to see this guy die because he wants to see others die as well. And then it segues into the forest where Allan and the affected of woman go off into the sun, the first mammoth bit of life in the condition of the films environment. Enticed by the shadows of figures and interiors of cavernous places, it's no doubt a fantastic film and heavily overlooked. The power is understated, but gloriously executed. I had been excited about 'Passion' for a long time; 'The President' (1919), 'Mikhail' (1924) and 'Master of House' (1925) are the only silent films I was aware of that he made. I then dabbled into film documentaries (one of which was the episodic 'Story of Film' by Mark Cousins) and I found out more about the realist film maker and this made me even more serious about getting it. It was a criterion edition I purchased and it came through last week. With those few films mentioned into consideration, Dreyer makes a foray into detailing Joan's story – The accuracy is diminished slightly, ultimately to accommodate the drama of the story, and instead Dreyer employs Marinee Falcolnetti as Jeanne D'arc and it's the most beautifully lit face in all of pantomime in cinema. There are a lot more that are probably better actors during that era, but it's an unequalled accomplishment to give such a resonance, simply with close ups (and it looks nearly like macro photography and this was during a time where these innovations weren't even around). I love seeing her response for salvation of soul, as if the apotheosis is manifestos. I don't believe anything that is said by Joan, but taking her impassioned words in this film, which are to me probably false and seeing how she goes against them, shows us the rigour of that terrible system. The film interlinks objects with emotions and takes different accounts very serious. I nearly cried in the first half of it and as it culminated calamitously. Dreyer used a panning shot very infrequently when he showed the judges and there's one scene where the camera pans right down one of their faces and then it cuts to Jeanne in a state of despair about where she leaned the prayer from. The judges don't hate her, but rather that they hate her mendacity and hubris ways, which make them hypocritical just because she wants to help people. Two Judges plea that she is a saint and didn't stem from the Devil, but from God. As if by envy of her accomplishments in helping people, they refuse to accept any verisimilitude of the trial. Trust me, the subtle moments of cinematography such as when the people come in with the weapons or when they're getting out the stake and the unbelievable part when they tell her that the King wrote a letter just to get her to put down a signature to death, hits the emotional side, not because it's playing for poignancy, but because of the woe of it So while probably not the most accurate version of the story (I have yet to see Demille's 'Joan the Woman' and actually read up on it), this is a bravura film and is close to being the best Dreyer film I have seen.",Null,2,4,28 October 2011
Hugo," An Amazing Piece of History counterpoised with 3D
","I have heard people say Martin Scorsese, it seems, wouldn't have made a film like this. I want to direct anybody about these qualms on that 'kiddie film' idea to watch 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through the American Movies'. To put it in a laconic way, Scorsese was predestined to make a film like this. What makes it enchanting and close to home is that the film is a fable per se; underneath it, though, is Scorsese's true love for films.The film is based upon a book about Hugo Cabaret, which Johnny Depp had in production for a couple of years now. Martin Scorsese was commissioned to direct and the result is a lavish design with an amazing stellar cast including Ben Kingsley who portrays George Melies with bathos and subtlety, Christopher Lee who plays a book keeper, Asa Butterfield as Hugo and Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle. Even the minor role by Ray Winstone as Claude the Uncle becomes momentous to the story. I think the real thing that came to mind for me was that 3D wasn't subordinate to the story or concurrent to the story IT WAS THE STORY. If you have ever seen Yasujiro Ozu's films or 'Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles' (1975) and films by Akira Kurosawa and even Orson Welles that you'll fathom out that film has ALWAYS been Three Dimensional. What Scorsese done with his amazing crew was that every spatial part of the foreground would be shot with depth of field. Melies at his celebration talking about what Scorsese would refer to as 'the illusionist' the magic tricks he would pull with Mermaids and Magicians, it's as though he has been cut out and is sticking out the screen (to use a cliché).The magic of cinema, the montages of the films to decipher 'Papa Georges' despair, the film follows a young boy, who tries to fix an automaton. He constantly evades an inspector and always runs the clock in its amazing interior (referencing 'Safety Last!' in terms of cinematic iconography) that his Uncle Claude does. His Father is no longer with him after a fire, while he was trying to fix an automaton, which his son subsequently has tried to fix using bits and bobs he can purloin from shops like George's shop. What's amazing is that throughout there's pervasive hints as to who this mysterious man is such as the poster, which seems to be showing 'A Trip to the Moon' (though it's in French so you can't tell).The film is relatively simple, though its tale of history is extremely pivotal to its anniversary of over 100 years now. Reduxing the Melies sets is wonderfully done through flashback and even little moments like Baron Cohen (playing the inspector who's basically a Keystone Cop in my opinion) constantly having pratfalls and pitfalls on the train station can actually feel more interactive as though his feet are sticking right out at us. Scorsese has not only proved the potential of this gimmicky device, but he's also used it to counterpoint with the old technology as an ardent student still learning his craft as he says. It could be up there with his great films ('Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver' and even 'Casino').The person I went with to the cinema had prior to it been told about Melies by me. I was oblivious to the premise being central to this Man; my reasons for talking about were because I was showing him primitive versions of Joan of Arc because I'm always interested in Dreyer's version, but I think that the way it branches out is fascinating. I then drew to the 1899 version of Jeanne D'arc by George Melies and how beautiful it was in its grainy hand painted form and I was telling him how Melies' anger caused him to burn the first carbon copies of his films. And then I get even more history on it in this film with so much poignancy about 'reinventing the wheel' and basically the guile of the artist. For example, Scorsese plays with the dream sequences at one point; the boy tries to get something off the tracks and the train comes straight to him like an old suspense thriller from the silent era with Pickford or Gloria Swanson; though it was different here. The swishing of the train is emphasized as it crashes right through the building and then it's contrasted later on as if it was breaking the forth wall for a couple of minutes in my opinion.It will be the first time you'll see Intolerance in this format, The General, 'Trip to the Moon' and even Edwin S. Porter's 'The Great Train Robbery' in this format. Even the projector in the cinema where Isabelle and Hugo go for an adventure flashes right out at the audience as we dabble into true magic. What an experience and I will note though that it will be tardy and slow paced for some. But it was simply rewarding in the end.",10,7,12,4 December 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," One of the Best Movies Ever (And Better Then 'The Godfather' Personally'
","It centres on Noodles (Robert Di Niro) who from the streets of Brooklyn in part of a low class structure. Into the midst of the plot (40 minutes in) Noodles meets up with Maximilion as a teenager, and another teenager, James Conway Donnell, and they set up a hierarchal system, where they dispense liquor to people illegally, and they distribute through and out of the water. They are Jewish (Motif of the star on the coffee window shows this); they are already in cases where they are nearly killed in this chain of events, betrayed and in an ominous place. It shows you Noodles as a young man who comes back to an area where he is under a vulnerable force which makes him resort to travelling to a different area outside his heritage – He comes back into the heritage and this is where the movie shows a great slick and emotional catharsis that Di Niro's character goes through to go back to a place where he has such an bad experience with and in the past and the dwelling of an invitation where he is dubious of the outcome but is lost to the dormancy in replying to it, is attributed to his age, his experience, his time and where he is. He has done things that are wrong, and only the movie chronicles through this - Every object has significance and every artifact is a cavil, for example Maximillian's pocket watch is referenced at the end of the movie, the gun is fundamentally important as well and the times and places from which we need to memorize everything, as to not get too disconcerted with everything; everything is important, both in their minds and on the surface.There's one bit in particular that I felt was an attempt for us to get into the depths of this otherworld, where James Wood's character Maximilian is used as the pivot to the story as he negotiates with Frankie Monaldi who he says has everything at the palm of his hand – and then they go against the gang with bullets. To try and get references to step up to the plate during the prohibition ending period. Their entrepreneurial business is dissolving, and it's clear that the movie is putting us in this scenario of it. Of course, from the beginning sequence we already get a look at these things and juxtaposition with the events are anachronically ordered... Let's understand that 'Once Upon in a America' takes the story of the gangsters rise but begins with his fall, indicating that what will be engaged with us the audience is a story where the 100% reliable narrative is Leone's way of dabbling into our minds and keeping us focused. We want to know how it all works; Blondie in the Dolar Trilogy was invariably a loner bereft of his path and direction. We want to follow him, but we have to also look at where he stands in the world and his status – he is a complete enigma, a puzzling character and kind of a cynical upstart – but we are introduced to him and onward he does become the only way we get into a primary Point of View into the story. It's kind of a similar trait with this movie as we see.I feel that 'Once Upon a Time in America' isn't only one of the great crossovers of modern drama, crime and gangster but also a personal statement about the tragedy of it; with such movies at that time that were launched into the mainstream cinema (e.g. Scarface, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter etc.) none had a greater resonance with its structure and flair than this one did for me personally. The general consensus now say that Once Upon a Time in America was revived after its experience in the abattoir, a.k.a the editing studio that butchered up the movie from its premier cut, and that this movie is brutal, hard hitting, an emotional roller-coaster, a poignant journey and a very bittersweet rendering of characters who we are kind of forced to identify with, even though they're bootlegging alcoholic substances. The real striking thing to me was that you had to feel for their rise in profiteering and that you had to really experience the life of it; so that's where it's not so much identifying as it is an exploration. Believe me, if you haven't seen it then I strongly suggest that you try and get it because it is truly one of the great American pictures.But if I were to nitpick the movie on all of the merits it has, I would probably nitpick Elizabeth McGovern's lukewarm performance; she looked slightly like her younger counterpart (Jennifer Connelly) but her performance is off key and a little bit cold and forgettable.But apart from that, I think Leone's best movie for me is definitely his last one. He showed that to him cinema was an entertainment novelty and it was also a place for him to express the stories to people that he felt could put him out there. He showed a real passion in this project and I really think that my entertainment was achieved and that my attention was held long enough that I consumed it in 2hrs but it was actually 3hrs 44minsThe music create a foreboding, atmospheric, mawkish, powerful, almost tear-jerking and everything compressed into the emotions of any music, that it's a character, an entity and as it trickle feeds you the feelings of Noodles, Max and everyone, you can't help feeling that the music works accessibly well and almost unbearably; believe me when I say, everything emotional is invoked in that music.It's up there in my favourite movies and I expect that if it is to ever be shifted down that it would be a rather small shift.",10,6,15,25 June 2011
Rosemary's Baby," The Consummate Thriller and Mystery Story
","A movie that was born out of greatness; the distinctive element that makes this movie quite good is that everything is all questioned. It gave me a real feeling of the 'Eyes Wide Shut' story on how everything was staged, how everything was denoted and how people were discerned in the unfolding of the tale (of course, Kubrick's movie was years after this one).It stars Mia Farrow as Rosemary, who with her spouse Guy (played by John Cassavetes) are investing in an apartment; unbeknown-st to them, the apartment is adjoined to the most peculiar and mystifying of old people; Ruth Gordon plays Minnie Castevet, a rather benevolent and well meaning person, who is the typical 'all kind and all helpful and attentive' neighbours, who out of their kindness, give a sort of longing for distance. Her husband is played by Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet. The Castevets are part of a certain group of people; the gut grinding feel to the movie give it a reminiscence of Hammer Movies, with the essence of a Hitchcock Thriller; but all in all, giving a genesis to a new entity of film. My gripe with the movie is that I felt the focal point was actually different from what I had expected; don't get me wrong I thought what my mind presented was not what it was all up to be. And my other gripe is that, like the character, you get frustrated towards the people. But as soon as the plot is ignited, it really does really blast into it. The relationships are laid out in a cliché way as I have explained; however, with that in mind, it is also very ghoulish and you can feel the vividness from it. For example, the satanic silhouette from Theresa (the girl from the beginning's body) is already a real foreshadowing to the theme of the film. That's the power of it – without the context backing it up – it feels Satanic and this is one of the horror trademarks that doesn't always execute it with subtlety and with enough suspense, into that fierce territory of being as surprised as the lead character (Mia Farrow). The motif of the pendant is powerful, surprising and enough to capture your attention. However, when you peg people in the movie, it can really put your mood into a spiral essentially transmitting the idea that everybody is in on it.My favourite scene is the dream/reality of Farrow's intoxication as we're exploring the deep darkness of sexual violence, sexual lust, sexual passion or just all things sexual; it scared me and creeps me out much more then things like 'The Exorcist' (1971) and even 'The Shining' (1980).The SFX is the best thing about the movie; the ambulance, screaming and chanting sounds through the use of music is absolutely liberating in that state of uncertainty about what you're watching and what's being described.The scrolled walls, the landscapes, the god like feel to it, the idea of creating the baby and the conspiracy behind that carriage, not just two, but all or possibly even being submitted to more than just one? Wow. It puts you outside of perceptual and mental ideas, forcing you to psychologically take everything in. Like what babies are used for and whether or not that mythology is true or not....Another thing that is quite annoying though, is the typical denial dynamic used in the movie, when you clearly know that they know. Even with the Baby, as if to try and creep you out, when you know it is alive or when that book is being impugned as nothing more than a fairy tale; however predictable that was, the ideas behind it were still giving you a great sense of being detected at every moment and ceased at every act with no escape.Basically, this movie is a solid movie; it adopts some of the older conventions of movies, but what the movie does unique is that it has a grittier darkness then other movies of its contemporaries and it also diminishes all humour, subjecting you to Polanski's vision and the rituals of another force to compel you to keep watching as if what you're concentrating on is destiny which is a very scary notion.",7,2,3,28 June 2011
