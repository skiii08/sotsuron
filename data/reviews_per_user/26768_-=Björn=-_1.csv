Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas goes soft and greedy
","Being an avid Star Wars fan since the age of seven (22 years), and eagerly awaiting the prequels, this was as a huge disappointment. I get a strong sense that Lucas has grown both softer and greedier with age, and this movie is only a soft and childish shadow, without the feeling of mystery and adventure Star Wars once had. Even though the signs were there already in Return of the Jedi with the soft, cute and cuddly Ewoks, I was hoping for something less childish with the prequels, and the anti-climax was the muppet/freak show at the pod race where i got a strong feeling that the main purpose was to squeeze in as many 'funny' characters as possible for the multi billion dollar action figure market, I guess the old enthusiasts doesn't spend enough money to be interesting enough to keep satisfied.",4,0,1,13 May 2000
