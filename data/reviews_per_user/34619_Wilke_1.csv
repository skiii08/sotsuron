The Blair Witch Project," OH MY GOSH!! CAN YOU SAY SCARY!!! THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE!!
","Well, as I started to watch this film I was expecting another SCREAM type horror movie.  BOY WAS I WRONG!, this movie is most definitely the scariest movie I have ever seen.  The movie seems so real, the acting is so real I find it hard to believe its acting and not a complete true story.  I must say out of every movie I have ever seen this one will stay in my head forever as one of my favorite movies.  You will become one with the movie and begin to love/hate certain characters.  Be forewarned this movie is extremely scary so don't watch this if you get nightmares easily.",10,1,2,25 June 1999
