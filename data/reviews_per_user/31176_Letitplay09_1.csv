Deja Vu," Mind-blowing!
","I went to this movie expecting to like it but not expecting to walk out of the theater and wanting to watch it again. This movie was one of the best movies that I've seen in a while. Not only was the story line and the acting great but how they make such an unrealistic setup look so amazingly real was mind-blowing. If you like movies that push reality and that have crazy twists, then i highly recommend this movie. I plan to own this movie the day it goes to DVD. Better than i expected and then some. The movie is filled with suspense and twists but also has some suddle love and comedy. The movie makes you think and you realize things that will make you feel like your a part of the movie. If you like the kind of movies that contain all of these things than i know that you will add this to your top 10, I did.",10,0,1,26 January 2007
