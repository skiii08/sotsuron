The Sound of Music," the sound of music best film of all time
",i absolutely love this film i watched it all the time as a child and still cant stop watching it. The actors and actresses within this crew are excellent what a star is Julie Andrews and Christopher plummer!! plus the children. The film is an excellent film i love all the music and songs my favourite must be Adel Weiss I'm not sure if i spelt that rite but hopefully you can understand what i am saying. 100% pleasure in watching this film over and over again... I will always be a fan of this film as i love the story line as well as the music and dancing.my dream i suppose would be to go to the places were they filmed the movie and go and see the scenery and take in the atmosphere there.,10,2,8,30 April 2008
