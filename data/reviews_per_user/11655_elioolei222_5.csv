Captain Phillips," Great storytelling Great acting
","OK , as soon as I saw that Oscar nominees , the trailer, the director ,and the main actor i came in the movie with high expectations .I HAVE TO POINT OUT SOMETHING: THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF MOVIES THAT HAVE CATHARSIS LIKE THIS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING AND ABOUT NOTHING AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT IS SO EMOTIONAL.This movie surprised me with the storytelling where we see both parts of the story , the pirate and the captain where each one is doing his job and trying to make a living. And when their fates meet they are helpless to change what is coming to them.I am sure this movie deserves all the Oscar Nominations and for sure I would vote best picture of the year.Tom Hanks and the main boy pirate play extraordinary their characters you feel their pain and feel attraction to both of them and justify their actions .Now at the end of the movie there is an intense emotional scene which I am not going to reveal but that scene wraps up the whole movie and brings the humanity in it and is a time when you think about the movie.Great work from everyone I would give an 8 without the final scene but that was brilliant idea and brilliant acting so my vote in here is 10 out of 10.It is a movie that can take the first place from Argo last year I think it is even better at some points.",10,0,1,17 January 2014
Bridesmaids," Bridesmaid
","After watching the Oscars 2012 (a little bit late), I decided to watch some of it's nominated movies, Bridesmaid being one of them.The first thing is that it is a long movie ,movies like this that are mostly comedy and romance shouldn't be that long cause will eventually get boring unless they are very good which this movie is not. I am u guy and I enjoyed some parts but in the whole it was not so good.The acting was mostly not so good but I really liked only one character 'Megan' by Melissa McCarthy.Then I come back to IMDb and discover she was nominated for Oscar ,that makes sense. I don't want to be to rough on this movie so I will add Kristen Wiig that made a decent appearance with the policeman whose name I don't remember.On the other hand I don't think that it deserves a nomination about 'Best Writing, Original Screenplay'. I can't really name this movie an Original with it's plot , it is surprising for me that this movie got a nomination.",4,2,7,16 January 2013
Lincoln," What genre is this movie ?
","Sometimes when movies are boring I continue to watch them but this one I couldn't see it anymore after 2 hours of waiting for something to happen.It is called a Biography, but whose biography. If the 13 Amendment was a person yeah but this one is not a biography. What about the drama I think I saw a new genre 'Political Drama' to vote or not to vote. As for the History I don't know a lot about it but I didn't learn anything from it . It was a movie that took 1 month of real events and played them nothing else because nothing really happens. I feel the same after watching this movie nothing new to think or to wander nothing at all. I saw a good rating about this movie 7.9 in here but I can't see why maybe the shooting and the acting but there is no story to be told ,how can a movie like this get such a high rating.I was looking forward to see something about this President but I didn't see anything besides the fight for the 13 Amendment that even Lincoln couldn't explain why he wanted it. Never was in this movie a good scene talking or screaming out loud about justice about what is right and what is wrong,nothing. Your emotion's never change during the movie. So I don't get what this movie was about so I went read the positive reviews and I still don't get it. How some people say that the great acting of Daniel Day-Lewis was thanks to Spielberg. I accept that everything was beautiful and every actor did their best thanks to $65,000,000, but I think Spielberg and his Writers failed their jobs and don't deserve the Oscar nominee . I saw his last movie before this one War Horse and that movie was great had emotion this one is just plain bald.Could have shown us a little about his past and a little after he died but nothing just that month of the 13-th Amendment where we don't learn a thing about the life of Lincoln or Lincoln apart from his obsession to pass that amendment in the Congress . He doesn't have an emotional thing attached to that obsession he just want's it fulfilled and he doesn't know why. That that I saw is not a man fighting for what he believes but a man fighting for no reason. Every movie is good because someone is fighting for something (family,friend,freedom,revenge,from alcohol,for or from an idea,emotion ) this movie shows us someone fighting for something that he isn't sure of what he is going to accomplish.",3,4,9,2 February 2013
Inception," NolanCeption
","I won't do a review of what the story is about because this movie goes beyond that. First of all I will give an applaud to Nolan for this masterpiece. This is the one movie that has everything , you can't find a weak point in this movie. The acting was magnificent from everyone ,everyone was at the top. Loved DiCaprio (I think he deserved an Oscar for Best actor), Gordon- Levitt and Ellen Page,Tom Hardy,Marion Cotillard everyone made their best it couldn't be better played by any other actor.The shooting and cinema-tics are great thanks again to Nolan, you can't find another movie so well shot,it looks different than anything I see from Hollywood, it is so refined and flawless. I can't think of a movie that was comparable with this one.And the music really deserved that Oscar Hans Zimmer is the best, I have not heard someone better than him . The two great minds ( Zimmer-Nolan ) create an wonderful environment.I think this is the best movie I have ever seen , Nolan has worked 10 years for this movie and has everything in it. He has captured bits and pieces from old movies (before 2000) and made something incredible from that, but that does not make it unoriginal. The movie is really original the most original he has ever done. It can be somehow be compared for the originality only with another movie he has done 'Memento' but not quite. Both of them play with your mind but Inception is way smarter way better. Everybody can watch this movie because it contains everything Action, , Romance, Adventure, Mystery, Thriller. This is a very smart film that keeps your mind busy all the time. Besides being a long movie in minutes, the movie goes on very fast because it engages the audience. It is not one of those movies that has a beginning a climax and an ending , this movie is like a graph that always goes up always on climax no one does that. I think this will be the best movie Nolan will make because you can't actually make something better than this and I have seen The Batman Trio ,I know that Man of Steel will be very good, I have seen the most liked movies of all time, new movies , old movie , but I can't think of any movie that is so sophisticated in every aspect.This movies ex-ells in every way you see it, no matter who you are it will immerse you completely. If I said magic it would become mundane.If you haven't seen it watch it one time for fun another to see what it really talks about and a third time to understand everything that is happening because you can't and won't do that only by watching it once. And read the FAQ in IMDb after watching it the third time.",10,1,3,16 January 2013
Prometheus," nothing to enjoy besides funny scenes and 'funny' scenes
","Just finished the movie. I didn't watch a trailer or a review of anykind just saw the rating at IMDb and it was what? 7.2 ,unbelievable because a movie like this hardly makes a 6 in IMDb because over seven are good movies. ln the beginning I thought : What am I gonna watch ? ln the end l was like : What did l just saw ? Sometimes movies leave you with a good question but this one is not like them.This movie does not have any plot holes because it does not have a plot. Sometimes in movie characters do things that do not feel natural for their type or things that are not in their personality here characters do these things or actions just because they can and that are contradictial with their last actions . This movie could have avoided some stupid scenes or tweak them a little but what the hell we are not gonna do that scene again even if it is completely stupid we are on a hurry. Examples : A machine operates a girl in her abs, after the procedure she gets some staples and is ready for the next scene. At least give her some glue with super growth muscle tissues or something, it is just plain stupid like that . Or the other scene where the ship is falling and these girls don't run aside the ship so it does not fall in their head but run along it . Just put some rocks around so it becomes hard for them to get away from the ship or else, but no we are gonna find the most stupid, irrational and illogical thing and we are gonna go with that.Maybe someone needed some money and thought let's make a fast-food movie with great look, awful taste that everybody buys and does not want to buy again.l am not gonna talk about acting or emotions in this movie because directing and the plot ruins everything.I am sorry but l can't find something good about this movie besides three things : catchy title , catchy idea and good starting scene. When you think about the idea of this movie that 1,alienas created life2,or why we are here on earth.lt is interesting but it can't go on and advance and make a good story out of it . It is only a question and is a stupid to make a movie like this because you gave the question to the audience 'why are we here' ,and than you don't do anything related to it besides wandering in a stupid planet.kIf you think about it it is a sure way to fail because firstly you can't answer it no one can, and secondly you can't deflect it to something else .Lastly about the ending. It leaves the idea that there will be a second movie as stupid as this one ore maybe more if they aim higher. Yeah ,If your gun does not shot at all aim as high as you want. What is their aim ? something more stupid. Redley Scott is like , we made a stupid movie how about making a sequel let's go to another planet and try to talk to these creatures we have only a character left so it won't cost too much .",3,3,5,21 January 2013
