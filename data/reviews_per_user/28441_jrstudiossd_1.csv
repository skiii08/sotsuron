Iron Man 3," Terrible for fans decent for people who do not like comic book movies
","This movie deals with the human side of being a super hero. Dealing with emotional trauma, relationship issues, PTSD, and political manuevering to manipulate governments and people.Wtf? How is this a follow up to Avengers? Lackluster villain, little use of actual Iron Man suit, and an ending that feels more like the end of the characters than the next step of a grand scheme of movies.It feels like this was written to be stand alone action drama and not part of a massice franchise. The story would have been great had it not been associated with marvel at all.",4,1,3,2 May 2019
