Sucker Punch," Not substantial, very redundant. Best part was the soundtrack
","Hooked me for the first 10 minutes (set-up), but let me go after that. The twist was obvious at the 15 minute mark. The structure was good, had Blake Snyder written all over it, but the hero and plot was not strong enough to carry me through the beats. Her cuteness dragged me through, not her growth as a character.3 actors carried the whole movie, 1 of which was not that important to the flow of the story, and none of which was the hero of the story, the others tried to get by on seductive faces, over the top make-up, and sexy lingerie.Had a hard time swallowing the character development, was not sure if the character had truly grown by the end of the movie.The fight scenes were fluffy with lights slow-motion and bullet-time, but never went beyond 2 movements before an attack. Very little Science to the choreographing.You can totally tell that they piggy-backed off of 5-6 video games and anime to gather their ideas for the action scenes. (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Dragon Age, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Sailor Moon).",4,8,20,25 March 2011
