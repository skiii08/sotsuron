Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," it's just not the same...
","A good movie...if you've not seen the original trilogy.  The Phantom Menace was visually thrilling, it was a beautiful concept, and it was watchable. However, those who have gotten caught up in the hype and expect something as monumental as the first trilogy they will be disappointed.  The characters seem to talk only because it moves the plot along, character bonds are not strong, and every plot 'twist' and 'turn' is so predictable that just about nothing is left to surprise.  It is unfortunate that the prequel doesn't live up to its predecessors, but with all the hype what did you expect?",7,0,1,19 May 1999
