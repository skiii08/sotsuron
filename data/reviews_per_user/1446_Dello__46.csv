Blade Runner 2049," Fantastic visuals, slow but engaging
","I had some problems with its predecessor even though I liked it, instead I found this one very remarkable and it was great. The aesthetics is phenomenal and the settings are outstanding. I wasn't a fan of the design of the 2019 Los Angeles but the 30 year gap made me appreciate a lot the 2049 version. Probably it's because the newer one is closer to the modern taste but whatever. What I liked more about this 'Blade Runner 2049' was the plot itself: it was interesting and slow (but this wasn't a problem). Instead the lower paced rhythm was great because it served the narrative better with a slow but inevitable going forward, which leads to more and more dangerous situations. And I also found that this sequel is a lot more symbolic than the original. An example is the figure of the child that is talked about as Messiah, resembling Jesus Christ or the Virgilio's 'puer'. And finally I also really appreciate the action that is grounded and brutal, very distant from the superhero standard.
Overall 'Blade Runner 2049' is a great movie but it's not for everyone: if you are able to appreciate the slow pacing it will be very enjoyable and worth watching, but if not this movie will bore you extremely.",9,2,10,12 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than the great vol.1
","'Kill Bill vol.2' is clearly the second part of a long single movie but is very very different in tone and in the scope than the vol.1. Indeed the first one is more action oriented and more fun, especially with its over-the-top violent fights but the second part is deeper and more emotional. And if the vol.1 was so memorable in terms of action, vol.2 has great dialogues that are now printed in my head (and in particular the last one). And I'm not implying that this movie doesn't contain some great duels, because it surely does, but I preferred this more narrative oriented style and the overall messages and theme explored by this vol.2. And in all of that I found the finale very satisfying, a perfect pay off to the previous four hours. The movies (vol.1 and 2) works so well because all the characters are greatly characterised and were always intriguing and I was interested in watching how they would have evolved in the story. I've already talked about the dialogues but I want to underline them again because they were fantastic and I feel I could have watched two hours of people talking about how to open a bottle of water and still being entertained.
'Kill Bill' intended as a single movie is definitely worth watching again and again and the different type of narration between its two parts allows to love them both without caring about which is better than the other, but just enjoying a great storytelling.",9,0,2,9 January 2020
First Man," An intimate take on the Moon landing
","'First Man' was very different from what I expected because it's not the story of the first man to ever walk on the Moon but this is just the setting. The film is more interested in his feelings, in telling the story of an introvert man who never fully managed to move on after the death of one of his relatives. And in this way the viewer experience a sympathy for that man and is able to relate with him rather than merely watching his triumphs and failures. Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as Neil Armstrong but also Claire Foy as his wife is very good. The director Damien Chazelle did a fantastic job, especially in the flight scenes where he decided to mostly only use a point of view placed inside the vehicle. This and the frenetic camera movements that simulate strong turbulence makes you feel there in full anxiety. Regarding the score, it was great and we should agree that the Chazelle-Hurwitz duo is phenomenal.
So 'First Man' is a slow paced movie whose focus is on the emotions of a man. Yes, it is a biopic about Neil Armstrong and has also the structure of the genere but it's even something deeper that manages to reach the viewer in a very positive way.",8,0,0,26 March 2020
The Incredible Hulk," 'Hulk' doesn't risk at all
","'The incredibile Hulk' is the black sheep of the MCU because of its very different tone and humor compared to the other MCU movies and also because there is Edward Norton as Bruce Banner (and not Mark Ruffalo). For this status a lot of people doesn't know its existence or consider it bad before watching. Instead it is a decent film, likeable, with action and a bit of fun. The real and only criticism against this movie is his regularity. Every aspect of it is simply regular, exactly what you are expecting by this type of films. There's no surprising aspects nor disappointing ones and everything is predictable. Also the last battle follows this rules: it is entertaining and visually good, but it isn't something different from a classical blockbuster movie. It's important to underline that regularity it isn't only a flaw but also a quality. Indeed a regular film is good, it will give you a pleasant time and you will enjoy it, at the cost of sacrificing surprise because of his non-risky nature.
In the end 'The Incredible Hulk' is a safe movie that won't probably let you down.",6,0,2,29 May 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Making millions by changing the last name
","'Catch me if you can' is a fun movie directed by Spielberg in which, to say it badly, Tom Hanks has to capture DiCaprio, who plays (at the beginning of the film) a 16 years old kid that steals a lot of money by changing his identity. And this particularity gives birth to a lot of funny moments that makes the ride enjoyable. The movie by itself is simple without complex storylines or profound meanings, but it's fine this way because the movie does its job: entertain. The only complaint I have is that 'Catch me if you can' is a bit too long, there are some heavy parts, but these instances are limited and so this isn't a big problem.
Thumbs up!",8,0,0,26 February 2020
Rocketman," If only I were a fan...
","'Rocketman' is a very solid movie, with great direction, acting, music and choreographies. My main problem with the movie is that I had never consciously listened to a Elton John's song. I saw the movie because I wanted to watch a good musical that could entertain me for two hours. And this film does a very good job in doing so but I lost a lot of emotional weight because I wasn't hyped up by the songs themselves. This 'Rocketman' is clearly better than 'Bohemian Rhapsody' but since I am a Queen fan I liked more that one. So if you are an Elton John fan 'Rocketman' is a must watch. And if you aren't but you want a solid movie with music and dancing this one is a great choice!",8,0,0,8 March 2020
Citizen Kane," Excellent but not the G.O.A.T.
","I was very interested in 'Citizen Kane' because of all the praises I've always heard about it. I have to say that the movie is really good and its age is nowhere to be found, something that only the great movies are capable of. The screenplay is brilliant because it narrates the life of a man (I've read it was inspired by a real person) in very particular way: the first thing that happens in the movie is the death of the protagonist (Mr. Kane) and all the narration follows Mr. Thompson, a journalist that is in charge of solving a mystery about this man and the film jumps between different periods of Mr. Kane's life. There's a study about his life, his motivations, his merits and his weakness showing the results of the choices he made or others made for him. It's also great how the viewer perceives him because of the peculiar arc that he goes through. The other great thing of the movie is the direction that is inspired and enriches every dialogue. But now that I praised the movie for his qualities I want to say that I feel this movie is 'a bit' overhyped. It's great but there are quite a few better movies. Is 'Citizen Kane' a precursor? Yes. Did it influence the cinema industry? Absolutely. Is it like Dante Alighieri's 'Divina Commedia' that a lot in vane has tried to reach? No, in the following 80 years there have been some (but not so much) better productions.
If you are interested in watching 'Citizen Kane' you should clearly do it, but do not except to see the best thing of your life because you can probably been left disappointed.",9,1,2,19 March 2020
Captain Marvel," Good movie, but nothing crazy
","'Captain Marvel' is probably the most hated MCU film, not for its quality but for outside reasons. I find pretty irrational and childish this behaviour but whatever. The movie by itself is good in all the aspects but in a mediocre way: nothing excels and at the same time nothing breaks it. In my opinion is very enjoyable and I've happily rewatched it few times. The biggest problem is the lack of memorability, there are maybe two or three scenes that I really appreciated. As far as the elephant in the room: the Marvel Studios have found a way not to make the feminist narrative prevalent and to be annoying. Instead Captain Marvel is powerful for a reason and not for being a girl (what do you think Rey?). Right, there could be the 'why' she is the most powerful and not somebody else but I don't care because an explanation was given to the 'how'.
If you are searching for an easy and entertaining watch 'Captain Marvel' can be a choice, but do not expect something more.",7,1,1,23 March 2020
Iron Man 2," Great atmosphere, far too many themes
","'Iron Man 2' is not the perfect sequel to his predecessor, which was surprising and exciting. This movie suffers the need of building a future for the at the time young Marvel Cinematic Universe and therefore there too many contents to deal with. There is the development of the main characters from 'Iron Man', in particular Tony's arc is quite important, but at the same time this movie introduces two more superheroes meaningful for future films. Then there are new villains which came out a bit superficial and finally there are some dipersive subplots. But this overload of content doesn't result in a disastrous movie thanks to the use of the atmosphere which made the previous film so great.
The second installment in the Iron Man saga is not as great as the first one, but it is a decent film penalized by his necessity to expand more than his capacity the MCU.",6,0,0,30 May 2019
Zootopia," More mature than the classical Disney picture
","'Zootopia' is a great animated film. The animation by itself is very well done and the overall design is very inspired. It's not the most original but it was executed better than the major part of the other movies with anthropomorphic animals. But 'Zootopia' is more than just mere animation because it has a solid plot and a powerful message. Indeed it is a sort of detective story (keep in mind that at the end of the day is a movie also for children and so is not cerebral or over complicated) that brings the protagonists to found a bigger dangerous plan. This plot is full of good messages to convey to children but even to the adults. 'Zootopia' is indeed about believing in yourself but most importantly racism, that is treated in a powerful way for kids (even for adults but it's clear there are more mature movies). On the other hand the film is also funny, colourful and energetic.
In conclusion I liked Zootopia a lot and I think that everyone can like it too, even those who usually don't watch animated movies.Ps: Nick the fox is simply too cool!",8,0,0,29 March 2020
Knives Out," A lot of fun
","'Knives Out' is a 'who done it?' type of movie that follows the established conventions of the genre but it is also a lot more. Indeed it explores new ways to tell the story about the mystery and the solution of the murder that occurs. And I find this aspect so much entertaining because due to the unusual structure I was able to experience different types of anxiety and curiosity for a movie like this. And it has some funny moments too.
In this context Rian Johnson manages to explore some deeper themes like the importance of behave respecting the others and the main one that is about racism. These themes are not showed in a direct way but in a more metaphorical one that is not omnipresent at all and so they absolutely don't prevaricate the main mystery itself but enriches the story.
In conclusion I had a very great time watching 'Knives Out', I was so much entertained and I look forward to re-watch it again!",9,0,3,5 January 2020
The Irishman," A lot of interesting stuff, but maybe a little too much
","I really liked 'The Irishman'. It's a long movie but the flow and the pacing are consistent and there's always something happening, and so I never felt bored, which is a possible issue for a movie 3 and half hours long. Thanks to his length the movie can takes its time to characterise well every protagonist and makes them feel like people and not only some mere characters. The performances are also great (De Niro, Pacino and Pesci were fantastic) and Scorsese did a remarkable job. The major flaw I found is that there's too much stuff, a lot of names thrown in one time and then touched again one hour later, or a lot of stories the narrator talked about which only scope was to contextualise something. The problem isn't that all this stuff isn't interesting, but at one point there's some confusion about what's going on or what character is who and so on. And I'm sure that a second/third watch would provide all the clarification but in theory it shouldn't be necessary. But other than that a very well made movie, surely worth checking out.",9,1,4,3 February 2020
Aquaman," Puddleman is surprisingly entertaining
","Director James Wan intended this film to be an high level superhero movie, one who could re-establish DC status as far as movies. It can be seen by his camera movements, forcedly ingenious that felt like he wanted to show how good he is as a director. The problem is that this feeling is not received, with numerous scenes that were annoying to watch and one in particular where the camera is moving excessively fast where I felt a bit of nausea. The direction was not all bad, indeed at the beginning of the third act there is a really beautiful scene, that shows Wan's history in the horror genere.
Another bad aspect of this movie was the CGI. The underwater setting was way distant to seem a bit realistic, with a lot of light effects so artificial that were disturbing to watch in a 2019 movie.
Also the plot was not that good, very linear, with some plot holes but in the grand scheme of the film it could have been acceptable if not for a narrative pattern overused. There are like 5 or 6 scene where the screenwriters didn't know how to start the action and so they decided to interrupt the dialogue between two or more characters with an explosion. The first time is ok, the second time you can accept it but when the third happens before the 40 minutes mark it's not good. Also the lenght was a bit excessive like a half an hour could be speared.
But why didn't I give Aquaman a terrible rating (less than 5)? Because at the end of the day it is an enjoyable film, with some big big problems but that entertains. Yes you will probably feel that some things are not working but you won't leave the cinema in pain.
In the end Aquaman is formally a bad movie but it has the rare power of entertaining, obviously not on an high level but it's not a poor experience.",5,0,2,27 May 2019
The Prestige," Only perfectly crafted
","'The Prestige' is an excellent movie from the technical standpoint (except for his score, but I will refer to this later): Bale and Jackman in particular gave a great performance and Nolan is really good as usual. The film is interesting mostly because of the intricated structure of his plot, where the Nolan brothers have fun in crossing the flow of time over and in changing constantly who to root for.
But unfortunately I have to say that it has, in my opinion, poor emotional weight. 'The Prestige' is listed as a thriller but I didn't feel the suspense, except for two scenes. And also his ambiguous nature about the protagonist doesn't help, because the real protagonist is the fight that I didn't find that exciting. But for this issue the worst thing is the score. It isn't bad at all, but it isn't nothing. I hardly remember a point in a film where it played and I am almost convinced that the movie was scoreless. For someone it may not be an issue but I think a score is useful when it enters your brain and enriches the scene, not when it is hardly listened.
'The Prestige' is a very well crafted movie that hasn't the emotional weight that could bring it from a good movie to an excellent one.",7,1,3,21 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The worst possible way to end it
","I know, the title can be a little harsh but as a lifelong fan of the saga I feel that way.
The movie by itself is not that bad, instead it is enjoyable even with its huge problems. In fact the feeling is that The Rise of Skywalker is two movies compressed in a single one: everything is rushed, there's not character development (the two main characters have their arc but it's like their changes happen because they have to and not because of what they go trough and of their experiences, failures and growth) and the story is so predictable and full of cliches. Despite all of that it is an entertaining movie, pretty generic (which it's not what you want from a Star Wars movie) but fine.Now the fan's prospective:
Once upon a time there was no Star Wars until episode 4 came out in 1977. There were no rules nor a lore and nothing was previously established. At the end of the original trilogy the situation was pretty much the same, as we knew almost nothing about what came before and about the rest of the galaxy because all the focus was on the protagonists. Then the prequel trilogy came out in 1999 and expanded the mythology and gave so much informations about what's a jedi, a sith, the old republic, how Anakin became Vader and so much more. At the time I was a little child so, even if I know that the prequels are generally bad movies, I grew up with them and I feel a sort attachment to that characters, their stories and their awful dialogues. And I know a lot of people hate them but I can't, they are MY movies.
Fast forward to 2015 and the sequel trilogy sees the cinemas. 'The Force Awakens' awakened my passion for the brand once again: it is very very inspired to 'A New Hope' but it is a great movie because of its well balanced pace, its semplicity and the overall tone. And it has a few nostalgic moments that I appreciated. So it was a good setup for the upcoming movies. I was super hyped up for episode VIII and I really liked what Rian Johnson did. I can see why people hated it and I can think of what could have been if someone different made that movie, but I still appreciate 'The Last Jedi'. And I loved how they treated Luke because I had always find him one dimensional but with this arc they made him more relatable for me and now he is one of my favourite characters in the saga.
But episode IX is a different beast. The movie as I said has it problems but I was accepting that because it has a lot of thing inside of it and not every film comes out great, so as long it isn't bad it's ok. But the last 20 minutes are horrible, they are the worst thing possible that can happened to the franchise. They absolutely break all the prequel trilogy, all of it. And I wrote about my attachment to it previously so you can imagine how hurt I was. And the problem is only with the prequels because if we pretend they don't exists it's all fine. The fans of the original one can say (and they are right) that the ending of episode VI was perfect but I had no problem in going forward with the story and knowing how much the prequels meant to me when I was a kid I was happy that the new generations could have their movies too. But breaking what had come before is not the way. And in all of that in this 'beautiful ending' there is one of the most unnecessary and cringy scene ever. Not to mention how the Skywalker family comes out of this movie, very disappointingIn conclusion the movie is fine, it isn't the best blockbuster of the year but absolutely not the worst. But I was very hurt at the end and I couldn't ask for a worst ending of the Skywalker saga.",5,5,8,20 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Mama, uh-uh-uuuuuh
","I enterd the cinema as a person who liked Queen's music, i left in love with their songs. Rami Malek was great as Freddie Mercury, even if his excesses were filtered in order to make him more likeable. The overall structure is mediocre with the rythm that is so inconsistent and some major points of the band's history were rushed. The last 30 minutes are instead so exciting and they give a sense to what seen before. I think that the Oscars won by this movie (except the Malek's one) were not deserved and they don't have to be seen as an indication of exceptional quality, only good quality. Indeed Bohemian Rhapsody is a fine film that entertains but doesn't go beyond that and it makes you want to listen to a Queen's greatests hits album over and over!",7,0,0,25 May 2019
The Intouchables," Strange friendship, spectacular movie
","Truly a great film, rich of emotions: it is plenty of humor as well of touching moments. It is a story about a strange friendship between two opposite worlds who crash into each others. The two protagonist grow thanks to the other and the viewer do as well, because they are so relatable. In support of the great acting and screenplay there is a wonderful score by Ludovico Einaudi that is really memorable. I feel like a part near the ending was lazy written and some other cliches which don't allow me to put a 10 but it is a very well made movie, which i personally love!",9,0,1,25 May 2019
Tropic Thunder," So idiotic but made me laugh
","'Tropic Thunder' is a very stupid movie but has some great funny moments. In particular Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black and Tom Cruise steal the show giving excellent performances for what their role needed to be. The rest of the cast is solid and the direction by Ben Stiller is good. 'Tropic Thunder' has its problems but is a fine movie if you want to see a short film (about 100 minutes) and have some laughs. It's not a masterpiece but it does his job.",6,0,0,5 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A lot of hearth
","'Once upon a time in...Hollywood' is a strange movie in the sense that there isn't a clear plot but it's more like spending some time with these interesting characters and their lives. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth played by DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are well characterised and I was so into what they were doing. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is instead a symbol: she symbolises the happy, thoughtless and hopeful pre Cielo Drive Hollywood. Tarantino is excellent as usual in writing dialogues that keeps you interested and engaged. Everyone expects an excellent technical department by Tarantino and this is the case, but one thing that I found more prominent here that in his other movies is the heart. During the watching I felt the passion and the love that the director put into this work and I really appreciated this aspect. Indeed I think that doing something you like as a job is a blessing and this can bring to a better quality of it. And this movie is a proof of it. During the film I laughed a lot, there were some emotional moments but the ending is something else: crazy, funny, violent, fantastic! With 'Once upon a time in...Hollywood' Tarantino manages to revive the city and the atmosphere of his childhood but also a period that changed Hollywood, but all in a fairy-tale fashion. It's not for everyone because of its particular structure but I personally liked this movie a lot.",9,2,3,3 March 2020
Gran Torino," Heartwarming and hopeful
","I've heard a lot of comments about how sad 'Gran Torino' is and I disagree. Yes there is a sad factor but I felt more happiness than sadness during my watching of the movie. All the first part is full of black humor stuff and I laughed frequently but the movie is also able to make you empathise with the characters and makes you comprehend the stakes of the story. The second part is almost humor-less and is very emotional. I saw the ending coming since the beginning and I think the film isn't shy to suggest what will happen, because it's more interested in the how. And in the end yes there was some sadness, but the heartwarming side was a lot stronger. And I was happy because the consequences of the finale are positive and full of hope. I loved this movie exactly because of this sense of hope it's able to convey. Indeed it lets you remind that there are good people in the world and despite the existence of some cruel individuals there are also the ones able to care about the others and to be generous. I loved 'Gran Torino', a great great movie by Clint Eastwood!",9,0,1,1 March 2020
Hidden Figures," 'Hidden Figires': huge potential, only nice results
","I start with saying that 'Hidden Figures' is a nice film, I liked it and it is a good time. But I want to underline the defects because I fell like this movie had so much potential but it has been wasted quite a bit. The real problem is that there are too many storylines and so few time to explore properly all of them. The result is not confusing, there are no rushed parts or plot points hardly comprehensible. The real problem of this is that the movie lose a lot of tension or emotional weight and stays pretty much superficial, with character construction that was simple and basic, nothing more. Also the beautiful messages about racial and gender equity feels superficial because of the poor time to explore them.
On the other end the direction and the photography are functional, all the acting performances were great and the music is suited.
In conclusion it is a movie which probably most of the people will like (even strongly) but very few will love or hate (unless you are personally trongly involved its inclusion message).",7,0,1,29 May 2019
Coco," A very colorful 'dia de los muertos'
","'Coco' adds up to the great Pixar tradition of producing great products that are able to entertain all the family thanks to different levels of depth. On the other hand 'Coco' has some problems that don't allow it to reach the best of Pixar products. In particular the middle section is weaker: it's a little boring and seems less inspired considering the excellent opening and finale. As far as the finale: it's great and touching, sad and happy at the same time. I found remarkable that a movie mostly watched by children is centered around the theme of death that is a painful part of life, and so the little ones can start to processing a bit this aspect. Finally the design and the music are both fantastic and memorable.
'Coco' has all the elements to appeal everyone and is a must watch for everyone who loves the animation genre.",8,0,0,26 March 2020
1917," A technical masterpiece
","To talk about '1917' is necessary to distinguish between the technical department and the plot itself. Technically '1917' is awesome, from the direction and the cinematography to the score, everything is stunning. Sam Mendes was fantastic and the fictitious long-take was incredible and it provided all the tension of the movie: not knowing what is to come and following the protagonists in their journey makes you live the experience with them and share the same emotions. And in all of that there were some memorable scenes as far as the aesthetics that are a statement of the excellent work from the technical department. Also the cast gave great performances even if they had very few to work with. Indeed the plot was uninspired and the least original it can be, with a lot of situations seen a million times in other war movies and there wasn't nothing fresh. The tension as I said was provided by the long-take and the score, while the plot couldn't build some of it too. In theory there were high stakes but I couldn't perceived that and this is the major problem of the movie. At one point I came to the realisation that the whole plot is written only to serve the beautiful long-take and nothing more. And I also realised that this movie is a great display of style and technique that has no substance as far as everything else. And while I was coming out of the cinema I listened to other people talking as it's usual after watching a movie and everyone was praising the direction and how visually beautiful the movie was, but I didn't hear a single person talking about what happened there or the shock they had in that scene, or that unexpected twist or something like these. All they talked about was the technique. And the fact that the first impressions weren't about the emotions the movie conveyed but about how the movie was made, that is what I think is the biggest flaw of the movie.
In conclusion '1917' has an uninspired plot and it doesn't manage to provoke strong emotions, but it is very very stunning. It's no doubt worth watching because Sam Mendes and his crew did a fantastic job in order to make this movie looking so great. If only the story wasn't a pretext to shot the movie the way it was, '1917' would have probably reached the status of 'one of the greatest movie ever'.",8,0,2,2 February 2020
Million Dollar Baby," The art of boxing, the art of cinema
","I liked 'Million Dollar Baby' a lot, it has a great story that takes its time to develop but it rewards you at the end. The cast was fantastic, in particular I loved Morgan Freeman's performance in this one, and the direction by Eastwood was solid as well. Another aspect I liked was that in the end the movie shows a particular situation that is very delicate and a source of dialogues on moral and ethical principles. I don't think it's explored profoundly but it's there and induces the viewer to think about it and to immedesimate with the characters involved. The only thing I didn't like was the score because in my opinion it was uninspired, and the piano jingle that frequently recurs was meh. But other than that great movie, very suggested.Clarification: IMDB doesn't have the half votes so I had to give it an 8 but it's better, I would give it an 8.5.",8,0,1,21 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Liked it as a movie but also as a Star Wars
","'The Last Jedi' is considered the most polarising Star Wars movie ever and is hated quite a bit in the fandom. I've watched this movie at least five times and I've enjoyed it every time. I can comprehend why other people didn't like 'The Last Jedi' and their points are legit but a lot is due to their own thoughts about Star Wars in the first place. As far as objectivity the movie is very well directed, it looks great and has a great score (John Williams can't miss with this saga). The plot hasn't big issues as long as we forget is Episode VIII of Star Wars. The only problem I have with the movie is that is too long mainly because of the useless Canto Bight subplot that is very bad. The most controversial topic of 'The Last Jedi' is how Luke Skywalker was handled and I have to admit that I would have liked too to see him as a powerful jedi with insane level of power but I also liked what Rian Johnson did. And this is because I was never a big Luke fan, I've always perceived him as the generic hero that most action films have and as a tool to bring back to the light the real protagonist of the saga: Anakin Skywalker. In giving him this powerful redemption arc with that beautiful scene with Yoda, then projecting himself across the galaxy that requires a special knowledge of the force and becoming the ultimate symbol of hope I grew to love Luke as a character. As I said I can see why for someone his character was ruined but for me it was the opposite. Surely I preferred this version of him that his useless role in Episode IX.
In conclusion 'The Last Jedi' is polarising and is right to have a personal opinion about it. I personally am on the side that liked it but it's not a sure thing, this movie is a perfect example of not knowing what to expect and whether you'll like it or not. Just give it a watch and mature your idea!",8,6,22,3 May 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Funny, cathartic, powerful
","The movie is quite simple as far as the plot and while it is clearly a part one of two it manages to be his own thing. But the style is superb: from the direction by Tarantino to the choreography of the fights, all is beautiful and particular I loved the music which is often used in a similar way to the spaghetti western by Sergio Leone. Indeed the fight scenes in this movie are very reminiscent of those gunslingers duels, but in a samurai fashion. And speaking about the violence, 'Kill Bill vol. 1' is full of it but it is so over the top that it is very funny and cathartic. Lastly I wanted to mention the thing I liked the most in all the movie: the anime section. It was so powerful thanks to the beautiful music and the very inspired drawings, making it an incredible piece of art.",8,0,0,4 January 2020
The Dark Knight," It will forever be Heath Ledger's masterpiece
","I love Christopher Nolan's style and I am a big fan of the Hans Zimmer's scores and so I liked the technical department of this film. Even the design of the costumes, of the vehicles and of Gotham itself. The stunts are great and the action too. But the technicality isn't everything and it's useless without a story and 'The Dark Knight' has it, and it's pretty good. It's engaging, interesting and it also explores a little bit the concepts of rules and anarchy. And this because the movie does a great job in maximize Heath Ledger's Joker potential. This version is my personal favourite because it's cruel and frightening while still being funny. He is also an agent of chaos that has no moral code or attachment to anything or anyone and does what he does to show that everyone's morality can be moved under the right circumstances.
Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is considered one of the best movies based on a superhero and I think this too. Indeed like 'Iron Man' and the MCU changed the industry as far as commercial comic-book movies, 'The Dark Knight' changed it for the more authorial ones. This film transcends the fans of the genere and can be appreciated by everyone who likes movies!",9,0,0,3 March 2020
La La Land," Heart warming, highly poetic and gorgeous
","'La La Land' is a fantastic movie, better than what I could have expected before watching and it has rapidly became one of my favourite movie ever. I loved Whiplash (Damien Chazelle's previous work) but this one is something special. 'La La Land' is about a couple and their love story, which I have to admit isn't something too particular or too original, even if I liked a lot the ending because it was something different but nothing that was never seen. The real merit of this movie is the way in which everything is portrayed, starting from the magnificent direction by Chazelle to the score by Hurwitz, including the great cinematography and all the cast. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both exceptional (in particular in the last 20 seconds) considering they also had to dance and sing, in which they were pretty amazing. Generally I don't like musicals but 'La La Land' is different because first of all I found more contextualised the dancing and singing scenes than a usual musical, secondly they are gorgeous. And all the movie in particular is highly poetic because of its bright colours that warms the heart, of the music which is fantastic and so thoughtless that brings you away from your dimension to make you live two hours in this pocket universe in which you feel light and without any mass. And you look around to the bright colours and you listen to the music played and you elevate yourself like the protagonists in a memorable scene. I know that it seems like a very good trip but I wasn't high, it was just the movie that provoked me all these feelings and emotions. For this reason I loved every single moment of it and it's one of my favourite movies ever. So if you haven't watched 'La La Land' yet, be sure to check it out. It's unlikely that everyone loves it as much as I do, but the poetic aspect of it really touched some cords in my heart, maybe will do this even for you. And if not it is however visually stunning, sweet to hear and it has an enjoyable story, so it is worth watching anyway.",10,6,8,21 January 2020
Up," If not for those irritating dogs...
",I loved 'Up': it is a great movie with some touching moments and a fantastic score. In particular the most impressive thing is the narration of the love story between Mr. Fredricksen and Ellie that is powerful even without a word because of the music and of the inspired images. The general idea of the movie is very original and the plot does a great job in entertaining the viewer. The characters are relatable and well characterised. It would have been truly an amazing movie if not for those dogs. They are so frustrating because they are so childish in a bad way. Being for children is not a problem and indeed I love animated movies but these dogs were terrible and they are used like the random NPCs you have to fight against in every videogame. And this is very bad because the messages that the movie tries to convey are important and mature and the dogs are really out of place. Even with this problem 'Up' is still a great film you should watch at least once!,8,0,0,14 April 2020
Reservoir Dogs," One word: solid
",I heard a lot of praises about this movie before watching it and so I was really curious to finally see it. I think it's not the masterpiece someone thinks it is but it's a very solid movie that manages to tell a coherent story that most importantly entertains. This story however is quite simple and indeed what gives this film personality are the characters. They are interesting and well characterised and the team they are a part of has a fun dynamic. 'Reservoir Dogs' is far from the best works by Tarantino but I think it's natural because it was his first movie and then he has matured more and more as far as his artistic consciousness. And peaking with the first work it's never good for a director. But who cares? This movie is great as its own and that's the important thing!,8,0,1,7 February 2020
There Will Be Blood," 'There will be blood': yes there was, but not from my eyeballs
","At the end of 'There will be blood' I started to think about the movie, its messages and its meanings and in doing so I almost forgot how beautiful the settings are, how big the scope is and how good the story itself was. Indeed the interactions between the characters are great and the film is able to convey a lot of emotional tension. And this is because the characters are unpredictable, you know what they want but not completely and often they act in a unexpected way. I was so invested in the meanings of the movie because it doesn't convey all the answers but leaves the viewer with a lot of 'why' that he has to answer himself. And the most convincinIg thought I had is that the protagonist of this movie is the Nietzsche's ubermensch (the superman) and throughout the film there are a lot of concepts of his philosophy. But nothing could have been possible without Daniel Day-Lewis: he is so great that I can't describe his work with mere words. In this movie (actually, in every movie he's in) he gave an incredible performance and as usual he disappears in his character. The way he moves, his looks, the way he talks, all these things made memorable an already well written character. In conclusion: a great film by Paul Thomas Anderson.",9,1,2,26 February 2020
Joker," The Joker doesn't cross the line
","'Joker' is a superb movie from the technical standpoint. I only say this and let you enjoy the technical department of this movie because I want to focus more on the great issue I had. I liked the overall plot even if I think that Arthur was too unlucky for this situation to seem realistic. But my main problem is that I couldn't detach from Arthur's character because there wasn't a scene where I felt like: 'it's too much'. Indeed all the actions (and kills) that the protagonist does are driven by revenge and yes, they are bad and exaggerated, but you can always find a reason why he does what it does and anyway everyone was an ahole to him so I didn't care for those people. I would have preferred to see a scene where the Joker murders to pleasure himself, only to satisfy his sadism. And I think that was the only way for me to actually fear the character and feel that the society had really created a monster that manifests his inner anger through violence. An example of what I am saying is the scene in which Arthur lets the midget go away. It was a great joke but this was the perfect scene where the movie could pulled off that 'it's too much' moment that I talked about previously by killing off the midget. In general 'Joker' is a very well made movie but it didn't convey his message for me because it lacks that over the top moment which eventually made me really fear the character.",8,1,2,24 December 2019
Whiplash," A perfect semplicity
","'Whiplash' is an excellent movie, dense and captivating that is definitely worth watching. I want to start mentioning the superbe work from J.K. Simmons and Myles Teller because I feel they did great and surely the final movie wouldn't be so good without them. In general the entire cast was good but the movie is heavy centred around the two actors previously mentioned. But the real 'x-factor' is Damien Chazelle who wrote a great screenplay and then thanks to an energetic and electric direction he involves the wathcers into this story. This is about the psychological fight between a drum student (Teller) and his professor (Simmons) and it isn't something intricated or difficult. Indeed is simple but it is executed so well, with a great characterisation of the protagonists, that this semplicity becomes a plus. And finally since this film is about music the score and the jazz songs present in the movie are really important and even in this aspect the quality is really high.
In conlusion 'Whiplash' is the triumph of the careful semplicity, of the passion to telling small stories that speaks to the audiences.",9,0,0,24 July 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," The sickness of excesses
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a great movie, with some excellent acting performances (DiCaprio in particular gives one of the best acting piece of his career), a perfect direction from Scorsese and very well made in general. The story is about Jordan Belfort, a broker which becomes rich and starts to live by excesses. This film is indeed a critic to this lifestyle, which is shown attractive and satisfactory at first, but it destroys who live this way and their families and friends with the passing of time. The movie makes a great job conveying a nauseating feeling through the noumerous scenes about drugs, alcohol and sex which are excessive and make fun of this people.
The only criticism I have is that I found is it a bit too long. This length is justified by the willingness to tell the story of Jordan Belfort without rushing anything but I felt like something could be cut, like 15-20 minutes, but it's not a big deal because the film is well made. And also a little thing about the editing: there is a scene near the 20 minutes mark in which it is so bad beacuse two characters are talking to each other and everytime the camera changes to frame the other its position is different and it is confusing. Fortunately it lasts like one minute.
'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a great movie but it requires some time, so you have to watch it with no urgency to fully enjoy it.",8,0,0,22 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Tragic and sad. And I love it
","'Revenge of the Sith' has some problems but it is one of those cases where I don't care. Indeed the movie has some of the best Star Wars moments to date and as a fan I can't do anything but love them. In particular the last 30 minutes or so are deep, moving, tragic and they clearly hit you: Anakin turning to the dark side (yes is a bit rushed but is very emotional), Palpatine's rise to the power, the birth of the Empire, Obi-Wan vs Grievous, Yoda against Palpatine. But nothing can't top Order 66 and Anakin fighting Obi-Wan on Mustafar and I think that those two moments are the best that Star Wars can offer. Both of those scenes are also combined with a memorable score like all the movie in general, in a few words another day at the office for John Williams. Personally even if I consider 'The Empire Strikes Back' the better movie, 'Revenge of the Sith' is my personal favourite for the reasons I explained. That 'You were my brother Anakin, I loved you' gives me chills every time, it's so great. As I said at the beginning the movie has problems, mostly of those are common to the entire Prequel Trilogy (bad dialogues at time, heavy CGI, some acting...) but I don't care, I only enjoy its greatness!",9,2,2,2 June 2020
The Lion King," One of the kings of animation
","'The Lion King' is one of the greatest animated films ever made thanks to many important elements. First of all the characters are memorable even if they appear for a short time. Then the plot is interesting and it is about the circle of life: life and death but also generosity opposed to selfishness. All of this is possible through an impeccable animation and a great music (both the score and the original songs). I think that almost everyone has watched it at least once, if not where had you lived? Jokes aside, 'The Lion King' has been a cultural phenomenon for a reason, it's very very good.",9,0,0,14 April 2020
WALL·E," A little too childish for Pixar standards
","Don't get me wrong, Wall-E is a good movie that has also important messages like the care of our planet, the importance of an healthy lifestyle and a conscious use of the technology. It has also a brave opening for an animated movie because of the lack of dialogues in the first 20-30 minutes. But then as the setting changes I feel that the movie becomes a little too childish. Clearly this movie is intended for children but in other Pixar films this aspect was more balanced. Except for that the Wall-E is very enjoyable and it has also some references to very important pictures like 2001: Space Odissey and Star Wars and I'm sure I've missed some other more.
In conclusion Wall-E is a fine watch for everyone who like the animated genre but it can be hard to see for those who doesn't like some childish elements.",7,0,0,29 April 2020
Marriage Story," Human and delicate
","'Marriage Story' is a film about a couple which is going trough the phases of a divorce. The best thing about this movie is that the characters, the two protagonists in particular, have a very human taste and they seem like real people feeling real emotions. And thanks to the excellent performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson these emotions are able to touch the heart of the viewer with all their power and at the same time with a delicate taste. As far as the theme of the divorce the movie is a critic about the process of it, on how it makes the couple waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want. And another aspect 'Marriage Story' manages to get right is that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not everytime) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults.
'Marriage Story' is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score: check this one out!",9,28,35,7 February 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Perfect ending, as a movie a little worse than its two predecessors
","'The Dark Knight Rises' had the difficult job to bring to a conclusion the trilogy started with 'Batman Begins', that in my opinion is one of the best origin story ever, and 'The Dark Knight' which is one of the highest point reached by a movie about a superhero. This movie is instead more 'regular'. Don't get me wrong, the film is great but not as good as the previous two. The biggest flaws are that it's a bit too long, boring in some parts and it has some plot holes. But at the end of the way it wraps up the trilogy in great fashion, I think it couldn't be more appropriate. So, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is entertaining, incredible to look, great direction by Nolan, fantastic score by Zimmer and some flaws that are not that bad. The real problem with this movie is that it came after two films that are simply too good. In the end the 'Dark Knight' trilogy is a milestone in the industry and it will forever remembered as the one that took the superheroes movies to an another level.",8,0,0,13 March 2020
Iron Man," A fresh breath for the superheroes genere
","Iron Man is a movie that has it all! There is fun, action, great music and also emotions. The plot is linear, without major plot twists but is very enjoyable and the main characters are well characterized and you can relate to them. It is a highly rewatchable film because it entertains so well that every time you watch it 2 hours pass like 30 minutes.
I'll give it an 8 because, even i think it has no big flaws, it's a pretty simple movie that can't reach the status of masterpieces but it is one of the best origin story film in the modern superheroes genere.",8,0,0,25 May 2019
Blade Runner," I will trigger the hardcore fans
","I'm going to say it immediately: I didn't particularly like the overall design of the futuristic Los Angeles. Ok, I've said it, I've said it. Now I'll articulate better what I think about this movie. As I said I wasn't fond of the design but not because it's ugly or what, it's just my personal taste. Indeed if we consider the time when it came out (1982), the work done is remarkable and the instances where you think: 'this has aged badly' are like two or three and it's pretty impressive. But it wasn't for me. Even with the plot I had some problems but I liked a lot other things. The story is simple and linear and there wasn't an unexpected moment but it's instead prevedibile in a lot of ways. On the other hand I was on board because of the charismatic protagonist and the memorable villain, that steals the show every time he is on the screen. But most importantly what I liked more is the mysterious sense about some plot points. In fact, despite a linear story, there are some elements here and there that makes you wonder about the real nature of some characters and the film does not answer to these questions. And I personally like when a movie leaves you with some thinking about what's the right interpretation even if there's no a clear one.
And so overall I liked 'Blade Runner' (the final cut) but, even if I recognised the enormous importance it has on the history of cinema, I don't think it's the masterpiece a lot of people claims this movie to be.",7,1,2,12 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Funny, delicate, strong, moving: everything you want from a movie
","'Jojo Rabbit' embodies what cinema should be: a rollercoaster ride of emotions packed with an important message. And starting with this last aspect, the movie is about a young boy who lives in Germany during the Nazi period. His mother teaches him the values of love and respect while the society inculcates him the Nazi ideology, which is the one he grows with. So at the age of ten he is a blind fanatic but it's clear from the beginning that he posses some of his mother's lessons that he rejects strongly. The encounter with a jewish girl that his mother is hiding in their house is the start of an evolution of Jojo's personality and I stop here as far as the plot. I can say that this is the setting of a satire about the Nazi ideology, that makes fun of it and shows how stupid it is. The other aspect I mentioned is the ride of emotions. The great thing about 'Jojo Rabbit' is that you enter the movie and you have almost two hours in which you feel every emotions: I laughed a lot and in some cases I lost it, I felt pressure and anxiety, I was moved by sadness and by joy. And all this emotions were perfectly balanced in the flow of the movie. I am a big Taika Waititi's fan and in this movie he outdid himself. Other than the plot itself, which I've talked enough about, the direction, the cinematography and the score were great as well. And also the cast did a great job: Roman Griffin Davis was outstanding, Thomasin McKenzie was great as well, Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell lived up to their very high standards and Taika Waititi was a fantastic Hitler.
What can I say other than I fell in love with this movie? Watch it if you haven't yet, this is filmmaking at his best form!",10,3,8,24 January 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Funny and visually stunning
","'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is a great piece of animation and the use of stop-motion is fantastic in this movie. The plot is ok and the pace is balanced and so the movie is surely entertaining. But the strongest sides of this film are the aesthetics and the music, both very inspired and very artistic. So, if you are a fan of animated movies you have to watch this one!",8,0,0,6 March 2020
Green Book," Great, but I have seen it before...
","I liked Green Book a lot, it is clearly well made and I had a good time watching it. But I felt I've watched this before because it has far too many similarities with 'The Untouchables', a French film from 2011 that I loved. It is simply the same story but in a different context: two men from opposites worlds that meet each other because of working motivations, that become friends enriching themselves and growing through the film. Also the alternation between the humor and some touching moment is very similar between the two movies. The fact that 'The Untouchables' was so surprising and great at the time is a clue that even this 'younger cousin' will be that for the ones who will watch it for the first time. But if you watched both you will probably feel like 'I've already seen it' at the end of it.",8,0,1,25 May 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Fantastic action, but maybe a little too much
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a great action movie with a spectacular technical department. Indeed George Miller was fantastic because all the scenes are clear and thrilling, and some of them are very memorable. The score is also inspired: frenetic and tense and it surely enriches all the action. But the most impressive thing is that almost every choreography is realised through practical stunts and this is particularly important because the movie has a a grounded and 'realistic' taste because of this practical stunts and in doing so it raises the level of the tension the viewer can feel. And finally I liked all the performances and the characterisation of the main characters. I found pretty solid the idea to give Max a little backstory so he can be perceived as mysterious and intriguing and I found him very cool.
The only problem for me is that there is toooo much action. Clearly I want to see action if I watch 'Mad Max' but I would have preferred a little more time spent on characters's interactions instead of almost 110 minutes straight of car chasing. And this was a problem for me because I found myself bored when these scenes were longer than 25-30 minutes. And probably it is only a problem of mine because maybe I can take only a few action at a time but sometimes I was bored and I can't hide this aspect.
In general 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a more than suggested movie, very frenetic and with a fast pacing, great visuals and music, that can be boring in some parts but it's not a very big deal: if you are searching for adrenaline in a movie this is a great choice!",8,0,3,21 January 2020
The Social Network," An entertaining ride about the creation of the social network that changed the world
","I found 'The social network' a very engaging movie about the personal life of Mark Zuckerberg during the period in which he created Facebook. The rhythm is fast, the dialogues are mostly quick and there's some dry humor too. All this fresh taste and the fun experience come at the expenses of telling the real story because I think that the plot has a lot of fictional elements in order to be more entertaining. Clearly the main events surrounding the creation of Facebook are real but the details and the general way in which they are told is 'freely inspired'. But it's ok because its purpose isn't to be a documentary but a fun movie and it surely is the case. There's also a bit of exploration about the themes of friendship, loyalty and the fight for power and richness. Suggested.",8,0,1,23 February 2020
