Blade Runner 2049," Great sequel nobody asked for
","I don't think there was a need to make a sequel to the original Blade Runner, which is why I cannot give this movie 9 or 10 stars. But if a sequel had to be made this is the best version of it we could get.It was atmospheric and well written, had gorgeous cinematography and was full of vivid, memorable and haunting images and scenes. The pacing was also good; it easily kept my attention at all times although being a considerably long movie. After coming out of the theater I was surprised to find out that I spent there almost three hours.",8,2,8,8 October 2017
