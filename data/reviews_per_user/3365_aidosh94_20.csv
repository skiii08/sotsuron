Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Pretty awesome sequel
","Personally, I prefer vol. 1, but this is a pretty awesome movie too. The action was good, or at least the only action scene, which was when Kiddo was fighting with Elle Driver and ripped here eye out... OK... The dialogs and the witty script just screamed out Quentin Tarantino, and it's just pure enjoyment watching the films of the perhaps coolest dude on earth. The cast was great too. I mean what can go possibly wrong when you have Uma Thurman, Darryl Hannah, Lucy Lieu, David Carradine, Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen? The only sort of bad thing was seeing Madsen 15 years later than Reservoir ¨Dogs, because there he was mysterious, cool, well a killer, and oh, yes.. hot! He's become an old and fat fart! Yeah, it has been 15 years... But still, some people age good and some bad. But he should really start taking care of himself... The special-effects were awesome and I totally enjoyed watching them. I recommend this film to all the Tarantino lovers out there (although I doubt that if you really love him you've already seen this film) but don't expect anything from Madsen. Cause if you do... you'll be really disappointed. Thanks.",Null,1,4,30 October 2007
Casablanca," Well, what can you say?
","There's isn't enough words to explain how beautiful, remarkable, extraordinary, superb, wonderful, unbelievable, fantastic, marvelous, great.... And so on. The acting was really good, and by watching this film, we can see one of the greatest performances by the all time icon and super-star Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman (from my country:) was glorious as the wonderful young Ilsa Lund who falls in love with the cool night-club owner Rick Blaine. I'm sure you already know what this film is all about, so I'm just going to say this; If there is anyone who hasn't seen this film yet should really start moving to the couch and turn the DVD-player on... Cause this really is THE ONE film you just can't miss! Thanks :)",10,1,3,23 October 2007
Citizen Kane," 'Rosebud'
","This is one of the greatest American classics ever made and it has one of the best stories and plots in the history of film. When I first watched this film I knew that it was going to be great: I had heard a lot about it, you know, being the greatest American film ever, but I didn't think that I personally would enjoy it so much (there's a lot of 'good' movies that I don't enjoy) because this was my first Orson Welles-film. By the way, he was great; the acting, the directing was awesome and it's amazing how he, by the age of 26, had made such a big name for himself, being nominated for Best Actor and Best Director and winning one for Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Thumbs up for Orson Welles.This film is a piece of movie history, and should be remembered and watched forever. So if you haven't seen this film (which I doubt you haven't) then you should really start moving and go see it! Do not miss this remarkable film, cause when you see it, I promise you, you will continue, months and years after you've seen it, thinking about the word 'Rosebud' and it's meaning. I still do sometimes.Thanks",9,0,1,24 October 2007
The English Patient," I didn't think it was boring at all!
","Look, this is no action-thriller. But it is by far one of the greatest film I've ever seen, and way better than any other action-thriller! Why do people have to be so naive, and behave like kids? Why can't they realize that EVERYTHING about this film is superb, extraordinary and well done. It deserved all the damn Oscars it got, although I was hoping for the amazing Ralph Fiennes to get one too. The acting was at it's finest, the camera-work, cinematography and directing couldn't have gotten any better. To summon things up = it was just a beautiful movie! And usually I would have said that people can think whatever they want about movies, but to think this is boring and undeserving of it's 9 (!) Oscars is just plain stupid. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I can watch it a hundred times more, and still not get bored (I won't really do that) because I understand the meaning of this film. It's about two things: 1. Love and 2. War. It's simple really, but the way everything is put together is just remarkable. So please watch this magnificent film, but not with low hopes. And don't prove yourself stupid, by going around saying that it's boring, 'cause it's not!",10,4,6,22 October 2007
The Caine Mutiny," Bogart is great!
","Over his career, Bogart starred in over seventy movies and his acting was great in all of them. But when you talk about movies that he played really good then I'll have to say The African Queen and The Caine Mutiny. He deserved his Oscar for The African Queen, but I think that he should have gotten one for this movie too. He was great. I wouldn't go that far and call this movie a masterpiece, it's close, but not as close to Casablanca greatness. But the acting was at it's best. You already know what it's about, so I'm not gonna tell you about that, but I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a very good, classic, different movie. So watch it, and enjoy the rare performance by Bogie. Unfortunately there won't be any more.Thanks",10,3,4,16 October 2007
The Shining," Probably the scariest movie ever made
","Don't misunderstand me, I said scariest, not best. This is a good horror movie and a scary one too, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a masterpiece, cause then you're talking about horror masterpieces like Psycho. I liked this movie, it was frightening, and I was dying to get to know what happens in the end, but I wont give this film more than an eight. It doesn't deserve more. But the acting was awesome. The one and only Jack Nicholson is once again really good and believable but personally I thought Shelley Duvall was even better. The way she handled the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny!' scene was fantastic. She was truly believable there.The fact that this film is number 54 on IMDb's top 250 is just wrong. There are lots of other movies that deserve to be from 1-50 on the list, for instance Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs (my favorite movie), La Vita é Bella, The Big Sleep, The Green Mile and Gone With The Wind. There is no way The Shining is better than The Green Mile or Forrest Gump.",8,1,2,23 October 2007
Gone with the Wind," Wow, wow, wow, wow!
","Wow, this was an astonishing movie. The acting, the story, the camera-work. Everything was superb. Vivien Leigh gives one of the greatest performances ever, as Scarlett O'Hara, the rich, beautiful girl who ends up marrying a bunch of guys and as the story goes, very beautifully I might add, problems and complications come between her and her men. Clark Gable is unforgettable as Rhett Butler, the man who Scarlett then finds out that he's the man who she really loves, but then it's too late. But, personally I believe that everything will be OK, 'After all... tomorrow is another day.' I got really touchy there... The point is that this is a masterpiece, a classic, and that it will continue to entertain and move people, just like it has for the past seventy years.Thanks",10,1,1,15 October 2007
The Pianist," Good movie, but a bit overrated
","I can't really select what vote I'm gonna give this film. Adrien Brody's acting was good, but the film wasn't something I haven't seen before. There are a lot of World War II movies and Schindler's List is by far the greatest World War II movie that I've seen, and if I have to pick a number two then it has to be Saving Private Ryan. I'm gonna give it a 7, but not more, cause I don't think it deserves more. And it being on IMDb's top 250 is just wrong. There are tons of other movies that are better. So if you're gonna see this film, do it for Adren Brody's acting, not the story, cause you've seen it before. Thanks.",Null,1,2,20 October 2007
JFK," It made me think...
","I really spent a lot of time thinking about this movie; The acting, the cinematography, and the most important thing of all: the truth. I'm dying to know what really happened, and who really did it. Personally I don't think that Harvey Lee Oswald did it, but hey, what do I know :) What do u think? First off, this is probably the greatest acting I've seen from Kevin Costner, besides Dances With Wolves. He was perfect for this role, and way too believable! The courtroom scene at the end is one of my favorite scenes ever. It was beautifully played, powerful and simply brilliant. The whole film in its self is fantastic and really deserved all the credit it got.Watch this film, 'cause it'll make you think, just like it made me think. Thanks",9,3,15,22 October 2007
Schindler's List," Great and powerful movie, Liam Neeson at his best!
","Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go see Schindler's List.EDIT: I wrote this when I was 12 or 13, and I'm so sorry about my AWFUL English... Ah, well just have that in mind when you read this. =)",10,254,490,18 June 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Awesome!
","Look, this is an action film and should not be taken seriously. I mean at least not where Uma Thurman has a sword with her on a plane to Japan (I can't remember exactly where). The point is that you should enjoy it for the action, cursing and special effects, not so that you could point out the weird stuff. OK, let's move on.Uma Thurman is really cool, like ultra cool. She is the perfect one for this role, and she plays it good too (not that it's that hard to play). She wakes up after a coma, her baby's dead, and all she wants is revenge. The flashbacks and her way of getting to where she wants to be (with Bill) is awesome. The special effects where like some of the best and coolest I've ever seen. Besides, it's Tarantino, can he ever do something wrong? Lucy Lieu, Daryl Hannah and Vivica J. Fox were all great as members of the assassination team that Thurman wants revenge on. The part where Thurman and Lieu begin fighting is really cool. Beautiful too, with all the snow.David Carradine is good as Bill, the man Thurman wants to kill more than anyone. He keeps that kind of 'mysterious crazy man' all through the film.It's kinda hard for me to picture Michael Madsen in any kind of different role, after watching Reservoir Dogs (one of my favorite movies) a hundred times, except for Mr Blonde, but here he shows, once again, that he was born to play tough guy roles. But for me he'll always be 'the cop-torturing, ear-slashing off ' man. Weird.Good job Quentin Tarantino, for once again giving us one of the super coolest, most violent movies ever and for picking out the perfect cast to go with this film. It's a good film, and shouldn't be taken seriously, at least not more than it should.Thanks for reading my comment.",9,0,2,12 October 2007
Saw," What the hell?!
","What!? I had heard so many awesome stuff about this film, but none of it were true. I hated it. It was not as scary as everyone say (that includes my own father) but just horribly acted and bad. The story was kinda weird and strange and extremely claustrophobic but what can I say... I just didn't enjoy it! I do not think that I'm the only one who hates this film. There are a lot of people who liked it, and that's OK. Everyone has the right to think whatever they want, but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone. + None of the actors who played in Saw were famous or even just a little famous! Except for Danny Glover, whom I don't really like... If you think you might like it, then watch it! But don't expect a masterpiece...Thanks",2,2,3,16 November 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Greatest Tarantino movie so far!
","I saw this movie about a month ago and I honestly didn't think it was going to be this good! It has everything; an great and cool story, an outstanding cast, cool and fun dialogs with great characters.Harvey Keitel is as good as ever, Steve Buscemi is so fun to watch and makes his character extra funny! Tim Roth and Chris Penn are as good as the rest but the greatest actor and character in this movie has to be Michael Madsen,'cause he made his character believable and cool and no one could have done it better! His character is at the top of my list of greatest movie villains in all of history.Quentin Tarantino is fun too in the movie and he has a natural talent to make these kinds of films and he should continue making them, although I doubt there's going to be a movie as good as this! This movie is really one of the greatest films ever and a special thanks to Michael Madsen (hihi), because without him this movie just wouldn't be the same!",10,1,3,24 July 2007
Titanic," One of the greatest love films of all time
","This is a typical 'rich girl meets poor boy' story, but it has got so much more than that. First of all, a great cast: Leo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates and many more. They were all good. And the special effects were awesome! I mean, really, I have never seen anything like that before (or maybe I have, I just can't remember it). The point is that this movie captures you for like three hours, and never once did I look at the time and see how long it's been or how long it's left. This movie deserved all the Oscars, all the credit and all the good reviews. I love this movie, a classic movie, and I can't imagine how anyone would think it's bad or that it didn't deserve all the credit it got. Watch it and enjoy it and don't think about how long it is. Some of the greatest movies of all time are like really long. Thanks :)",10,2,4,12 October 2007
Psycho," Weird.. they didn't win Oscars..
","This is probably one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and I watch movies as often as I can. A woman steals some money from her work and runs away with it. She goes to the Bates Motel, where she meets Norman Bates. A psycho.This is Alfred Hitchcock's best work and I think that he should have, at least, been nominated for best picture, cause this truly is an amazing film.Janet Leigh was good, at least the whole forty-five minutes she was in the film until she got whacked... But the really weird thing is that Anthony Perkins did not win an Oscar for his role, a very difficult role to play I might add, as the psycho who kills his own mother and kills Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in the shower. That was some scary stuff.This is one of the greatest films ever made and it's absurd that the academy would give Oscars to let's say Denzel Washington for Training Day, and not to Perkins or Hitchcock. I mean yeah, it's been 40 years, but still! Well, good job Perkins for giving us one of the greatest performances ever in the history of film.",10,0,0,12 October 2007
The Green Mile," My favorite movie of all time
","I don't know how to explain how good this movie really is. I'm not going to write a hundred lines, just enough so others can see and be encouraged to watch this remarkable film.It's about the lives of a couple of guards on death row, until the day a wrongly accused man, John Coffey(beautifully played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who I think deserved an Oscar..), walks in the room. Tom Hanks was good as the religious man who wants to save Coffey from the electric chair, but then doesn't cause he told him not to.The scene where he watched a film for the first time was... amazing. So powerful, touching and I felt something that I've never felt for a movie before. When I find out what it was i'll let you know.Morse, Hunt, Cromwell, Jeter, Rockwell, Pepper, Stanton, Clarkson and Hutchison were all good as the good/bad/sad characters in this film. Really, it's a flawless film.I cried a lot during this film! The greatest film ever to be created. Good job King and Darabont.I hope my comment was useful. Thanks.",10,0,3,8 October 2007
The Terminal," No Forrest Gump...
","Look, I think this movie is underrated because people always compare it to so many other great Hanks movies like Forrest Gump, Philadelphia and even The Green Mile. But this is a warm, loving, funny and awesome movie. Hanks played his role awesome and believable and that's what matters. Catherine Zeta-Jones was fun too, but not that fun. Just fun enough! Please, stop comparing it to other movies and just take it the way it is. I recommend it to any Hanks or Spielberg fan and hope that they enjoyed it as much as I did.7.5/10",Null,1,3,7 October 2007
Apollo 13," Really Exciting
","This movie is what I call an exciting, action-packed, almost great movie. It's not really amazing or classic, but it was far better than what I had expected (my naive sister said it sucked!). When I watched it alone I was very entertained by the really great special effects and, believe it or not, the acting. It was definitely not Oscar material, but still good enough... Tom Hanks is a delight to watch and he plays his role great, and along with Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris he shines brighter. But I was also impressed with Harris and Sinise. They were good.Anyway, watch this movie and be entertained. It's really a great movie!Hey, did you know that Gary Sinise has starred in three Tom Hanks movies? Apollo 13, Forrest Gump and my all time favorite movie The Green Mile.",8,1,2,8 December 2007
Jackie Brown," Boring..
","I had way too high expectations about this movie. Quentin Tarantino is by far the best and coolest director, in my opinion, and watching Reservoir Dogs (my favorite movie), Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies, I understood what Tarantino was really about; blood, violence and a fast tempo. But Jackie Brown has none of those things. If another director had made this movie then people would probably go on saying that it was good and it had a good story and so on. But Tarantino knows what he's all about (I'm sure) and he knows what his fans like, once again fast tempo and violence. Plus a great soundtrack. Making this movie wasn't so smart. But I hope he'll continue with the cool movie making, cause he really knows how, and that we will see more of his greatest movies in the future. Thumbs down for Jackie Brown, but thumbs up for the coolest dude on earth.",5,12,23,20 October 2007
The Simpsons Movie," The funniest cartoon film ever!!!
","I just couldn't stop laughing. I sat at the movie theater with my sister and we didn't want this movie to end! We've been waiting for like a hundred years for it come out, and when it finally did I was so happy because it was everything I wanted it to be and have: Lots and lots of Homer! Cute little Lisa and Bart were as funny as ever (especially when Bart got attached to Ned Flanders :) and Marge as wonderful as ever, and little Maggie who said her first words in the end: 'Sequel?' Boy, am I excited to see how the second film is going to be! To summon things up: I recommend this film to EVERYONE and not seeing it would be a very dumb thing to do, cause this really is a funny cartoon. Hell, this is the greatest cartoon and a very funny movie. And Homer Simpson must be the greatest character ever!",10,0,2,23 October 2007
