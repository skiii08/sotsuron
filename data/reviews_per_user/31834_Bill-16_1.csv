The Blair Witch Project," Best Since Halloween
","I remember when the original Halloween was released, a horror movie that actually made my heart beat faster. Most horror movies made in the last 20 years spend to much time and money trying to make blood and guts look 'real'. Grossing you out more than scaring you. Blair Witch gave me the same feeling as Hitchcock's 'Psycho',less the the visual perfection from Hitchcock. My heart was picking up a few beats in the last 30 minutes of Blair Witch and the rest of the movie was well worth watching, also!!",9,1,3,4 November 1999
