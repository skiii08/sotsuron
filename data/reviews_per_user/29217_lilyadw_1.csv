Black Swan," Obvious and heavy handed
","It took me a long time to watch this movie, and I had high hopes based on what I had heard.I was really disappointed though, the movie seemed really obvious the whole way through, and Nina's spiral into psychosis seems to mirror every single other film with similar themes as well.The parallels between the story of swan lake and the characters in the film were heavy handed as well, and you could tell Darren Aronofsky thought he was being really clever with them.Actually the whole movie seems like Darren Aronofsky just attempting to come accross as profound, every single line from Leroy is like Aronofsky jacking off to how smart he is!Also for a movie where most of the characters are female, it came off as weirdly sexist? Not to be preachy about those kinds of things, but Aronofsky displays a limited view of women in this film. They're either timid and virginal or seductive and immoral. Very madonna-wh*re. There's the overbearing mother character as well of course.Bit of a letdown overall! Most of the body horror and special effects were amazing to be fair but the rest was less than I'd been told to expect.",4,1,4,10 January 2019
