Antz," This is a clever marvel of animation.
","'Antz' is a marvelous blend of brilliant animation and wacky humor.  The physical look of the picture is stunning.  The voice-overs are enormously entertaining, especially Woody Allen as 'Z.'  The social commentary about conformity versus individualism will be totally lost on young children. 'Antz' is geared towards older children and adults who will get the political allusions and who will appreciate the musical oldies that provide background for the action.  This movie was pure fun.",Null,0,0,3 November 1998
Shakespeare in Love," This is the year's most original movie.
","There's a lot to love in this movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow is luminescent, Geoffrey Rush is hilarious, Judi Dench is magnificent in a small role and the script is clever and witty. Rupert Everett and Ben Affleck are under-used, which is a real shame, since they are both so talented and charismatic. It's a literate movie with a lot of 'in' jokes.  'Shakespeare in Love' is entertaining without being moronic or condescending.  What kept the movie from really enthralling me is the lead, Joseph Fiennes.  I would have liked a more striking male lead, someone with more subtlety and shading in his acting to match Paltrow's wonderful performance.  It is a good movie, but not a great movie.",Null,0,0,1 January 1999
Life Is Beautiful," It has its moments but it is overrated.
","'Life is Beautiful' is not meant to be taken literally.  Those who criticize it because it is unrealistic are missing the point of the movie.  To me the movie is saying that in the face of the irrational Nazi juggernaut, one has to react with humor and denial to survive.  To give in to despair would be to hand the Nazis an immediate victory. The performances and the cinematography are fine.   My problem is that a little of Begnini goes a long way.  His incessant chattering got on my nerves fairly quickly and although he is a likeable person, I found his personality grating.  He made a courageous movie, but I didn't love it as much as I admired his bravery in tackling this subject in such an original way.",Null,1,2,15 February 1999
