Ford v Ferrari," A Bit Long and a Bit Slow... In More Ways Than One
","Generally enjoyable but could have benefited from a 20-minute trim.Also, in many of the racing/practice scenes, the cars seemed to be doing about 70 while showing us speedometers indicating 200. With all the CGI in this movie, it wouldn't have taken much more of it to add a real sense of speed.Good performances, decent script. Give it a go.",7,0,4,16 November 2019
The Birds," If Dullness is What You Seek...
","I love Hitch but, for the life of me, why is this movie considered one of his best?In its best moments it's dull. In its worst moments it's slightly duller without a jot or iota of suspense. I mean, really, many scenes attempted to build suspense but the construction proceeded at the pace of a snail on downers and the 'payoff' never got funded.Great director, good to great actors, awful and boring film.",2,0,2,26 October 2019
