Sucker Punch," That looks so cool...
","Fabulous! By relying on tropes so familiar he doesn't need to contribute a story, Snyder justifies over-the-top visuals and gives us a gang of kick-ass warrior-women without one close-up shot of a bosom or one ripped skirt at the thigh. Think 'Aeon Flux' and that style of 'cool,' instead of 'Black Scorpion' (and that style of trash), and you get what Snyder has to offer.Drill down on the IMDb ratings and take note of the fact that, except for the IMDb staff, the highest rating comes from females under 18. A number of critics mistakenly dismissed this movie as being aimed at men, because the heroes (the right word for these women) wear a lot of black leather and fishnets. But look closer at what you _don't_ see: there's not a lot of bare skin, nor even much hinting at anything racy. In the 'club,' they wear the same practice leotards every professional dancer has. In the fighting scenes, their outfits cover almost their entire bodies, and in ways that are no more demeaning than how most male action heroes are dressed. Closest thing I could see to adolescent fantasy stuff was one character's black leather nurse's cap, which frankly looks pretty jaunty, kind of like the winged cap of the Italian carabinieri. Amazing that the teen-aged young women seemed to get this, while the middle-aged female professional reviewers mostly missed it.Extra fun for those of us who remember Scott Glenn for the similarly plot-less, equally atmospheric, ultimately inferior (though almost as satisfying) 1983's 'The Keep.' He is equally enigmatic here, though a bit more sly as he leaves the combat to the main characters.Don't look for a story. Look for something you kind of partly wish were real, if only it weren't so likely to hurt you, and then say, 'Gee, that looks so _cool_!' You'll be glad you did.",8,2,4,23 February 2013
Spartacus," 'Gladiator' couldn't come close
","I loved it.  It's sad, yet affirming.  The music is a kind you don't hear in films anymore, with sweet strings and quiet tones.  The acting is credible and convincing.  And there's a story.  Russell Crowe sweating and grunting isn't drama.  Kirk Douglas telling a man he has to kill that he loves him like a son, and making you weep as he does it...  _That's_ drama.The whole thing is fine, even the one slave-turned-soldier who apparently was captured in Brooklyn (judging from his accent).  Peter Ustinov does the cowardly hero to perfection.  Charles Laughton makes intrigue interesting. And Olivier is evil.  It doesn't get any better.",10,4,10,27 October 2001
Star Trek," An Okay Space Flick, But It's Not Trek
","I really wanted to like this movie since it might have been (and its early mini-trailers hinted that it would be) the restart of my beloved characters I have waited for since 1969.Nope.This movie simply has nothing to do with Star Trek (The Original Series). Oh, it's got a character named 'Spock' who has pointed ears and comes from a planet named 'Vulcan.' But the similarity between 'Spock' and Spock is about what you'd get if a twelve-year-old watched a dozen TOS episodes, then tried to describe Spock to a grown-up director or writer who had never seen TOS. And 'Spock' is the closest to the original of the main ensemble.Okay, so it didn't _have_ to be the same, I know. But it captures _none_ of the original's feel or charm. Indeed, where it tries to do so, the film gets in its own way. To put them in the familiar setting and context of the commander/first-officer/doctor, the script has forced situation after forced situation calling upon the viewer to strain their willingness to disbelieve the absurd to its breaking point.Also absent were any familiar sounds. But for a few, almost swamped, beeps and chords, most of the sound effects, and all of the score, again fail to connect us to the source material.There were lots of exciting scenes, and I think this could have been a worthwhile entry into the sf genre of movies (but for that annoying habit the director has, as several others have noted, of shaking the camera for no apparent reason; actually gave me a mild headache, at one point). However, by calling it 'Star Trek,' some reasonable expectations were cultivated. Alas, no reasonable expectations were met.I'm sad to say it, but, although this movie is sure to spawn at least a couple of sequels, it's time to face the fact:Star Trek is dead.",4,3,7,17 May 2009
Hugo," Another Sugar-Coated Kids' Story
","There must be a stock process now that all film-makers know of that makes your exterior shots all resemble blue-steel gingerbread houses trimmed with frosting. I don't know what it's supposed to do, from a dramatic point of view, but it's just everywhere lately and Scorsese uses it so much in 'Hugo' you could end up believing that Paris just needs a rub-down with a giant chamois skin to become the world's biggest Hall of Mirrors. Maybe it's a side-effect of replacing genuine photography with CGI. I don't know and I don't care. It looks silly and I'm tired of it.Likewise, I am tired of tales like this one that involve a young child on his own, overcoming false obstacles that mostly take the form of curmudgeons you hope will all love him before the story is over. This film is just one tired clich√© after another of such stuff. The full cast of modern 'Dondi' films is present, with the innocent boy, precocious girl, multiple dubious authority figures, whimsical elders, and so on. You've seen every last one of them over and over.Sure, there's plenty of steam-punk pseudo-wonder intended to keep the lips of your inner seven-year-old pursed into a little 'o' for over an hour. Brass keys, spinning gears, and wind-up contraptions of every kind are in almost every frame of this film, all to make you think that something oh-so-magical is going on in front of you.Ho.Now add to that: hum.While I can't say this one lacked for anything original, it lacked for anything surprising. Each and every set-up is, soon after, resolved in precisely the way you most expect that it will be. Original, perhaps, but familiar all the way.Your inner seven-year-old will love it. Your actual seven-year-old will probably love it too.Grown-ups, on the other hand, may wonder before it's over just what it is that $170,000,000 can buy anymore.",4,10,19,26 December 2011
American Beauty," Dreary chain of non-starters, all for a misfit closing line.
","What an awful film.  There are no characters you can like, or even identify with unless, as apparently its makers expect, you are a dysfunctional chronic depressive who hates his life, spouse, child, sexuality, job, age, parents, and, I guess, credible stories.  This is a badly made quilt of patches, each one composed of the non-story (I'll explain that) of someone so badly messed up that you'll think your most depressed friend should be giving them peer counseling.  And, that's too bad because there are limitless chances to actually do something with characters like these. Instead, each one sort of commences a personal evolution, and hints of humor surround all of these initial bursts out of the gate.  But, then, each one just sort of slows from that first sprint down to a jog, then walk, then kind of aimless amble, producing a non-story, every single time.There is no one you can like, root for, or care about in this movie.  They are all flawed people with easy lives, yet endless anxieties.  None of them tries to deal with their problems, worst of all star Kevin Spacey who deliberately takes a job with 'as little responsibility as possible.'  Even that potentially funny excursion goes nowhere, as we see almost nothing of his new position (which could have been grist for both the comedy mill, and the social commentary this film wants to be perceived as making, but doesn't.)As a kind of grand joke (but really an insult), the very last line, done in narration, tricks you into thinking this worthless piece of grinding misrepresentation was actually some kind of life-affirming, we-shall-overcome example of the human spirit.  Uh... no, it isn't.  If you want that, see, 'The World According to Garp,' a thousand-times better movie than this.  The last time I saw this kind of one-liner attempt at putting an audience in an emotional vice to squeeze out a warm feeling was when one of the characters pointlessly says 'mazel tov' to a victimized Jewish character in a Broadway production of 'Grand Hotel.'  The Manhattan audience, as required, went 'awww.'  But I've warned you this time, so don't fall for it.If you want a slice-of-life movie where things are a little less extreme (read that, 'actually believable'), with some fun spots worth laughing at mixed with its philosophies, see 'The Wonder Boys.'  It's what this movie wishes it were, or should have.  On the other hand, if you are a manic depressive who is never manic, you are going to love 'American Beauty.'",3,3,5,23 July 2001
Avengers: Infinity War," Bring something to occupy your attention.
","Meh.At almost 2-1/2 hours, A:IW is a mish-mosh of tangled story threads that have no place in the same film, barely able to justify their absurdly overlong fight scenes, each of which includes ludicrously inconsistent strengths and weaknesses on both sides.Early snarky dialog gave me the impression that there would at least be the edgy humor that characterizes the best of the Marvel films, but the gaps between instances of such writing are huge to the point of boring.The story is thin, hard to believe (even for a Marvel film), and will be largely incomprehensible unless you remember almost everything from the eighteen other films in the franchise (or, as I was, are willing to pause repeatedly to Google up the answers to your questions).My teenage son often watches videos on his iPhone while simultaneously playing a game on his Nintendo Switch. I find it hard to believe he can really pay enough attention to know what's happening in a video while also playing a game. After watching 'Infinity War,' however, I would recommend having a toy in your hands if you plan to see it.",6,0,3,26 August 2018
The Last Samurai," The Perfect Re-Tread
","Odd film.  Great acting, beautiful scenery, costumes, and photography.  Lots of gory action and a powerful soundtrack.  Macho themes of honor, combat, heroism, revenge, etc., through the whole thing.  And not a single original frame in over two hours of movie film.  It was a combination of 'Dances with Wolves, 'Crouching Tiger,' 'The Seven Samurai,' and (a bit of) 'The Natural.'  It also included some material from an obscure little movie called 'The Challenge,' about a has-been boxer who gets sucked into a battle between a wealthy Japanese man and his brother who runs a traditionalist monastery/karate school over a samurai sword.  Beyond all the stolen concepts, it reiterates the tired theme of a backward, feudal society becoming the equivalent of a giant chessboard for white Western men to use in settling some personal disputes as they 'gift' the locals with their (obviously superior) knowledge of things like how to kill each other.  I was awestruck by the artistry of it, and dumbstruck by the banality of it (since it was an Oscar nominee).  If you haven't yet seen it, I'd say you should, but be ready to hear yourself asking, 'But wouldn't he be dead by _now_?' over and over.",7,0,1,21 June 2004
Up," A Flawed Film from the Pixar Assembly Line
","When 'Tin Toy' and other animated shorts first appeared from Pixar, it was like a breath of fresh air in the world of CGI. Instead of more robots, they boldly took on the challenge of rendering natural subjects, including human beings. The slightly drunken-looking wobbling of some characters (maybe, again, to avoid the precise, laws-of-physics appearance of most other computer animations of that time) was a bit distracting, but the images of flexible objects (like babies) were break-through accomplishments.Now, almost thirty years later, the technology has advanced considerably (close-ups in 'Up' of fabric, fur, and hair, are stunning). But, it looks as though Pixar has hired one set of CGI characters and now has them all fulfilling their multi-movie contracts. If you saw 'The Incredibles,' you will feel as though you've seen these characters before (perhaps, if you've also seen 'Toy Story,' the same way you felt you'd seen those characters before when you saw 'The Incredibles'). In a way, even 'Finding Nemo' and 'Cars' look like they all came from the same factory as this film. Well, they did, but... why should they? The exaggerated features, cartoonish proportions, and overstated gaits (a kind of bunny-hop if the character is young, a Frankenstein's-monster sort of lumber, if elderly) are starting to look very familiar. (Although, inexplicably, given how far the technology has come, the designers feel compelled to include elements, such as Mr. Frederick's slightly polygonal ears, that appear to be concessions to the computer's historical role in films of this kind.)The story itself is flawed, alas. No spoilers here, but it did seem that the main character's emotional responses to events around him were inconsistent, as were his physical abilities. He chooses sides in the (dramatically necessary) conflict, but not the one it seemed that he would have, at least not at first. Also, while the idea that he can fly his house via thousands of helium balloons is well within the accepted tropes of the cartoon genre, it lingers on way too long and becomes an intrusively absurd aspect of the whole film, with scene after scene making it harder and harder not to say, 'Oh, come on now!' In fairness, there are a couple of moments that will bring tears to adult eyes, proving that this medium really can deliver emotional content. If only there were more of that, and less of the outright nonsense, I'd have scored this film much higher.Pixar broke the mold, decades ago. But now they've replaced it with a new one. What once seemed so daring and new, has become ho-hum and commonplace. A cynic, just maybe, would say, 'Hey, they know what sells.' A shame, given that an animator--using a computer or not--is, in the end, not limited by the laws of physics, but only by our willingness to suspend our disbelief.",6,0,0,1 March 2010
Groundhog Day," Funny, full of heart, but lacks the ending you need.
","The other comments on this film are, collectively, pretty accurate, I think. Murray plays the role of the witty cynic, who lives the same boring day repeatedly, with charm and a credible mix of belief and disbelief.  He was the perfect choice for a part that was probably harder to play than he makes it look.  The writing is as good as the acting (almost; see below), moving quickly past the phase where Murray's character comes to terms with what's happening to him (a smart move, since the viewer already knows, and would be bored if it took long on the screen), and on to exploring the various things we might all think of eventually, if caught in the same sort of Twilight-Zonish phenomenon.  The results of the 'hero's' efforts to cope with his problem are satisfying, as is his personal evolution, brought on by the experience of trying.  Only the end, which satisfies the heart, but not the brain, fails to equal the rest of the movie.  You never really learn why or how this extraordinary occurrence came to be.  The film is a fable, or fairy-tale, yet its events are so logically presented, and Murray's ways of dealing with and, finally, gaining by them so grounded in reason that the absence of any explanation leaves a hole in the story and, ultimately, your experience in seeing the film.  This would be a four-star movie, if only they'd filled that gap.",8,0,0,13 September 2001
The Sixth Sense," Come on, was anyone really surprised?
","Imagine what seeing this film would have been like if you had known the ending in advance. All those oh-so-clever scenes where Willis's character alternates dialog with the character of his wife... they'd be about as gripping as a magic trick when you already know that it's done with mirrors.Well, that's how it was for me. At the moment he meets the boy in the church, I turned to my wife and said, 'He's ____.' Honestly, I had not seen any of the promos, nor heard any of the hype, for this film. My wife picked it. So, when I got the 'punch line' early, the next hour or so became a dreary, repetitious slog, with me dumbfounded by the inability of the rest of the audience (I spent about as much time watching them as watching the screen) to see what, I thought, was so blazingly obvious.Great idea(s) in this film, but hanging so much of it on one 'surprise' at the end was a dumb move, in my humble opinion. For those of us who saw it coming (and, really, I'm not the most perceptive fellow around; can so many folks have actually been fooled?), the surprise was that we were still awake to hear our neighbors gasp.",7,1,2,9 July 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Not really satisfying.
","Oddly, Tolkien's wonderful book(s), which seemed to create that all-important sense of 'this matters' when read, did not translate for me to a 'this matters' experience when on the screen.  The movie(s) did a masterful job of rendering both the scenery and the characters.  But, I had to ask myself, 'If this were not based on Tolkien, would I care about the story at all?'It's amazing and puzzling to me that they don't stand on their own.  The book certainly does, and this series of films is rather faithful to that text.  Still, for reasons I cannot fathom, I enjoyed the eye-candy, but not the story.If you love LoTR, you must see these films.  But, to be honest, they would never have gained much of an audience, I think, without the connection to their famous progenitor.",8,3,6,2 July 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Confusing, but pretty to look at.
","Touted as a version of Homer's Odyssey, this could-have-been-great film is beautifully photographed, but makes no sense.  Forced inclusions of Homer's famous characters (The Sirens and Polyphemus being the most broadly recognizable) don't help prevent this oddment from ultimately failing to meet its own goal of being about... well, what?  It's the comic evolution of three men escaping from a Depression-era chain gang.  Clooney, playing the overeducated leader, has some witty lines, drawing their laughs from the misfit way he rambles polysyllabically (sp?) at simple folk who neither know, nor really care much, what he is talking about.  Finally, neither will you, as it turns out he has no real mission.  The character himself turns out to be confused, despite his vocabulary, even to the point of flatly ignoring the severe beating a friend receives while sitting next to him. The 'Odyssey' metaphor ultimately fails, too, as he is not quite rewarded with his archetype's deserts, gaining nothing of any great consequence in the end.  See it after 'Being John Malkovich,' if you liked that film (Carter Burwell, who scored the latter, added some music to this one, too).",6,0,0,18 July 2001
