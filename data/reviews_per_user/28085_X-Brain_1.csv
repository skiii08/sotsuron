Requiem for a Dream," Description of one of the most tense movies ever...
","Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is one of the most tense movies ever. This movie really has an impact. It would be quite wrong to say that it's a film about drugs. The characters solve various intimate problems; and Aronofsky, through hardly seen games, puts the audience into the skin of his characters. All of them have dreams, all of them lose them after getting too much of them. NB: After watching this movie, you would never put a needle into your arm...:-)))",9,0,1,15 January 2004
