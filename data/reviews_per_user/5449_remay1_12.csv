United 93," If You're Not Afraid, You Should Be....
","This nonjudgmental portrayal of the events abroad United flight 93 probably didn't set out to send any sort of a political message. In fact the director went to extraordinary lengths to avoid appearing to have a political point of view. The message came through nonetheless. The message is simple: There are many, many, Islamic Fundamentalists out there who want only one thing out of life -- they want you dead. And they think nothing of killing you for no other reason than being American, or Jewish, or Christian... or anything other than a Radical Muslim. These people are not bearded, turban-wearing, wild-eyed screaming lunatics. They are far too sophisticated and savvy for that. No, they masquerade as students, computer specialists, engineers, clean cut young men you would probably not even notice in a crowd. They are the kind that could call their wife on the phone and say sweetly to her 'I love you,' then get on a plane and kill thousands of innocent civilian strangers, in the name of God. They could be anybody, living anywhere, doing anything... and that's what makes this movie truly frightening.The fact that the story is told without and typical Hollywood hype, corny dramatic devices, or other distractions only serves to point out how terrifying the modern world really is. It is made so as a result of this fanatical terrorist ideology. Regardless of your political position, you are forced by this movie to see the fruits of radical Islam. You are forced to see raw evil. You have no choice. There is no way to sugar coat it. These people are evil and must be eliminated, by what ever means are necessary. As the movie makes clear, it comes down to one thing -- it really is them or us. It really is just that simple. You're either for them or you're against them. Our country's very survival depends on it. I urge everybody to see this fine movie. If you have seen it once, I urge you to see it again. In seeing this movie you will see the truth, and the truth will make you mad.",9,3,6,21 June 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Jack Sparrow on Meth?
","After the notable success of the first movie ever made from an amusement park ride, the writers and directors were trapped. They had to make a sequel -- and probably another sequel, and another, and another. You get the idea. What to do about a plot? After all, the first movie didn't have a story to draw from, no novel, no play, nothing. So they hired some writers and concocted a tale involving lots of pirates, British soldiers, a beautiful damsel in distress, -- a piece of cake. Voila, huge success beyond their wildest dreams. We were ready to forgive the cookie cutter plot drawn from all the pirate movies since Erroll Flynn plied the trade, because, ...well the girl was soooo beautiful, and Jack Sparrow so quirky in a charming sort of way, and everybody else was so earnest, the monsters so scary, etc. We just bought it, big time! Enter the second installment. What to do now? No problem, just bring back Jack Sparrow, only make him ten, no twelve times more annoyingly quirky (I swear he was on drugs through the whole movie) and throw in lots of pirates, the same beautiful girl, and lots of British soldiers, corrupt politicians, monsters from the dead, etc. Another piece of cake.And, judging from the box office, I guess it really is just that easy. Another huge success for a movie... based on an amusement park ride. Who needs an engaging story, or clever plot devices, or great acting? Hey we have scary monsters and lots of computer animation! I have to admit I did enjoy the ride. I just wanted more. I wanted Daniel Defoe. I got Billy Silly Bones instead.It isn't a terrible movie. It is, in fact, the 2nd best movie based on an amusement park ride ever made. It just confirms what everybody already knows: It takes more than lots of sword fights, swashbuckling, sea monsters, cannibals, and pretty heroines in peril to make a really good pirate movie; but if you have enough computer graphics, it won't really matter -- you'll still make a ton of money.",6,1,3,31 July 2006
The Prestige," Well put together -- but not your happy place!
","Utterly gripping turn of the century English theater tale. Excellent period feel, costumes, sets, engaging interplay between all the characters, pacing, cinematography, all first rate. The audience is mesmerized by the magic acts, the romantic entanglements, but at the same time, is left utterly cold by the complete lack of warmth and humanity. This is not a movie for someone looking for a uplifting, positive two hours. This movie is devoid of any warmth. There are no heroes, no good guys, no role models.Scientist/inventor Nikola Tesla, whose work all movie goers have seen, even though they may not know it, figures prominently in this movie. Among other things, he invented the Tesla Coil, which is frequently featured in science fiction movies. The coil generates impressive electric displays, like controlled lightning, arcing between electrodes. The main plot of this movie revolves around the use of this electric 'magic'. The movie is not, however, a scientific documentary, and the leaps of logic from Tesla's scientific experimentation, to magic tricks shown in the movie, requires accepting highly implausible events requiring much suspended disbelief, but that fact doesn't detract too much from the movie's allure. The magic is well enough performed to be engaging and plausible. You want to believe it. It works. The movie doesn't entirely satisfy however. The main thing that does diminish the movie's appeal is the unlikable nature of all the principle characters. You just can't 'like' them, any of them. The movie well worth seeing however. Just don't go when you're in a bad mood already. This movie will only make it worse.",8,3,6,24 November 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Shallowness Taken to New Depths
","About ten minutes into this movie, I was hoping against hope that one of them would strike up a conversation with... maybe a sanitation worker, or a street vendor, or bag lady, anybody with some depth of character -- somebody interesting, real, human!!! What a waste of film!The only character in the movie with any semblance to a real human being was Andy's father -- at least he expressed some genuine love and interest for somebody!? All others were unbelievably shallow, fake, vain, cruel, indifferent, snarkey, smarmy, etc., etc., etc., ... They tried all too hard to impress everybody, and wound up impressing nobody. Real Hollywood types! Why the moguls in Hollywood would think the average movie patron would be interested in such despicable people is a total mystery? Why would they think the main character would be even remotely sympathetic to us all when she displayed her disdain for the 'evil, vain' fashion publishing industry buy quitting to get away from all the phonies, only to take a job with a phony left-wing fraudulent 'newspaper' where she supposed she could 'do real work?' and shack up with a phony, shallow 'sous chef' boyfriend. Don't any of these people have real lives, children, families? In a way, it's kind of sad.What a waste of time. Uhggggg!",2,78,136,6 September 2006
The Village," Good, old fashioned, spooky tale.
","A pox on all the so-called 'serious' movie critics who are panning this fine effort... they are missing the point. The reason some films are made is simple: entertainment. We have become so enthralled with the idea that popular film culture should have a sole mission to bash us over the head with politically correct messages, we are unable to enjoy a good film that only has as its motive to give us a good two hours of fun.This movie is very well crafted, and while it is deliberately slow paced, it satisfies. The 19th century Gothic novels it was paying tribute to are also slow paced. It's all part of the mood the director is trying to set up. The acting is very good, the script is very well written, the camera work effective.If you are looking for a movie with lots of car crashes and political messages, go see something else. Heaven knows you'll have plenty to choose from. If you just want to be immersed in a different time, a different feeling, a different ambiance, go see this movie. You'll be glad you did.",Null,0,0,4 August 2004
The Illusionist," Movie Magic Redux
","The reason you go to movies is to be entertained, period, end of story. After seeing this movie you'll realize that reason is undoubtedly your true motivation more than ever. In this day and age, when every movie seems to be bent on clubbing you over the head with some overt political message, or to nag and goad you into going along with some heavy-handed social arm twisting, what a pleasure it is to discover a movie that returns to the roots of what movie making is, or at least what it truly should be: Escape, imagination, mental challenge, enjoyment, fun... you get the idea. If that is what you look for in a movie, search no further. This movie will whisk you away for two hours of pure fun and escape from your everyday worries and cares. Go, have fun, enjoy. It's worth it. This year we have been treated to no fewer that two turn-of-the-century movies about magic. this one and The Prestige. While they are both good, this movie wins in the 'entertainment' category merely due to its much more likable characters and plot. We can identify the good guys and villains and feel good about the first, while loathing the second. In The Prestige, there aren't any heroes.The movie also possesses one of the best surprise endings seen recently. The magician in the movie keeps you so mesmerized, you don't even notice his true sleight of hand until it is revealed to you at the end. It is truly ingenious, remarkable, satisfying. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't seem to be getting as much press as some others. Perhaps it is a result of the lack of politically correct content, or, more likely, because it was made by independent film makers, but it deserves much more notice, and audience. If you see it, you see why.",9,1,2,24 December 2006
Avatar," The Noble Savage - Done in Blue
","Ah yes, the notion of the Noble Savage. It is a very romantic notion. One that has been portrayed over and over again for centuries and has become the virtual gospel truth for all leftists: The indigenous culture is always superior. While this is a gratuitous assertion, it none-the-less seems to find immediate acceptance in otherwise rational people, such as college professors, philosophers, and now - movie audiences. Like most gratuitous assertions, under the rules of logic, it could be equally gratuitously dismissed: The native culture is almost never superior to the conquering culture. The American and Australian Aborigines, the stone-age peoples of Borneo or Africa were not superior to the prevailing European, Asian or even Middle Eastern cultures that overtook them, in any measurable way, except in the non-quantifiable asserted 'quality' of their inter-personal relationships within their own society, and, to any objective observer, their primitive cultures were vastly inferior. The truth is - they lived short, brutal, disease-ridden, hunger-plagued lives. Anyway, the movie was swell: Lots of gee whiz computer generated special effects, animations, loud (My daughter sums it up correctly. We pay the extra to feel our seats shake.) battle scenes, the obligatory oh-so-evil corporate and military types facing off with the unbelievably noble, loin-cloth-wearing, practitioners of a tree dwelling culture. The blatant anti-capitalist, anti-military bias of the movie wasn't so swell, and nearly ruined the experience.Outside of the ham-fisted political message, it was a good ride; well worth the price of admission.",6,1,7,3 January 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Veni, Vidi, Mendacia
","From a cinema production point of view, this is a fine effort. Good acting, editing, lighting, sound, cinematography, etc. No quibbles there. It was a riveting suspense tale with all the elements of the genre thrown in: False leads, red herrings, -- As a movie, I enjoyed it.As a valid representation of two thousand years of religious history, the movie falls short. While, over the centuries, there has been no shortage of persecutions, killings, banishments, etc. done in the name of Jesus, or the Pope, when you boil them all down, most were really the result of envy, greed, and good old fashioned political rivalry. They were mostly after gain, territory, plunder and glory. To ascribe most if not all malfeasance done during 2000 years to the central motivation laid out in this movie --Jesus was (gulp!)married to Mary Magdalene-- is just silly. Would people really kill each other because some think he was married, and others not? Most people would shrug their shoulders and say 'so what?' Being married would have not been unusual for a Rabbi at the time. What of it? Also, the idea that if he was married, he couldn't have been divine, merits another 'say what, why not?' Many believe that the very reason he alone could atone for all humanity was because, as a divine mortal, he was uniquely qualified to give his life for us. It was his free will gift. He could, of his own free will, sacrifice himself for our sins.Aside from the theological arguments, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this movie was the depiction of all religiously orthodox and devoted Catholics as despicable monsters capable of killing without a hint of conscience. This goes right along with the trend in Hollywood these days: Christianity = evil. Only those who somehow held out the secular ideal of Jesus as just a 'great teacher' but not divine were depicted as good and honorable. This is a hurtful stereotype, and is deeply resented by religiously oriented people, yet it seems to be the stock-in-trade of filmdom these days. For falling into this trap, the movie is cheapened and is almost laughable at times in its excessively evil portrayal of all clergy. Maybe some day, an honest depiction of the overwhelmingly good priests, monks, friars, cardinals, etc. will be made, but it's not this movie.",4,1,2,17 August 2006
August Rush," I Used to Like Music!
","A relative (whom I knew to be a very accurate reverse barometer of movie quality) recommended this stinker to me. She raved and raved, on and on. I know, I should have known better, but in a weak moment I watched it. My family, who have a working knowledge of good music and good movies, spotted the fraud in moments and quickly wandered away. But I, like some pathetic boob, watched it to the dreadful conclusion. By the end I was laughing out loud at the painful, unintentionally hilarious clichés. There are too many illogical, vapid, um ..... cheesy (it really is best descriptive adjective for this tripe) scenes, which crowded in on each other like rats trying to escape a flooded sewer. Speaking of sewer -- Oh the smell! Oh the humanity!Never mind all the schmaltzy lost child and quixotic Fagin references. However, I ask myself in retrospective incredulity, could a movie about music be so utterly devoid of musical quality? Didn't any of the producers or directors even have a modicum of knowledge or appreciation for music? They had to all had to have totally tin ears to allow such musical trash to permeate nearly the whole misguided effort. And what of the classical musicians who were forced by some demonic overlord to perform this wretched stuff? They must have been wearing ear plugs under their long hair. Awful, awful, awful! Do yourself a favor, stay away at all costs. I will never regain the brain cells destroyed by this menace! I will live the remainder of my life haunted by images of o-so pathetic street urchins, gospel choirs (who never sing about God or Jesus?), faux Irish bands with fake accents, and beautiful cello ingenues, who seem to have masted the instrument without knowing any bowing or fingering technique, only to play the most insipid music ever to despoil a sheet of manuscript paper. The small Elgar snippet near the end was fine, but even Elgar couldn't save this movie. Arrg, arrg, gurgle!",1,19,30,26 April 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes - Kung Fu Fighter
","About three minutes in, I had to run out in the Lobby to check what movie I was seeing. I thought I had purchased ticket for a Sherlock Holmes movie. You know. Sherlock Holmes - the genius detective who used his superior brain power to outwit villains of every stripe? But what I was seeing was Sam Spade. Somehow he got transported back to 19th century London and was persuading the bad guys with an astonishing array of knuckle sandwiches, knives and pistols. And the movie just continued in this vein - with Holmes punching it out with assorted thugs, including, I kid you not, Irish toughs who gather in cattle pens at the stockyard and stage fights for a purse. Who was this Holmes impersonator I wondered? I immediately riffled though my A Conan Doyle Complete Serlock Holmes books, and, much to my surprise, was able to find at least two episodes where Holmes talks about using the martial arts to subdue nefarious foes. He is also portrayed in the books as an expert swordsman. However, scenes with Holmes actually deploying fisticuffs apparently don't occur in the books at all. So the movie producers and writers have modernized the current Holmes to make him more appealing to the 'cage fighter' generation. I guess I can forgive them for that. It did make the movie more exciting than the 'snail's-pace' action we got in all of the Basil Rathbone oeuvres from the thirties. In those, Holmes relied almost exclusively on his wits. However this movie used the violence as a plot vehicle too much in my opinion. I do miss Basil, even though his stereotyped version of Holmes also doesn't appear in the books. No deerstalker hat for example. It's not in the book. This movie also captures the tortured, opium-addicted, nature of Holmes quite well. That is mostly missing from the Rathbone movies. Okay, overall this was a good movie, albeit a bit too rough, too little polish, too much bare-knuckles for my tastes. Go see it though. Holmes with wit - and grit to spare.",7,4,7,3 January 2010
The Queen," The Real Star -- Diana
","Helen Mirren will certainly deserve her Oscar next month. (Do you think the members of the Acadamy would dare snub the queen?) However without a doubt the real star of this fine movie is Diana Spencer. After wining the princess role by marrying Prince Charles, she never failed to upstage the royals at every turn and she manages to pull it off again in this movie. The whole point of the movie is to show how they agonize and struggle to deal with her -- even in death. It is truly a fascinating glimpse into the workings of the royal family.For a thousand years, we (And let's not kid ourselves, Elizabeth is as much our queen as England's in spite of two hundred and thirty years official separation since the American Revolution.) have, in turns, revered and disliked the monarchy. We don't really understand them. The English don't understand them, and, in realty, they scarcely understand themselves. The one thing they have proved to be, over the many centuries they have been in place, is resilient. They are capable of evolving, be it at an ever so glacial pace. We leave the movie with a slightly better understanding of what it means to be Queen. The queen will overcome and survive without a doubt!This movie captures exquisitely one of those evolution episodes. Excellently scripted, filmed, staged, conceived and produced. Kudos to all involved. Truly deserving of 'best picture' they will surely get if the Acadamy can, for once, leave political correctness out of it.",9,1,2,19 February 2007
Saints and Soldiers," Powerful war movie gem.
","Every once in a while a little movie will come along totally unheralded, unexpected, under budget, under promoted, but which really shouldn't be missed.Saints and Soldiers is such a movie. If you like lots of big budget special effect -loud explosions, -crashing airplanes, -panoramic scenes with thousands of extras slogging through the mud, -if that's what you want in a war movie, skip this one. It doesn't have any of those things.What it does have, however, is a very effective ensemble cast telling a very compelling story, -a true story, of the Battle of the Bulge. From the utter confusion and tragic consequences of the 'Malmedy Masacre', depicted in this movie as more an accident of the fog of war rather than a cold calculated act, to the final climactic battle scenes, this movie shows world war II as it most likely really was. A very personal war for each soldier involved.My uncle was a soldier who lost a leg in Europe during that time and as he related experiences of battle, he always made it perfectly clear that war was always a very personal thing. You were doing everything to survive. Your enemy was doing the same thing, and somehow battles were eventually won or lost. The average G.I. didn't know, or much care what was going on over the hill, or on a grand scale. He only knew he and a few of his buddies were being shot at by a few of the enemy and they had to shoot back or perish. It's all about living another day.This movie conveys those sentiments very clearly. It is about daily survival without the grandiose trappings. You really wind up caring about each of these characters. It is well worth seeing. Especially if you were a soldier -or know a soldier, -or just want to know more about being a soldier. In my opinion it will go down in history as one of the more realistic war movies ever made.",10,101,137,21 January 2005
