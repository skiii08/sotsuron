The Incredible Hulk," It wont win any Oscars......
","But who cares? This is a good example of a film that was just made to entertain and succeeds. The first half hour are actually quite good, and when he transforms into the hulk it just becomes good, corny fun. It has a really good cast (Tim Roth, William Hurt, Liv Tyler, and Ed Norton as the title character) which helps it quite a bit. The scenes with Norton, who is a great actor, are the best in the film by far. For the rest of the time, just check your brain in at the front desk and enjoy.Their is definitely MAJOR improvement from the 2003 version, and I like that we don't have to see the same boring story that we always see explaining how he came to be the hulk. Near the end, try to control your giggling, don't make the same mistakes I did.",7,2,4,18 June 2008
