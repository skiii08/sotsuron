The Sound of Music," Wonderful Musical
","I resisted watching 'The Sound of Music' for many years. The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me. Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie. I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should. This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles. Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria. Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality. The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows. The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess. We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian. We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world. However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting. In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany. Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss. World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical. Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat. Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards. Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs. The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy. Among these songs are 'Edelweiss,' 'The Lonely Goatherd,' 'My Favorite Things,' 'Do-Re-Mi' and the title song. Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents. Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste. The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting. Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities. Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain. I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture. I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50' television with stereo speakers. I do not have surround sound connected. The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer). I have a bigger issue with picture quality. The color keeps shifting between scenes. In some scenes the color is excellent. In other scenes, the color seems off. At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself. The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying. I hope future releases have this problem fixed. This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should. This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better. I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before. You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family. Enjoy!",6,2,11,22 October 2008
Scream 2," Almost Better than the original
","Wes Craven hits it big again with this amazing sequel! NO one was really expecting this to be better than the original, ( most sequels SUCK ) but this was a much anticipated movie and hit hard hwen it came out. This very closely came to surpassing the original. Sydney still believes that there is a killer waiting to get her, and she's right, with a movie about her life coming out, more muders start to occur. And she soon again finds herself in the middle of vicious murders. And she finds out that it is again a tag team duo, Micky, the freaky film student, and Billy's mother, who also, like her son, seeks good old fashion revenge.... What made this movie so populare was that it took Scream to a new level, bringing in other stars, and having movies inside a movie, and it mixed comedy with horror. Tastefuly, in one of hte first secens, we meet a college class discussing how sequels suck. This all thrown into one makes for a fun movie that is packed with it's share of thrills. I liked the sequel it was better than most sequels turn out however I still prefer the first but it was satisfactory to my demands. The premise of the sequel is that the survivors of the first movie all go on to college as well as three new members to the group and after the movie Stab based on what had happened to them last year came out two people were murdered and they think that they could be next so they are now wondering if it is a person trying to make a real life sequel. I would recommend this to people who have for one thing seen the first movie and liked it. Also if you are going to watch this make sure that you are thirteen or older otherwise it will be to violent for you. Second of all my advice would be for you to watch it with a friend otherwise you may be afraid to pick up the phone if they call. I hope that this review has helped you in making a decision about whether or not you will watch this movie!",8,1,2,6 September 2009
Scream," Lots of Screams Heard
","'Scream', released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others. This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget. Two sequels proceed. Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans. It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film. This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date. It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked). 'Scream' desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a 'serial killer' whose obsession with horror films goes too far. He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them. The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer. Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before? Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat? Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect. And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target. Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully. He doesn't spoof any of them. Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling. He occasionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including 'The Ricki Lake Show'. Meanwhile, he adds the occasional teen humor that relates well to that age group. Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films. He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own. He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense. Horror film commemorations include 'Friday, the 13th', 'Halloween', 'Carrie', 'The Exorcist', and his own 'Nightmare On Elm Street'. Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor 'dressed as' Freddy Krueger. Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted. Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask. While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality. Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining. They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes. Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from 'Halloween'. Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer. The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling. 'Scream' begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time. Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first. Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline. This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.",9,0,1,10 September 2009
