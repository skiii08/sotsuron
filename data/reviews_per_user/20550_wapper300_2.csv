Skyfall," Too much in exchange for very little.
","As a Bond film enthusiast I feel that this film has left out much of the 'Bond' quality and furthermore substituting its content with TOO much thriller/action.This film falls out of the suave bond category and into the more mission impossible-dark knight row. Bardem's performance would certainly do well in the batman trilogy,but it was too much for a Bond film,but nevertheless it was well fitted into its' genre.Regardless,many Bond questions are left hindering around?Where is the large excitement of the classic Bond-on-bond girl thrill?Where's the large impact of the Bond girl? Where was the thrill of the gadgets that's been going on for 50 years?What's with the huge story line deviating from the central figure that is Bond?The presence of the Bond spirit is sensed too little in this film.Now,the entire movie is not a flop.The acting exceeds itself;perhaps one of the best Craig and Bardem performances to date; although not in line with what Bond really is. They somehow managed to form a perfect alloy of past and present,reviving the old Aston Martin to give it a flow of class and bringing forth youth with Q.I think the problem with this bond is that it categorizes itself amongst the viewers.Those who enjoy real old school,like me,would rather have something more classy,like Gold Finger or Casino Royale,leaving all the action for mission impossible or bourne.For those who like the heat then this is all yours.",8,2,7,10 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Simply Astounding!
","To those who have yet to see this movie,I warn you,brace yourselves. Some movies are good,others are great,but very few leave an impact so grand that other films must simply trail in its existence. This picture brings to a conclusion one of the most applauded trilogies of all time. It brings to mind one word-excellence. As usual, great acting. Bale gives life to the amazing batman, Hardy astonishes as Bane and Hathaway fit the film like a glove on a hand,but in the end its all Nolan. Nolan has once again proved himself to be one of the greatest story tellers of all time.Though not filled with iconic lines or epic performances, the story is so well put together that it stirs the emotions within the viewers. It rightfully deserves a spot alongside the greatest. Definitely a 10/10.",9,3,7,28 July 2012
