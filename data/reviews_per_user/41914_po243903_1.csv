Lucky Number Slevin," amazing freaking movie
","hahaha i had to write this after reading a guy's comment, this person had to be like my high school aged sister who if everything isn't spelled out for them they don't like it and turn their brain off, ie her favorite movies include crossroads and swimfan, anywho bruce willis 'allies' with josh hartnett because he had sympathy for the poor kid when his parents are killed and they both cannot go back to normal lives, so they work together to bring those jerks to justice, the entire movie was great, with awesome deaths-the baseball to the face, great dialogue-the whole scene with the cops in back of the van, to a great revenge plot that had me on the edge of my seat, great movie all around, i cant believe i didn't hear anything about it prior and up to releasing",10,0,6,13 June 2006
