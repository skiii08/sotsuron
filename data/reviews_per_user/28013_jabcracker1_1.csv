Source Code," pat ending with just the right little twist at the end (little spoiler)
","As others have noted, there are a ton of movies that have taken advantage of the Copenhagen interpretation in Quantum Physics of alternative realities/parallel universes. And why wouldn't writers jump all over this? It provides for every movie maker's dream... endless concurrent plots and many possible endings!!!It just seems we end up seeing the 'best' come true. Make a wish and see it come true! Especially when love is involved. Because unless you are in the noir or horror genre, love prevails. In some genres, eternities can be pretty grim, but our culture demands some hopeful note if you want to be mainstream.BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING at one loose end... what ever happened to the guy Jake took over in this newly created reality he now inhabits? We are all happy for Jake's character, but no one among us probably mourns for the poor sap who lost his existence for the sake of Jake's!!!Oh well.",Null,0,1,31 July 2011
