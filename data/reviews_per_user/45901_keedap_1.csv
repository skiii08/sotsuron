The Hangover," A very nice movie........awesome
","Well The moment you see stars u have not seen too much you tend to avoid the movie ...(I do) but this movie is a movie worth watching ...You start laughing from the first scene itself .... I loved this movie cause i could relate to lots of things happening in the movie ... I do drink so that was natural ... ..Me and my friends were relating each other to the characters in the movie.... The females might not like the movie, due to the type of humor and male dominated plot. But they should watch it ....The actors have done justice to the characters they got .. ALLEN specially was the pick of the lot...Mr Chow with his accent was decent enough ...would recommend this to everyone .",10,3,6,14 July 2009
