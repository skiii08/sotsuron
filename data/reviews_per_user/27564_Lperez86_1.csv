Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A fun film
","In order to enjoy this film, you have to stop comparing Downey Jr.'s Holmes to any other interpretation of the character you may have encountered. If you take him as a stand-alone character, completely disregard any other interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - including that of the books - then you have a fun, action-packed movie that's guaranteed to entertain. I personally enjoyed 'A Game of Shadows', more so than the first film, and even laughed out loud on occasion. If you walk into this film expecting to be blown away by a complex plot, then you are sure to be disappointed. Instead, accept it for what it is - a fun movie with enjoyable action sequences and Robert Downey Jr. doing what he does best...with a questionable British accent.",6,1,2,5 May 2012
