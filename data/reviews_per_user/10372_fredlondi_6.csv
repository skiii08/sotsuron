The Finest Hours," A Squandered Opportunity **SPOILERS**
","QUESTION: Which of these two stories sounds more interesting?(1) A Coast Guardsman has to pilot a tiny boat into the middle of a storm in order to rescue a group of people stranded on a sinking ship.(2) When his ship is caught in a storm and splits in half, the bow sinking and taking with it the entire bridge crew, an ordinary seaman finds a way to jury-rig the stern half of the ship with a manual rudder steered by his surviving shipmates in an all-out effort to drive it to shore.If you're 'The Finest Hours,' the answer is obvious - the first story.'Wait,' you may be asking, 'what was that about some guy driving half a ship?'Oh, don't worry about that.Yes, this is the biggest problem with 'The Finest Hours' - its fatal decision to tell the story from exactly the wrong perspective. It's a decision so bafflingly stupid I can't get my head around it. It completely ruined the film.Chris Pine plays the aforementioned Coast Guard sailor, and his arc takes up most of the running time. He's not a particularly interesting character, yet from the very beginning of the film, we see everything through his eyes. We see him fall in love with his wife in a first act that drags and drags. It lulls the viewer into thinking he's seeing some kind of romance rather than a heart-stopping real-life adventure. The actual plot ends up blindsiding the viewer.It's not until the second act that you really get a chance to meet Casey Affleck, who plays the seaman on the doomed freighter. Right away, we see he's not respected by other members of his crew, and in fact is a bit of a recluse. But when the storm tears apart his ship, he suddenly finds himself thrust into a leadership role. Taking the initiative, we see him come up with an insane plan to drive the broken part of his ship to shore. And, more unbelievably, it actually works - he even manages to beach the ship within sight of land.But the film doesn't care. I'd be generous in saying that it thinks that both Pine and Affleck's characters are equally compelling, but it just isn't true. Pine's story continually interferes with Affleck's, so much so that we miss some of the most interesting moments, such as the trial-and-error that must have happened as Affleck worked out his radical plan. In its place, we have to endure Pine's dull romantic subplot with his anxious wife, as if the story's really about them at the exclusion of everyone else.The ultimate absurdity is that the film seems to become aware that Pine's arc isn't as interesting, and has to reach to make up for it. The defining scenes are when Pine's boat is confronted with a single wave that is his biggest obstacle leaving and returning to the harbor. Both scenes of the wave are slowed down for dramatic effect. But it's laughable when you realize how small his boat is, and thus, how small the wave must be. It just doesn't compare to the borderline superheroics of Affleck's character which - it must be said - involves traveling much further than Pine ever does.Oh, and I forgot to mention - there are actually TWO ships in danger, which is the whole reason Pine gets stuck with the small boat. We don't see what happens on this second ship at all, or the rescue that takes place. Pine's arc makes it completely irrelevant.This film symbolizes a very real problem in America with regard to its hero worship. There's this mistaken belief that a man or woman in uniform doing his duty is every bit as heroic - or more so - than an ordinary person who goes above and beyond the call of duty. And, don't be mistaken, that's exactly what's going on here. Pine may have been dealt a cruddy hand by having to pilot a small boat, but he's just doing his job in going out there. Affleck, on the other hand, could've easily just given up or tried to save himself - after all, none of his shipmates liked him. But he didn't, and he went well above and beyond what was expected of him. Affleck is the true hero of this story - Pine is merely a supporting actor.Think of this in the context of 'The Poseidon Adventure' (1972) (spoilers ahead on this film, too). Though a fictional film, 'Poseidon' chooses to focus on the normal passengers who try to fight their way to higher ground in a capsized ship. These Affleck-like characters are the heroes of the story, and everything is told from their view. The Coast Guard has a role as well, but they only arrive in the final minute of the film, after the passengers did 95% of the work in saving themselves. Just because the Coast Guard do dangerous work doesn't mean they're always the heroes. And, guess what - they're not as relateable to a typical audience as people like themselves.This is exactly how 'The Finest Hours' should have been made. It should have started with Affleck on the ship and stayed with him for the entire film. We should've learned more about him, why he is the way he is, and why the others don't respect him. We should've seen every moment of his unbelievable courage, and wondered moment by moment if he would succeed. You can still put Pine in the story, but have him show up as one final obstacle. Think of the drama where, after all Affleck does, we discover that the only ship that reaches them is one too small to save everyone. Unbelievable! That would've been such a tremendous reveal and really added depth and action to the story.Who's to blame? Well, the writers, of course. How could they not have seen this? Maybe they wanted to show the heroics of both sides, but really, when you look at the story, the characters just aren't equal. The story demands better than what they gave it. A simple script revision would've fixed this. It's clear such revisions weren't attempted, and they rushed the first draft of the script. For shame.It may seem silly to criticize a film based on real events, but that doesn't mean there's only one way to present it. And if one-half of your story is vastly more interesting than the second half, why not feature it more? At the end of the day, big-budget films like this are entertainment, and you have to put your best foot forward.Two out of ten stars for Affleck's awesomeness, proportionate to how little of it the film lets you see.",2,2,9,14 December 2017
Ready Player One," The bleakest depiction of the future since 'Idiocracy' **SPOILERS**
","Let me say this - I hate video games. I hate them with a passion. I feel that they've made people so creatively bankrupt that the only art they can think to make are drawings of video game characters, and the only videos they can make are themselves reacting to video games. Video games of today are trying to be movies - and vice-versa - and Ernest Cline's novel showed that books are following suit. So, when I heard about this film, I wasn't excited to see it. But I was hoping to be proven wrong, as poorly-promoted films like 'District 9' did in the past. But, right from the start, the film proved to be a chore to sit through. The first fifteen minutes were some of the most visually and mentally exhausting moments I've seen in a movie. You are bombarded with a metric ton of exposition, then a rush through all the 'worlds' of the OASIS with barely enough time to take it all in, then thrust into a race where entirely too much stuff is going on. Wrecking balls swinging, King Kong smashing, cars flipping and wrecking everywhere. The race sequence sounds awesome until you realize the film made two grievous errors. First, for being an escape from a drab and depressing dystopia, the colors used in the OASIS are equally bland and blurry, everything cast through a blue filter. Something more cartoonish with brighter colors would've been a better approach to further distinguish the virtual world of the OASIS from the real world. This leads to the second problem - because the OASIS is depicted in such a drab color scheme, it's very difficult to pick out any of the 'easter eggs' everyone's talking about. I saw this film in IMAX 3-D, and at any one moment - even with thousands of digital creatures on screen - I couldn't see more than four objects at a time. And, more often than not, you don't see things long enough for you to even recognize them.What no one will admit, and die-hard fans of the book will surely deny, is that 'Ready Player One' is basically a rehash of maligned 'The Emoji Movie.' It's an attempt to portray an invasive technology as fun while completely ignoring the real societal harm it's done. Sure, we see how crappy futuristic Columbus, Ohio looks, but there's no awareness of cause-and-effect, that the existence of the OASIS was itself responsible. It's blamed on some nebulous global cataclysm like the equally-awful 'Maze Runner' films. Even one of the villains is actually played by T.J. Miller, the main character from 'The Emoji Movie.'Near the end of the film - which runs about an hour too long - the film's internal logic starts to crumble, making you ask questions like---When a bad guy plugged into the OASIS is just about to complete the Atari 2600 game that unlocks the final key, why does the hero girl in the same room plug herself into the game instead of walking the ten feet up to him to stop him? When the main character is trying to virtually stick the key in the final lock, all the while trying to keep his balance in a truck driving through the real world, why isn't anyone else standing around in the truck trying to help steady him?And when the main character finally prevails, why are all the minions researching pop culture for the bad guy celebrating? Didn't that moment mean they'd failed?Also, let's face it - if a virtual reality video game system became this prolific, there's no way we'd all look like movie stars. Yes, I get no one would pay to see that, but if you think you can spend nearly every hour of the day playing video games and look like Tye Sheridan, you're kidding yourself.On top of all this, the film is just depressing. It's completely ignorant of the emotional weight of its own premise. The defeatist attitude of the main character saying 'There's nowhere left to go. Nowhere but the OASIS' is itself shocking. To think that any generation would be so jaded to think that the rest of the world isn't worth exploring just because others have is just sad. It made me think there are people out there like that already, fat and unhappy as they spend hours on end playing video games and ignoring the outside world. To this film's credit, there is a brief moment where the main character's uncle is shown having wasted the rent money on the game, but this doesn't make the main character reflect on his own choices. And, minutes later, both his uncle and aunt are killed, aborting any satisfying resolution.The film also took a dismissive attitude toward depression itself. The film makes light of suicide, showing a person so distraught over losing his credits in the game that he attempts to throw himself out a window. The plot is also driven by the depression of Mark Rylance's character as Halliday, the co-creator of the OASIS. Each one of his clues left to the gamers was a clear cry for help, pointing to his mistakes and regrets in life. But, again, there's no reflection on the part of any of the characters, no realization that they, too, could be like Halliday in the future, and perhaps want to change their ways in a 'Christmas Carol' kind of way. Nope - it's just on to the next ridiculous action scene.Finally, it was depressing from a cultural standpoint. I found it strange that in 2045 people would not only be obsessing over nostalgic pop culture, but exclusively pop culture from the 1970s and 1980s. It made me truly wonder about the permanence of anything created from the 1990s onward, particularly today, when trends seem to rise and fall quicker than ever. I think the film could've helped itself by having the bad guy be the one focused on older pop culture from the '70s and '80s while the heroes reference things from today. It wouldn't have fixed all the film's problems, but it would've been a start. Overall, 'Ready Player One' painted the bleakest picture of the future in any film since 'Idiocracy.' The visuals and the world of the game (what surprisingly little of it we actually see) is little more than the peeling paint job covering a stark reality. Even the resolution to close the OASIS two days a week couldn't get me out of the depressed feeling I had walking out of the theater. This isn't simply a matter of a film not being for me - it was a genuinely shocking realization of what the world is for some people. The OASIS is fast becoming a reality in our world, and we should take this work as a cautionary tale.",1,3,16,11 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lessons should be learned from this cinematic disaster
","Coming into Thursday's premiere, I remember thinking that 'The Rise of Skywalker' was the most doomed thing ever created. I couldn't imagine any scenario where this film could succeed. If it was terrible, it would be called the final nail in the coffin for a flawed trilogy. If it was mediocre, anything it lacked would be blamed on both previous films, calling the whole trilogy into question. And if, somehow, it was good, it would come off as desperate, trying to cover up the sins of the past. When looking at most of the first reviews, 'The Rise of Skywalker' managed to conjure all of these feelings while accomplishing nothing.To watch this latest trilogy of 'Star Wars' films is to witness the gradual destruction of a franchise - and a fan base. No doubt as I write this, RedLetterMedia, MauLer, Robot Head, E;R, and The Critical Drinker are piecing together the right adjectives with which to dismember 'The Rise of Skywalker' while hacks like Chris Stuckmann and the Nostalgia Critic scramble to make new excuses for Disney. This trilogy has already inspired vigorous debate about the difference between objective and subjective quality in film, and how many supporters of this trilogy don't know the difference between the two, resulting in passionate misunderstandings. With old fandoms challenged by new ignorance, the result has been some of the most explosive debate on the internet - debate which shows no signs of slowing down.YouTube fortunes on both sides have been built on every misstep of these three space adventures. 'The Force Awakens' was a hard reset that shattered the logical progression of the series while shunning the original cast. 'The Last Jedi' was so obsessed with subverting expectations that it played out like a comedy, its 'woke' feminist agenda ironically undermined by the incompetence of its new female characters. 'The Rise of Skywalker,' then, is the moment all that damage has caused the entire structure to collapse. From the first scene, we see all the magic of 'Star Wars' has crumbled away, leaving the flaws of all three films clear for all to see. All you can do in the theater is just shake your head and wait for it to be over.By attempting to patch up the mortal wound Rian Johnson inflicted on the series with 'The Last Jedi,' J.J. Abrams has done nothing to fix them - he's only drawn more attention to those mistakes. The red welds in Kylo Ren's re-assembled helmet, which somehow still has a functioning voice modulator. So many lightsabers brought back into the fight scenes that it becomes cumbersome for Rey to carry them, never mind use them. Luke's pitiful 'I was wrong' quote on the island where, just one film earlier, his character was destroyed beyond repair.The few cool moments in the film each carry a tinge of sadness when we realize how much better they could have been if there had been some clarity of purpose other than making tons of money. Every character moment, unfitting bit of comedy, or action sequence rings hollow. And this builds throughout the film until you are quite literally pulled out of the action.As with 'The Last Jedi,' the unintentional humor outshines the scripted jokes. In this film, we discover Rey and Kylo are nothing more than Wile E. Coyote and the Road-Runner. Kylo throws all his Dark Side ACME gadgets and weapons toward his adversary, but with inexplicable ease the utterly perfect Rey gets away time after time. Kylo loses over and over, and yet the film keeps telling us to get hyped for the next battle, because THIS time it'll be different. The outcome becomes so predictable it's laughable.In the final act, Rey and Kylo even fight over who gets to suffer the most dramatic death. Kylo is thrown into a bottomless pit, then somehow climbs out to find Rey's lifeless body. He holds her until his power brings her back to life and they kiss. But the fangirls in the crowd barely get a chance to 'squee' before Kylo is immediately raptured out of his clothes, followed by his mom.This is the only time the film - begrudgingly - allows there to be any consequence to the action. The rest follows the Marvel strategy of not wanting to murder its darlings:The film teases the death of Chewbacca during perhaps the most hilarious scene in the film, when a force-pull tug-of-war over an escaping shuttle craft leads to it exploding into pieces. Then Chewie just shows up again with a simple 'I guess he was on another craft.'C-3PO's memory wipe is presented as an emotional climax in the trailers, and it happens after another tone-deaf scene where he comes up with another idea before he's unplugged. But then the film lets him have his memories back, uploading his mind from the 'unreliable' R2-D2.Poe finds himself piloting the only ship still in the air after the rest of his squadron is shot down one by one. All the while, a preposterous number of Rebellion ships sits in the near distance, watching all the 'red shirts' get picked off before they decide to make their grand entrance.This clashes with the few actual emotional scenes in the film, which are so rushed that the viewer doesn't get the chance to feel anything. While we get to see reactions to Princess Leia's death, the moment comes and goes with surprisingly little fanfare. It's just one scene among many. The film becomes a stunt show, trying to keep up enough speed to launch you over one plot hole after another so you don't notice them right away.I don't entirely agree with the common complaint that 'The Rise of Skywalker' is a 'jumbled mess.' That's giving the movie too much credit. The film gives the appearance of complexity, but it quickly becomes so mundane that it's boring. It's all stuff we've already seen, done as safe as possible - not a coincidence since J.J. Abrams also did 'The Force Awakens.' What I expected to be a complete train wreck was instead Star Wars' answer to 'Waterworld,' a film with a bunch of stuff happening, but with neither heart nor intrigue. The tried-and-true distractions of the previous films just don't work here, and it shows. It was disappointingly easy to remove myself from the experience.As with any disaster, if anything positive is to be gleaned from 'Rise of Skywalker' and the rest of the trilogy, it's that perhaps lessons will finally be learned - lessons that have gone ignored for decades. Sequels, reboots, and remakes have sapped all creativity and swallowed the movie industry whole. Perhaps this will be the moment when Hollywood will realize they should focus on telling interesting stories that aim to be both entertaining and timeless, rather than shoehorning incompatible characters and themes into franchises with brand marketability. Maybe then we will all realize that writing is the true engine of film - not star power and visual effects - and that writing alone deserves the most care, attention, and respect. Maybe then, all this waste will not have been in vain.The worst part is what this means for the average 'Star Wars' fan. I didn't grow up with this series, and so the disappointment of this film didn't affect me more than the average moviegoer. But when I see someone dress up as Han Solo, or decorate the back of their workspace with toys, I know this must hit them the hardest. For their loyalty through thick and thin, they deserved better, and because of the cavalier attitude of both Disney and the film crew, the opportunity to make good has been squandered. This is not the world's greatest tragedy, but it's not to be dismissed as some triviality.Those fans are owed a refund at least, and an apology at most.",3,23,40,21 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Visually stunning film about an unwilling protagonist
","It's very hard to break new ground in the superhero genre. Not only have Marvel and DC fallen into their own unique set of clichÃ©s, but movies like 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Deadpool,' each intended to subvert tropes, became old hat by their sequels.Visually, 'Into The Spider-Verse' is indeed a departure from several of these formulas. The animation is unique and fascinating, a colorful blend of digital and comic-book-style animation that was fun to watch (though at times made me wonder if I was watching a 3-D film without the glasses). There's a genuine effort to breathe new life into the genre and have fun with the source material, including its flaws, which was a welcome change from the garden-variety superhero film.As much as I was impressed by the visuals, I couldn't help but feel a strange disconnect throughout the entire film, like trying to see something through the fog. It broke my immersion just enough to pull me from the story.A nagging gripe I had about the film is the way the characters were handled. This felt like the cinematic equivalent of the 'Overwatch' video game where diversity and character designs are substituted for creating interesting characters. Like Widowmaker and Tracer, these are characters designed to be drawn by a multitude of artists on Twitter - particularly in the NSFW realm, despite many of them being high school age and the Anime-inspired Penny Parker clearly even younger. This is further ironic because Penny has so little screen time and is given an emotional scene during the climax that is completely unearned.Even Miles, who we spend the most time with in the film, doesn't have a clear motivation to become a superhero. Prior to being bitten, he doesn't have any motivations at all. He's not by nature altruistic and treats his newfound powers as an irritation, something forcing him to conform, just like the prep school his parents put him into. Both as a student and, later, a superhero-in-training, older figures are frustrated that they can't seem to get Miles to focus on improving himself. He's inhibiting himself, and at least one teacher calls him out on it.About all Miles wants to do in this film is vandalize New York with stickers and spray paint, something he does from the very first moment we see him right up to the end credits. The closest thing he does to channeling this interest is spray-painting one of Spider-Man's suits to make his own. Any arc of him turning his talents toward art, like a similar character in 'Equalizer 2,' is instead big-footed by a typical Marvel plot to which he is completely unsuited. While there are times that he seems to be picking up skills from his cohorts, none of these lessons have any permanence in his mind. He gives up near the film's climax with frustrating ease, and the group all but gives up on him.In this way, Miles reminded me of Nick Cannon's character in 'Drumline' - someone with clear talents, but no desire to refine them, instead wanting to have respect handed to him without putting in the work. In both films, we do not see a protagonist change, but instead, others around him changing in order to accommodate him. The only difference in 'Spider-Verse' is that when the other superheroes change, they do so in spite of Miles, and not because of him.It's unfortunate because Miles, unlike Nick, is a good kid in this film, despite his lack of motivation. He's not unlikeable - he's just unfocused. It's a consequence of the writing. There's a clear gap between the scared and inattentive Miles through most of the film and the sudden completely-in-control hero who dominates in the last five minutes. The mastery of his skills comes to him suddenly and without reason, which was frustrating because of the care taken in most other aspects of the film. Seeing him actually choose to change in that way would have been so satisfying.There are a lot of positives to take from 'Into The Spider-Verse.' It is a bold-looking film that takes a lot of chances, including some very real stakes on both sides. I just wish the characters, particularly Miles, were handled the same way.",7,1,15,3 January 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A failed historical fiction with absolutely no sense of history or intrigue *SPOILERS*
","'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' takes the 'Harry Potter' series in a new and exciting direction through its use of historical fiction. The story takes place in New York after 1929. In the opening scene, our hero Newt finds out firsthand how difficult it is for immigrants to get through Ellis Island. Many from other parts of the world are turned away just for being seasick, or for the new quotas instituted by the government, as was really the case back then. Newt barely gets through the exhaustive inspection process, enduring many indignities before he finally reaches land. The event humbles the aristocratic magic user, but also focuses him on the task at hand.The reason for this heightened security is a sense of paranoia in America stemming from the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, both cataclysms blamed on witches and wizards hiding within the country. The misery suffered by unemployed Americans standing in bread lines helps fuel the anti-magic movement, known as the Ku Klux Klan, into a furor. The biggest moment came before Newt's arrival, when a mysterious person revealed to the newspapers that wizards and witches live in opulent hideouts, resembling speak-easys of the ongoing Prohibition. Word of a grand conspiracy is afoot.Newt is on a mission to heal this divide and expose the true terror behind what's been happening in America. He knows the villainous Grindelwald is on the loose, that it was he who leaked the existence of magic to the American muggles, sparking the anti-magic Klan movement. With the humans distracted, Grindelwald wreaked magical havoc on the stock market, leaving the muggles frightened and subservient. Then he teleported to the Midwest, infecting the soil with his dark magic until it blew into choking clouds of dust.Newt has traveled to America as he has learned of Grindelwald's third and most ambitious plan yet. A plan to help the fledgling Nazi party through their fascination with the occult. Though he's uncertain if he's up to the task, Newt has brought with him a suitcase filled with magical creatures in hopes that they can help him stop Grindelwald. He finds a small group of rebel magic-users who he hopes will stop this villainous plan before it's too late.No.No, wait.I'm sorry, none of that happened.'Fantastic Beasts' is a completely squandered opportunity. Despite being a period piece, it has no sense of history and uses the time period as little more than an opportunity to let its characters wear period clothes. The film takes pains to tell you it's taking place during the mid-1920s - before the Depression - and though the twenties are still 'roaring,' everything looks drab and dull as if the Depression had, in fact, happened. This decision has long-reaching consequences as it prevents the film from being historical fiction.There is an Ellis Island scene, but again, nothing is done with it. Newt breezes through the checkpoints with virtually no incident. The film also made clear that Newt wasn't an immigrant, but someone who's simply visiting, further preventing this scene from being used to its fullest potential.There is an anti-magic movement in the film, but there's no reason for it to exist. The 'roaring twenties' were a time of carefree excess, a time where the U.S. economy was booming after World War I. There's no crisis known to the humans that justifies such a movement taking place, as the Depression, the Dust Bowl, or even the rise of the Nazi party could have. Grindelwald is in this film, too, but isn't even revealed until the very end of the film. His nebulous presence is used in place of any real-life historical events, and is thus much harder to understand. Having seen the trailer for the sequel, it's clear this was done merely to keep this going as a series, which was to the complete detriment of this first installment.In short, this is what happens when a British person tries to understand American history or American culture. Just like John Oliver has before, J.K. Rowling failed.I'd have less of an issue with these decisions if the film had something much more interesting waiting on the other side. Unfortunately, there isn't. The entire film is very drab, dull, and slow-paced. The characters with the single exception of Jacob Kowalski (played by Don Fogler) remind me of the Jedi from 'The Phantom Menace' - they act without passion and act a little too secretive, concealing their motivations from the audience. Only Kowalski's story is relatable as the 'everyman,' but even then it's uncomfortable watching him be manipulated by the female love interest pretending to like him.The result was quite possibly the most boring film I've ever seen. Longest two hours I've spent in a theater. What a waste.",1,4,13,6 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," **SPOILERS** Avengers: The Last Jedi
","'It wasn't as good as Infinity War.' That was all I could say as I stumbled home after two in the morning. It's taken some time, but I'm starting to understand why.The biggest problem I had with this film was how all the superheroes seemed to act as if 'The Snap' happened only to them and no one else. The entire first act shows the cast depressed because they lost, and because of who they lost among their group. While this is understandable, it seems to be the only thing they care about. They only want to avenge the loss of their own loved ones, not the horror suffered by the rest of Earth.This isn't just my interpretation of the writing - the effect on the rest of humanity is almost completely hidden from view. As to the larger global cataclysm, we only get a few glimpses - Hawkeye's family, a memorial in San Francisco, a few people who show up to Captain America's grief counseling group. Other than that, we're merely told about the larger effects of that moment, such as when Black Widow states the Earth's governments are in ruins. It too well concealed the terror suffered by so many others on Earth, as if the writers themselves weren't sure how to convey the magnitude of the act.At the same time, the film assumes the surviving humans all know that Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet were the reason behind half of the world disappearing. This raised several questions:First - how would they know that? Was humanity ever told that Thanos would wipe out half of existence if The Avengers failed? Do they even know what the Infinity Gauntlet is? Who would've been there to see it when it happened outside Wakanda's secluded African community? When people saw others turn to dust, wouldn't they think it was terrorism, a plague, or something entirely different?Second, if they were told, who did it? How did everyone react when they heard? And wouldn't they be upset at The Avengers for failing to stop Thanos? Why, five years later, would some kids walk up to The Hulk and take a selfie with him as if nothing had happened? You'd think our heroes would have been chased into hiding, not hanging out in their perfectly functioning headquarters to quip at each other.Much like 'The Dark Knight Rises' and the Anime 'Sword Art Online,' 'Endgame' relies on a sudden jump forward in time to avoid answering these and other compelling questions. It is in the five years after 'The Snap' that we could have learned more about humanity's response to the disaster, and how if at all The Avengers were blamed. After all, we know from the very beginning of the MCU, when Tony Stark reveals his secret identity, that humans know superheroes exist. It's these interactions between humans and the heroes that have driven much of the narrative in the MCU.But instead, at this most critical time, we're simply moved ahead to a moment of tenuous calm, thus allowing the Marvel brand of humor to continue despite the unfathomable tragedy. To the film's detriment, this isn't the most interesting time for the story to take place. And to make it worse, humanity has absolutely no role in shaping the narrative of the story. We're not even certain everyone comes back after The Avengers craft a gauntlet of their own - it's all done symbolically, without any of the emotion or consequence.As if gripped by the same depression of the film's characters, we're then thrown head-long into a ridiculous time travel plot that fills the film's second half. Thanks to the film's greatest hero - a rat - Ant-Man returns from out of nowhere, and while stuck in the Quantum Realm also seems to suddenly understand everything about time travel despite being a common thief. Tony Stark's concept of building a time machine also comes to him from out of nowhere. It would've been interesting to see this plan be an act of desperation by brutally depressed characters, all of them knowing the act is impossible, but just looking for something to do.But, of course, it works, and the film then partakes in its true passion - celebrating the MCU itself. Like a terrible clip show from a long-running show, much of what follows is everything you've already seen from nearly two dozen films, re-enacted all over again. It's quaint for hardcore fans of the series, but for me, it left me wondering if something more interesting could've been done in its place. The film can't even escape making the same mistake so many other films do by couching their time-travel plan in terms of still other movies, like 'Back To The Future' and even 'Hot Tub Time Machine.'The inevitable over-indulgent fight signals the end of the film, featuring a chorus line of all the characters coming back as if preparing to take a final bow. It's the big applause moment of the film, but somehow still comes off rushed. We don't get any understanding of what it was like when each of them came back, and what effect it had on their loved ones left behind. We don't understand - other than a few lines from Spider-Man - what it felt like to be one of the murdered from Infinity War. It's at this moment you realize why they didn't show anyone else come back after the second 'Snap' - once again, humanity took a back seat to allow the superheroes a dramatic entrance. But, for a three-hour film, it really lacked the weight the writers were clearly going for.In the fight itself, we're treated to many absurdities. The maligned Captain Marvel, who after nearly ending the film all by herself in the first five minutes literally told the audience 'you're not going to see me for a while,' shoots in from out of nowhere and effortlessly destroys a ship, just as she had in her own film. She then joins a group of female superheroes who pointlessly pose for a moment, then unlike the male characters screaming and attacking, choose to scream and attack. On top of this 'Force Is Female' crap, the whole sequence is shot like a DC fight scene, complete with an ugly brown filter over the colorful characters. But, hey, when it's all over, Thanos gets to die a second time.To round things off, the film follows 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' in gleefully letting the past die. While Iron Man gets an epic and dignified death - unwillingly, having started a family of his own - others aren't so fortunate. Captain America voluntarily becomes old, handing over his shield to his black friend Falcon. More wokeness ensues when Thor, transformed by depression into 'The Big Lebowski,' hands over the keys to his sad little village to the Valkyrie woman from 'Ragnarok' who can't act. One after the other, your favorite superheroes survive their greatest challenge only to voluntarily give up the reigns to a group far less interesting or talented. Then the actors sign their names 'Star Trek' style, you wait 11 minutes for no after credits sequence, and its finally time to go pee.Once again, even in this biggest and most anticipated superhero film, this is yet another example of writers not taking the time to play with an idea and make their story the very best it could be. It's not a terrible film, but it's not a complete one, either. Tragically caught between racial and sexual politics, rabid fans, and Disney corporate, it lets a little too much of the outside world water-down a good story.",5,66,129,30 April 2019
