Scarface," Pacino is the ultimate movie drug lord..
","Pacino is utterly masterful in his portrayal of drug lord Tony Montana. Great movie, famous for it high level violence but what people fail to realise is that the truly 'violent' scenes are not shown but simply implied by the audience.",10,0,1,18 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great story, disappointing movie
","Was it the fact that we expected too much, or did it just fail to deliver? That is the question. I am not alone in thinking certain aspects were simply added for the sake of a target audience, namely small children. The Jar Jar Binks character is the most annoying thing ever on screen, even C3-PO won us over eventually but Jar Jar simply spoils what should have been a great movie. The special effects are simply that, very special, this is definitely one of the most visually appealing movies in the sci-fi genre. Its a pity that ths story wasn't the focus here and the marketing of childish characters was, lets hope we get less of Jar Jar and more of the brilliant story we have come to love in the next 2 installments.",7,0,1,19 April 2001
The Exorcist," Testing your faith...
","As we have been desensitized by movies in the modern era, The Exorcist is one of those unique movies that creates controversy to this day. Probably more disturbing than scary it focuses on the demonic possesion of a young girl. Where normally a slow build up is not in a movie's best interest, in this case its the slow build up which adds to the tension and anxiety of the viewer. Its more a case of you know something bad is going to happen and even though you think you are prepared for it, the sheer disturbing nature of watching a young girl act and look so horrible is something you can never forget. Not something you can watch too many times but it certainly makes you take a stand in your faith or lack of and is a one of a kind film.",10,0,1,19 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The best martial artsfantasy movie ever..
","The only way you might not like this movie is if you arent a fan of the fantasy or martial arts genre. The great cast and beautiful locations are spellbinding, not to mention the awesome special effects with every fighting sequence.",10,0,0,18 April 2001
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Better than Pulp Fiction!!
","Great movie, great story, great cast. This is one fast and funny movie. If you enjoyed Pulp Fiction then I highly recommend this. If you can get around the accents and slang you will be in for a treat, it moves very fast and has you hooked from start to finish.",10,0,0,18 April 2001
