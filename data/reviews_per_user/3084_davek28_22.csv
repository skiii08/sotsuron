The Devil's Advocate," Powerful
",I saw this on TV recently and thought it was a very powerful film. Definitely worth watching.My only criticism is that I got fed up of Al Pacino shouting towards the end.  Oh - and why didn't Charlize Theron's character just head home when things started getting weird?Okay - so it's borderline whether it's worth seeing or not.  Just playing Devil's Advocate here....,7,0,1,5 August 2001
The Blair Witch Project," I'd rather watch paint dry
","I guess you either love it or you hate it.  I just saw it on video, and I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters, and the ending just left me cold and unmoved.  Whilst I hate gory splatter flicks and admire the return to a more psychological horror style, this was the first time I actually felt I'd wasted money renting a video.",1,3,5,25 April 2000
The Avengers," Crash bang wallop
","I don't usually comment on a film for which I'm completely neutral, but this film deserves a neutral comment as it's such a waste of time and money. It exhibits the typical American obsession with violence and little or no character development. After fast-forwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot, I still didn't care what happened to anyone, including the planet.Scarlet Johansson is completely miscast as the Black Widow. She should be tall and willowy. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the Hulk as it suits his style of acting, which is usually dumb.I really am a fan of Joss Whedon and own the entire Buffy collection, but I counted two - maybe three - snappy lines of dialogue in this. Very disappointing.I was going to give it 5 out of 10 but decided it deserved 6 towards the end - barely. Just too corny for words and silly in the extreme.",6,3,8,16 October 2012
Gravity," Crisp 2D High Definition would have been nice
","I don't know if this movie is being shown in 2D as well as 3D, but I found the picture to be dark and fuzzy. I kept wanting to remove the glasses in order to be able to see more clearly but, of course, that doesn't work.Aside from having to suspend disbelief in several places, it was entertaining enough - but just enough. Yes, the special effects were good. But why did it have to have the usual element of schmaltz required by Hollywood films? If Ryan had to have a psych evaluation prior to qualifying as an astronaut, I think she would have been rejected. Who wants a potential suicide case in space?I was looking forward to this (I don't visit the cinema much these days) but I have to say it didn't excite me. It wasn't a revelation. It was a good film, but that's all. So 7/10 from me, which basically means I liked it but have no desire to see it again.",7,0,2,18 November 2013
The Big Lebowski," Keep these people away from me.
","Fortunately, I recorded this film off Channel 4 (UK), so I could fast forward through all the dialogue.  Don't get me wrong - I like films with lots of dialogue.  But in this case, they were just shouting at each other, ranting on about nothing much at all.  Lots of angst wasted over trivialities.I was willing to be won over by a Coen brothers movie - I really enjoyed Fargo - but this just seems such a waste of celluloid (or whatever they use for film stock these days).  Great performances, but if I never knew it was there, I wouldn't miss it - and I don't.I hope that makes sense.  The Big Lebowski certainly doesn't.",5,2,7,5 August 2001
Knocked Up," So-so sort-of comedy with the occasional titter
","It just proves that the standard of movies is dropping all the time that this film was given good reviews when it was released in the UK. As I prefer not to share my film-going experience with the popcorn and Coke crowd these days, I rented it on DVD. I at least expected something tat would cheer me up, but this was just too infuriating for that. I'm used to suspending disbelief in order to enjoy science fantasy films, but I find it very hard to suspend disbelief when it comes to films that are supposedly situated in real life.Katherine Heigl's character would never, NEVER, **NEVER** sleep with this guy - even if she was drunk. Having done the impossible deed, it is even more unlikely that she would actually grow to like the idiot afterwards - let alone love him.I think I got 4 or 5 vague laughs out of it, so it wasn't all bad, but the basic premise that this gorgeous, successful woman would hook up with a sad, tubby loser with even worse loser friends is just too hard to accept.",6,0,1,29 March 2008
Underworld Awakening," I enjoyed it
","I really do not see why everyone has such a downer on this. Maybe I was in just the right mood (having just watched 'Saving Mr Banks') but beautiful Kate Beckinsale in tight, shiny black PVC shooting impossible guns at ridiculous monster Lycans was just what I needed. Resemblance to the TV series 'Believe' (and the girl did look a little like Bo) kept my interest. The cameos by local (to the UK) Thespians was a bonus. Everyone was attractive, the action was great, the soundtrack was punchy and it looked good throughout.Yes there may have been some goofs in there, but I wasn't looking for them as I was just enjoying it as pure entertainment and not being picky!",7,3,6,10 May 2014
Pitch Black," Lacks credibility
","If their craft was disabled, why did it crash on a planet and not get pulled into the stronger gravity of a sun? How come they managed to arrive just before an eclipse which happens every 22 'years'? Assuming that lifeforms adapt to their environment, why do all the animals on a planet which is constantly in sunshine (3 suns) live underground? The planet should be totally uninhabitable.  Nearby planets and suns would cause havoc with the atmosphere - if there's any left at all.  At best, it would share a very thin atmosphere with its ringed neighbour. Barring all that, it'll make a nice late night feature on Channel 5 in a couple of years.Dave K",5,0,1,26 November 2000
Silver Linings Playbook," Rom without the com
","I really don't know what the fuss is about. Silver Linings Playbook was getting good reviews, so I decided to see it. However, I then watched the online trailer and it put me off completely as it looked like the kind of film I hate. But a special offer and a free afternoon took precedence. It started out loud and manic and I hated it, as expected. Gradually, it moved through tolerable to not bad. So from an initial 5/10 it crept up to 7/10 by the end. It's certainly not Academy Award fodder, though. I still fail to see what's so great about it.I find Bradley Cooper irritating and have never liked Robert DeNiro, but I do find Jennifer Lawrence fascinating. She always seems to immerse herself in her characters and appears to have no vanity whatsoever (except at premieres and awards ceremonies), which is refreshing. Sometimes she looks plain and sometimes attractive, but she's always intriguing. In my opinion, her performance is the only reason to pay to see this film.I didn't laugh once, but I did cry at the (spoiler) happy ending. A predictable ending, but welcome nonetheless.",7,4,9,26 November 2012
Face_Off," What a load of rubbish
","I've been putting off watching this film since it was first released, but I finally gave in -- and regretted it.  If a film is good enough I can usually suspend my disbelief, but this one takes the biscuit.  Having tolerated the usual Hollywood shoot-em-up gun culture in the first 30 or so minutes, I was then presented with this ridiculous operation to switch faces.  At that point, I fast forwarded to where Nick Cage wakes up and finds his face is missing.  What utter tripe.  Sorry, but I'd rather watch a cheap 50's horror B-picture.  I abandoned the whole farce at this point and will never be tempted to revisit it, unless someone threatens me with laser surgery or else.3 out of 10 for having Gina Gershon in it.",3,2,5,14 May 2002
Bridesmaids," Complete pants
","There should be a film classification which restricts admission to people UNDER a certain age. In the case of Bridesmaids it should be restricted to under fifteens. That's about the level of humour of this film. Despite the good reviews it's actually a pile of inane, predictable, juvenile rubbish.I really wanted to like it, but it was just embarrassing. I felt no sympathy at all for any of the characters. If I enjoyed slapstick and gutter humour I might have liked it better. Every 'joke' was stretched out beyond its limits. Overall, a painful experience.This is a final line of text to get past IMDb's silly restriction on too-short reviews. Bridesmaids is still rubbish.",5,30,58,19 November 2011
Meet Joe Black," Needs editing down to 30 minutes or so
","I love Claire Forlani and felt sorry for her wasting so much acting talent in this long-winded overblown pretence of a movie.There are so many holes in the 'Death Takes a Vacation' plot that as soon as Mr Pitt got his I was wishing that he hadn't and it had been developed as a straight realistic love story between Susan and Thingy (Pitt - we never find out his character's real name).So we get to see even more of the rich side of America and how angst-ridden they all are.And don't even get me going on that laughable stuff with the terminally ill Jamaican woman and Pitt's patois.No wonder I prefer European films. I get so fed up of this kind if US tripe, full of faux sentimentality and Life Lessons.And finally - Susan seemed to figure out exactly what Joe Black was, and that he'd been switched back with the original guy that she met in the coffee shop. HOW???A friend of mine lent me this DVD on the basis that it's the best film she (note - She) has ever seen and she watches it repeatedly. Maybe if Brad Pitt (miscast, in my opinion) hadn't been in it she might have thought differently.Sorry for the rant, but I just had to let it all out. I feel better now.",5,1,2,20 August 2005
Ex Machina," Mad scientist creates life
","I seldom go out to a cinema to see films any more, but this one drew me in. It is fascinating throughout and delivers a few plot twists towards the end which are just elegantly satisfying.I give it 8/10 as I enjoyed it so much, but also because I think there were 20% plot holes. The denouement happened so fast that I doubt that it could have happened in practise. Too many practical issues. The same is true of the mad scientist's laboratory - certainly with today's technology. Maybe if it was set 20-30 years hence it might be more credible.Kudos to all the actors, including Sonoya Mizuno who was just as accomplished in her small part as the others in their three-hander. I somehow doubt that Nathan could have acquired his massive volcano - er - villain's lair in Norway with that abrasive alcoholic personality, but hey.Don't think about it too much, just enjoy the mood, the photography, the effects and the amazing score. I want to see it again just to confirm my suspicion that there are plot holes aplenty, and I have to see that disco sequence again!",8,2,16,26 January 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," What am I supposed to relate to?
","There isn't a single sympathetic character in this whole mess. It's like getting on a fairground ride while it's in motion after you've eaten too much. It's vaguely nauseous, meaningless, pretentious, expensive drivel.Beware the Bingety Bong of the Throob and the Doodly Squot of Broot. Made up names with made up personalities, if they have personalities at all. How anyone can relate to this tripe is beyond me.Sorry for venting. It just makes me angry that so much time and money went up in virtual smoke to put this on the screen. Oh - someone said it's supposed to be funny. Huh? There are jokes? I must have missed them while I was fast-forwarding through the action sequences.Painful waste of everything. Cinema is better than this. I actually like graphic novels, but please leave comics on pulped trees where they belong. 5/10 is generous.Edit: I just remembered that I saw 'John Carter' (of Mars) on TV recently and enjoyed it much more than Guardians. Yeah - I'm surprised, too! But I could relate to the characters and follow the plot much better in Carter than in Guardians.",5,3,9,24 January 2015
Cold War," I was taken in by the hype and the trailer
","I loved Pawel Pawlikovski's previous films - especially Ida - but this didn't work for me. The leads are competent enough but don't seem to have any chemistry. The music is nice but the staged numbers should have been in wide-screen colour. The main female character, Zula, is very unsympathetic. All she wanted was to be mistreated by everyone, including the world in general.A shame, as I wanted to like it. It's not a love story. I honestly don't know what it is. A tragedy, maybe. But I didn't feel any sympathy for either of the two main characters.",6,6,13,17 March 2019
The Shape of Water," Corny, derivative tosh
","What a load of corny, derivative tosh this turned out to be. I can understand why it won an Oscar for production design, but, best film? No way.It initially mad me think of Amelie. It has that kind of not-quite-reality feel about it. So it was good to look at, with nice music, but nasty violence and an inevitable Bad Guy. Why do American films always have to have a Bad Guy? Usually the military.I failed to feel any sympathy with anyone except for Octavia Spencer's character, Zelda. Everyone else had An Agenda. And, as usual, the whole thing is, sadly, reduced to firearms.Interesting to see good old Nigel Bennett from Wolverhampton (UK) playing a Russian. Not sure how good his accent was, but probably not as good as the genuine Russians in The Americans.Why are films built up so much by critics only to be a disappointment? The films critics hate also seem to do better at the box office.",5,3,9,14 July 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Watching bad people spend other people's money
","I must have missed something as I didn't find this film humorous in the slightest. For the best part of three hours we watch despicable leeches making money from innocent investors who have no idea what kind of animals are on the other end of the phone. This is the ugly face of capitalism taken to an extreme. Unfortunately, I suspect that this kind of extremism still exists.As a film, it's good enough but could have been heavily edited to remove all the tedious orgies and rousing speeches. As I was watching this on blu-ray I fast-forwarded through some of the awful druggy episodes and long-winded treatises.I have to admit that Leo does a good turn and puts his all into chewing the scenery, and the drugs, and the female talent. Talking of which, Margot Robbie is radiant. She looks amazing and puts in a good performance, although she is sidelined for most of the middle of the film. I hope to see her in many more films to come.So this is one of those movies which I'm glad I didn't see in the cinema as I'd hate to be trapped in a room with these low-lifes.Or maybe I'm just jealous...",6,3,6,9 August 2014
Arrival," Amy Adams Saves the World
","I have to write a review about this long, stretched out piece of hokum. But what to write? All the obvious, predictable stuff is in there, including the rogue army idiots. Like Gravity, it has the dead daughter.Amy Adams whispers her way through it, forcing me to turn subtitles for the hard of hearing on. Did she have something wrong with her voice? I found the slow pace really annoying. The 'music' starts out really irritating but eventually becomes classical.The word that occurs to me is 'tedium'. Oh - and there's 'unbelievable rubbish', especially with regard to the alien language. But then I'm obviously no expert.I was hoping for better. Thank goodness it's over. I can watch something interesting instead. 6 out of 10, but decreasing to 5 as I watch the credits.",5,1,4,12 April 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Nice to look at, but boring, chick flick
","Nicely directed and photographed chick-flick with wooden performances and tame sex scenes. Reminds me of rubbish like the Emmanuelle films in the seventies. Jamie Dornan reminded me of George Lazenby.I really didn't detect any chemistry between the main actors and, if she needed persuading to be submissive, why did he bother with all that effort to convince her? I'm not convinced, either.Overall it's not convincing. They are obviously a miss-matched couple who have nothing in common so I'm not sure why they persist in constructing a relationship against all odds. It's a shame it took Ana the whole film to figure out what the rest of us knew all along.I had no desire to watch this, but it was there as a freebie on Sky Movies. It has to be the most unerotic erotic film I've ever seen. And what on earth is a classy Brit like Jennifer Ehle doing in this?",6,0,4,20 December 2015
The Sixth Sense," Incredible
","So Bruce Willis' character didn't realise he was dead. Didn't he find it odd that he never needed to go to the toilet, or pay the gas bill, or eat, or drink, or brush his teeth, or drive a car, etc etc for a few weeks or months prior to finding HJO. And how come he found the kid, anyway? AND in the same neighbourhood!It's a well directed film, but I always find holes in this kind of film. Sorry to be picky, but I have to suspend so much credibility that there's no point in the plot by the end.I never liked the Osment child, but I have to admit that his performance is good in this. The film has redeeming qualities, but the basic premise is too flawed. The only bit I liked was the dead girl's video for her father. That was quite touching.Someone's comment says he watched this film 27 times (has to be a bloke). I won't be watching this again. 7 out of 10 for direction, photography and performances (esp Toni Collette).",7,0,1,3 February 2003
Spectre," Yet another Bond film
","Yeah, it was okay. Quite entertaining but no more or less than any previous Bond films. There was no chemistry between Bond and Swann. Unfortunately I had to take a comfort break about half an hour in and missed Monica Belluci entirely, but apparently didn't miss any of the plot. Moneypenny wasn't in it enough. Q was nicely portrayed by Ben Wishaw. The action scenes were good, but it was soo slooow at times - and very dark (in terms of foot candles rather than plot).I heard it was very funny and easily passed the 'six laugh test' for a comedy (Kermode/Mayo). Er ... no. I laughed once and sniggered once, maybe.The main thing I enjoyed was the incidental music. The fact that I noticed it says something about where my attention was (not on the plot or characters).I hope Daniel Craig doesn't make another Bond film. I'm not a fan. The end credits said that Bond will return, but I hope someone 're-imagines' the franchise before they make another.I've been a big Bond fan since I first saw Dr No at the cinema way back when, but it is definitely getting a bit tired. I need another Daniel Craig Bond film like I need a hole in the head. ;-)",7,5,23,31 October 2015
Her," Is everyone else being hypnotised somehow?
","What a load of baloney. She's a piece of software running on a server somewhere, so naturally she can multitask. She could be talking to thousands of people at once in thousands of different voices while writing several books and chatting with other computers. What did he expect? Doesn't he understand I.T.? Also, this film is so sleazy. I had no sympathy with the main character at all. I felt more sympathy for the software. And who was paying for this service? Did he get bills from his Samantha-provider? How come she wasn't delivering commercials every few minutes?She's an 'operating system'? What is she operating? So she's a software platform, like Windows or Linux? No! She's just a computer program running under an operating system. And who is programming her? Google?And that poor surrogate girl. He was lucky (except this is a movie) that she was young, slim and pretty. What I would have done in his place is ditch the ear-bud and make love to the real live girl!Too slow. Too silly. Too ridiculous. The only redeeming feature was Amy Adams. Oh, and really pretty cityscapes. But primarily utterly unbelievable and one big yawn.I despair.",5,4,8,25 August 2014
