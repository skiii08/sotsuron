Your Name.," A wonderful film
","Makoto Shinkai's latest film is wonderful. It has a superb soundtrack, amazing animation and an intriguing plot. The characters are well developed throughout the film as the viewpoint switches between them in an novel way. The way the ending was resolved was satisfying and appropriate. Most probably my favourite film of 2016.* major spoilers *The comet that destroys the girl's town could be taken to represent the Fukushima/Tohoku disaster and ways to prepare for such events in the future. The film mixes serious parts such as the town getting destroyed with light hearted comedy. Some these jokes rely on which words are used by each gender. In one example the girl as the boy uses Watashi (which is taken to be effeminate), she then tries to use different versions of I until she gets the right version, I am curious how they will handle in this in the English dub.",Null,2,4,6 November 2016
