Source Code," Amazed how many miss what happened
","Source Code is a fun and interesting take on what at first seems to be high tech memory analysis where an Air Force Captain has his consciousness placed into the last 8 minutes of a man who died in a terrorist attack.The actual procedure is far beyond that we learn in the end as the tech was actually placing the Captain's consciousness into that dead person in an alternate reality that was identical to reality up to that point.The problem is less with the story or tech since this is a Sci-Fi movie and accepting that future tech and alternate realities are par for course, but with the fact that the scientists involved don't realize that changing what happened makes it not a memory. Although they may just be making assumptions that the tech allows the simulation of sorts since that is as believable as alternate realities I suppose.The reviews I have read that feel the later scenes and the final run through the source code somehow don't make sense led me to post a review. Simply put, the last scenes at Nellis are in the alternate reality. Therefore the train didn't blow up. The Captain is still alive in the device.Of course I feel a little bad for the teacher in that alternate reality as he ceases to exist when the Captain's consciousness from the first reality takes over - although since he would have died otherwise maybe not as tragic as it seems at first.",8,0,1,31 May 2019
The Wolverine," Good, summer-action flick with character introspection, and a few gaping holes
","The Wolverine does not attempt to be too many things at once, but what you expect from it, or want, will dictate how distracting the plot holes are which will in the end determine your enjoyment level. Unless you are seeking fault, or seeking Oscar worthy attributes, all others should find redemption and enjoyment in the movie.Hugh Jackman once again reprises the title character and he conveys the angst, apathy, and attitude admirably at various points throughout the film. He suffers only slightly at how the character is written to be portrayed, to which I do not hold him accountable.Mariko, Yukio and even Harada are played well with Yukio earning the gold both acting-wise, and the most depth to the character. Harada seems to suffer with the direction of his character, but this can be attributed to a character flaw rather than storyline error if one wants. Mariko plays off the strength, individuality, and tempered vulnerability adeptly, but is surprisingly written fairly flat, impeding one aspect of the storyline.The villains are sadly underdeveloped making it hard to a)understand motivations, b)care about the endgame. It doesn't help that both of those two things are the largest storyline plot holes both in design and execution.In the end, buying into Logan's self-evaluation, growth, and emotions is done best by watching the main character in the moments between action, and not best served with the in your face 'dream' sequences. The action and the impact the storyline has on Wolverine physically is inconsistent, but the emotional depth within him rather than playing off others is the strength of the story.",7,0,2,29 July 2013
