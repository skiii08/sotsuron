Alien 3," Different shouldn't mean bad.
","This film by David Fincher is a step away from Alien and Aliens, but that doesn't mean it's a step back.  The movie is different, with an almost European experience regarding the Alien saga. (Thus because most of the supporting cast is European).  The atmosphere is dark and seemingly claustophobic with a quick-as-a-whip killing machine decimating the defenseless convict population.The supporting cast is terrific with Charles Dutton as the Gothic Brute and leader of men, Dylan.  Charles Dance as the medical official with the shadey past.  Paul McGann plays a more psychotic and isolated loner prisoner named Golic.  Ralph brown and Brian Glover hold the place together as the two men in charge of the rusty complex. Pete Postlethwaite, Philip Davis, Christopher John Fields, and namely Daniel Webb are terrific as other prisoners.The film is suspenceful and even if one knows the ending, it is still an entertaining surprise as to who lives at the end, adding a bit of irony to the film with that aspect.  I would rate this film a 4 out of 5 stars because although I did not enjoy it as much as the earlier Alien films, it was a wild and entertaining flick right up to the credits.",Null,0,3,1 February 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Now that's an Alien flick!
","Not the best in the Alien series but I still loved it!  Great lines of dialogue, awesome casting/acting, and some of the most gruesome scenes I've seen to date.  The only downfall for this film was two of the best characters played by Michael Wincott and Dan Hedaya were given roles just above cameo status and were killed off quickly.  Still, they with Weaver, Ryder, Perlman, and Cruz made the film a memorable one!",10,3,5,17 March 1999
Aliens," Setting the standard!
","All of the main, middle, and minor characters play an entertaining role in this incredible movie.  Biehn, Paxton, Goldstein, and of course, Weaver are some of the more noted people in the movie.  Not often do a mastered cast and excellent flick combine so well but this time Cameron made it happen. Probably one of the best Sci-fi movies ever made.",Null,0,0,17 March 1999
Jurassic Park," A summer hit but c'mon!
","If anyone has read the book one can't help but be frustrated with this movie.  It was made for basically the family to see for much of it with stereotypes and too gleefull endings.  First of all the lawyer bothered me most.  In the novel he is a typical slimebucket and wats money money money. However he (still being a jerk) ends up being a bit of a hero and to a pleasant surprise. . .lives.  As for John Hammond, in the movie he was santa clause.  Also, I liked Muldoon as a drunk tub of lard rather than another bold hero type to kill off valiantly.  The flick had some amazing effects and a few good moments but its a 5/10 effort after reading the novel.",Null,2,4,4 July 2000
