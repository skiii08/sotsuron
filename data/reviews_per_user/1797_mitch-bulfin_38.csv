Ford v Ferrari," FORD v FERRARI (2019) - 9/01/2020
","Christian Bale continues to prove that he is one of the best actors of this era, and this film is another example of it. Damon is good, but Bale carries this film much like his character carries his racing team. The story is very interesting, maybe better titled 'Shelby v. Ford' rather than 'Ford v. Ferrari' but a story worth hearing about, especially if you are not familiar with it already. It definitely consists of some run of the mill and cliche sport biopic moments and themes but it is worth checking out for the performances, direction and if you're into sports, cars and races.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",6,2,3,10 March 2020
The Lobster," THE LOBSTER (2015) - 26/03/2020
","The Lobster is inventive, transporting, but still relatable, rooting the nexus of it's weirdness on the same awkwardness and anxiety everyone feels with the prospects of prolonged romantic courtship. The Lobster is a captivating and unusual creation deserving of it's spotlight and surefire future cult status amidst lovers of the weird. Highly recommend checking this out.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,1,1,30 March 2020
The Benchwarmers," THE BENCHWARMERS (2006) - 27/03/2020
","The Benchwarmers attempts to have an important message about bullying and I commend a comedy for trying to have a message at all. But the film probably ended up offending more people than it helped. It's a film that people praise for it's quotable lines and hilarious side characters, but neither can save the unintelligent feeling I got throughout the 80-minute runtime.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",2,0,1,30 March 2020
Vertigo," VERTIGO (1958) - 15/10/2020
","A beautifully crafted classic. Vertigo works as a love story, works as a drama and works as a thriller all thanks to Alfred Hitchcock's directing skills. This movie literally made me applaud, I appreciate this film a lot. A perfect gem.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,1,10 March 2020
Casablanca," CASABLANCA (1942) - 16/10/2019
","'Casablanca' is a tight movie. Craftsmanship is the name of the game, and with every line, look, and movement contributing to its story, not a moment of what you see on screen is wasted. Fully realized locations, legendary performers at the top of their game, and a story that sneaks up on you with how powerful it suddenly becomes -- yes, 'Casablanca' deserves the place it has made itself at the top of all-time lists. Even today it's more entertaining and emotionally resonant than many current films. That it is from 1942 and yet remains so relevant today is simply mind-blowing.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,1,10 March 2020
Inglourious Basterds," INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) - 13/11/2019
","An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilised monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's  Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse, these are Tarantino times. Masterpiece of modern cinema, highly recommend it.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,0,1,10 March 2020
12 Angry Men," 12 ANGRY MEN (1957) - 21/10/2019
","12 Angry Men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room.m, it's just so tight. The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty. It's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law. Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
Knives Out," KNIVES OUT (2019) - 22/11/2019
","'Knives Out' is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, 'Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense'. For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",7,2,3,10 March 2020
The Irishman," THE IRISHMAN (2019) - 28/11/2019
","Now, I missed out on seeing this at the cinema but I watched it instantly as soon as it was on Netflix. If you can see this at a cinema, and can handle three and a half hours without a toilet or snack break, then by all means, watch it on a big screen, because it's beautiful and ultimately the best way to experience a film of this scope and spectacle.Whatever you do, make sure you ultimately watch it. Films like this don't come around too often, and this is such a perfect swan-song for this talented group that I doubt we'll see these legends together again. It's bittersweet, but if this is Scorsese's, De Niro's, Pacino's and Pesci's farewell to the crime genre, then it's an amazing note to go out on.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,3,7,10 March 2020
Yes Man," YES MAN (2008) - 18/03/2020
","Jim Carrey is as good and charming as ever, but even he cannot save this film. It's an amusing comedy, but predictable and sluggish, and most of the gags don't quite work. Plus, even though Carrey pulls through with a handful of funny bits, he just doesn't suit the part. 'Yes Man' is good for passing time with, but it could have been so much better. Ironically, I am not a Yes Man to this predictable semi-witty comedy.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",5,2,2,30 March 2020
Taxi Driver," TAXI DRIVER (1976) - 12/07/2019
","A brilliant psychoanalysis of a disturbed individual, Taxi Driver is masterfully directed and showcases the career-defining performance of Robert De Niro, and remains just as poignant and hard-hitting as it was back then.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
Barry Lyndon," BARRY LYNDON (1975) - 11/11/2019
",A fabulous picaresque tale - satirical and tragic - in which we see Kubrick make every splendid shot look like an authentic 18th-century painting while using a cynical and essentially cold approach to recount a long series of barely connected episodes in our anti-hero's ill-fated life. Barry Lyndon is fantastic and amazingly helmed by Stanley Kubrick that boasts great performances and a revolutionary direction.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>,10,0,0,10 March 2020
Nightcrawler," NIGHTCRAWLER (2014) - 31/10/2019
","Gyllenhaal is terrifying as night time crime camera man. He takes the film through a slower middle part, but overall the movie always works: as acid social commentary on media and lack of empathy. The atmosphere of the hot LA nights is almost physically perceptible and the solution after a really thrilling final act is bone chilling.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,2,10 March 2020
North by Northwest," NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) - 18/10/2019
","I don't know if the film is busy enough to be a real wild ride, but for its time, and even now, it really is really fun, and while you shouldn't really expect the dramatic weight found in many of Hitchcock's other thrillers, style, intrigue and entertainment value converge tightly enough to make this one of, if not the legendary filmmaker's crowning achievement. When the run is done, the final product goes worn down by dramatic limitations, as well as tonal unevenness, believability lapses and, of course, an overblown structure, but through excellent score work by Bernard Herrmann, sharp cinematography by Robert Burks, thoroughly clever writing by Ernest Lehman, an electrically charismatic lead performance by Cary Grant, and a lively directorial performance by Alfred Hitchcock, all behind a grandly adventurous and intriguing story concept, 'North by Northwest' stands strong as a thoroughly entertaining affair that may be Hitchcock's most realized classic.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,0,0,10 March 2020
The Shining," THE SHINING (1980) - 30/12/2019
","And still, one of, if not the greatest horror movie of all time. The atmosphere of the entire movie is beautifully haunting and eerie. The performances from all characters were incredible, especially Jack Nicholson. His gradual spiral to insanity is performed perfectly. I couldn't imagine a better Jack Torrence. The movie is very slow, so don't expect a high octane horror movie. I very much enjoyed the pace and couldn't imagine a film that was any shorter than it's two and a half hour runtime. The movie leaves you with questions that will cause you to look at this movie a million different ways. I cannot recommend this movie enough.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,2,10 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD (2019) - 17/01/2020
","Third rewatch since release and it's still as fun as ever, the pacing felt slower in the first and second act because I started it late and I was the only one awake watching it but other than that, I had a blast. Besides, the final sequence of the film is so great it almost justifies everything leading up to it. Another outstanding Tarantino film. A truly great 'what if?' tale with the best of Quentin, Brad and Leonardo. Tarantino scores again.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,2,4,10 March 2020
Room," ROOM (2015) - 17/03/2020
","Fantastic acting and a great script make this one of the most unusual films of recent years. One shouldn't spoil too much about the plot, but it says a lot that a film can easily have it's climax in the middle of the story and still lose no intensity in the second half, easily keeping the audience's attention for the aftermath. Engaging, moving and honest.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,0,0,30 March 2020
Schindler's List," SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) - 16/10/2019
",Schindler's List is a silhouette of creativity and a real live portrait of the events that went on during World War II. What's great about it is that you have to go back to it a million times over to truly understand it. The magnitude of something that great is not easily discovered nor explained.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>,10,0,0,10 March 2020
1917," 1917 (2019) - 22/01/2020
","1917 deserves a standing ovation for the technical aspects, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this movie also wouldn't have been as good as it is without the careful direction by Sam Mendes. Between his work on American Beauty or Skyfall, it should come as no surprise that he would make a great film, but the crew around him took it to another level in my opinion. I was sucked in from start to finish and the two-hour run time flew by. I can't recommend this film enough. Easily one of my favourite films of 2019.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,1,2,10 March 2020
Prisoners," PRISONERS (2013) - 20/02/2020
","Prisoners makes your eyes glued to the screen, the characters are well written, the pacing is perfect, the story is magnificent and the twist in the finale blew me away like I did not see that coming. I forgot to mention how beautiful the cinematography is thanks to Roger Deakins. If you haven't seen Prisoners then you are in for a ride. Outstanding acting, a tight, mesmerising and engaging script and the directing make this one of the most exciting and best thrillers of recent years.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,1,10 March 2020
The Dark Knight," THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) - 23/07/2015
","Boosted by a career defining performance by Heath Ledger, The Dark Knight is every bit as dark as it is entertaining. The writing is sublime, the acting incredible and the directing top notch.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",9,0,0,10 March 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) - 4/08/2019
",This is by far the most technically advanced movie that Kubrick has ever made - and even though he also made great movies like 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Dr. Strangelove' - this movie also has the best plot of all them if you are able to see through the very trippy aspects of this masterpiece.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>,10,1,1,10 March 2020
Singin' in the Rain," SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) - 16/10/2019
","'Singin' in the Rain' is another one of those films that you just can't help but enjoy. It's so warm and funny and has such visual splendor and creative energy that you just kind of get sucked into all of the action. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are as gifted as comedians as they are song-and-dance men, and Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen provide worthy female support. It's really just a very fun film.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,1,10 March 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) - 6/03/2020
","Even better on rewatch! Everything comes together with all the little nuances. Smart, inventive, original, and above all heartfelt. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the amalgamation of Charlie Kaufman's creative script and Michel Gondry's sensitive direction, that all come together to create one of the best movies put to film in the last decade.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",9,0,0,10 March 2020
A Clockwork Orange," A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) - 16/10/2019
","Stanley Kubrick gives you a psychological experience that transcends you into a realm where people and the world function in a way you can only imagine. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novella lives up to the term 'controversial'. Violent, explicit & troubling to say the least. It's ruthless tone and insightful portrayal of its dystopian-landscape & devious antagonist makes A Clockwork Orange cult-like and iconic.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,3,10 March 2020
Joker," JOKER (2019) - 5/10/2019
","The cinematography is bold and the performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating in Joker. While it starts sluggishly, the film's ultimate pay-off in delivering the 'Clown Prince of Crime' into full-form makes for an unsettling, yet unique character study of one of DC-Comics' iconic villains: Joker.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",7,0,0,10 March 2020
Whiplash," WHIPLASH (2014) - 26/02/2020
","Definitely up there with my favourite films of all time. I won't discuss performances too much because there isn't anything I haven't said, they're astonishing. The underlying message of sacrifice in order to achieve greatness is well-told. Characters had their own motivation and challenges along every step of the way. Music and fast drum beat keep you awake throughout. Great storytelling. The directorial work is also topnotch and technically outstanding. Captivating long shots and masterfully executed camera work draws the audience into this brilliant study into obsession. The movie maintains a nearly relentless pace throughout without losing an ounce of its allure. A simply breathtaking study in how carefully chosen scenes and razor sharp dialogue can do true justice to a film's message and theme. A must see movie and a true classic in the making.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) - 18/12/2016
","This movie unfortunately is too raunchy to ever be considered for an award, but it is a quality film. Di Caprio and Scorsese combine for one of the most fun financial movies of this decade. There are solid performances from all the main and supporting characters. Many weren't happy with the ending, though it was a very accurate representation of this day and time, and falls in line with typical Scorsese films. Don't watch with family, seriously.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
Inception," INCEPTION (2010) - 11/01/2020
","A truly rare, intelligent summer blockbuster packed with ideas and concepts to keep the audience contemplating long after the credits. Inception succeeds on multiple levels thanks to it's brilliant script, wonderful direction and outstanding effects - all of which come together to create a unique, surreal experience unseen in mainstream blockbuster entertainment.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",7,1,2,10 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) - 9/11/2019
","The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax. One of the best dramas of all time.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
Parasite," PARASITE (2019) - 24/02/2020
","Third rewatch later. Hustling poor Korean family demonstrating that the class divide can never be surmounted. A slow-paced thriller that keeps you on edge, whilst never quite becoming sinister, just powerfully developing the characters' stories to the ultimate conclusion. Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,2,2,10 March 2020
Back to the Future Part II," BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II (1989) - 21/11/2019
","While it doesn't have the charm as from the first one, this is still a good follow up to one of the best movies ever made. The humour is probably the best thing about this, I think the humour is slightly better than the first. To have it set in the future then when they go back, they finds out that it's a parallel timeline then they have to go back to the past to solve the timeline is a good concept for this type of film. Michael J. Fox is great as always in these films, definitely the heart beat of this franchise.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,0,0,10 March 2020
Marriage Story," MARRIAGE STORY (2019) - 9/12/2019
","Upon rewatch, this film remained astonishing. Noah Baumbach has always had a knack for portraying the mundanity of life with such great detail and grace, and Marriage Story is yet another melodrama that shows how skillful he is. Marriage Story is a delicate dance of paradoxical emotions, weaving together themes of love, loneliness, heartbreak, and regret in such a manner that perfectly reflects the imperfect nature of human relationships. Adam Driver kills as Charlie, but Scarlett Johansson destroys as Nicole. Their performances are as intertwined as they are fragmented, and they bounce off each other with effortless chemistry. Marriage Story is a powerhouse of craft on all fronts. It is completely arresting and intimate. Baumbach reminds us how delicate love is, and that - amidst all the chaos that comes with it - there can always be beauty even in despondency and heartbreak.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",9,13,19,10 March 2020
Raging Bull," RAGING BULL (1980) - 20/10/2019
","With quite possibly the greatest performance in the history of cinema, Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is both haunting and powerful, exploring the themes of self-destruction and defeat in the most heartbreaking way possible. The boxing scenes are stellar, and the Scorsese's direction is brilliant in every way possible.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,1,10 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," JOJO RABBIT (2019) - 15/12/2019
","Jojo Rabbit is a powerful anti-hate satire. Funny, but smart enough not to let the Nazis get off the hook, with a storyline that takes the audience to some deeply poignant and serious moments. Heartfelt, hilarious and witty to the extreme, feeling tonally inconsistent in many areas, it still doesn't take anything away from Taika Waititi's unique, graceful film and how it could have gone horribly wrong in the wrong hands. Luckily, what we have is a cinematic gift.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",8,1,3,10 March 2020
Rear Window," REAR WINDOW (1954) - 25/12/2019
","Truly suspenseful and masterfully crafted, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a masterpiece of thriller that is both parts witty and serious, clever and entertaining, and humor filled and fear inducing. James Stewart is amazing in the main role.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,1,1,10 March 2020
Back to the Future," BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) - 31/10/2019
","A summer blockbuster popcorn adventure not to be missed. This movie is a classic. Marty McFly is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean and has to ensure his parents still meet so he can eventually be born. This movie is great. So happy that Marty was recast and given to Michael J. Fox. Words really don't do this film justice, you just need to see it. Great adventure with perfect blend of comedy and excitement. Will be interesting to see how this current generation reacts to this film as the 80s seem so long go for them.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
The Godfather," THE GODFATHER (1972) - 16/10/2019
","From it's stellar opening wedding scene to it's bittersweet conclusion, The Godfather is a groundbreaking and brilliantly made film that deals with themes of power, corruption and family with subtly and finesse. Easily one of the greatest movies ever made.<ul><li>Mitchell Bulfin</li></ul>",10,0,0,10 March 2020
