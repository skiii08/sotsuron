It," Horrible, horrible movie... Don't be suckered in by the inflated rating.
","This movie is horrible. And not in the 'It's a good horror movie' sense either. There is no coherent story to be seen here, no pacing, no exposition. There is literally *no* character development.How am I supposed to care for characters that I never get to know? I didn't care what happened to them. The black kid, the fat kid and the girl just kinda join the group. There is no development of the friendship or any kind of emotional bond. *boom* and they're friends. There is no story. It's one jump scare after another interlaced with a 'story'. I put that in quotes because after the story segments we're often left more confused than before. Now to the 'horror'. This wasn't scary. Not even remotely. There was this one dude in the cinema that jumped at every 'scary' scene, but he was hardly someone that could be considered a normal person. The effects are mostly done with CGI and are HORRIBLE. They're so bad they border on the point of COMEDIC and yes, I did laugh out loud several times during the movie. Most of the scares are either done with loud music and fast sudden movement to startle you or 'scary' disfigured corpses that look like wax dolls made in a kindergarten class.That's all it is. Jump scares and awful story. There is nothing scary about this movie. Nothing interesting or noteworthy. The only reason it's got such a high grade on IMDb is because of the fanboys inflating the rating. It'll drop soon enough.DON'T be suckered in. Don't go watch this movie. It's a waste of money and above all your precious time. I WANT MY TWO HOURS BACK!",1,171,349,7 September 2017
