Raiders of the Lost Ark," A globe-trotting rip-roaring adventure.
","This movie deserves its status as an modern classic, and its many iconic scenes deserve all of their homages and parodies. Harrison Ford does a tremendous job as the suave archaeologist Indiana Jones, and the special effects are both real and well-done. As of course, are the ever-present glorious gore. The comic relief relieves tension and is hilarious. The creeping shadows in the wall, whether Nazi or Indie, are a particularly well-used cinematographic device as well.This movie may be at the root of many of America's misconceptions about the Third Reich and its relationship with the occult, but it is a fun ride. It is difficult to make treasure-hunting through ancient temples seem more romantic than it already is, but Indiana sure manages it.(I saw this on July 10, 2017.)",9,0,0,10 July 2017
Casablanca," A well-deserved classic.
","As part of my pathway of 'rounding up the usual suspects' in terms of classic movies, I recently watched Casablanca. It was as good as I had always heard. I have very little to add in terms of the film itself, save for the fact that it was a surprisingly watchable and pleasant, as stupid as that sounds.The scene in Rick's when the French sing La Marseillaise was particularly powerful.As Rick says 'If she can stand it, I can! Play it!' If you can stand it, watch this movie. It's as good as it looks.",7,0,1,27 June 2017
In Bruges," Touching dark comedy.
","I have never been to Belgium. I have never wanted to go to Belgium. However, after seeing Brendan Gleeson (Ken) and Colin Farrell (Ray) explore and then engage in a series of violent incidents all over the gorgeous medieval city of Bruges, it has suddenly moved near the top of my must-see list in Europe.The very fact that even after seeing a body tumble out of a clock tower and fall in a bloody squelch on the cobblestones the idea of climbing the clock tower still remains appealing speaks to Bruges's beauty. The movie itself is a journey through both the city as well as the depth of human guilt and depravity. It includes romance and action, humor and tragedy.It definitely has its faults. The sequencing of gun fights near the end seemed to be built around what was convenient for the plot, not what would actually make any sense. It is, however, a well-done movie overall, and one that deserves to be seen by more than just people on the train to Bruges.(I saw this on June 28, 2017.)",8,0,1,28 June 2017
Citizen Kane," A wonderful movie for any era.
","Before watching this, I knew that Citizen Kane was considered to be a 'great' movie, but to be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting a good movie. I was surprised by it, not just as a historical artifact, but as a high-quality piece of entertainment.It was just a fun movie, with all the heights of Charles Foster Kane's career being moments of great delight and all of his lows being moments of great tension. Orson Welles's performance, as one might expect, was intense and expressive. The film's plot with its mystery structure and extensive flashbacks were well-done as well.I don't know enough about film to critique Citizen Kane on that level, but I can say confidently that it is not just a great movie. It is a good one.",10,1,3,28 June 2017
Iron Man 2," A fairly entertaining blockbuster.
","This movie technically begins by depicting the squalid life of the film's villain, but it soon speeds on to the movie's primary subject - Tony Stark's insatiable ego. Stark acts like some comic book caricature of John Galt, and many of his lines could be verbatim quotes, as far as I can tell. He says lines like 'Because I'm your nuclear deterrent. It's working. We're safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can't have it. But I did you a big favor.' In other words, he begins the movie as a charming egotist, Shrekli if he had a soul.The movie (and my perception of Tony Stark himself) get much better as it goes on. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer does a solid job and manages to be even easier to hate than Robert Downey Jr. Watching either of them prance around on stage is cringe-worthy but both performances are well done. The movie's long camera shots of various attractive women and its reverence for gee-whiz technology feels a bit overdone at times, but I guess that that is what the people making the movies thinks its audience wants that. They know better than me.Iron Man 2 is wish fulfillment and not at its best. It is, however, not at its worst either, and it is an entertaining movie that is at its best when Tony is being bashed, or slightly worse, bashing someone else.(I saw this on July 15, 2017)",6,0,0,15 July 2017
Brokeback Mountain," A gloriously raw love story that pulls no punches.
","I am willing to be an unabashed fan of this movie. It is great.Of all the great love stories that I have seen in movies and in plays, I can't think of a story that has spoken to me more intensely than Brokeback. Ever since rewatching it a few days ago, I have been playing back the scene when Jack says 'Sometimes I miss you so much that I can hardly stand it' over and over again. It's just that good.Tragic. Tender. Terrifyingly beautiful. From the natural beauty of Wyoming to its rural poverty, the American West has never seemed more full of brutality or love.One of the great love stories of our time, Brokeback should be relevant for far more than the 'gay cowboy' closet.(I have seen this several times, most recently on June 22, 2017)",10,3,5,26 June 2017
Midnight in Paris," A Woody Allen love letter to Paris and love itself, if the two can be separated.
","This movie is a fanciful romp through time and space in the City of Lights, with a screenwriter-turned-aspiring-novelist (Owen Wilson as Gil Pender) as the protagonist. Its central conflict is about love, creativity, and that funny feeling of nostalgia for periods which you personally have never seen, for Gil the 1920s and for Adriana the 1890s. It is wry, fanciful, and that sort of chuckle-funny that Woody Allen excels at. It is rarely funny enough to laugh, and the series of inexplicably attractive women that surround the creative types of the movie is wish fulfillment at its worst.Woody Allen's unmistakable touches cover this movie, and it is richer for it. The clichéd image of romantic Paris is mocked, extended, and even reinvigorated by his irreverent touch. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams both do fine jobs, and Wilson's character dominates the movie, but the real star to me is Marion Cotillard's wonderful portrayal of Adriana. She is an effervescent and artistic delight. This movie is well worth a watch, and I enjoyed it a great deal.(I have seen this before, but I last watched it on August 13, 2017)",9,0,0,13 August 2017
Shutter Island," Psychologically (literally) intense mystery.
","This is a great movie. It gradually builds over the first 90% of the movie, culminating in the single great revelation of our protagonist's identity. It's a twist but not an annoying late-in-movie transformation of the plot. It feels more like when you're stumbling over a riddle and someone just tells you the answer. It is both satisfying and shocking.It is atmospheric, and the combination of the effects and music brought me to Shutter Island with terrifying effectiveness. Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job, but the real star to me was the initially worrying then comforting role of Ben Kingsley as a doctor on the island.",9,0,1,27 June 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," Superb American classic.
","The Grapes of Wrath is a novel that I read and enjoyed in school, and this movie is a classic in its own right. The story is well-known at this point, and the movie powerfully tells the story of the Joad clan as they journey to California. There are some changes from the novel, frequently for the better. Some of the elements of the story in California were re-arranged and ends on a more optimistic note than the novel. The difficulty in expressing the more abstract chapters of the novel is clear, but I think they are well-done. The movie is more vaguely optimistically technocratic, but that agrees more with my politics, so I hardly mind!(I saw this movie on June 22, 2017.)",8,0,1,26 June 2017
Forrest Gump," Heartwarming, nostalgic, and...
","Forrest Gump is a great movie. I doubt you're reading these reviews at this point to try to figure that out. It is deeply inspiring, if a bit too saccharine at points. The story it tells is uplifting, and the film blends archival footage with new stuff masterfully.The movie does tend to be a bit of a Grand Tour of Baby Boomer cultural touchstones, not that that is necessarily a bad thing! Forrest Gump has long been my movie to reinforce my faith in the universe and humanity itself, and Forrest is one of my all-time favorite characters to ever grace the silver screen. To (mis)quote the famous line, this movie is like a box of chocolates, except with this one, you always know what you're going to get.(I have seen this before, most recently on May 13, 2017)",9,1,1,27 June 2017
Nightcrawler," An urban hunter on the prowl.
","Nightcrawler is an thriller/drama/comedy that follows Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he starts and then grows his 'professional news gathering service.' The business school mantras and clichés of the 21st century have never seemed as horrifying as when they are spilling out of the mouth of Louis Bloom. Gyllenhaal's physical transformation into the gaunt and creepy Louis who never, ever wants to be called Lou is impressive as well. The criticism of the media and its persistent focus on 'nice' people getting hurt is well-done, even given its lack of subtlety. The cinematography is well-done, and Louis's progressively nicer vehicles are shot like a wild animal stalking the streets of LA. Riz Ahmed also does a fantastic job as Louis's much put upon subordinate. An overall solid film.(I saw this most recently on June 1, 2017.)",9,0,0,28 June 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The atmospheric beginning.
","From the bucolic Englishness of the Shire to the ethereal otherworldly beauty of Galadriel's elven forest to the underground horrors of Moria, this film excels in creating settings that are not merely evocative but totally immersive. The characters are well-done, the plot swims along, but the locations created by JRR Tolkein and brought to life by Peter Jackson are the highest point of this movie. The wild landscapes of New Zealand are transformed with aplomb into a variety of settings throughout Middle Earth. Sean Bean does a particularly great job as the tragic and conflicted heir of Gondor, Boromir. More than 15 years after the release date of this movie and decades after the book was published, I feel there is little I can say in terms of the actual content of 'The Fellowship.' I can however say that while some of the CGI-driven special effects may seem a tad dated in 2017, they are used well throughout.Note: I watched the Extended Edition, and it was an absolute delight. I haven't seen the shorter version in several years, but if you can spare the time, I would recommend the longer one.",10,0,0,22 July 2017
American Psycho," Disturbing but aesthetic. Mostly the former.
","I have some very mixed feelings about American Psycho. It is, on the one hand, a profoundly disturbing movie that seems pornographic in its depictions of sex and violence. On the other hand, it is a beautifully executed film with eye-catching cinematographic grace. (Christian Bale is scarily attractive as he works out in his immaculate tighty-whities and as he murders. Not to mention that scene where he looks at his own gorgeously toned body in the mirror while having sex two ill-fated women.)The role of the unreliable narrator is also very interesting. By the end of the film, the movie's comedic elements are coming to the fore as the audience comes to realize that the phantasmagoria of sex and violence was more fantasy than reality.I have very mixed feelings about the movie as a whole. I was left with an intense feeling of disgust after seeing this movie, but I can understand why someone else might like it.That person is not me though, and the feeling of disgust hasn't left.(I saw this on June 20, 2017)",5,0,0,26 June 2017
The Shining," Beautifully shot and iconic.
","I was weirdly unimpressed by this movie.It is admittedly beautifully shot, though that's probably not all that difficult to do in the visual splendor of the Rockies. Many of the scenes and lines from this movie have become iconic pieces of film history, much mocked and admired since its release.However, I just didn't enjoy this movie very much. The pacing was slow at the beginning, and then suddenly too fast at the end. The transformation of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) into a psychotic murderer felt rushed, though the typewriter scene was magnificent. 'The Shining' is certainly worth a watch, but I won't rush to see it again.(I watched this on August 25, 2017.)",7,1,2,12 September 2017
No Country for Old Men," West Texas has never looked more interesting.
","It is easy to dip into clichés when describing 'No Country for Old Men,' to talk about the plot that feels as big as West Texas itself, and as someone who has driven through way too many times, it is a gigantic place.Those crutches are understandable, because the movie does feel as big as Texas. The big skies that are in the movie from the very first scene and continue to its close add a sort of inhumanity to the film's atmosphere. The intense yet well-done violence and the terror it produces feels as insignificant to the vistas of West Texas as the scattering of deer that Llewellyn tries to hunt near the beginning of the movie.'No Country' manages to combine sublime beauty and rip-roaring fun.(I have seen this several times after Fall 2016, last on May 3, 2017.)",9,2,2,28 June 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The masterful middle.
","It is hard to tell the middle of a story. I've always thought that middles lack the novelty of beginnings or the satisfaction of endings. However, 'The Two Towers' does a wonderful job of continuing the various plot threads of Middle Earth without starting or ending them. From the psychologically raw tale of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to the heroic epic of Rohan to the Blakean ecological tragedy of the ents, Tolkein and Peter Jackson a vast story in this incarnation of his saga.Gollum is a disturbing treasure, and any scene involving him is indisputably well-done. That's not to say that his mere presence doesn't disgust, but his role is indispensable. In terms of the smaller details, the design work done in Rohan is magnificent. Low-key and fitting with their lack of worldly sophistication, it is nevertheless done with pride. It would have been a great movie without the little details like that one, but it wouldn't have been as good as it is.The film certainly has its flaws, many of which have since become clichÃ©s. Legolas's pre-modern AK-47 in the form of a bow and arrow is both silly and unnecessary. Many of the extended fight scenes feel redundant, and after you see the first several orcs getting decapitated, what's the added value in seeing ten more? Clearly greater than zero, at least according to Peter Jackson. Note: I watched the Extended Edition, and it was an absolute delight. I haven't seen the shorter version in several years, but if you can spare the time, I would recommend the longer one.",9,0,0,22 July 2017
Hidden Figures," Solid, if not out of the world (except literally) entertainment
","Hidden Figures is a movie about three NASA workers, mathematical prodigies, who play vital roles in different ways in the American space program. I don't know enough about the specific history of NASA to comment on that point, but the exposition was integrated well. They are all African American women, and they face all the bigotries that one would expect in the mostly intolerant environment of Virginia in the 1960s. They all start as 'computers' to perform mathematics manually but soon move into roles ranging from computing orbital mechanics to programming their technological replacements. Hidden Figures tries to do a lot, and it does much of it well. It is, at times, a touching movie that pulls on the heart-strings. Yet despite its grand ambitions, I do not think that it is a great movie. Its message, while noble, is made ham-fistedly. Jim Parsons as villain was a nice touch, and the three main actors did a marvelous job. Taraji Henson did a particularly striking job. However, the film's ambitions of covering three different character arcs perhaps weakened its execution of all of them. John Glenn's character in particular seems more like 21st century wish-fulfillment than a realistic take on a character, and the physical smashing of the segregated bathroom signs was also a bit too obvious a metaphor.It is not a bad movie, and it is certainly an uplifting one, if not exactly a great one.",7,2,4,10 July 2017
Pulp Fiction," Intense iconic fun.
","There have been few movies that I have enjoyed more than Pulp Fiction. It combines intense action, dark comedy, brooding humanity, and for lack of a better word, some really, really fun scenes. It is graphic, but it is done well. For one small example, I know no other movie that combines tender family connections in the face of war and the fact that people hide stuff where the sun don't shine as flatly or as well as Pulp Fiction.Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and John Travolta all do a tremendous job, as one would expect. The different story-lines are executed well both individually and as a single story. I'm searching my mind to find any faults, but I can't think of any. It's a great movie. Enough said.(I saw this on June 27, 2017.)",9,0,0,27 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A unsatisfying, forgettable, but mildly entertaining movie.
","I enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie. I really did. Its humor and authenticity made for a wonderful film, as did its feel-good warmth.However, its sequel lacks that human touch and replaces it with a grab- bag of Hollywood tropes. Every action that anyone takes is driven by desire for 'family' which they insist on explaining on screen in length. Showing and not telling has apparently been forgotten since the first 'Guardians' movie. Ego's complicated motivations for destroying all life in the universe are given way too much screen time given how confusing they are, and the subplot about the Ravagers that culminates in the final fight is ham- fisted, though it is the most amusing part of the movie. That clumsiness is shared with that of Gamora, whose role in the movie is eminently forgettable. The movie isn't totally boring, and the 80s flashbacks are fun as always. I had expected better though from both Marvel and the 'Guardians' franchise. Hopefully the next movie will be more like the first than the second. (I saw this on a plane on September 17, 2017.)",4,6,10,22 September 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," The terrifying ur-thriller.
","I don't normally watch horror movies. They're not normally my thing. However, on the suggestion of a friend, I recently watched 'The Silence of the Lambs' and very much enjoyed it. It was a terrifying movie, but it was good for far more than just some jump scares. The terrifying sophisticated psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter was played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins, and Jodie Foster also did an intense Academy Award winning performance as FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling.A gripping movie from beginning to end that left me with more questions than answers, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good movie that deserves all the praise it has earned.(I saw this on June 29, 2017.)",9,1,2,29 June 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Long, but worth it.
","To be blunt, it is difficult to keep anyone's attention span for more than four hours, particularly given the fact that the film spends hours covering the trek of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum across the volcanic wasteland of Mordor. However, every minute of the film bristles with artistry. It is a beautiful movie, and the vistas between Minas Tirith and the Black Gates of Mordor are visually stunning. The soundtrack seems like a character as well, and it adds a much appreciated richness to the film. I have a standard set of complaints about this movie, and its less-skilled imitators. The battle scenes go on for far too long, some characters (Gimli particularly) can often devolve into caricatures of themselves as the plot moves forward, and plot elements (like the eagles to fight the NazgÃ»l) seem to drop into the plot out of thin air.Despite those flaws, 'The Return of the King' is well-done from start and finish and deserved every one of its prizes and accolades. Note: I watched the Extended Edition, and it was an absolute delight. I haven't seen the shorter version in several years, but if you can spare the time, I would recommend the longer one.",9,0,0,22 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," An ambitious film that reaches and mostly succeeds.
","It's hard to imagine a more difficult movie to make than one that spans centuries, races, and the very limits of human consciousness. However, Cloud Atlas is a phenomenal success. Despite its length (or maybe because of it), it manages to weave a number of very different stories into a single, spell-binding story of humanity itself. It is hilarious and terrifying, inspiring and profoundly horrifying. The music adds to the atmosphere too.Some of the movie's ideas like the language spoken in the post- apocalyptic scenes, some of the makeup choices, and the quantum mumbo jumbo were perhaps not as good an idea as others though. It fits many of the not-so-nice clichés of the post-apocalyptic genre as well.I have been a big fan of similar Wachowski projects like Sense8, and Cloud Atlas is similar in theme and tone. My main source of frustration about this movie is the fact that I waited five years to see it!(I saw this on June 26, 2017)",9,2,3,26 June 2017
