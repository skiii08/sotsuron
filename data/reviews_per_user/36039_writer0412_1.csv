Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat -Boring
","I got the movie and had high expectations.Unfortunately, the story took a long time to develop. Tension was built for he was to meet Pamela Anderson. When I realized he wasn't going to meet her, my interest shrank quite a bit, and I admit using the forward button from time to time.I found the scene in the hotel room with the fat guy quite revolting but didn't mind the other scenes.Other scenes were not very ingenious either.Not sure why this movie has been highly rated by the media. I am going to resell the DVD.",3,4,8,12 December 2006
