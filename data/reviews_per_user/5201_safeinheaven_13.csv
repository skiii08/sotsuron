E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," MARVELOUS, MAGICAL!!!!! Thank You, STEVEN Spielberg: ET, an adorably cherish-able film; moving and personal to us all
","I saw ET twice in summer and late 1982 when I was 11. ET was playing in Bryn Mawr and 4 miles east on Lancaster Ave The Thing and Poltergeist were playing in Ardmore. My brother, his friend, and I stood in line for an hour and before that my just my brother and I stood In line (Das Boot was also playing).Man, oh, Man I cried in ET. I cried when ET died . . . then ET came back to life . . . and I cried with tears of joy. Oh, what a precious time at the movies . . . Elliot's parents were divorced . . . so were mine . . . so were everyone's parents in 1982 it seemed (not really). Elliot was a true everykid and Gerti and the big brother, I can't remember his name . . . they even had an ATARI 2600 like we did. ET . . . was magical . . . and up the street THE THING was the antithesis of ET, vicious, mean, scary truly ahead of its time and still a classic . . . The Thing will gross you out today as it did 25 or whatever years ago . . . ET will make you wonder and marvel at the Heavens today as it did 25 or whatever years ago today . . . 1982 WAS A GREAT YEAR TO BE ALIVE IN . . . now I'm thirty-five and working on a Ph.D. . . .I have a wife and son . . . watching ET is like going back into a time-machine . . . I know exactly where i was and how i felt when I first saw it . . . life is really far-out. THANK YOU STEVE!!!! for giving us ET . . . its truly a magical experience.and to think . . . some people don't like ET, THAT'S WEIRD. but that's America.",10,4,9,8 September 2006
Dawn of the Dead," still thrilling . . . i've seen it again!
","Oh yeah.  The suped up busses were from romero's idea for dead reckoning. Anyway, we're at such a loss with this movie, really.  Look, in the Dead '78, the humans found the mall--it had everything they could ever want, ever imagine ever having.  Roger, Peter, Steve, Fran became so over-satiated that they wound up becoming dead from within, dead to themselves (even more aparent in the 142 minute version).  Here, like i read somewhere else, the zombies never enter the mall--until the 3rd quarter of the movie and not because of a 'former instinct to be in a place once important to them' it was simply to get the humans, i still can't remember their names, I think there's Mike, Ana, Luda, Ken, Andy, CJ.  but that's as much as i can remember even after the second viewing--the character's are not as descript. Dead '78 was a film lambasting the excesses of consumerisim and the gluttony it encouraged.  Dead '04 is taking a pro-consumer stance, almost blaspheming the philosophy of its paradigm (Dead '78).  because look, its rated-R, its fast-paced, almost demanding repeated viewings, its in 2:35.1 aspect ratio enabling universal to market at least 4 dvd versions:  a full-screen r-version, a full-screen unrated version, a widescreen r-version, a wide-screen unrated version, not taking into consideration a 'renegade director's cut' possiblility.  There are over 100 dvds on my shelf in my room upstairs.  I'm a consumer.  Universal Studios with its Dead '04 wants me to buy four more dvds to fullyt experience Zach Synder's DAWN OF THE DEAD. At least it was still thrilling the second time around!  It made its money: where's the sequel!!!?  I'm flesh-hungry for more!",10,0,0,6 April 2004
Dawn of the Dead," 'What if'
","In an alternate ending of 28 DAYS LATER the caption reads 'What if . . .'. 'what if' there were no 28 DAYS LATER('what IF' Danny Boyle couldn't get the financing for his movie or, 'WHAT IF' at the end the jet crashed into the crew incinerating the negative materials).  'What if . . .'   '. . .'  if DAWN OF THE DEAD '04 had no 28 DAYS LATER to use as a blue-print would Z. Synder have had the zeiiest, the surrendipitidy (sp) to reach back 24 years prior to grab-up Umbreto Lenzi's 'INCUBO NELLA SULLA CITTA CONTAMINATA' penchent for agile-dead people (meatloaf-headed creatures w/ sub-machine guns.

Terminator Salvation," Terminator IV is Classic Science Fiction
","Terminator IV is truly 'classic science fiction:' it takes 'stuff' we have to 'deal with' in everyday life and puts our 'stuff' in a context foreign enough where we (the audience including me) recognize a starkly contrasted reflection of ourselves: our strengths and our flaws . Even though James Cameron is nowhere-really to be found in the credits, both James Cameron's heart and soul are in Terminator 4; possibly when Stan Winston passed-away, James Cameron paid a little more attention to 'his baby's' (The Terminator 1984) third off-spring. Subconsciously James Cameron always takes us back to Harlan Ellison's 'Soldier' (story/episode on 'The Outer Limits'); Ellison, Cameron, Winston, Gale Anne Hurd, and William Wisher are ALL genius storytellers and TERMINATOR IV would never have been as great an entry in Science-fiction without the genuine enthusiasm of the actors and entire production staff!!!!!! The people in the row behind me and in front of me didn't seem too enthusiastic about Terminator 4 and that's a little sad. The audience didn't seem to like American Gangster and Cat in the Hat and Speed Racer either . . . I guess I'm the one who's 'off' Oh well: T4 is great . . . if you're twelve or a 38 year old parent taking his 12 year older to see it.If you are in for extra-gore read the screenplay and novelization of The Terminator . . . The Terminator 'wastes' the 'Sarah Conners' is a way-grosser way!",10,4,8,22 May 2009
Crash," some ill-informed introverted writer writes a screenplay about idiotic caricatures of racists that makes for a very dumb movie
","Crash stinks. Its phony and never didactically teaches its audience anything except how its cynical, paranoid creators feel about their own fabricated schema (or world views). Its a shame that people actually buy into this silly movie that plays like an episode of Alien Nation . . . when the cop molests a guy's withe, the guy would have reported it . . . but because of phony dramatizing by the stupid, ill-informed cynical writers, there's additional, contrived dickering between the husband and wife. The worst movie in decades . . . ill-informed lies. ill-informed ideology. ill informed racist writers. its like Grand Caynon . . . i guess a 'grand Caynon' film must appear in every generation.",1,20,33,8 January 2007
28 Weeks Later," Body parts; not knowing who to shoot and shooting everybody; brash, tired American soldiers: ITS IRAQ
","Body parts; not knowing who to shoot and shooting everybody; brash, tired American soldiers: ITS IRAQ. The best zombie movie: does what Nightmare in the Contaminitated City, Demoni, and Demoni 2 attempted. Scenes almost too horrible to look at. Characters we grow to love are killed. 28 Weeks is savage . . . and wonderful. Without a doubt people will not like it and will say this review was not helpful. I wonder who these people are and what they like. I think people who go to horror movies are discouraged and enjoy discouraging others . . . hence, the horror aspect: its entertaining for horror film goers to see bad and sad things happen on screen; there is little sympathy.",10,2,5,20 May 2007
The Thing," Its impossible to put into words: THE THING is an AWESOME experience
","Its got to be the NEW GOLDEN AGE OF HORROR: 1982. and SCI-FI. 1982 (1981, 1980) ET, The Extra-Terristrial, Poltergeist, Star Trek II-The Wrath of Kahn, Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3-D, The Gates of Hell, One Dark Night (ead and Buried, Sword and the Sorceror, Blood Beach, The Bogey Man, Zombie (re-release), all about a year old; Dawn of the Dead's about three years old as with Friday the 13th and Maniac and My Bloody Valentine, and The Shining, and Happy Birthday to Me . . . truly a GOLDEN AGE.The Thing is an ageless, masterpiece of HORROR . . . the guy's chest turns into a mouth with ugly sharp teeth . . . and then the guy's head sprouts legs and then there's this weird Norwegian base which makes the film come off like a quasi-sequel to the 1951 film . . .TRUE HORROR . . . then there's the spaceship the big one over a thousand years old and the new one . . . MASTERPIECE OF HORRORIFIC IMAGES JOHN CARPENTER is painfully under-appreciated . . . THE THING even outdoes ET in IMDb.comes . . . HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 . . . this collection of films IS CLASSSIC for our time. John Carpenter lifetime achievement award.",10,0,1,8 September 2006
The Mist," Vintange Stephen King: HP Lovecraft's At The Mountains of Madness meets Romero's Night and Dawn of the (Living) Dead and Aesop's Fables . . . kinda silly and moronic though
","What we have here is a remake to a non-existent film based on a Stephen King Novella made 25 years ago. The Mist is horribly outdated in Stephen King's style and thoughts--it is shot in a reality-TV format That even sports fade outs where chapters or commercial stops should Be. No one wants to genuinely freak-out or repulse the audience Anymore . . . at least in The Mist's attack in the generator area. The Audience was laughing more than anything else. It was a shame. I hope The gunslinger Dark Tower will not be shot in the same way even though Stephen King favors low standard reality-TV entertainment and sold the Dark Tower's rights to the makers of Lost for 19 dollars at a Convention in New Jersey--the guy was painting a Gunslinger poster Before the storm hit, and the Aesop's Fable moral of the story is . . . . wait! Wait! WAIT! The arrowhead project is like the drilling in the Lovecraft Story and the 'trapped' Pinter Play scenario is like Night of The Living Dead . . . the gore is like Dawn of the Dead. It stinks, I Wish I hadn't seen it.",4,9,18,26 November 2007
I Am Legend," Overall, Legend stinks!!!! No 'Come out, Neville'; No social hierarchy of vampires; No wife coming back from the grave; no extinction of the human race, 'Legend' disgusts me
","Will Smith gives an excellent portrayal of a man alone for 3 years (he Becomes 'autistic' in a sense, losing his own humanity in the Loneliness) And Will Smith reinforces a positive image of African-Americans; other than Will Smith, the whole movie blows except for the interesting premise it robbed from Matheson's brilliant novel. The vampires are transmuted into mindless look alike rabid zombies that are cheap imitations of 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead (remake) The movie overall is merely visually stimulating as if a second unit director who was a visual artist directed the film. I think 'fans' overall got tired of the formula of slow moving creatures trapping people in a building for two hours and demanded something different. As a result we have dumb 'not even vampires'/Not quite zombies either with no personality or motive to attack Neville save for dumb animal instinct. Gosh it was awful . . . .a total D+. I'm never going to see another horror movie again after this I think. 'The fans' have taken over. Legend was like: Steven Sommers directing the remake of Lawrence ofArabia . . . . a mistake",1,14,27,15 December 2007
Drag Me to Hell," The trailer is MUCH better than the film
","Drag Me to Hell . . . From the Director of 'The Evil Dead Trilogy,' is EXACTLY what the movie you're interested in seeing or have seen already is. The Evil Dead movies weren't very scary; not scary to the point of having to check under your bed or putting a chair up to the closet door or sleeping with the lights on at least. The Evil Dead movies are movies that are unlike ANY HORROR MOVIES 'out there' because of the incredibly inventive genius at work behind and in front of the camera. Inventiveness seems to come from young, fresh malleable minds where neurons are still differentiating and areas of the cerebral landscape haven't yet been discovered. With age, the brain like, the body begins to calcify; it becomes MUCH HARDER to come-up with WACKY new things to put up on the screen. Drag Me to Hell is The Evil Dead without the (literally) GALLONS OF BLOOD and the grim, suffocating NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD feel. Drag Me to Hell feels like Sam Raimi loved The Grudge, The Grudge 2, The Ring, and The Ring 2 and thought (with his maturing and more world wary mind) it would be great to have another short-cute blonde-haired girl caught-up in the middle of 'scary' 'chaotic' 'spiritually traumatic' pretense. Even though the 'short-cute, blond-haired girl' in The Ring and The Ring 2 actually had black hair (actually Jennifer Connelly made-up to look slightly Asian in ethnicity for sake of argument), the 'short-cute blonde-haired –girl' characters and their dark-haired boyfriends are ALL COMPLETELY Interchangeable. Despite the classic 'Sam Raimi Moments' (Wacky Editing, Dancing Evil Dead Monsters, and classic JUMP moments), Drag Me to Hell can also be integrated with The Ring and The Grudge movies . . . possibly the Best Title for: Drag Me To Hell would be: 'The Grudge 3--a Ring Sequel: The Button.' I feel very bad about getting ripped-off by Drag Me to Hell. At least Joe Lo Duca's deeply visceral musical style can still be heard amid Christopher Young's credited score and KNB's special effects are always awesome. Even though there are only N and B and no K here. And there's a face that I missed; and the whole movie seems so empty without the face. Sam Raimi movies could not be the best Sam Raimi movies without the face and the chin present. The Face and The Chin are dear old friends to Sam Raimi movies and I am sad that I missed The Face with The Chin. SAM RAIMI better do The Evil Dead: Redux and include The Face with The Chin as the main character.",5,1,8,29 May 2009
American Gangster," Honesty, Success, Intrepidity, Fierceness!!!!! American Gangster IS the Best Film of the Year--a lot goes on in this one
","The guy Frank Lucas is a tiger, yet Ritchie Roberts is the lion, the king of an awesome 'jungle' of a movie; and to think it all really happened. Foremost Frank Lucas is the quintessential American (works under someone in the trade for 15 years, learns from his mentor's mistake, and GRABS the trade by its horns and revolutionizes the society that borne him.) Ritchie Roberts is equally an American (a guy with a lot of shortcomings who is honest in crucial areas yet dishonest in equally crucial areas). What a film; this will be the next SCARFACE for people in a trade like Frank Lucas. Critics who didn't like this film are completely misinformed--critics are people like us; some are thoughtful others are not thoughtful, we don't know where these critics came from their backgrounds anything. See the movie!",10,0,4,11 November 2007
Halloween," A total Rip-Off of Deep Red . . . Halloween, however, is beyond a 10 its a Classic
","FRom the opening Point Of View shot to the motif of a child's being involved with a long-ago murder to the 3-note 4 beat fingered music score, to the bath-tub scalding scene (in Halloween 2), to even the working title: The Baby Sitter Murders, John Carpenter's Halloween is a complete and unimaginative rip-off of Deep Red-The Hatchet Murders and when compared, Halloween pales in complexion. BUT . . . HALLOWEEN is so totally Frightening and AWESOME . . . Deep Red terrifies yes sure but it doesn't FRIGHTEN and totally alarm the audience like HALLOWEEN . . . The uneasiness is in HALLOWEEN's 'primality'--everything is so basic, bare-bones. three-notes in the score, three acts in the movie, three fleshed-out characters (Michael Myres, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode) at least in terms of motive. Where Deep Red is complex with a few plot holes HALLOWEEN is like a freight train whose only purpose is to take us from point A to point C and leave us-the audience, looking over our shoulders, checking the closets, and looking under our beds for The BOOGEYMAN . . . how incredible . . . and HALLOWEEN II is just as good . . . i think with sequels everyone knows what to expect and its like eating one too many slices of pizza where the pizza's great to start off with but a nice deep dish of lasagna would really hit the spot . . . HALLOWEEN II really makes HALLOWEEN into a three hour movie and a three hour Freight-Train Ride really wore the mass-pop culture out . . . I am not 'mass culture' and adore Halloween I and II. But the Italian sources these films came from Twitch of the Death Nerve, Blood-Spattered Bride, Profondo Rosso are awesome in that they are not bloodless . . . when the guy has a needle stuck in his eye in Halloween II (not a spoiler-I didn't say what guy), its bloodless whereas in Deep Red when the lady is butchered by the meat-cleaver Bright Red Blood goes EVERYWHERE . . . HALLOWEEN's more than a 10 its a CLASSIC beyond any rating.",10,1,2,4 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," please, Remake Rodrick Thorpe's The Detective for DIE HARD 5 AWESOME is too small a word . . . You've NEVER before seen the stuff that happens in This one
","10 out of 10. EVERY movie should be as wonderful as the DIE HARD movies!!! I saw the first Die Hard in '88 three times in the same weekend as a junior in high school, Die Hard 2 in 1990 while at home from college, Die Hard 3 on my honeymoon, and now Die Hard 4 when I have a family of my own--I LOVE THEM ALL! There's nothing like the Die Hard movies--no matter who the director is, they always make me go crazy with excitement (the bad guys are always super-bad and John McCLane ALWAYS comes to the rescue . . . ALWAYS, man)and Bruce Willis makes me laugh and smile all the time in every DIE HARD! The bad guy in this one is a mean-spirited Pat Boone doppleganger and as all the bad guys in every DIE HARD he's very charismatic. Bruce Willis drives away from missiles from a jet fighter, flies a helicopter, and many other things with some far out computer dude and his bud The Warlock who looks like Wolfman Jack . . . and John McClain's daughter is kidnapped and such . . . see the movie!!!! I hope FOX uses Rodrick Thorpe's novel The Detective as source material for DIE HARD 5 . . . without the late Rodrick Thorpe there never would have been John McClane. For some more DIE HARD action read NOTHING LASTS FOREVER, 58 MINUTES, and THE DETECTIVE. An R-rated version needs to be released shortly in select theaters and on DVD. The PG-13 cuts make it seem slightly edited for TV.",10,5,14,27 June 2007
