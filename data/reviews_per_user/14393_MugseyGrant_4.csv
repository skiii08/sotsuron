10 Cloverfield Lane," Great Film Worth A Watch
",10 Cloverfield Lane What A Film Truly Worth A Watch Its Not Often I Can't Pick Fault At A Film And This One I Couldn't. This Is What Happens When You Cross Two Different Types Of Films And Mix Them Together. The Film Will Play With You And Will Make You Wonder If John Goodman Character Is Crazy Or Is He Really A Nice Guy. I Found It Interesting How Scary He Came Across Within The Film. But Acting From Cast Was Amazing And Very Good For A Cast Of Pretty Much 4 People In The Whole Film. As For Downsides I Like To Have Known More About John Goodman Character As He Was Quite An Interesting Character. But Everything Was Great It Kept You Watching Right From Start To Finish And Could Watch This Again And Again. Any Horror Lovers You Must See This As This Film Will Keep You Guess And You Be Shocked At The End I Never Expected Or Saw That Coming!,8,1,2,26 August 2016
Ali," A True Legend A True Film.
",What an amazing film I really don't know where to start or finish with this one. But what we already know is Mohammed Ali was a true sports legend. The film showed all highs and lows and the real points of his career. A real watch for any film lover and one of the greatest films of 2001. You have an amazing actor none other than Will Smith who fits the role perfectly. A great fast telling story that stings like a bee and along with it some of the greatest scene in a film that contains boxing. The small soundtrack might be limited but fits the film greatly. If any film derserve an award back in 2001 then this one did with amazing amount of wins you can see why this was such a great film about the legend. There really not much more to say it highlights the situations Ali faced in his younger years right down where he proved just how great of a fighting legend he truly was and why he was such a legend to a genration in the present days. He did what any man would do and fighted not just America but to rank as the top man.,8,1,4,10 August 2016

Her," Why Am I Crying?!
",Her three simple words but really can mean so much this really does gives us faith in these films some of us as of yet have been able to see. I was left crying after watch this film. Maybe I could feel some sort of connection to Theodore or maybe it's because this film is so wonderfully written? This needs to be one anyone watch list even if you hate anything romantic or Sci-fi it's truly a film you won't see anything else like it. We then start to question will what's in the film be possible one day. Next lets talk about the soundtrack without a doubt another amazing part of this faultless film. I want to find something I can pick fault at but there isn't because it's that good. The acting is amazing and the film looks like it will be one of those to stay in my mind forever how this film makes me feel is without any doubt amazing!,10,0,3,3 November 2015
