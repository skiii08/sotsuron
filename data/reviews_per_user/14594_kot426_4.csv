Stop-Loss," Excellent Acting And Emotional Storyline
","First off, I do not agree with desertion or any anti-war stances. But I have to say that this movie really moved me, got me to thinking....what if I were in his shoes? The way some troops were/are being stop-lossed is pretty disgusting. I support our government and the USA is truly 'the land of the free and the home of the brave' but when it comes to soldiers being stop-lossed, I have to say that it is an injustice to do such a thing to honorable heroes. Ryan Phillippe is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint in this movie! In fact, the whole cast did an outstanding job. I thought this was going to be another Hollywood forced way of thinking anti-war movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Even though there are parts that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I really enjoyed this film. Very emotional at times. And God bless our troops and the United States of America. Please be safe, my heroes.",9,0,1,29 June 2008
Control," Just Finished Watching This Fine Film
","Wow! Such noteworthy performances by all. This movie that was perfectly filmed in black and white made me feel several different emotions. Sadness for both Ian and his wife, anger at Ian for some choices he made, a need to pop a Prozac at the beginning, middle & end of the film :-), such utter feelings of hopelessness poured from the TV screen. When Ian sang, he put all his emotional and physical being into each song, it is no wonder of the outcome. I felt such sadness for Debbie...helplessness. I hope her and her child are doing well today. I think Ian needed to be committed for help with what really seemed to be a very serious mental illness. Hopefully, this movie will teach some up and coming musicians that being happy is more important than fame and fortune.",8,0,1,1 July 2008
Across the Universe," Loved It! Loved It! Loved It! A Must See!!!
","I rarely give movies a 10 but this one most definitely deserved one! I just loved the whole experience! Jim Sturgess is just sensational. Ten lines is not needed to comment on this film. The word 'magnificiant' sums it up. All the Beatles songs were so wonderfully sung by everyone, I just loved the way they were performed. I want to see more and more films like this one! I praise all the cast and crew. This deserves to be shown everywhere. I watched the Pal version of the DVD and cannot wait to get my hands on the R1 release. I will definitely watch this one more than once. Thank you for creating such a pleasurable film to watch!!!!!!!! Please consider making more like this!",10,1,3,8 January 2008
La La Land," Wow, Rating Waaaay Too High For This One!
","Is the rating too high on this site for this movie or what???All the hype and nominations for this horrible movie reminds me of how 98% of the media reports from a liberal point of view instead of from a non-partisan point of view. Disgusting.This movie lacks everything from acting to so called singing. Horrible is what should be the headlines for this atrocity!We had to force ourselves to watch this till the end. Several times we were on the verge of shutting it off. This proves that the Oscar's should be abolished. And who really cares if an Iranian actress doesn't go to the Oscar's? And how long have you lived in a free country...NEVER! (lol)?Poor Ryan Gosling, I always liked him.....disappointing that he chose such a flop to 'act' in. Thought he didn't want to do the Hollywood thing anymore. Proves Hollywood money can buy anything or anyone.",1,23,41,27 January 2017
