The Hangover," Ripoff of the 'Dude wheres my car'
","Even thou the movie it self is pretty funny, the plot is shameless ripoff of the 'Dude wheres my car'. Let me sum up both movies for you in order: Few friends wake up after a terrible hang over.They are missing something, and trying to recreate what happened last night.They run in to a wild animal and then interrogated by some mean cops.One of them got a really hot chick, even if he doesn't remember it.They run into some washed celebrity.They then getting confronter by a gang of people for something they have, but they don't remember where it is.Then they realize that the thing they been looking for was close to them whole time, and end up in better position then they were in.End.Yeah, thats BOTH movies. as said, ripoff.",3,22,46,11 July 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Possibly most overrated movie?
","The movie itself was not bad. It is well made, and I enjoyed it until the end.. it's then the big disappointment came. Not only did it lack logic, and by that I mean the theatre and it's guards.. There are supposed to be all high commanders of Nazi army, yet trough whole theatre scene we only see two.. That's kind of bullshit, no sane human would set up that little guards in such important place, so the movie failed there already.Then the ending.. they burn/blow up the place with little to no assistance from leader who then tries to make up for that weird action scene by a cool ending.. except for it is not cool at all.The ending left a really weird taste in my mouth, leaving me sitting there, thinking 'That's it'? They made a deal with Nazi, blown up theatre and movie ends.. Feels like I kinda wasted time on that one.",1,12,23,21 November 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Nice remake of Death note.
","So I just watched this movie, where a guy fights for his morals by killing those who are guilty in his eyes, and the police knows it is him but can't prove it. In the end, when he is about to kill those at top, they discover his plan and turn it against him, which results in protagonist dying.Was it Death Note I watched? Or Law Abiding Citizen? Both have exactly same plot..What can I say, a thrilling remake of a great manga. However ending really does mane one wishing it would be other way around, since the main character is quite appealing.",8,0,2,11 April 2010
