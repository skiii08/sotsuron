Blade Runner 2049," Dreaming above the rainy city
","Beautiful, haunted, dirty , sad , an existentialist gem of a movie about a disappointed droid who thought was (is) special; a fair sequel and time will tell about its majestic.",10,0,2,18 October 2019
Alien 3," A deep movie not for everyone
","First let me start saying that I'm a huge fan of the Alien trilogy(not the 4th, for me the ending was perfect in the third)And I saw first the first, second and wait for the third one, true; is dark ,sad ,slow pace but I accepted like it was and suffer alongside Rypley's fate.The score so deep, the funeral of Newt and Hicks and the underlying script of death and reborn, ALIEN 3 don't have the action or horror like his previous but it took for sure the drama , the heavy burden of Ripley and succeed ,we loose all those great characters James Cameron gave us but, hey that's life ,we all die and I love dark and pessimism movies, go watch a comedy for a happy ending, Alien 3 is the perfect ending of the series : '...in every seed there's a promise of a flower '...The sun sets and enter darkness (alien)",10,3,7,28 December 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," A nice ride!
","Went to see this movie yesterday night at the IMAX theater and I wasn't expecting much.. First let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Cloverfield and all monsters movies, aliens etc and I was told this movie wasn't the case but guess what? Big surprise! Also the first part of the movie in the cellar is pretty intriguing with some really tense moments and also fun, building over and over thru changes of emotions the final and brutal way out.John Goodman was amazing a well and memorable character, and Mary Elizabeth also was good (personally got for her a nice acceptance since she made her role in The Thing) So despite the lack of monsters in the majority of the movie I was pleased by a nice script and cinema.I would have give this movie a 10 if at least at the very end in the flash of the lighting instead of the alien ship were standing in the field the big monster of Cloverfield 1 ,but nothing is perfect... Go and enjoy this movie, you won't regret it",8,1,2,14 March 2016
Interstellar," To space and beyond...
","What can I say about this movie that others already have written...nothing...This is one of a kind , a gift for mankind
Someone once say that a director reach a peak when delivers a science fiction film , like a challenge, because it's a very difficult genre to archive and Nolan not only delivers, he also did so far the best movie of his career if not, one of the best movie ever.
All the big effects, feelings and images : the planets, the ships, the wormhole ,the drama contrasting the small details : the watch, the complicity of Tars at the end , the leap of faith of Anne Hathaway taking the helmet off in front of the grave of Edmund...All of that entwined with the beautiful score of Hans made me add a little grain of sand , a diminutive speck of stardust with this review to a massive, monumental film made with heart and soul.",10,0,3,4 November 2019
28 Weeks Later," Take a speed pill this is a harsh ride!
","I like 28 days later but after watch 28 weeks for my 4 time I realized love this one more , it feels like fulfill all the horrors ,also got more action and chaotic sense of fear, run is all you got...and dam they're fast! I know some people complain and don't like this movie saying the camera was a bit shaky, weird angles and fast shots but hey guess they start watching this movie thinking in the slow pace of the first one, so, give it another try because this is a hell of a good movie. The acting is very good, love Robert C ,Rose Byrne and the amazing Jeremy renner in his role of a marine with a kind heart(By the way : best death in the movie burnt by flamethrower! The only movie of virus, zombies etc that gets close to 28 weeks later is Dawn of the dead remake from Zack z... The music is also good and memorable, the places, empty streets and dangerous tunnels, wow post apocalyptic for real, i can talk about this movie for decades, so I'm out of here, see you in London!",10,0,4,18 April 2016
Drive," Nightcall !
","This movie is not for everyone. The music of this movie it's not for everyone .The violence in this movie not for everyone.The scorpion jacket of the driver not for everyone.The silence and rush of love not for everyone.The lack of dialogue and info of the driver and his casual,violent exalted behavior is not for everyone.A movie far from the Hollywood standards that got some depth is not for everyone.Drive awakes a dreaming state ,a distant happiness and an eminent sense of lost also not for everyone.'I wanna show you something dark but have no fear' definitely not for everyone.And finally this review :NOT FOR EVERYONE!",10,0,1,4 February 2016
The Descent," This horror movie saved the genre
","Dark. Human. Frightening journey and radical justice for its characters. One of the best horror movies ever made! The music outstanding. The camera and light work ; impeccable. The ending is a blast of feelings, no need a sequel(shame there's one) Neil marshal go for real this time, hope he comeback again after his latest poor films... F....k i have to spoil : she never got out of the cave !Dam what an ending .The atmosphere of the cave is good enough to believe they suffer.A solid ten, if you haven't see this movie don't hesitate, there is a deep hell of a ride waiting for you.",10,1,3,28 August 2015
The Godfather: Part III," A perfect conclusion.
","Is beyond my mind how anybody could rate this movie that low , this is a perfect conclusion , a dramatic finale , the right end for Corleone; in loneliness .
 Sophia was not that bad , she is very atractive and looks italian a lot , there is an aura of innocense around her hard to beat.
 Al Pacino ...well, he is always good, imposible to forget his screams for fredo and the last scream for her daughter , one of his best performance.
 The music is a 10
 The change of Corleone sister a plus
 Andy a great Sony 's son
 Robert Duvall really piss me off , that was the loss of perfection for The Godfather 3 ...but what can we do ?",10,1,1,10 September 2018
Arrival," Wasn't what I was expecting and happy for it...
","Amazing movie, touching, an impressive piece of art,not only for what you see but for the importance of the message. In a world so divided we are, in the cold of present humans relationships , this movie like the message the aliens in it are a gift To humanity..The gift to realize we are not alone and together we are one, to love and care for the other, to embrace dead as a natural process in our live with no fear, with love. Now I know for sure this is the right director for the Blade Runner sequel, congratulations and thanks for this gem of human science fiction .",9,1,9,13 November 2016
Alien: Covenant," Waiting 5 years for this ?????
","What the h...? Who the f... Do you think you are Ridley Scott ? Easily the worst alien movie after alien 4 .First why you didn't took what others did great about the alien franchise ? Instead you destroyed , example : the eggs comes from a alien queen , Cameron did perfect and you just came with the David stupid creation, you just killed more the suspense of an alien creature, parasite Etc.Then you also managed to kill Elizabeth Shaw and all the engineers ( the only highlight of Prometheus moron !)And bring back the worst from Prometheus ( a stupid crew , stupid decisions etc) The gore was good no complaint on that , but even the old aliens rip in half bishop Android and here they even mimic with David puffff... I expected a movie where Shawn meet the engineers and David translated for her about the answers and somehow seen the inevitable fate of mankind David release the black goo(yes that was a good idea in covenant)..What a waste of moneyWhat a waste of time waiting these years , this is what happens when a director follow the money and not his guts , you could make a great movie following the end of Prometheus with Shaw, you could insert the xenomorph again of course but instead you bring another ship of morons into a planet the same predictable movie ...and I almost forgot : like in Prometheus the same error...Where are the aliens????? The black goo was designed to create the alien (in Prometheus you can see in the room of the black goo canisters a statue of a xenomorph and that is before David create the alien) but the planet is empty and should be swarming by aliens , eggs, queen ,same here in alien covenant , 9 years since David release the virus on the engineers , still no aliens muted from them , just spore plants???? I gave 5 out of ten for the new small aliens , visual and David performance ..Try harder next time",5,6,12,23 May 2017
