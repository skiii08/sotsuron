Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin Tarantino's raging revenge story draws to a close!
","Warning: This review might contain minor spoilers, but I'll try to keep them as low as possible. ~ Aevora.K I L L   B I L L   V O L . 2Yesterday it was crunch time. In a completely sold out cinema I was going to watch the sequel of what I thought to be one of the best movies ever. First Kill Bill Vol.1 was shown, then a break and finally it was midnight and Kill Bill Vol. 2 was about to be shown.While the movie was playing, I didn't move. I didn't wink and I almost forgot to breath. I was so amazed. This was such an unique movie, and it was great on both a 'nice story'-level as an artistic level. When the credits came rolling, I was shaking and I was totally convinced: Kill Bill vol.2 is not only better than Vol. 1, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.And that quite surprised me. After seeing Vol. 1 with ultra-cool Gogo Yubari and classy, stylish O-Ren I did not think that QT could ever surpass the quality and intensity of that movie. I did look forward to Vol. 2 but was afraid to be disappointed. I was so wrong. Not only do Budd and Elle Driver overdo the coolness of Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii, they actually are able to be even cooler as Gogo Yubari.Vol.2 is a lot less violent and it is one big pack of dialogue. But the dialogue is so stunning, that you're not even disappointed that there's not so much violence in it. The action that does appear in the movie is outrageous and just great. As an effect of all these dialogues, you get sympathy for The Bride and even for Bill. The dialogues are never too long or too complicated, because there is always some action intwined with it.As The Bride comes closer and closer to the mindbreaking climax of the film, there are a couple of extraordinary scenes in the film. I will try not to spoil anything, but Pai Mei's training, the Paula Schultz thing and Budd and Elle in the trailer are certainly one of the best scenes there ever were in a movie (people who have already seen this movie know what I'm talking about).I don't think that QT could ever have used a better cast for this film. Uma Thurman shows that she act everyone of the screen as she plays a mother, a killer, a revengeful Bride and a lover. On top of that, each different side of her character is so well worked out by Uma that I think there might be an Oscar for her. Not to forget David Carradine. He plays Bill as such a mindless killing machine with a heart, that you think he is playing a double role, but it's just a piece of excellent acting. Michael Madsen is Budd and I wonder if the role is written for him. If not, Madsen could also be in the running for some awards. I was never a fan of Daryl Hannah. I thought she was kind of annoying. But I have to admit that she was sexy as ever and a great actress for the role of Elle Driver. At least one award for her. Keep an eye out for double roles by Gordon Liu and Michael Parks cause they are great. I really need to see this movie one more time to discover every little hidden detail that were also in Vol. 1.Conclusion: Fans of Kill Bill Vol. 1 are bound to go to this one, cause it's by far better than Vol. 1. If you found Vol. 1 a little over-the-top violent I suggest you just try out this one. You'll probably be amazed by the great storyline QT has written. The cast is great, the action is amazing and the storyline is stunning. I've got a A+ for Kill Bill: Vol. 2!",10,0,1,18 April 2004
