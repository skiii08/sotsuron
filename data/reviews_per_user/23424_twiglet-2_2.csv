The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project is dull
","Despite being told by everyone that I knew that the Blair Witch Project was the worst film they had ever seen I still went to see it.In principle the Blair Witch Project should have been a good film. It has all the scary essentials: Dark forest, scary noises, stories of witches but it fails to create any atmosphere at all. Given a big enough budget this film could have been terrifying. Instead it was just dull. Most of the time you are staring at a black screen waiting for something to happen. It doesn't.To sum up, despite the hype and the media attention the film is really not worth going to see.",1,2,3,3 November 1999
Final Destination," Not the top shocker, but a worthy addition to the line-up
","I don't know what the authors of the other comments are on about, I really liked this film. Maybe they tried to look too deep into the film, which is difficult since it is as shallow as they come. If you ignore the facts that the acting is a little wooden and the plot slightly contrived then this is a good enough way to spend a couple of hours, if only for the chance to see the characters getting picked off one by one in increasingly brutal ways. It would seem that Death is not someone you really want to annoy since he is incredibly resourceful when it comes to pay-back time.There was quite a lot of hype surrounding the film in the UK, what with the TV adverts showing people jumping out of their seats in terror every 10 minutes and I must admit that I did jump, but only about twice. It was definitely not the `shocker to end all shockers` it was made out to be.",8,2,2,1 June 2000
