First Man," Terrible bore. Why Gosling?
","An incredibly boring movie and lifeless movie. This movie obviously deals with Armstrong's flights and eventual moon landing and also how it affected his family. The actual flight and moon scenes were flawless, it all felt very real. What didn't feel very real was any emotion between him and his family at all. Gosling as always played the apathetic man of few words in some of the worst casting I've ever seen. It felt like there was no emotion towards his family or leaving them behind, should he not make it. The only emotion to be found was in the part of his wife. All I can say positively towards this film was I loved the score, it used tracks you'd hear in the old cartoons whenever a character ended up on the moon and managed to capture that feeling of wonder.",5,2,4,16 October 2018
Hereditary," Complex and Disturbing, but unmissable.
","I saw this movie on the UK premiere and it definitely left a lasting effect of pure dread, which is always great and elusive for horror nowadays. It's somewhere of a cross between a gut wretching family drama and a slow burning horror. It takes its time throughout taking you on a slow ride as you watch this family go through a series of horrid events and dig an equally horrid past, all the while tension between everyone slowly building up. Nobody is at rest, nobody is safe. The casting of this movie was spot on and the part of the unhinged mother and estranged family creates the perfect distancing give us the discomfort that everyone is together yet alone. The camera work did an astounding job of creating a fresh, tense kind of horror that was never put to rest with a jump scare and as a viewer you're never at ease, even after learning not to expect sudden scares. Towards the end the tension erupts and kind of transforms into full-on horror and leads us to a shock ending that ties the movie under a bow and brings together a number of clever hints and foreshadowings, the mood also totally shifts. As a movie I found this one very complex with the mix between drama and the total mood shift towards the ending, not to say it didn't pay off. I think Hereditary is just of the border of mainstream leading towards niche, and it tell anyone to give it a try.",9,4,8,15 June 2018
A Star Is Born," Haunting performance for anyone
","This movie is was all it was made out to be, a big budget knock out with 2 great main actors and a simple but fantastic story anyone can follow, but not an easy ride by any measure. Both actors were inspiring and charismatic, yet so rough around the edges. The movie was the perfect combination of grit and easy viewing, and everything that lead up to the conclusion had me invested in the two as a couple, which is perfect when things get serious.",8,3,6,10 October 2018
Climax," Mind blowing cinematography with a cult feel
","This movie was an outstanding feat to begin with, with most actors having no prior experience and the brilliance of the cinematography. There was a 42 minute take I believe, no jump cuts just switching up who the camera followed taking you along for an excellent ride. And the whole film was done in such a short timeframe.I liked the realism. While not the biggest fan of Vice I found the portrayal of what it's like to do psychedelic drugs in a bad setting quite on point and I think they were the right choice to make a film like this. Of course there is some extremity here and there baring in mind this was based off a true story where nothing really happened, but just the right amount. Excellent shock value and not nearly over the top.I highly recommend this film. Not for the uptight kind though",8,7,12,22 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A homage to perhaps the most stylish era of cinema
","Left this movie with my jaw hanging. I don't quite know where I rank this movie among Tarrantino's best and I don't feel the urge to rank it. It was a film all of its own that told a fantastic love story with cinema in the most stylish era of cinema and turmoil. As always the dialogue was outstanding and I think he brought out the very best his cast could offer. What I think I loved the most is that the movie wasn't just one thing, there were so many transitions to the pace and style. Ultraviolence, great storytelling, and taught moments that glue you to your seat. It has so much rewatch value and I already want to watch it again.",9,9,14,4 September 2019
