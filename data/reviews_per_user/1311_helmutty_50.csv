Angels & Demons," More interesting than Da Vinci Code.
","Angels and Demons is not too bad, it comes in a form of entertainment. It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels & Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.The story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought. The sets are amazing too.Overall: Fans of the book will flock the cinemas to catch this. Fans of the previous movie, Da Vinci Code, should also catch this. Those who like thrillers, this one may suit. This is supposed to be a fictional thriller which is not to be taken seriously.",6,34,55,16 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates of the Carribbean 4 3D is simple-minded and fun
","I must say I enjoyed Gore's Pirates of the Carribbean trilogy very much. Although the third one is crammed with many characters and confusing story plots, I still had a great time watching ships being wrecked apart. When a forth movie is announced, I was wary of it as I thought Gore has already concluded his vision. I did not actually show much interest in watching it until I heard it is shot in 3D and I am a big 3D fan. Pirates of the Carribbean: On Stranger Tides is an entertaining ride and much more simpler than the bloated At World's End.The story: Johnny Depp returns to his famous role, witty Captain Jack. His friend, Gibbs is back. Barbossa returns too. And these are the only characters that are back for a forth outing. Jack is still as witty as ever. Characters wise is okay. Some characters are under-used like the mermaids. Those action fans who expect Gore's visual and epic battles scenes will be a little bit disappointed in here. Rob Marshall goes for smaller yet still thrilling action set pieces. On the note of ships wrecking, there is none here. Story wise is alright. The pace moves decently. Critics and audience who complained that the previous movie is too bloated now do not need to wreck their brains with characters and confusing/long-winded side plots. Hans Zimmer is top-notch here again with the famous Pirates of the Caribbean music. As a 3D fan, I was a little disappointed with its usage of 3D. Shots of scenery are good but when it comes to the action, it lacks of the visual effects it is supposed to have and in your face moments. I have to admit that this is a bit too long for a 3D movie, struggling to keep the 3D glasses on top of my glasses and craning my neck like in Avatar. Overall: It is another Pirates and blockbuster movie to whet movie-goers's appetite. Of course, it is not like the Gore's movies or even as big as his but this still stand up with Rob's different directions. This might start up another series as this will no doubt earn a lot in box office.",7,12,19,19 May 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," A fun 3D movie.
","3D Movies like this are hard to come by this year. This is another movie which used 3D camera to film. The previous movie is Step Up 3D which the 3D is good too. I think only three live-action movies used 3D camera, Resident Evil Afterlife, Step Up 3D and the highly anticipated Tron Legacy. The rest are lazy 3D; notable ones are Clash of the Titans and The Last Airbender. Anyway, the 3D for this is good, I could see at least the effort to bother to get 3D camera to film it. As the usual in recent 3D movies, this does not really contain pop-out images but it brings us to the world where we are like standing next to them; watching the bloody battle between man and zombies.The story: It is as dead straight as a zombie walking. Alice still survives...and takes revenge on the Umbrella Corps in Japan. And she survives and saves some survivors. Yadayada...I could go on but is there a need to? It is as straight forward as the other three movies; if you can get the story of the other three movies, why not this? Plus this is a familiar video game adaption. The action is there with some cool slow-motion. But the climax is somewhat disappointing. As usual as the other three movies, this has annoying and cheap shock scenes. The director says 'Let's make it scarier by having shock scenes in 3D, people will be screaming!' Acting wise is the usual, Milla is cool. As usual in zombie movies, there is one annoying character that i couldn't care. Music is good and brings out the atmosphere but sometimes, the pop music is not needed.Overall: It is a fun 3D movie. You get to see man fighting zombies in 3D. The 3D and the action just immersed me into their horrible world unlike the recent video game adaption. The King of Fighter which makes me a little bored. Since this movie ends with a cliffhanger, I better expect a sequel.",8,12,26,10 September 2010
Star Trek," Not a fan of Star Trek.
","I have not even watch any of the Star Trek movies, not the 2003 movie. But it is J.J Abrams that makes me interested in the reboot/remake. His previous movie, Mission Impossible 3, is good and is the best of the trilogy. His latest effort, Star Trek, is not bad either. There is drama, there is fast-paced action and there is amazing special effects. J.J Abrams is famous for producing TV series, Lost, and the shaky Cloverfield.The story: The origin of Star Trek. It reaches out to everyone whether fan or not. Reboots/remakes are usually different from the original, this is something people need to accept while watching them in order to enjoy or like them. There are many successful reboots like Batman, Hulk and now Star Trek. J.J Abrams makes movies that are not too long or not too short. They usually clock around 2 hours, not more or not less. That is why, his movies are entertaining. His movies do not make you feel that they are dragged or being cut short. Now the story goes at a fast pace. Especially for those who are watching Star Trek for the first time. There is enough suspense and when it comes to action, it is purely intensity. The action scenes are breath-taking, fast-paced and are moving in a frenetic way. The music is epic too.Overall: Yeah, I don't know whether it is a good reboot but it is definitely a good adventure movie and worth the watch. Those interested in the origin of the Star Trek should catch. J.J Abrams' fans should catch this too. Star Trek's fans will catch this one. If there is a sequel, it should be up in my must-watch movies.",7,3,11,9 May 2009
Iron Man 2," This is not better or worse than the first one
","I can't say that this is better or worse than first one. One thing that Iron Man 2 is better than the first one is the action scenes. There are more robots to robots clashing in this one although they are a bit short and do not provide enough thrills. One thing Iron Man 2 does not have in the first one is the intensity of the story. This time, the story is not so fast, and in the middle, it drags. Jon the director tries to inject drama into this but in the end, it pulls the fast pace into a slower one. I am not saying it is bad but it just does not put justice to the first one which has a fun pace.The story: Like I said, this cannot be compared to the first, in fact. Since, Tony is back and he has bigger problems to deal including a villain. The first third of the movie is energetic including WhipSplash known as Ivan in a car racing scene. The second third of the movie is where the pace goes slower for Tony to deal with his personal problems and that gives time to Ivan to build robots. The last third is where Tony thankfully solves his major problem and prepares to suit up for the climax. It may not have the energy like the first one but it is still fun with new characters. John Debney,who replaces Ramin, creates an epic score for this one.Overall: It still entertains and has a lot of fun. I would say it is certainly a good sequel to the first while it is not comparable. This may be the only movie for your thirst of superheroes movies unless you count Jonah Hex in. This better makes good in box office to have a another sequel.",7,3,11,1 May 2010
Balls of Fury," Balls of fury!
","It is not that bad. I am one of the guys who like this. It is not bad comparing to the movies that were recently released in Singapore. Underdog is not very good, can't even be a superhero movie. Shoot em' up is for hard-core action fans and basically is very violent and bloody. Then it is Balls of fury which I enjoyed watching. I thought it was something like Prince of tennis, the live-action movie and the ping-pong ball fights scenes are something like that. That, the ping-pong ball fights, is the thing that attracted me to watch it. But Prince of tennis is better than this. Balls of fury got the comedy and the simple action which becomes a harmless fun movie. I like movies as long as they are fun or entertaining. Balls of fury, though fun, is considered quite dumb for some mature adults or teenagers, the director used stupid jokes like always get hit in the groin and banging into the wall. It has to be stupid to be funny. Sometimes, I admit that it is quite dumb in some of the scenes but it is fun, it got slow-motion ball fights, it got Maggie Q who is hot and it got dumb-a** jokes so what more you want for a dumb comedy.Overall, it makes a harmless movie that you can watch in your free time. It can be funny sometime and it too can be dumb sometime. You may laugh or smile at some scenes. I don't know but I smiled when watching it even at the stupidest jokes. Best to leave your brains at home while watching. This movie is not to be taken seriously.",6,21,28,30 September 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Wolverine the entertainer.
","All of X-men movies are pretty enjoyable and entertaining. The recent movie, X-men 3 is loud and entertaining at best. Now comes X-men origins: Wolverine is a prequel. It does its job to entertain people with its brutal and intense fight/action scenes and people will be engaged in the warped and mixed feelings of the mutants especially Wolverine. He has a tragic past that makes people feel sorry for him. We get the ruthless Victor Creed, who is known as Sabretooth, not being as cold-hearted as I thought. I am not familiarised with X-men or their origins, I have only watched the movies but i do know that X-men is one of the most popular Marvel comic.The story: Everything has its own past. Logan known as Wolverine is happy living his life working as a lumberjack and seeing his girlfriend everyday. Until then, William Stryker comes and destroy their lives. Wolverine becomes revengeful. I can't spoil the twists and turns or major story plot to those who are not familiarised with the story. The pace moves briskly. It is action-packed with some explosive action and also packed with mutants like well-know Gambit and Deadpool.Overall: It is not as bad as what some people say and it is also not as good as what other people say. But it is somewhere in the middle where you can enjoy watching it. Those who are not familiarised with the Wolverine's origins and want to know should catch this. Those who cannot get enough of X-men movies should be able to enjoy this or not. It is not the best or the worst marvel comic movie.",7,19,38,1 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Hot Fuzz
","It is a great cop movie featuring Sergeant Nicholas Angel, he is 'transferred' to Sandford, a sleepy town. Then murders start which the police take them as accidents which it is weird, some of the accidents do not even seem to be accidents. Nicholas tried to prove to the police that the accidents are just not merely accidents but murders. No one believe him so he has to go around the town to search for evidence. He meets Danny, a funny guy. They go around like the spoof of Bad Boys and others.It is good, it is violent but it still has some humour to cheer you up. Those who watched Shaun of the dead, you will basically know what type of violence it has. It too has a strong use of language. Its suspense will also keep hold of you. There it becomes a great movie for you to enjoy.It has some chase scenes and gun-shooting scenes which I enjoyed them. It is a rare sight watching a good cop movie which has humour. It is gritty. It is good to watch it in cinema, it will definitely crack you up and keep you at the edge of your seat. In this case, I like it.",7,3,5,10 June 2007
Terminator Salvation," Not great but massively entertaining.
","I have watched the terminator series, the movies are quite good. Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the series. One thing that disappoints is that there is no main terminator that goes killing humans like in Terminator 2. MCG, the director, did a great job especially creating the gritty and tough world. MCG proves that he can go from comedic action with stunts to loud whizz-bang and gritty action. But his story pretty much stays the same. His movies have always been a mindless thrill ride. That is Terminator Salvation.The story: It is the year 2018. John Connor has grown up to a bat-man-like with tough voice. He is serious and leads a team to destroy terminators and Skynet. There is one mysterious guy named Marcus who does not know why he is in the year 2018. Can Connor trust him? There will be some mild twists. The action starts with a bang. Explosions, chase scenes and one-to-one fights scenes with terminators. They are intense. There were times that made my heart pounded like scenes where MCG aimlessly put loud music in almost silent parts. The music is good but not as epic as the past movies like Terminator 2.Overall: It is a mindless action movie where almost all of the characters have only one goal in mind. Action is good and intense with explosions. Terminators' fans will definitely flock the cinema to see whether it is worthy to be in the name of terminator. MCG's fans will be proud that he has done a good job. Whether it is not like a terminator film, it will still be included in the terminator series. There may be a sequel or not...",7,71,128,30 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean 3
","I have to admit that the movie blew me off with action and realistic monsters, mostly on the perils. It is slightly confusing on which side they chose, they seem to be cheating each other or either feel that the side is bad, they chose another. Basically the sides are will's, Davy Jones' and Lord Cutler Beckett's. I have to admit that it is fun to watch the three sides clash together and you get a pretty intense war. The story is Elizabeth Swann and Barbossa going to Singapore to get Will and get help from captain Sao feng to get Jack sparrow back. It continues from where it last stop in Pirates of the Caribbean 2. You get more answers to your questions like the curse gold. With special effects that are realistic, what could go wrong. The director had the story entertaining as to keep people glued to the screen, making it suspense at times. They went to islands with perils, they sail in the sea with perils, everywhere they go, there is perils, that is why it is entertaining. Yes, it is long but it has cool action to keep you entertain, the last battle will blow you off.It is packed with action with loud music blaring in your ears, it has humour too. I can probably say that this is the best of Pirates of the Caribbean movies. You want cool action together with loud music, catch this. The price of the ticket is worth. I like it, may be one of the best part 3 movies, but this ending is somehow disappointing. Never mind that, you watch for the action or for the funny jack sparrow.",7,0,1,26 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider-man 3
","This is considered the best spider-man movie, the 1st spider-man movie was about the beginning, the growing, the 2nd movie was about, mostly touching our hearts, sad and lastly, the 3rd movie showed both of the types from the two movies which is good, the best spider-man movie. It has some great deal of actions and at the same time, it touches our hearts. The story followed Peter parker, spider-man, having some serious problems, he wanted to propose to Mary jane, his girlfriend but something got him and he did not propose, meantime, harry remembered his father's death and decided to take over his father and became the new goblin to kill Peter, not only that, sandman was also running away from the police which ended up that Peter knew him plus a freelancer, Eddie brock was out to get the job and ruined Peter's life and getting the job. Soon there was a blackish goo rise from outer space and needed a home so it mixed with Peter and transformed him into a new person, the bad and the cool side of him. There are so many things happening in a time. The fighting scenes are not so bad, more brutal than the last spider-man movies, the last fight scene is the best, you will get to see peter and harry teaming up together in order to fight with sandman and venom. You will get to see the long-awaited villain, venom which is cool but happened to appear in the last part of the movie only, only if the director had extended the last battle, it would have been good.The story is good, the CG effects are cool, (it seemed that the director was well-trained) this movie is a must-watch movie for spider-man's fans but newcomers may be good with it. It is not like any action movies, it has the story for you to keep on.",8,4,8,2 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Evil 3!
","This actually is an average zombie/horror movie but what makes it more interesting is that it has action-packed scenes which are great. I am not saying that this movie is not good but it is just the old trick, the same usual zombie movie. Zombie movies always feature hot women running and gore plus the usual type of story line. Resident Evil is based on the game which I never play. It is one of the few good game adapted although I did not play the game but the story line seems pretty interesting. Let's recount some of the previous movies that are adapted from the games. DOA is one of them and it is fairly okay. Bloodrayne is another and the two movies are trash. This is what I can recall. Let's head back to Resident Evil 3. Some of the pointers:Hot women: Check! It has number of hot women. Milla Jovovich did a pretty good job in carrying out Alice's role. Ali Larter (from the TV show, Heroes) also did a good job in portraying her character Claire. You get to see them fighting or shooting. Brave women.Gore: Check! That is the main target of almost all horror and zombie movies.It has quite a lot of gore and blood considering. It is more bloodier than Resident Evil 2. You get to see the usual gore like zombie biting people and others. It did a good job just not only for gore but the action stunts. That makes it not like most of the zombie movies. It has both the gore and the intense action.Storyline: It is better than Resident Evil 2. It has the simple story line to keep up. The story is Alice resurfaces to protect convoy of the uninfected towards refuge in Alaska. Simple and short. Along the way, you get to see Alice cutting zombies, doing high kicks and others.Overall, it does make a good harmless movie to watch during the weekends. It may not be the best game adapted but it certainly got the guts. You like both action and horror movies, this is for you.",6,1,3,9 October 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Better than Hellboy
","It took 4 years to make Hellboy 2. I think it was worth the wait. With more monsters in this sequel, it makes you think you are in another world and not earth. I always like superhero sequels, they are better than the first one. Hellboy 2 is one of the good sequel. There is the usual humour from Hellboy, the rest of the team like Liz, Abe and the mysterious Johann are good too. This sequel seems like a fantasy movie loaded with monsters while the first movie, Hellboy 1, seems like a dark and scary movie.The story: It is just like the usual superhero story, the villain goes crazy and bend on taking over the human world and the good guys go and save the world. But there are many monsters, you can't help but be fascinated by them. Some monsters look like from Pan's Labyrinth which is another masterpiece by director Guillermo del Toro. This guy likes dark fantasy a lot. Anyway, the action-packed story with the monsters will make you engross in the world they are living in.Overall: It is a fun summer flick. With great characters to make the movie more enjoyable, action fans will be pleased with the action scenes and there is a wide range of realistic monsters. What more do you want for a fantasy action flick? Guillermo del Toro makes this movie enjoyable with his humour and the usual over-the-top fantasy. It will be worth to watch this in cinema.",8,25,47,11 July 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's 13
","It kept me going because of its witty plot, otherwise, I would be sleeping in the cinema's cushy seat. I like them figuring how to revenge this Wilie Bank. They use ideas and I like that. The story is very simple. Ruben (Elliott Gould) almost fainted when Wilie (Al Pacino) asks him to sign his share. The story is that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang must come back to revenge Wilie. To bankrupt his great hotel.They start planning from there, and from there it seems a bit slow in the plot. Why don't they start doing things? The idea made me glued to the seat and not move although in some part, I had to blink my eyes or look to nowhere. I have to admit that some parts made me restless because this is the first time I am watching a movie that talks and talks. But still, I manage to see the whole movie. The plot is great and the acting is great. I feel that the music is a bit cheery so I think it would be better if they mix Ocean's 12's music into this movie.Bravo to the director who had the ideas of making it interesting and the ideas of continuing the whole series of the Ocean's. Those who is dieing of some big action, this is not for you as it will bore you. It may not be worth for the ticket but it is still worth to watch.",7,1,4,10 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne ultimatum!
","Another gritty spy movie! Before commenting on this movie, I have not watch the last two movies bu I roughly know the story. In the last two movies, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon)is trying to find out who he is. He is trying to search his unknown past. That is all I know. It seems interesting and it is interesting. It boasts great intense car chase scenes which is amazing but I can't really stand the shaking hand of the camera man. They wanted to make it more gritty. The shaking scenes gave me a hell lot of headache. And almost all the action scenes, they had to shake the camera.It is good, it has great action and has suspense too. I was actually only interested if Jason would die. That is why I watched this film. I must say I am pleased with the action. If you are the type that you will die if you don't watch the last part of a suspense movie immediately, I am sure this will kill you. It does have a great deal of suspense. It is good to watch it in cinema.",7,0,1,10 August 2007
28 Weeks Later," 28 Weeks later
","This is a realistic and scary movie. It seems real, that the zombies will affect other areas other than UK. That is scary! The point the director used, nobody can stop those nuts flesh-eating zombies, no matter, they use fire or whatever they can think of. Those zombies will still run after them. By any case, it is not one of the zombies' movies, it is slightly touching, and it is not those bloody zombies eating people, there is a meaning to what the director had directed. It is short but it shows a lot blood squirting, explaining things and big action, thrilling chase scenes. It is slightly a bit too dark to see, I know the director's intention- to make the place dark and makes zombies suddenly attack people, the shock factor. I hate it when he(the director) used tactics like keeping up with flashy scenes, that makes me go dizzy and I thought they blind my eyes.You want great bloody zombies movies. You will not be disappointed with the gore, often zombies come attacking people, munching on them, you get to see a lot of blood squirting. You want realistic zombie movies, here is one. It is thrilling, it is gritty and you never know when the time will come. Thinking about that is scary!",Null,2,5,27 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The best Harry Potter movie yet
","Surprisingly, this is more intense and action-packed than the previous movies. The previous movie, the half-blooded prince has literally no action, only some mild struggle of magic battles. The deadly Hallows is better than the last in terms of action and intensity. From start to the credit rolling, I had to hold my breath during the intense 2 hours and 26 minutes as I have not read the books; not knowing what could happen next. With the realistic acting, the high level of intensity is achieved.The story: It starts off darkly with Voldemort displaying his cruelty without hesitation. And from that scene, you know you will be absorbed into the now dark and bleak world of Hogwart. Harry Potter and his friends are the run and nearly every where they stop for a rest or go into hiding, troubles find them. And that are the parts where David Yates proves that he can create some hectic action scenes. Though the action scenes are brief but they are intense like the first action scene where Harry had a narrow escape. The action scene in the forest is intense though frenetic. The story may drag a little in the middle but it has a purpose; to understand the trio's emotions more. The acting is good. The intensity between Daniel, Emma and Rupert is good and believable. The other characters' suspicious looks and capable of doing anything also make this intense. The special effects are breath-taking. Music score is also epic; the music matches the movie right and at the right time.Overall: Is it the best Harry Potter movie? I can't say as the final movie is not out until next year. But this is definitely the best Potter movie so far as I feel that it balances the right amount of action and drama and intensity. I was left disappointed after watching the half-blooded prince but this is good follow-up where I didn't actually feel disappointed. One of the better blockbuster movie this year.",8,2,4,19 November 2010
Disturbia," disturbia DVD review R1
","Wow! I am pretty impressed with the movie, and this is not the type that will try to shock you all time like some horror thriller movies. It will slowly scare you at some scenes and I am not prepared to be scared at the scenes but suddenly it gave me the shock. After one scene that shocked me, I knew I would have to be prepared to be scared by other scenes. But for a thriller movie, I won't want to say that this is a horror movie, it had done a pretty good job.The story is about Kale and his father go fishing and on their way back to home, they meet with an accident which Kale's father gets smashed up by a zooming car. Then we see Kale in school, punching the Spanish teacher after the teacher mentions Kale's father. Then in the next scene, Kale is confined in home, not able to walk out of his house. His X-box line is cancelled and his mother cut off the line of his T.V in his room. He got nothing to do but to spy on his neighbours and met a hot girl. From there, he suspects that his neighbour is a murderer. He try to uncover him.Overall, it turns out to be a good thriller flick. But it could have been better, it is spitted into two parts, the first forty-five minutes is about the spying on his neighbours and the last hour is about the uncovering of the suspected neighbour.The DVD contains special features, it contains four deleted scenes which are boring, mostly extended. The usual making of the movie, bloopers, outtakes, music videos, trailers, quiz and audio Commentary. Worth to catch it on DVD.",7,0,1,18 August 2007
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Good straight-forward entertainment packed with action.
","It is a pretty straight-forward action flick. With the short runtime of 1 hour and 28 minutes, you can expect this to move briskly and to be packed with a lot of action.The story: The movie starts with the young Hansel and Gretel losing their parents. They are shortly picked by a witch to be food. They manage to escape and burn the witch alive and that's how they become witch hunter. Cue to the opening credit. The next scene shows them saving an innocent woman whom is accused of being a witch. And from there, the action keeps going. There are some slight twists about the innocent woman and Hansel and Gretel's parents. Other than that, it is purely straight-forward for a good thing. The action scenes are not bad but they are more gritty than fantastical. Music wise is quite alright with Han Zimmer acting as the music supervisor.3D: It is okay. As many of the scenes take place at night, the 3D effect dampens. It becomes more like harder to see. But when it comes to explosions, blood splatters and action, it is gimmicky with objects flying to your face. Other than that, the 3D is not really recommended unless you have some spare money.Overall: It is not bad for the month of January. Sure, there is a great potential that the movie never reach but Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters won't disappoint if you want a good entertainment packed with action. Next fairy tale movie is Jack the Giant Slayer in Feb.",7,51,89,29 January 2013
Step Up 2: The Streets," Step up 2
","It is just okay for a dance movie. In dance movies, the plot is not a thing to look out for, it is the dance moves. Step up 2 features cool dance moves but the plot is so simple. But it is a dance movie, we should be watching it for its dance moves not some good plot. Step up 2 features some of the most coolest dance moves. When I was watching it, I was wondering how did they do all the moves. The dance moves are amazing. Though the dance moves are amazing, I felt the plot is boring.The story: it is really simple. Andie is a girl who street dancing at a so called club called The Street. She then is sent to Texas, she enrolls at MSU where they don't accept her type of dancing. She gathers a group to impress an underground street dance competition. I don't even bother about the story plot. It is simple, nothing you cannot understand. The dance moves is well done.Overall: You like dancing movies or you are looking for cool dance moves, this should be watched. Basically, I have nothing to say about this movie but only rave about the dance moves. Other than watching the dance moves or hot people dancing, there is really nothing more in this movie.",5,6,9,7 March 2008
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," An equally thrilling yet safe installment to the franchise
","Tom Cruise is back and though he is ageing, he still proves he is capable of stunts. Mission: Impossible - Rough Nation is an action-packed thrill ride but everything is familiar from the mysterious organisation to the double-cross agent. It does not deliver anything we have not seen in the Mission: Impossible franchise. Luckily, director Christopher McQuarrie injects the same thrilling energy into his set pieces and keeps the pace fast enough.The story: IMF is disbanded and a wanted Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is determined to bring down a mysterious organisation, the Syndicate. Yes, that is all the story offers. The series of action set piece push the story forward. Director Christopher is known for his smaller film, Jack Reacher. From the get-go, he is determined to show that he can handle an action film on a bigger scale. The beginning shows Ethan hanging for his dear life on an airplane. And the action gets bigger and disappointingly balloons down in the climax. This is one of those action films where the climax cannot top the big action scenes in the beginning and middle. The notable action scenes are in the opera and an extended set piece where Ethan breaks into a power station and ends up on a thrilling motorcycle chase. Perhaps Christopher realised that he could not top them so he opted for a more personal and smaller scaled climax. Acting wise is the usual in the franchise. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson plays a decent character. Music by Joe Kraemer is great.Overall: Is it worthy to be in the franchise? Yes, it is. It has all what a Mission: Impossible film needs. However, as with Tom Cruise ageing, the franchise is close to loosing its steam with its already-seen-it-all plot. What this franchise could do is to have a fresh take on the spy genre. With the sixth film announced, let's hope it can be something more than just a big- bang action film.",8,4,8,30 July 2015
Quantum of Solace," Don't compare this with Casino Royale
","If you want to enjoy this movie, it is best for you to see this as a stand-alone movie. I know that Quantum of solace is a direct sequel of Casino Royale. I won't compare this with Casino Royale, each of them has its own points. Casino Royale is the introduction of characters and James Bond. Quantum of solace directly continues where Casino Royale left off. It is action-packed, more action-packed than Casino Royale. James Bond is back and nobody can stop him seeking revenge for his dead Vesper. The stunts are admittedly good. Action scenes are intense. Location sets are beautiful. Bond movies can't possibly go wrong with Bond himself.Story: As this is the direct sequel to Casino Royale, it starts off where it left off. It starts with a car chase scene and soon the dangerous foot chase which is amazing. Yes, there is action non-stop. The action scenes are thrilling and intense, they are not like those repeated action scenes where I get bored watching them. Bravo for the stunts. They are all realistic. The story do not really develop, Bond on a mission to stop an environmentalist, Dominic Greene, from taking control of a country's water supply and Bond is also on his mission on revenging for his dead girlfriend. Camille (Olga Kurylenko) is then introduced, she also wants to stop Greene as she has some personal reasons for doing that.Overall: It is a good direct sequel to Casino Royale that only picks on the stunning stunts and action. Bond fans will definitely watch this. Action fans will like this too. Those looking for any developments like characters' developments in movies, this will not be the right one. Leave your brains at home and just let the action unfold.",7,4,6,8 November 2008
District 9," Interesting and intense.
","It is not as good as a masterpiece as what others have said and definitely not a bad movie as some die-hard sci-fi fans said. It is good but not a masterpiece, it manages to keep you engage to the screen with its raw intensity and realistic feel. I was afraid that it will become Cloverfield, with its shaky hand-held camera. But I was proved wrong. This is far more interesting and intense than Cloverfield. This has different views of different characters unlike Cloverfield-it is filmed with only one hand-held video camera.The story: Humans disrespect the new aliens that came to Earth. The aliens live in slums in South Africa. The aliens have emotions, their faces express their emotions. The acting is natural and it adds to the overall realistic feeling in this adventure movie. The adventure may not be that unique but the raw intensity will keep you on the seat and makes it more watchable. The effects are good, better than Dragonball Evolution with a budget of 45 million.Overall: Though it may not be an unique adventure, it is an unique experience. Those who want an unique experience and raw intensity, this is worth the money. This is one movie that does not hold back the brutal violence and language, it is more violent than Cloverfield.",7,5,10,15 August 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission: Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol
","This is the first live-action directed by Brad Bird who is well-known for his Pixar movies including The Incredibles. I was particularly interested in seeing how he will fare in his debut live-action movie and it turns out that he proves live-action is not a problem for him. Mission: Impossible 4 is a fun thrilling action-packed ride.The story: Ethan Hunt is back for a new mission as seen in the opening scenes-he rescues a criminal from prison. And from there, the action almost does not stop. The story is straight-forward but the whole movie is filled with tense action. We didn't even hear the characters talking randomly about other topics other than spy stuff. I never got bored as the movie does not give you a chance to be bored. The tense action is always running to keep you glued to your seat. The action scenes are cool and brutal. I am surprised Brad directs those scenes brutally with bone-crunching sounds. The fist-cuffs are brutal for the franchise. Of course, one of the most notable scenes is when Ethan climbs the tallest building in Dubai. The whole scene is tense as it is real. Another notable scene is the thrilling chase in the sandstorm. Is it intense for someone to chase someone without able to see properly? The humour mostly from Simon Pegg helps to enhance the movie. Acting wise is fine. Music wise is good. It helps to give a more tense feeling to the already tense action scenes.Overall: It is solid entertainment. It is also a action spy movie to whet fans of the spy genre and James Bond. This could actually be the best Mission Impossible movie. This is actually better than the good J.J Abrams' Mission Impossible in terms of action and tense story. This proves that Brad Bird not only can direct animation but can direct an action-packed movie filled with cool action scenes.",8,14,32,15 December 2011
2012," 2 and an half hour of pure destruction
","2012 is a thrilling and emotional ride. Scenes of the cities/countries are amazing, the CGI looks so real that almost convince you that they are really being destroyed. I am sure the CGI is the one that stands out in the movie. People would watch it for the CGI. There is also a lot of emotion added into this movie, the acting including the children's is quite good.The story: First, it starts off a little slow but when it comes to second destruction, that is where pace becomes faster due to the thrilling escapes of destruction. When the destruction comes, a lot of people die and become selfish. John Cusack plays Jackson who is a writer (John also plays a writer in the thrilling horror movie 1408) trying to save his family. That is usual in a disaster movie. They then meet some other characters and try to plan their escape. Everything is destroyed and not one thing is spared. The music goes well especially with emotional scenes.Overall: Even if you don't like the plot, you would enjoy the fantastic and realistic destructions of countries/cities. Even if you find the story lame, you have to admit that the CGI is really well done. Though the CGI stands out in the movie, I find that some emotional scenes are good as well. Like disaster movies, you would probably enjoy this. Cannot stand unrealistic plot including big goofs, you may not enjoy this.",7,1,4,14 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Ghost rider!
","After watching daredevil, I did not have high hopes for ghost rider which was under the same director. Daredevil was not very good, the case it was straight forward. Ghost rider which was slightly different than daredevil, proved that perhaps the director had learnt his lesson. One thing, this is not a kid film like spider-man or superman which means that the director can create violence and scary scenes. There are some suspense but the director made a fool out of it and it turned out not scaring people. The director did a good job on making ghost rider to live. But bad job on finding the actor of ghost rider, he looks to old to be a handsome superhero. The director had learnt his lesson, deciding to make it more thrilling than daredevil. It lacks the violence that was needed. If ghost rider was so capable of killing the bad guy in around five minutes, why not put him into a fight with the devil who caused him so much pain. Ghost rider may not be very good but at least it proved that the director put in more effort than the crap daredevil.",7,3,5,17 February 2007
Stardust," Stardust!
","Before watching this movie, I felt that it was not nice, the feeling of it that made me not want to watch. But I am glad that I did watch it and it is pretty cool. I thought it will talk a lot and it did prove me wrong. It cut pretty short on talking compared to other fantasy movies (where they talk a lot in the introduction) and goes straight to the intense action. It is safe to say that this can be one of the best fantasy movies or the best. Compared to The dark is rising, Stardust did a lot time better than it. Finally, a fantasy movie that don't disappoint. The recent fantasy flicks like Eragon and The dark is rising just fall flat to the ground. Surprisingly, Stardust got the right pace and end nicely.Stardust is good for all age not like Lord of the ring which has some violent scenes. Stardust has the humour to cheer people up but it does have its intense scenes too. It is a good fantasy movie unlike the recent ones. It won't disappoint you in terms of fantasy and plot. It is slightly weird and funny, it does have the intense action mixed with good intense music and has fantasy violence and things like the flying boat. What is more you want from a fantasy movie. The plot is surprisingly interesting too. It can keep you going. The recent fantasy movies do not have all these points. Stardust has a lot of reasons for you to watch.Overall, it did pretty good in the term of fantasy. It is a great movie to watch in the weekends or anytime. It does have the suspense to keep you watching.",7,7,10,28 October 2007
I Am Legend," I am not legend!
","When I looked at this movie, it does show you that he is alone but he is not...Enough of this. I am legend proves itself that it can hold the suspense and as to shock people with its fierce vampires/undead ( I don't know what it is). It has some suspense, its suspense is not bad like you will want to the end ( The ending is not what I expected) or whether the undead perish or remain and there are some more. The undead are scary, they are smart ( Not the dumb zombies in horror movies that just walk and walk) and fierce. You would not want them when you are alone.The story is simple- Will smith's character is alone with his dog, man's best friend. His daily life is boring since there is no one to talk to. He just watch recorded News, go to take CD from CD shop, play golf in the air-force area and more. The point is that there are no people not even in the CD shop, he sets up dolls in street and in the CD shop and pretend that they are real people. But he is lonely, the dolls won't give him a response. After the introduction of his boring life, he discovers undead and takes one of them to be his experiment. Then he runs and shoot undead and that is all. The disappointing part is that the introduction takes up around 30 minutes, that gives little time for the undead to appear. SPOILERS: After he lose his only friend, he becomes depressed and sad. The point is that he is not alone. SPOILERS END. Will smith did a good job in playing his character where he is to be lonely.Overall: It does seem realistic and asks you the question 'What happen if you are alone in the country/world?' Those who were expecting an action-packed horror movie and watched this, it could be quite disappointing. It is certainly not really an action-packed movie but it does interest me with its suspense. Those who want an action-packed shooting or exploding movie, I am sorry that it is not. Those who want to watch it for entertainment, this could be worth watching. It is not bad but it could do some improvement for the introduction scenes.",6,1,3,24 December 2007
Shrek the Third," Shrek 3
","Before I comment on it, to say the truth, I don't like watching Shrek movies. They are boring and not funny enough. I am not sure why I am watching this movie, is it because I heard it was good? I am not sure what came to my mind watching this. I thought of an excuse, a one good excuse is I love seeing the cute Puss in the boots. He is a character that makes the movie likable, in my reasons. I am not sure about that. All right, I have to admit that some jokes got me but the problem is that since this is made for kids, you can't expect big action or much potty humour, oh well, maybe I like watching big action. It is pretty like the previous Shrek movies, with more characters. The point...why can't the director make it exciting so that we don't have to say 'Oh my! It's another Shrek movie, and why do I feel like I have watch this before.' But, I have to say this one is better than the previous Shrek movies. In my choice, often the third part is better than the second and the first movies.If you have nothing better to do, like me, you might want to catch this or if you are a fan of Shrek, this suits you.",Null,0,0,29 May 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic Four 2
","You can't compare the first movie to this, the second movie. While, the first Fantastic Four movie shows the introduction or the beginning of their powers and how they live with their superpowers, the second movie is on the action. The story is simple, a strange alien comes to the world and while Johnny chases after the silver sleek alien, he somehow gets to know the name, silver surfer. Silver surfer comes to destroy the world like others bringing Galactus to eat the world up. From there, the Fantastic Four must do something or their world will soon end.It is quite short, somehow like a short movie, but still it can entertain you with excellent fights with special effects which is the most entertaining, the talking about how to destroy or bring the board away from the Silver surfer is quite fast. All they do is action. On the other side, the movie is quite short and hence the fights scenes are quite short. Dr Doom is back and he is more powerful but the movie does not prove that he is powerful, that is why Fantastic Four can't be a short movie, when it is short, it can't prove the Fantastic Four to be more powerful like Dr Doom.Don't let the PG rating affect you, some scenes are a little intense. Either you like the first movie or you like to see Silver surfer in action, you can watch it. Hopefully, we will get an extended version on DVD.",7,10,20,15 June 2007
Transformers," Best movie of 2007
","I considered this as one of my best movie. Is this consider Michael Bay's best? I think so. Although, you can see his usual big and loud action with exploding things. When we first heard that Michael Bay was going to direct this movie, we all knew that it would be loud and had a lot of action. Michael displayed his action types. Exploding things come smashing and big robots chunking themselves at each others. So when you are watching this in cinema, it will be very loud. Michael made the robots' designs cool with the modern touch. Those who complain that the robots do not look like the usual cartoon, Michael made the robots to look cool, they are modern, not to look like the old cartoons.The story is dead simple, you get a young man, Sam Witwicky falls in love with a pretty girl, Mikaela and bought a old car which transforms into Bumblebee. From there, the Decepticons chase them and Optimus Prime told them that they want the glasses which has the location of the allspark. The robots smashing each others start here.The fightings are intense, smashing and hurling at each other, it means you get to see brief moments on how the robots are fighting. The Decepticons are disappointing, most of them only come to screen at the last half and hour and do not show their true powers, I mean, they are huge and evil-looking for no reason. You will get to see Megatron fighting Optimus Prime, the longest fight. The final fight is the best but the whole movie is good with the heavy music.This is for all, fans or not. Those who are not fans of transformers may like this too as this is not about the robots, it is the action. Those fans of action, you also will want to watch this. Worth the price of the tickets.",10,3,10,30 June 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy," The best entry in Marvel's Phase Two
","Marvel likes to take risks hiring fresh directors for its big projects. James Gunn, who has only directed two movies and written a few movies including Scooby-Doo, was tasked to bring bunch of misfits to life. The risks are James Gunn, who does not have a lot of credits, and the source material, which is not very well-known to general audience. Fortunately, James has proved people wrong, he could indeed direct a fast-paced entertaining and witty action thrill ride.The story: By now, general audience and fans should know the formula of every Marvel movie. Guardians of the Galaxy does not change much in that aspect. But what makes it stand out from the others is that these heroes are almost like anti-heroes. In the start, they are not heroic or morally right. They are sort of selfish and only think for their own good. However, further in the movie, they begin to help each other and form a team know as Guardians of the Galaxy. It could draw comparison with The Avengers. In The Avengers, the heroes have to learn how to work with each other. James Gunn does not bother to add long dramatic speeches or poetic dialogues to develop the characters. Instead, he blows things up to let the characters bond with each other. There are lots of action. In fact, it is one of Marvel's most action-packed movies. Right from the start, it is packed with fast-paced explosive action. The CGI works with the action scenes. Rocket and Groot are two neatly animated characters. The rest of the characters are just as entertaining. The villains may not have a lot of things to do except growling in their heavy make-ups and showing bits of their powers. Music by Tyler Bates is good especially in some tender moments.Overall: Guardians of the Galaxy may have a formulaic story but it has heart. Surprisingly it is touching at times. It has all what a blockbuster should have; thrilling action, great CGI, epic music. Marvel is confident that this will do well that it has announced a sequel. With this just as the first adventure, I would surely like to see more adventures as they face more challenges.",9,4,9,3 August 2014
Ip Man," Ip Man!
","I had a choice of watching The Spirit or Ip Man. It is a tough decision and after a long while, I finally makes the choice of watching Ip Man. The director of Dragon Tiger Gate makes his comeback with his usual star, Donnie Yen. As expected, the martial arts fighting scenes are amazing. This director is amazing, he knows how to direct realistic martial arts fighting features in Dragon Tiger Gate. This guy can create, I can say, some of best martial arts movies.The story: It tells about Ip Man's life, the soon-to-be master of the famous Bruce Lee. I can't say much about the plot but the fighting and the music are great. The Japanese soon attacks China which affects Ip Man and his family. Soon, he goes for a fight, organised by the Japanese, which can earn him rice. The Japanese General is impressed by his ability which leads to the final battle of all. It is fast paced with amazing fights in between and humour.Overall: If you are a martial arts movie fan, this is definitely stunning and not to be missed. If you get entertained by any form of action and want to know the facts of Bruce Lee's master, this should also not be missed. Another good martial arts movie.",8,54,93,25 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Better than Begins
","Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing.The story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker.Overall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie.",8,12,24,19 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter
","Harry Potter series is quite popular for teenagers and adults too. It became live-action which is great. The first movie, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone, is not very good as the fantasy is quite mild but as the series go on, from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating, it is getting more darker. This movie is the newest Harry Potter movie, passing on to the fifth year for Harry Potter in Hogwarts and Voldemort is back, finally gets to show magic powers. There too are new characters as for Dolores Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, a new villain and Lunna Lovegood. With all these new characters, Harry Potter will have face more difficulties. Harry Potter movies are just the short version of the long-pages books. For me, I prefer to watch than reading long stories.The movies are getting better, with more darker tone and more serious looks, this movie can never go wrong with teenagers and adults if they like dark movies. This will definitely have darker tone compared to the other Harry Potter movies. Then soon, as the series move on, it will be quite dark with different directors with different ideas. I will have to see how this go on.It is not that bad, it is just a bit too short. There is not much action to it. Oh yeah, I forgot, Harry Potter is mainly a theme for frightening scenes not some big action. Well then, you can't expect some exploding things, if you want that, go and watch Transformers. Harry Potter proves to be more darker. Now, he loses his cool and shouts back, now he wants revenge. Harry Potter is growing up. It is not the timid boy you once knew. The last fight is disappointing. Once again, you are dealing with magic not big action.You will probably get some shock if you watch it in cinema and also there is some suspense. So if your kids are afraid, don't bring them. You should know Harry Potter movies are increasingly dark.",6,0,4,11 July 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," Entertaining fun romp
","How to Train Your Dragon may not have a complex plot but its plot with the help of its 3D is engaging enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen. It is also a fun light movie that kids can enjoy. Alice in Wonderland may be a little dark for them. This has some scary/intense scenes with the dragons but it should be fine for the kids as most of the dragons appeal to them. DreamWork movies now are usually 3D and Pixar is following after it. I think DreamWork movies keep improving. I actually find this better than its last movie, Monsters Vs Aliens.The story: Hiccup dreams to kill dragons like Vikings do. He is often ignored by his father when he says he wants to help kill dragons because of his 'weak' size. When he finally caught a dragon, he gets closer to it and soon, he understands everything he wants to. The plot is straight forward, there is no twist to twist and turn the story. One thing that caught me while watching is the striking John Powell's score. He did an epic score for this which is another factor which contributes to the greatness of this movie. You got cool 3D effects, an enjoyable plot with humour and striking John Powell's score.Overall: It amazes me how much I enjoyed this movie. I never expected much from a DreamWork movie but instead this proves me wrong. I am surprised that this takes little time to dwell on the emotions of the characters and use the remaining time to make a funny action-packed movie. It is a good 3D movie for the kids if you think Tim's Alice In Wonderland is a little too dark.",8,12,24,20 March 2010
American Made," An entertaining and fun well-made film boosted by great direction and acting.
","Doug Liman and Tom Cruise paired up together again for a fast-paced and colorful biography on Barry Seal. American Made may not have the blockbuster action but it holds up on its own firmly with the help of a great direction by Doug. Tom Cruise is definitely the main highlight of the film and he is what made it so entertaining.The story: The pace is brisk; it takes the audience on a crazy ride from the start and never slows down. Though it never felt boring, sometimes I felt that it could have slowed down for some development. After the film ended, it seems that Doug and Tom had a clear mind on just keeping the audience as entertained as they can be. It cuts to the chase and never dwells on anything such as emotions. It moves quickly from event to event. Advantage is that I was not bored at all. Disadvantage is that it felt like a 2 hours montage on Barry Seal's life. There is no real tension or character's development. The realism is helped by the smart decision of filming like a documentary. Be warned: Action genre fans may be disappointed that is no big action. It is strangely classified as action. Acting wise: Tom Cruise looks like he had lots of fun filming. It is just entertaining watching him immersed himself in the crazy and fast-paced world of Barry Seal. The rest of the cast are decent but not impressive.Music wise: Christophe Beck created a decent mood of the different years. Since Doug wanted the film to feel realistic, it is not jam-packed with music. There are many moments where sounds and ambiance take the front seat. Overall: It is not impressive but it is a solid entry to Doug Liman's and Tom Cruise's filmography. I went in with low expectation and had no idea about the outrageous stuff Barry Seal did. And not only was I entertained, I was immersed into the world of Barry.",9,53,85,3 September 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," does not deserve the overwhelming negatives reviews.
","The most anticipated movie is here! It is loud, explosive and noisy. Transformers 2, in short, is very entertaining with big robots smashing one another. It is also intense and epic especially at the last battle scene. Michael Bay does what he do best. Big explosions, more bigger explosions and the biggest explosions. Transformers 2 is a non-stop action fun romp where you just have to sit and wait for it to unfold. You do not need to do anything else, like thinking and pointing out goofs.Story: It is almost like the first one where story is just hidden in the amounts of explosions and CGI robots. But in Transformers, why do I care about plots that are intelligent? I am watching it for robots smashing each other. That is one thing a critic is never going to know. If Transformers has a twisted, dark and complex plot and the robots just appearing in a few scenes, it won't be called Transformers. Transformers means fun, explosions and robots. The music is even epic. Explosions are cool. The cast are hot. The director is insane. But one thing I do not like is that it has too much comedy and some lame characters trying to funny.Overall: It is a good summer movie. Take a break from watching the usual genres, and watch something different. What is not fun seeing robots destroying everything in their path? Let see if G.I Joe is as successful as Transformers. Maybe not.",8,18,41,24 June 2009
30 Days of Night," 30 days of night!
","The vampires in this movie are not the usual vampires you see in other movies. This vampires are more fiercer and more of a beast. When they talk to each other, they growl or speak in their own language ( I don't know what they are speaking). 30 days of night is a violent movie not for the faint-hearted, it is gory and beautiful ( in some ways). The background is beautiful, like pure ice. But in the end, it become red as blood will flow when the beastly vampires come and munch their ways through. It is not beautiful anymore.The story is simple, Alaska is shrouded in darkness for 30 days. Can you believe it? Josh Hartnett stars as the main character in this movie. He brings some survivors into hiding from the vampires. Guess what? Not many survivors can escape. The vampires always can find them and it is time for them to fight them off. Include some head-chopping scenes. Those who did not read the comic, it brings you into knowing how the survivors are going to ward off the vampires. Other than that, the first 30 minutes seems boring and the violence seems the same. The same head-chopping scenes. This can bring laugh or smile if you are not the serious type. For me, I laughed at the vampires' suits. They look less scarier and look like infected business men who don't bother to take off their suits.Overall: Those who like hard-core gory violent movie or fans of vampires movies, watching this will entertain you. It has its suspense to hold you to the seats. Those who are faint-hearted, steer away from this violent movie.",5,0,1,28 November 2007
Edge of Tomorrow," A solid and fresh blockbuster that doesn't feel tired
","It is probably one of the freshest blockbuster for a while. Although its idea is from a Japanese novel, it does not feel bloated and tired like some franchises in this summer are suffering. The movie is what the trailers are suggesting; big-budget action-packed sci-fi movie. But what the trailers didn't reveal is its surprising sense of humour. It feels fresh because blockbusters nowadays take themselves too seriously and this doesn't. The story: It surprisingly starts off without an action scene (many blockbusters like to start off with a big bang action scene). Tom Cruise plays William Cage who is suddenly put in the front line of a battle. The thing is that he is not used to combat. The action starts not long when he is plunged into the battle between alien and human. After he dies the first time, he is brought back to life again. And it goes on. That sums up the first act. Montage of big explosive action scenes and him dying over and over again. Surprisingly it doesn't feel tired and boring. I don't want spoil the second act as the truth is revealed. The third act rams up with an exciting climax. Doug Liman holds up the pacing well, things don't feel repetitive (due to different camera angles too). There is definitely a lot of action. There are times where there are explosions for the sake of a blockbuster movie. But what is nice in these action scenes, both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt have their different fighting styles. Acting wise is fine. It is nice seeing Tom acting out of his comfort zone. Emily does not have to act much except to act cool and swing into action when it is needed. Music wise is fine too.Overall: So far, the blockbusters this year seem tired and rely on their own franchise to sell (Spider-Man, X-Men and upcoming Transformers etc). Edge of Tomorrow may be based on the Japanese novel but it proves to be something fresh on the big screen. It is worth a shot to watch it on big screen. It is a blockbuster that doesn't take itself too seriously and let the audience sit back and watch the action unfold without being overly complicated and bloated.",8,7,13,31 May 2014
Hancock," Hancock!
","Will Smith is a famous actor. He acted in the recent movie, I am Legend and his movies usually make a lot of money. His new movie, Hancock, is good fun although there are some disappointment. I have seen Peter berg's The kingdom which is intense with big gun shootout in the end. I must say that Hancock almost has the same style of The Kingdom- the unsteadiness of the camera, things that explode and some more. The fight scenes and the villains should be better, it is not what I expected but because of the story.The story: Will Smith plays Hancock, a destructive superhero who does not care about destroying people's things like cars, train and buildings. People hate him. He saves a guy, Ray, who considerably asks Hancock to do what he is supposed to. Hancock spends his time in jail, trying to turn a new leaf. Soon, when crimes rates are rising, Hancock saves the world. Just the usual superhero story but Hancock is a superhero that is destructive and says anything he want to say. Unlike other superheroes who are usually good and well-mannered, Hancock does anything he like- not taking things into consideration. I would not really call this an usual superheroes movies, it would be more of an action drama with people with powers added.Overall: Is it good? Well,I would say that it is okay. I thought it could have done more better. With the runtime, it is okay as it is made that it would not be boring. There are twists on the way to the end. Other than that, it got the humour and Will Smith is good. If you are a fan of Will Smith, you should probably catch this out. If you like superheroes movies, this one should fit you but don't expect too much. It would be good to watch this in cinema, you get to see some thrilling action rushing into your way.",7,2,8,3 July 2008
Shooter," Shooter! DVD
","This movie is fun, not only it has the action but it too has the suspense and the mystery. Something that action movies don't really have. It has blood and some gore, so to fans who like watching bloody movies, this one is no problem. It has big action, to appeal to action-packed movies fans like me.Shooter is about an ace marksman, Swagger (Mark Wahlberg)was framed for the presidential assassination he was trying to prevent, he is forced to go on the run while trying to track down the real killer and discover the truth about who betrayed him. Simple. Action starts from here. It is great having to watch this kind of action movies, the gritty type. It has the expression, it has the guts and it will show blood whenever it wants to. It is the brutal type, it won't lower down the amount of blood, there will always be blood when people are shot. It does have the heart in it. Great action flick! The DVD includes the making, deleted scenes and etc...like what other DVDs have for the special features. The deleted scenes show some extended clips, the extended shopping scene and etc... Great for a DVD.",7,0,2,8 August 2007
Sherlock Holmes," One of the best movies of 2009
","We had noisy and explosive blockbusters in summer etc.Transformers 2, G.I Joe. While they were entertaining, they were just into the action with simple story and some lame jokes. So now comes December, other than Avatar, another so-called blockbuster is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes is a reboot by Guy Ritchie which shows the younger Sherlock and his partner, Waston. Whether it is a true reboot, I don't know as I am not familiarise with the original. But this reboot will definitely get some new fans.The story: It has a good mix of genres, action and thriller/suspense and mystery with a touch of humour. In the end, Guy manages to blend them together and forms an entertaining, thrilling and good movie. Sherlock does action, he does boxing and he seems not to be afraid of pain. Not only he knows perfect action, he also can visualise. That is what makes him so deadly. Other than that, his mind is smart and can observe background fast and still manage to say quirky humorous jokes. Robert Downey Jr is good for that Sherlock. Han Zimmer also does a perfect job in creating the electrifying music.Overall: It is worth a watch. Even if you don't know who is Sherlock Holmes, it is still good to watch this and who knows, you may even become a fan of him. It is a good blockbuster as the summer has noisy and non-sense blockbusters, this actually has a plot with twists and at the same time packed with action and thrills.",8,4,11,26 December 2009
Iron Man," Amazing Iron man!
","The movie does live up to my expectation. Iron man is one of the best movie in 2008. It is good to see some rising star such as director Jon Favreau, who directed Elf and Zathura and acted as the sidekick of Matt Murdock in Daredevil, now directs a big marvel movie and I am glad that he manages it well. The acting is good, CGI is good too and there are couples of intense scenes. Not much of a disappointment. Even the few action scenes are managed well so as we would not feel bored or felt that its CGI make up for the few action scenes.The story: Tony stark is rich, a Playboy and a genius. He is having his perfect life until when a group of terrorists captures him and force him to make a powerful weapon they want. Shortly, Tony decides to build an amour to protect him while escaping. He escapes, he decides to upgrade the amour and uses it to protect people. Robert Downey Jr is a good choice to play Tony Stark. While all the others are good too. CGI is amazing, it makes Iron man flexible. It is one of the most intense marvel movie I saw and that is what that makes it good, awesome. There is pretty much humour too even when fighting.Overall: As I says, Iron man is one of the most intense marvel comic movie I ever saw, it is worth watching it in cinema. The CGI and the battle scenes are worth it and it makes up for the few action scenes. The story is intense. It should be the 1st at box office and will. This will leave you craving for more, it feels quite short although it is 2 hours and will want Iron man 2. This will be added to my best movies which includes Transformers. Now CGI is really realistic.",8,9,14,30 April 2008
Casino Royale," The beginning of bond.
","Well, this is James bond you are talking about here, the guy who has the girls and gadgets. Many dream to be the guy which is James bond. I can't say he has no sex appeal. Again another dead-simple plot, the bad guy has to keep money for the terrorists and he somehow lost the money and wanted to bomb the plane but bond stop him and he moved on to his next plan, gamble.......here come James bond trying to pit his luck against him. Well, finally......James bond manage to stop him. But this James bond here is weak, he got hurt from time to time. Anyway, though the plot is simple, the music which i like something about it is great. When you watch it in cinema, you can feel the tense rising with loud booming sound. This one can't be missed. This bond movie is the first James bond movie I like. This movie is a lot fun to watch in the cinema. But you see, indeed everyone has a taste to something.",9,1,3,14 December 2006
Beowulf," Beowulf!
","It is another so-called ancient movies like 300, troy and more. Now it features about Vikings. A guy called Beowulf ( Ray Winstone) goes to a land to slay a powerful dragon, Grendel ( Crispin Glover) and Grendel's mother ( Angelina Jolie) wants revenge on Beowulf. The story is simple and yet engrossing.The director, Robert Zemeckis move on from Polar Express to this animation Beowulf. While watching the trailers, I was confused about what I was seeing. It seemed realistic but after some scenes, I realised it was just animation. Beowulf used the motion of the real actors are captured on computer and is then put in the computer animation to make a photo-realistic movie. It is just amazing. The animation seems better than Polar express.It is co-written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary. It is smart, cool and amazing. It could be all you are asking for. Beowulf and Gredel's mother are partially naked. That is also the drool of people who are watching this movie. Angelina Jolie, partially naked rising out of the water in gold paint. What do people want more. The violence is there too.Overall, it does make a good fantasy action movie. It does have the appeal too. Watching in cinema will increase the intense like fights and it is awesome to watch it in cinema, it is 3-D . Probaby a good movie to watch in November.",5,8,19,14 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Die hard 4.0
","To be honest, I am not a die hard fan when watching this movie. The trailer was cool and I thought I would catch because of its intense action. I have seen Len Wiseman's movies, Underworld and Underworld 2. They are not bad but here he proved that he can handle big action with exploding cars and he did it. He managed to put all the intense action violence into a PG-13 rating. I can say it is rather more intense than violent.The story is action-packed, almost around every ten minutes, action will come, blasting John McClane and his 'pal', Matt. Matt was wanted dead but John comes along and saves him from the exploding computer. Thomas is a hacker and wants to hack all the USA system. And you know what will happen, John going to stop him, meets some near-death incidents and making jokes. Finally, Thomas gets so angry with him and he decided to hold his daughter hostage. It is pretty intense but it has some humour too. Not bad for an action movie's style.Len Wiseman proved he can direct big action so he moved down from Underworld to direct Die hard 4.0. He is amazing. It is more intense than Underworld, it is better than Underworld. Those fans who think that Die hard 4.0 should be rated R, watch this, it is quite intense even for a PG-13 movie. It is great and I am not a Die hard fan. Even people who like hard-core action movie will like this. It is worth the ticket price.",7,3,6,1 July 2007
300," 300
","This makes a good history movie if it was real. The movie is 'alright' movie, you watch it because of its fighting, other than that, nothing seem good as the story is straight forward. You know what Frank miller's comics are like, they have graphic violence and sex, not so much on language. The director even made the deaths so detailed, example like when the head was sliced off, you can see what is inside of it. The style of the violence is slow-motion, until you are tired of them fighting in slow-motion but for the first time, you will stare in awe at how the director made the violence slow, slash. The soldiers are cruel, have no feelings, kill those who get in their way, is spartan soldiers like this? No feelings but filled with justice, they just slash and slash without thinking. Do spartan soldiers always like to die for their country? All senseless violence and madness! If you want good story plot, this one does not fit but if you want to watch bloody violence, slice and slash or like war movies, this movie fit your glory...happen that I like its style of violence, I rate 7 out 10, if not 6 out of 10. This is one typical war movie that has endless wars.",7,1,3,21 April 2007
Fantastic Four," Really fantastic.
","I have read some of the comments posted in IMDb, I realised this film is not that bad, and not that good. But the positive thing I can say is that it is one of the best superhero flick. Featuring five people going up to space and were changed. I almost watched all the superhero movies, and this is one of my best. There is enough super-effect, action and some humour, and 'wow!' at the part when Susan storm stripped until her undergarment. I was not bored at all, fancied their superpower, but the story was straight forward so that in some way, the film seemed a bit slow. Needless to say, I hoped the upcoming Fantastic four 2 will better than this one. Overall, I enjoyed this flick, best to eat with popcorn.",7,0,1,18 December 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Better than the first two but...
","...still not quite good. This is better because it has intense battle scenes and epic music and faster pace but the still has the same lovely-dovely talk which drags. The CGI has definitely improved too. But all the lovely-dovely talk bring down the whole movie. All the talk between Bella and Edward seem like they are going on forever, they seem like they will never end. I could be annoyed too with Bella's decision of who to choose.The story: It takes place after New Moon, which almost put me into sleep, and Bella is still indecisive the love between Jacob and Edward. Blah, blah, cue to the boring talk between them that go on forever. The new-born vampires are going to attack Bella? I was sleepy from the boring talk that I did not really know what the new-born vampires want. Okay, then there are two major action scenes which are short. Even the climax is disappointing. I mean, it is like what the heck do they need to practise for? I am actually surprised at the pace of this though it is faster than New Moon. I have seen David Slade's 30 Days of Night and I have enjoyed its grittiness and suspense. But in this, he chose melodramatic lines that go on forever and drag the plot down. I would say Howard Shore did a good job for composing. The other two movies' music are nothing.Overall: This will be definitely be popular for the females who ogle at Edward or Jacob's six packs. Other than that, I don't know why someone touts it as the movie event of the year! I rather want to see that line on the Inception's poster.",6,5,11,3 July 2010
