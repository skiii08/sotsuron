It," Expectations were high, and stayed high
","This movie was amazing. Now, I have seen some reviews saying that this movie was not scary and sometimes the scary moments came off as funny. As somebody who is terrified of clowns, this movie gave, and still gives me, nightmares. There are some scenes in this movie where pennywise is messing with the kids heads and mocking them, and those were funny. But for me at least, scenes like Patrick's death, Stan getting attacks by the flute lady, etc. got me. This movie also contains a ton of comedy, mostly from Richie and Eddie, and it worked great. The acting is great. Overall would give a 9.5/10 because sometimes the CGI would be great and sometimes it would be bad. If you are scared of clowns this will scare you. If you don't care about them it might not. Would recommend, and I'm very excited for chapter 2!",10,1,2,11 August 2019
