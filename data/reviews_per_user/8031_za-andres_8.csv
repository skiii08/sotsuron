Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Working up until a Point
","'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' portrays somewhat of a make-fun story not only towards Americans, but towards Kazakhstan itself.Borat's first scene in The 'U.S and A' starts with him going down the stairs from JFK airport, but the memorability starts when Borat 'Accidently' drops his luggage in the subway, and you guessed it. Along with all of the clothes that he possesses, come hens from Kazakhstan. 'Careful! They Bite!' says the comedian. Scenes like this are what make 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit of Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', but others just simply don't. In another stupid and typical Borat scene, You find Borat (After his other Kazakhstani friend Azamat strips of him of everything he has) lying on the floor burning his Pamela Anderson picture, and whimpingly crying as if the world was going to end. The crowd started to crack up as if it was the funniest part of the movie, while I was just silently waiting for the scene to end.For some film goers, 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' might have the properties of a cinematic masterpiece that has no diminutive end towards laughter, as much as some may see it as anyway they please.Either way, there is still something that makes 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' stand tall, and that is Sacha Baron Cohen. The film's pace revolves around his performance. He is a master at improvisation, and if it were not him who plays Borat, the film would be a dud.Every time the film achieves a balanced essence, the director ruins it with a daft scene of stupidity. But surprisingly, every time the film is an inch away from darkness, Sacha Baron Cohen pulls it up miraculously. Its the critics highest grade of the year, but that may not signify anything until you see it yourself. In this case, I am not telling you to not not see it. Either way, 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' is here to stay for a very long time.",5,2,4,12 March 2007
Zodiac," 'Zodiac' is of the rarest-and dying-type of Hollywood thriller
","Exhilarating, unshakable, mesmerizing, baffling, and adept beyond belief, David Fincher's Zodiac neither lacks ambition or audacity. Combining all aspects of Fincher's works from his cynical Se7en to his brilliant Fight Club, Zodiac is of the rarest --and dying-- kind of Hollywood thrillers, both simplistically alive and meticulously astute.Shot on state-of-the-art HD by Harris Savides via a process that required absolutely no celluloid or tape, Zodiac gives off somewhat of a rich, smoky feel, often felt as if it were shot with a Mini DV. This also gives a feel of realism towards a film that is not supposed to be interpreted that way at all. Such a toned-down aesthetic (full of fades to black) is matched by David Shire's taut score and the director's conspicuously reserved camera work, which favors both masterful crane-shots and visual close-ups giving the audience it's grab towards emotion.Although Zodiac looks like the average, done-deal, it truly isn't. Mixed with stunning casting (especially Ruffalo, who finally proves himself), a beautiful chronology that never seems to slog the film's pace, and a feeling of overall realism, Zodiac really is a director at the top of his game. The film is in its own world, unique in its own ways, but also glares a sense of naturalism. Zodiac embeddes the beauty of itself in our minds, creating a stark, unforgettable journey that truly must be seen to be believed.",9,7,14,12 March 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," The Magical Touch
","Pans Labyrinth', a remarkable film from the inconsistent director Guillermo Del Toro, is an intertwined tale of adulterated fantasy, a very accurate assessment on nefarious and fascist government, and most of all, a superlative accomplishment in the genre of fantasy. Del Toro has proved more than his hidden facade of indispensable magic; he has created a world to escape to. For the first, and maybe the only time this year, the viewer is in a world of cinema that is unpredictable from the start.A towering work of narrative obscurity, 'Pan's Labyrinth' portrays the life of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a genuine little girl who believes in magic. Her mother, Carmen, is pregnant, and they are on their way to the mothers' husbands' home in 1944. Her husband Captain Vidal) is a hardcore Franquista (Franco supporter, the dictator who ruled Spain from 1939 until 1975 when he died of natural causes) who is merciless at all costs.But in the end, Del Toro does not distinguish a good from a bad ending, and quite frankly it hardly even matters. What the viewer perceives is more than just a remarkable story. It's an illustrious work of magic made for a must-viewing. And in the end, after Ofelia's last task is accomplished, and the masterful musical score lay in the background, one can't help but think: Could the film be meant for something else? Of course it is, for it is a clear and thought out political allegory. But even by viewing the film at diverse standpoints, in the end it really comes down to the real truth: the film is nothing short of a true and simple work of art.",9,3,6,12 March 2007
The Lives of Others," Guilty Parties
","It's weird that first films from a first director get my full support, but The Lives of Others is really something special, both beautifully portrayed and written. It's also clear, of course, that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has skill; even though it's only his first film, some of the content of the film is so remarkable that it immediately brings up previous works from veteran directors.Critics have already been diminishing the film, claiming that it is flat as a character study. The truth is, they're right (If Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck would have concentrated more on character study, critics would have been hailing it as a masterpiece). But if one opts to take out the character study abroad, a clear and remarkable thriller will remain. The Lives of Others is truly something special and rare, disturbingly accurate and really quite extraordinary. The film is likely to win the Academy Award for best foreign film, and in a way it deserves it, also like Pan's Labyrinth. In the end, The Lives of Others proves to the viewer not only keen film-making skill, but rather the ability of mankind to change upon its surroundings. It's rare that a beginning film reach out to me the way this one did, but The Lives of Others is a most exciting film.",9,2,3,12 March 2007
Children of Men," A rare futuristic thriller: grim in its scenario, yet exhilarating in its technique.
","There are many things that happen in our future: for those technological buffs out there, there will be large hi-def T.V screens and sophisticated wireless devices. But on the not so shinny side, and for those present day future predictors, women will become infertile, and eventually we will all vanish from Earth. It's difficult to establish such a premise in 114 minutes, and Cuarón happens to know this. So what he creates is more of a preview of it. Despite its astute sympathy for what-if film lovers, 'Children of Men' does work, and rather effectively.It's 2027, women are infertile, death comes everyday, migrants are a complex deal, rebellions arise all over the world, and there is a suicide drug named 'Quietus.' Motto: 'You decide when.' Shelled by the excellent Clive Owen as Theo, a lazy and mundane man who has lost his son to, yes, a flu pandemic in 2008. His first portrayal is a scene in which he is walking into a coffee shop, -the youngest person in the world, age 18, has just died- buying a usual cup of coffee, and putting a sip of rum in it. An instant later, an explosion. It nearly kills him. Cuarón lays clues and evidence all over the film, especially through vivid examples of people, mostly illegal immigrants, being locked up on the street, and random, but important advertisements. Theo really doesn't care much about the world, that is, until his ex-wife (Moore with no English accent), the leader of pro-immigrant rebels, presses him into retrieving a pair of illegal travel passes in the hopes of reaching a group of much-rumored, never-confirmed off-shore scientists called The Human Project. Their motives, tied to the well-being of a young immigrant (Claire-Hope Ashitey), will soon become clear, but only after the cost of failure has been made equally clear. Kee, played by Ashitey, is visibly pregnant, and after a serious of insolent truths about the rebels themselves, Theo is now bound to help Kee. They set off, and eventually reach their destination, which marks the end of the film.Cuarón's graceful camera, the movement of characters across the frame, and the magnificent acting collectively evoke a genial sense of place. But while the film's exo-skeleton is a memorable and vivid one, the film does have its minor narrative flaws. But what ultimately saves the film from darkness (just imagine if it were Ridley Scott) is Cuarón himself. Without overemphasis, Cuarón beautifully bends gritty realistic scenes and predictable ones to his own canon; he changes the rules of the game, and he is very well aware that only he can do such a thing in a film with a what-if standpoint. He includes mettlesome action scenes (all which are masterfully detailed) with exuberant dialogue, and we truly realize what an brilliant director he is. While 'Children of Men' is not his best film, his diversified directing is fluently proved in this piece work. His previous works, including the terrific 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', have all spanned from drama to fantasy, and all over again with this rare and futuristic film.There is a striking scene late in the film, after a serious of some major 'bam bams' and deaths, where Theo tries to find the newly-born infant that Kee had unwillingly exerted out of her young abdomen the night before. Everything but the young baby's cries fill the screen. He soon finds her, and he brings Kee along with the baby out of the decrepit building which they were using as shelter. Soldiers cease fire. People hold out there arms and cry. They all forget why they are fighting, and if there is any cause for it in the first place. It is evident that Cuarón has a gift only the greatest filmmakers share: he makes you believe.",9,2,3,14 March 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Trashy Book, Trashy Film
","Dan Brown's novel, The Da Vinci Code, was a blast to read. And I remember to this day that a major motion picture was written all over it. Unfortunately, the film isn't as good as many expected it to be. With a terrible script, bad acting, and wrong interpretation of the book, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a dreary and cheap piece of entertainment. Ron Howard's interpretation of the book is terrible. And like all book adapted scripts, the dialouge is a mess. To their credit the director and his screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman (who collaborated with Mr. Howard on 'Cinderella Man' and 'A Beautiful Mind'), have streamlined Mr. Brown's story and refrained from trying to capture his, um, prose style. 'Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.' Such language  note the exquisite 'almost' and the fastidious tucking of the 'which' after the preposition  can live only on the page.For those who read the book, I will keep it short by saying that it has some mistaken parts to it, and perhaps is not at all what the readers want to see. Tom Hanks is useless as Robert Langdon, a cryptologist who discovers a deadly secret, and is being framed for murder. Tom Hanks is a slick haired Smarty that acts very bad in this one. Why? Oh, well it seems that Mr. Hanks tone is dry and apparently has no expression on his face. Compare this this to 'Forest Gump'. Perhaps the highlight of 'The Da Vinci Code' is the acting of Ian McKellen, who is Leigh Teabing, a complete backstabber with a moronic attitude. Again, a better film is needed.And so, The anticipated 'Da Vinci Code' came crashing down like I didn't expect it to. And you have to ask yourself: Why do they make the movies in the trailers so good?",2,1,4,12 March 2007
The Departed," Dreay, Dreaful, Deathy, Ratty
","Martin Scorcese is back with his new film, 'The Departed, which brings cinematic dysfunction on to the big screen. 'The Departed' was one of my most anticipated films of the year. Well, I highly regret that now.This film begins with the a self-reflexive narrative provided by a Wonderful actor, (who essentially saves the film from complete darkness) Jack Nicholson. He explains, 'When you Have a gun pointed in your face, it does not matter if your a cop, or a mobster.' Later the film incorporates Matt Damon, who plays the usual role with that smirky face of his. He plays an investigator who secretly works for Frank, but at the same time is a mole in the special police unit force, or something like that.On the other side, is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the opposite. He is an undercover cop who works for Frank. Such a wonderful role he plays. Honestly, in previous films, DiCaprio has managed only to distinguish himself as one bad actor. In 'The Departed', part of the 4 good points it got was DiCaprio. He has finally found himself a role. Very good DiCaprio! The other points go to Mr. Nicholson. He is flawless. Completely flawless. DiCaprio and him tandem, to make 'The Departed'. If 'The Departed' Were to prove anything, it would be that Nicholson has not lost his touch. And that is magic.So what's so bad about 'The Departed'? let's say it is only a failed attempt to bring Goodfellas back tom the big screen. The viewers can probably imagine seeing Mr. Scorsese sitting there, thinking of a way to bring back the Goodfellas 'Pop' into our junky Modern Cinema. Mr. Scorcese has failed his old but magical touch in bringing back Gangster classics (this is one is even copied! from Internal Affairs). Oh boy, I can't until next year.",3,2,4,12 March 2007
Casino Royale," The New Bond? Good? Bad? Damn Good
","A few days back I had two wishes. The first one was to see the stunning 'Casino Royale' on the big screen. The second was that if I were to see it, I wouldn't be disappointed. My first wish came true rather fast, after some discussion with family members about the film itself. The second wish came the minute the new Bond movie, 'Casino Royale' began on the magnificent big screen.From the first scene to the last scene of the film, 'Casino Royale' will have you sitting like no movie this year. I didn't even stretch. I didn't even look at my watch. My eyes remained focused on the big screen. The first scene of the film resembles a film noir miniature gimmick. The scene demonstrates how Bond got his position in a slick style; excellent dialogue, and excellent pacing. I must admit, if there were to be one complaint about 'Casino Royale', it's the title. The title contains unsuitable rock music (there should be the masterful theme). It has a good idea, just not a very well executed one. Other than that, the film is a blast.Daniel Craig is Bond. The blue-eyed, blond haired actor succeeds beyond my limits, beyond everyone's. He is agile, slick, and ultimately great. He creates Bond. He is perfect for it.In one or two short sentences, 'Casino Royale' can be best summarized by saying the following: Bond is invited to the casino royale to stop Le Chiffre. (who kills a lot of people, obviously) He gains a lot of money, and then ending contains an inscrutable twist to it. I don't want to go into detail, because then I wont stop writing.In every sense, 'Casino Royale' satisfies us all. It's dazzling, it really is. It's the new definition of a Bond movie.",9,0,3,12 March 2007
