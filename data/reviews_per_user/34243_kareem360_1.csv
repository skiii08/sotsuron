Saturday Night Fever," Disco hits the big screen
","This film was great. It scores with fun and excitement, and paints a perfect picture a young teens life in Brooklyn New York, revolving around the Disco scene. For those who remember what it was like, being young and indecisive about where they wanted to go, and how to deal with being in love once the fun stops in the 70's, this film will touch your heart in a musical way.",Null,0,0,13 June 2003
