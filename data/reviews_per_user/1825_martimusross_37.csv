Ford v Ferrari," Really Great Action Movie
","Le Mans '66I saw this at the Cineworld secret screening and my heart sank having already condemned it from the trailer. I loath movies about racing cars and I hate Christian Bale with a vengeance. Well despite these 'minor' prejudices this was a really great movie.Centering on a biopic of Ken Miles life as a racing car driving, played by Bale, and his friend Carroll Shelby, played by Damon. These two central roles were delivered with passion and some very fine acting. I could be wrong but Christian Bale's diction was so much better in his native english rather than the mumbling guttural we are usually straining to unjumble.The elongated driving sequences were exhausting and to long for me but I could see others around me lapping this up. The entire ensemble were brilliant and really created the atmosphere of the racetrack and the maverick sportsmen of the 60's.With regard to awards my mind tells me that there are merely supporting actor nominations here because neither of the leads here displayed any comprehensive array of emotions and that discounts them. Ditto for best movie.",8,14,41,5 November 2019
First Man," A Worthy Documentary not a Movie
","This movie was worthy in the extreme and functioned well as a near perfect documentary of the years leading up to the moon landing and the moment of history making. As a dramatic movie is was, in my opinion, lacking on several fronts. Famously reclusive or perhaps in reality mundane there was little presented of Armstrong's inner thoughts or his personal life. Ryan Gosling had little to work with and maintained a minimalist style that was practically a blank portrayal. Clare Foy was totally under-utilised and just irritated the viewer every time she appeared on the screen. I accept that rocket science and space exploration are serious subjects but this movie was unrelenting and ultimately it became a documentary piece and needs to be judged as such.",5,1,3,16 October 2018
Rocketman," Well Worth A Watch
","RocketmanI really liked this movie, on the whole the dramatic impetus was supplied by Elton's chronology mirrored in the songs that were written at roughly the same time. It was quirky, inventive and showed an aspect of Elton, the national treasure.What was good,1, the music was fabulous and Taron Edgerton did a fine job, he really tried to reproduce both Elton's style and range.2, the ensemble playing was strong throughout and they seemed to gel well. I really liked the boss of the record company.3, the staged set pieces were brilliantly realised.What was not so good:1, it was never really explained why Elton's father rejected him, it inferred he was scarred by the war and left incapable of demonstrative behaviour or any depth of affection. And yet later in the movie he is a changed man, was he just a homophobe?2, there were several weak spots, I will detail two, when the song Saturday Night.. came on it seemed just shoe-horned into the movie, as happened in Mama Mia, it was just too contrived. The second was the gathering of family in the therapy group, if this was an epiphany moment it fell way short.3, the need to have flashbacks from a rehab group was just an unnecessary device and just did not work because he did not interact with the group in any real way.This was a great movie, certainly one for the fans, it won't win an Oscar but it was a jolly good night out.",6,2,7,22 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Unconvincing As A Love Story
","The very heart of this movie is the love story between the rising star Lady Gaga and the jaded drug ridden alcoholic that is Bradley Cooper's falling star. On many levels the chemistry just wasn't there, Bradley's convincing method style was fully realised as a train wreck of a man but lacked any real character development, Lady Gaga's acting was very on the surface and at some points you could practically see her counting her emotional responses on line and on cue.The emotional responses seemed to be confined between pathetic and hysterical that jarred with Bradley's more nuanced emotional palette. Clearly Gaga devotees will see no fault. The pacing of the movie was laborious at times with any tension evaporating entirely. Two aspects of the movie were worthy of note, firstly the realistic concerts and the documentary nature of the camera work, and lastly, on the whole, the music, it was great fun but not memorable as it was set within an unconvincing movie.",4,475,811,10 October 2018
Fury," A Total Disaster Avoid This Vile Movie
","FuryThis really really was a dogs breakfast of a movie, It was so bad it defies analysis, to present the central role as some kind of twisted father figure protecting his flock was beyond absurd.Just about everything was gratuitous and it failed to educate, entertain or inform.",3,1,3,21 August 2019
Captain Marvel," Just About OK!
","Whilst I was watching this movie I was vaguely entertained but now having left the auditorium some things were far from satisfactory.I will detail my concerns in order;1.Brie Larson, quoting Dorothy Parker 'she runs the gamut of emotions from A to B', there was absolutely no range in her acting. When your main character in a superhero movie just doesn't cut it and the whole movie rests upon this character your in big trouble.2.This is an origin story and yet most of the questions surrounding her origins remain unanswered. We have no clue as to why she is so powerful, what are her specific powers apart from energy manipulation of all sorts, she is a kind of superhero 'one-trick-pony'(that was clever).3.Captain Marvel is apparently so powerful and has no weaknesses, unlike Superman and Kryptonite, or overcome by superior strengths as with Dr Strange, Spiderman, and the Hulk. To have no weaknesses whatsoever ruins the movie, as there is no point where you feel she is in any danger of losing against her enemies or indeed any danger at all. The only apparent weakness she seems to have was a whole array of cognitive problems, poor memory, brainwashing, poor judgement and trust issues (I have those before my first coffee).4.Brie Larson just does not look the part, a Bond girl must look like a Bond girl and a superhero woman must look like a superhero woman (unless she is, of course an anti-hero). Without be overly judgemental or hung up on stereotypical images at best she looked ordinary when she needed to look extraordinary (Shock horror I made that point!). She will not be going up on any pre-pubescent teenage bedroom walls methinks (and again!)5.I won't dwell on other problematic areas like, a clumsy plot, slow pace, embarrassingly cheesy jokes, no character development or poor music or indeed the strange over-long, un-productive, uninteresting and boring conversations they have with each other (I've dozed off!).6.The movie is so over-contrived to make her a worthy opponent for Thanos that we just felt the whole movie was in a waiting room, a precursor to the main event.The one thing that was totally memorable and sticks in my mind, and is worthy of a major mention and displayed both a remarkable acting ability and a whole variety of different powers and abilities was the ginger cat. Could we not put the cat against Thanos in the next movie, I am sure he would win, I can clearly see the scene where Thanos, the planet killer, is defeated by a regurgitated fur-ball to the head (what an image).",5,1,3,9 March 2019
Knives Out," Agatha Christie Old Style Who-Done-It
","Knives OutI really enjoyed this movie.This was a very old style who-done-it in very much the style of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, we had a many stranded labyrinthine plot unravelled slowly by our hero detective followed by a denouement.This was very much a talking movie with little action of any kind so if you are looking for a car chase resolution this is not the movie for you.Daniel Craig did a fine job as Benoit Blanc, the drawling accent did not slip once and he dominated every scene, the whole cast did a good job occupying their respective stereotypes.It must have been good as try as I might I couldn't predict the ending.",7,7,22,25 November 2019
The Irishman," Great Film But Ridiculously Long With Much Repetition
","The IrishmanFrom the get go we had a musical reminder from the God-Father, I just knew where this movie was going lol.What was goodWe had of course some of the best method actors on the planet, as with Brando this is exhausting viewing, but I loved it.How to decide who was more prominent of the three main leads to get an award is the major problem.This was really a simple linear story with flashbacks, most helpful when the canvas of the movie was so large.The styling and cinematography was comprehensive we really felt we were in the various time periods.The intimate way the camera moved was great and entirely appropriate for movie.What was problematicThe pace was virtually real time, slow to stop, drama is a compression of reality over conflict, this really did drag in places.Repetition of many of the scenes and set pieces, I was sometimes thinking not again and yet again!This needed to be cut down by at least an hour, the movie didn't gain anything by being baggy or lugubrious.It became very much a 'boys' movie, this was a directorial decision.We had no redemption at all and because of this it ended up more of a documentary or blueprint on being a gangster.Note to NetflixWe have had a series of movies that Netflix believes breaks new ground, from a movie without a script and actors that was Roma, from the kitchen sink that was Marriage Story and now a three and a half hour marathon. My advice find a 'Hitchcock' or a 'Lean' to create film history, thus far everything is forgettable.",8,3,7,18 January 2020
Aquaman," Great, Really Great
","This movie threw us in at the deep end and we swam with the fishes. It was a great ride that kept our attention from start to finish.It was long, it was a monumental saga it was CGI gone mad, but this was a really great movie and delivered exactly what was on the tin.Jason Momoa gets special mention, he gave a solid endearing performance that trod the line of humour, self-deprecation and super-heroI loved it",10,5,13,19 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Thor Movie So Far
","It was totally brilliant from start to finish. There was lots of tongue in cheek jokes and great action sequences, there was a total buzz in the movie house.",10,2,10,12 August 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Strong Story With Some Issue Politics
","I enjoyed the movie, not sure what it was about, but it was good entertainment. Everyone was a hater and every 'ism' and 'ist' was present.Everyone was so equally incompetent the inherent comedy and juxtaposition of apple pie and explosives was great fun. Fundamentally it was an american story that had no transferability.I loved the fro's, the fashion, the cars, the cinematography, the lighting and the tight script, throughout it was fine acting.If there was a theme over and above the story on screen, it was perhaps the dangers that come with any blind sort of identity politics. If there was meant to be some parallels with the now I couldn't see any, subtlety is lost on me.The strange footage at the beginning and end of the movie was a strange interjection that had little to do with the movie and was just an unnecessary distraction",6,13,25,9 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Ending The Franchise With A Fizzle Not A Bang!
","Star Wars - The Rise Of SkywalkerI mustn't be too harsh in reviewing this!Having watched this I realise the movie was all about tying up loose ends, honouring what went before and being careful not to create any new storylines that would set hares running. Within these strict parameters the movie answered the needs of fans and perhaps on a second or even a third viewing will prove quite satisfactory.What was problematicThe medieval belief that an individual is doomed to moral corruption due to a genetic preponderance is to modern minds absurd, and really very flimsy motivation.The movie lacked humour, this is really an essential component of the franchise.The 'romantic' pursuance of Rey by Kylo Ren was creepy, touching on coercive grooming, this really did not work. In addition when he had achieved his goal it was a contrivance in the script to arrange his demise to make way for her real love interest.The acting was wooden and the script stilted in places, the original franchise was sexy in many ways this was just bland and beige and getting more insipid by the minute.Just too much referencing backwards we had every famous scene ticked except one, this would be our heroes getting out of a refuse disposal on an empire ship...lolWe needed lots more 'magic' more use of the force, just about more of everything.This franchise did not end on a bang but alas merely a fizzle.",5,6,11,6 January 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," So Wonderful, Just Amazing
","A truly great movie on every level. Rami Malek deserves an Oscar for his sensitive performance of this troubled artist that was Freddie Mercury. He captures the fun and the humour of the man and the loyalty of his friends and family in intimate micro gestures that show a meticulous attention to his craft and a near super attention to detail. Rami was Freddie at no point did you question his interpretation, it was mesmerising in its intensity.The whole cast was brilliant and captured the time so well. Freddie died 27 years ago and yet this movie excluded no one in the auditorium.The songs were played in full and the experimental and alternative nature of Queen was shown in all its glory.The direction was masterful, the editing crisp and special mention must go to the settings and stylings of several scenes in clubs and studios, we were in the 80's.Without doubt this is one of the best movies of the year thus far and a must see.",10,4,7,27 October 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Unbelievably Good That Stands The Test Of Time
",The Lord Of The Rings TrilogyPerhaps the best adaptation of a gargantuan novel ever made thus far.Words defy analysis but in short all the forces are martialled by Peter Jackson in service of the story that is enabled with a breadth and scope never before achieved before this.,10,3,3,5 March 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Gripping, But Preachy About Identity Politics
","I so want to agree with everyone that this movie was amazing and fantastic and perhaps the best thing since the invention of sliced bread, but when you look closely there are significant problems.Let's start with what was good;1, the comprehensive construction of Miles as a personality, from his dialogue to his jokes from his singing to his clumsiness, this was realised in micro-gestures and facial expressions as was Miles' father and uncle, a brilliant piece of animation.2, the movie created a comprehensive atmosphere and style and was planned and executed to an inch of its life.3, you were gripped from the start, whilst watching the movie there was a great dramatic impetus, you were desperate for a conclusion.4, the music, graphics and minute detail was all brilliantly realised.What was not good;1, if you take out the character development, that must be secondary to the story, we have boy infected by spider, trying to stop the Kingpin from using a machine to bring back his dead family, this is hardly a substantial story.2, if, and I believe it is the case, that the story above was incidental and that the 'real' story was 'everyone can wear the mask' this is using or abusing the vehicle of Spider-Man to advance forward a political agenda.3, if we had a parallel dimension then Spider-Man would be the same in each dimension, just as New York was the same in each dimension, if we had a alternative dimension then nothing would be the same so there would perhaps not be a Spider-Man, this was jumbled thinking at its best, which is it?4, we had blatant gender and racial appropriation and a whole array of divisive stereotyping that was used to underpin a political agenda, it was perhaps even gross tokenism, let's say no more.It cannot be right to use a movie to promote ideologies of globalisation, political correctness and identity politics and embed this within the core of a movie and this needs to be called out for what it is, this is indoctrination and liberal authoritarianism bordering on brainwashing.I did enjoy the movie whilst I was watching it but afterwards I felt I had been cheated, preached at and manipulated to a political world view, that is the latest Hollywood fashion trend, that places identity above everything and we are all citizens of nowhere.",5,7,15,4 April 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," A Really Brilliant Movie, A Must See!
","The Amazing Spider-ManYes of course it goes without saying the Tobey Maguire first three movies were brilliant but this movie is on a whole new level.In many ways this genre has come of age in this movie, it just had everything, we had the perfect balance between action and story, comedy and tragedy, light and more serious issues. Overall it was a dark, sinister and menacing movie.Andrew Garfield is just a fantastic actor and perhaps my personal favourite as Spider-Man. His geeky look works here but he will struggle to find roles in the future as he is not ideal as a romantic or action figure, a similar position to Ben Wishaw.I can't find any fault in this fantastic movie",10,3,4,18 June 2019
Yesterday," The Movie Was OK, The Music Was Brilliant
","YesterdaySo much of this movie was charming, brilliantly acted, and inventive, however somewhere around the middle of the movie, (the missing the train scene) it just turned into a big farce. The plot just became unbelievable, it also turned corny and over-sentimental. Of course I accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero.What was good:1, I loved the music, I think this made the movie.2, Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, did a fine job, he has mastered irony and deadpan, we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream.What was challenging;1, the plot was either so corny or so contrived, some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing.2, Elle, played by Lily James, lost our sympathy, she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving 'their' dream, she tries to make him choose between his dream and her.3, The conclusion was unsatisfactory, he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it, he ended up a teacher, big mistake.Overall, the was an overly contrived feel good movie, I enjoyed whilst I was watching it, but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end.",6,139,194,20 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Definitely One For The Fans
","EndgameThis is most definitely one for the fans, quite impossible to understand the main plot or the nuanced references unless you had watched the previous 22 movies.Well I have and I thought overall it was brilliant, I watched it in the 3D 4 DX version and though the rain and lightening good fun was had by all. The three hours flew by to the redemptive conclusion.I will list the really good aspects and the not so good1, we had lots of humour, well placed and well timed it was genuinely funny.2, the action sequences were great and were not overly long, just about right I would say.3, the plot, whilst fantastical, held together, great!4, Captain Marvel was not invincible, and looked more like the superhero she is, so this worked.5, fine bromance elements.6, Hulk's transformation was a master-strokeNow the not so good1, the beginning had slow dialogue that just was not meaningful, baggy is the word!2, why they felt the need to have absolutely every Marvel character including the minors turned into an obsession, this proved to be overwhelmingly.3, the music was unmemorable, pity!4, we needed Thor restored earlier as an Apollonian god.5, the sexy element of Marvel superheroes was dumbed out, there was no one to dream about.I loved this movie and for Marvel fans this delivers the goods and they will find no fault.",8,0,4,27 April 2019
Batman Begins," A Really Great Movie
","This movie was stuffed with stars who gave their all to the project. There was a really dark and sinister atmosphere tempered by the warmth of Alfred, played by Michael Caine.

The Favourite," Miserable & Tedious, Style Over Substance
","It is self evident a great deal of attention and planning went into this movie, ultimately my review is based on how the movie moved me and how the execution of the script was realised on the screen.My conclusion is this was ultimately style over substance, it pretended to greatness but fell short on so many levels. I will detail the main failings in order;-the use of a wide lens became wearing on the eye and the constant looking up at the characters without variation became tedious
-Anne as an Oscar vehicle had insufficient lines or facets of personality to show depth and character development.
-the movie was unrelentingly miserable and cruel, I am not clear why.
-they were all self-serving but seemingly without sufficient motivation for their actions.
-there was no character definition, any of the lines could have come out of anyone's mouth.
-there was just insufficient story to sustain a movie and what there was remained unresolved.
-the lesbian relationships were degraded to merely jostling for power, this was shallow and petty.
-the ending was abrupt and merely suggested Abigail was revealed for the schemer she was to Anne.
-the music jarred and was repetitive in some sectionsI would add there was a steady steam of people walking out of the auditorium who thought is was certainly not their favourite.How can this even be nominated for an Oscar when compared to The Shape of Water or Three Billboards, last years offerings.",3,2,9,29 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One For The Male Fans of Tarantino
","Once Upon A Time In HollywoodAs a Tarantino fan a new movie is a treat and this did not disappoint. My gut feel tell me the subject matter lends itself to a more male audience and definitely one for fans of this director, if you are not either of these it may not be for you.A large and rambling story developed that aimed to establish the three clear elements of any Tarantino movie;1, nothing happens without a reason in the movie.
2, incredible characterisation of the central roles
3, vast character development within the movie.The acting was brilliant throughout in true method style but only one role had sufficient range on display to even think of nominating for an Oscar and that was Leonardo DiCaprio.The movie itself was flawed as an entity as it is incomplete without a sequel. We had at the end no established motive and no reason, as yet, why this group of actors was singled out for 'retribution'. We also had no conclusion to any character or any redemptive feature. For this reason alone it really cannot be considered for best movie.I would suggest the comprehensive capturing of the atmosphere of that time was a brilliant display of direction and cinematography so their maybe another award here.",7,0,4,21 August 2019
Aladdin," Brilliant and Charming A Must See
","AladdinAfter Disney made a hash of Mary Poppins, Dumbo and The Last Jedi they have come good here.The choice of Guy Ritchie as director was their golden ticket. His tongue-in-cheek style and light touch humour was exactly what was required. I may even suggest this surpassed the animated version upon which it was based.Everything was in place, brilliant casting, brilliant CGI, brilliant music, the monkey the carpet wow. I really cannot find fault anyway in this great movie, except for a strange and inappropriate insertion of some liberal values.If I was giving out Oscar nominations, one for the director Guy Ritchie and one for Will Smith, best Male supporting actor, for his high camp genie. Not that I'm an expert but the editing was brilliant to.The whole cast was good but displayed a limited range of acting skills solid but nothing special.Overall a 9/10 for this charming family movie.I will however call out the political indoctrination to liberal authoritarianism that has been inserted at places in this movie, this is a result of Hollywood's latest fashion trends of 'Me Too' and 'Times Up' movements, these were not present in the 1992 animated version and why have they been inserted here. This is ugly to see in a children's movie where minds may be suceptable to this liberal world view, this aspect is shameful for Disney and needs to be called out for what it is. The song Speechless was just misplaced and cutting out Jafar's banishment song was a mistake. The movie was so much heavier that the original and just not as much fun, Disney must really stop trying to be all things to all men and stick with the story telling.",8,0,5,29 May 2019
The Lion King," Not A Patch On The Original
","The Lion KingThis remake of Lion King had some good things in it but it just did not surpass the cartoon version. The main problem was in a cartoon we can accept singing and dancing animals, however in a real setting this just doesn't work, it's weird and freaky. Stop motion capture is a very different medium and needs a different approach, any idiot could deduce this and yet they went ahead with this project.What was good;1, the animation was faultless as was the 3D, the detail and naturalness of the movements was just perfection.2, some of the voices were perfectly cast, Simba, Scar and Mufasa spring to mind.What was problematic;1, the music was at time just too epic in a kind of revrential or even religious way.2, the key song 'can you feel the love tonight', the movies apotheosis was just mangled, what were they thinking, not a patch on the Elton John version.3, adult Nala was wrong on every level, all the vocal inflections were exaggerated and she was so critical, judgemental and downbeat this grated.4, Pumbaa, played by Seth Rogan was meant to be funny but most jokes were delivered sardonically, he was miscast in this role.5, the script had been manipulated to be more PC and appeal to wholesome liberal snowflakes and their children. The Lion King has its roots in the duplicity of Shakespeare's Hamlet don't sanitise perfection.",6,0,2,21 July 2019
Call Me by Your Name," A Breathless And Sumptuous Movie
","Call Me By Your NameOn the face of it this movie appeared just to be a coming a age story over a breathless summer in Italy in 1983. However it was about so so much more and it is a movie that requires several viewings to draw out the multiple and profound themes that lay just below the surface.The movie looks atThe nature of sexuality linked to age and the tragedy of a sexual prime slipping away. The father says 'there will come a time when no one looks at you, let alone comes near', and yet he appears 'happily' married to Elio's mother. His message is to seize the moment to avoid regret.That any sexuality cannot be ultimately 'forced' or suppressed despite the strictures of any society, and that we should just be ourselves.The careful way the age gap between Elio (17) and Oliver (24) was handled, they are both equal in their needs and desires at that moment in time, planets colliding.Elio adolescent liaison with Marzia demonstrated his strength of desire for Oliver far outweighed his attachment to her. This was nothing personal, never stated, but entirely understood by her when they agreed to be lifelong friends.The metaphor for Oliver was 'later', but in fact the reality was 'now'.The movie went on to introduce a breathless heat and sumptuous cinematography with a ravishing score.Timothee Chalamet brought a animalistic, instinctive and nuanced portrayal of teenage infatuation. Without being to effusive he demonstrates the art of invisible acting effortlessly, this man is the entire package. I only hope he is given the quality work that respects his talent.Armie Hammer was solid and he really gave a great performance and perhaps well outside his comfort range as a non-European lol!I really loved this movie, it is just a joy to watch 10/10",10,4,8,18 December 2019
1917," A Simple Idea Executed Brilliantly
","1917Great MovieIt was refreshing that for once we had a director totally in control of his personal vision, from the script through the production to the directing and editing.A deeply memorable movie for all the right reasonsWhat was goodDespite the over-arching matter of futile warmongering amid the squalor of the trenches the Director chose to put front and centre different themes to explore, mate-ship, grief is a luxury, human resilience, etc.The tone and atmosphere was comprehensive, as with Hacksaw Ridge, we were there in the trenches our viewpoint was that of another soldier and we were forced to confront the horror.The use of humour as a pressure valve, the audience laughed at some macabre incidents, this was very cleverly used.The focus on the bonds that join men together in avarice, no conclusion was given, quite rightly, but it was palpable in its presence.The incredible use of all the cinematic forces as a vehicle to forward the story, we were all engaged, this aspect was greater than the sum of its parts.The score was really quite brilliant, the singing set piece was inspired.The incredible focus of creating believable characters perhaps the triumph of of this movie, when Corporal Blake died we felt grief.What was not so goodThe pacing was slow bordering on stop, however this was entirely intentional.The variety of the images, yes we had some diversion, the farm, the night scene, the cellar, the cherry orchard, the river, perhaps more arial shots or indeed the dog-fight.Lack of redemptive conclusions, Schofield arrived at his personal epiphany but this was not rammed home.With regard to awards, this year was overall a bad year for movies. This is perhaps best of the bunch with Ford v Ferrari a close second.",9,0,2,15 January 2020
Big Hero 6," This Film Defies Description In It's Perfection
","Big Hero 6When you have an art product that exceeds the sum of its parts you have something remarkable indeed.High art is that rare moment when you have a combination of art, music, theatre, literature and painting or any such combination that come together to form a new work of art, where all of the technical constraints disappear and you are left with something that often defies description.This cartoon is a combination of brilliant story, brilliantly realised with incredible special effects and an incredible musical score.People talk about Into The Spiderverse but that was preachy, simplistic, with a quite ridiculous story. Just nothing in comparison to the splendour of this movie.This was perfection personified.",10,1,1,3 November 2019
Midsommar," Really Great Horror Movie
","MidsommarThis was a really great horror movie, I can't say I enjoyed it as it was all so deeply disturbing it was more the case I experienced the horrific reality as the story unfolded.About midway through the movie it became clear that they had been specifically recruited by Pelle because they were anthropological students who would be drawn to 'alternative societies'. Once this pivotal fact was known you knew they were never leaving.The movie was deeply memorable for the direction, the styling, the use of the camera and there were set pieces of drama that were so viscerally disturbing I couldn't watch again.Apart from Pet Sematary this was the best horror movie of the year without doubt.If you are an experienced horror movie watcher then this one is for you, if not it will give you nightmares.",9,2,5,18 December 2019

Joker," Tired, Tedious & Tragic Turkey - Give It A Miss!
","JokerWords completely fail me, I just had to sit through two hours of watching an alcoholic in Judy and now I am made to sit for two hours watching a lunatic in Joker. In both I was neither educated, entertained or informed. Both movies were utter cobblers and should be cast into the void where they will find the ultimate turkey that is Carry-On Columbus.This purported to be an origin story of master villain extraordinaire, Joker. We got zilch on how he became a master criminal, he had no henchmen, we had no bank robbery, we had no car chase, we had no joker, and on top of that his arch nemesis Batman was a small boy when they were contemporaries. This was incoherent nonsense.Joaquin Phoenix's performance had so many problems,1, he dominated the movie by being in every scene, true, but the story was so unfocused it became an interpretation of a man struggling with a mental health condition. The main problem was the Joker was not an interesting character, he was bland, predictable and revolting.2, his characterisation rested upon physicality, he lost weight, he was half naked, he contorted his body, with the inference twisted body twisted mind, does Hollywood really think an audience can be duped by such an obvious trick, this was no Raging Bull or Dallas Buyers Club. I wanted to pass the hat around the cinema to raise funds to buy him a shirt and then make him wear it.3, We had raw method style from Joaquin that was largely improvised to fill the void. There must always be a reason behind behaviour otherwise it is meaningless and so it was here.4, The Joker, unsurprisingly, it's in the name, was funny, if he was sad, it was pathos, this was unremittingly morose. Jack Nicholson's performance captured this but it was absent here.This was a miserable, instantly forgettable movie that lacked any focus or story. Around me there was a constant stream of people walking out who felt they had been sold a pig-in-a-poke, and went to watch Aladdin instead, as did I.",3,32,93,5 October 2019
Whiplash," Portrait Of A Sadist As An Old Man
","This movie was built upon the myth of an abusive encounter that led to the creation of a supreme musician, an extension of the idea all artists need to suffered for their art.The movie then treats up to a series of disturbing scenes to underpin this idea in the hands of a frustrated university professor trying to find his genius. This pathological psychopath is nothing more than a sadist and bully who gets off on torturing and humiliating young vulnerable men.The movie is less than convincing as musicians are usually so driven they need to be told to practice less and be persuaded that perfection is unobtainable. Not to mention that musical progression occurs naturally in a supportive and collaborative environment.Whilst there were convincing performances the movie was an ugly mishmash of conflicting vestigial thoughts.The music was good as was the editing but the direction of this soulless material let to little character separation.Only near the end did the story try to justify the movies focus on brutality by trying to catch and fire this vile professor from his job at the university.Overall this movie left a nasty taste in the mouth with little or no resolution or redemption",5,1,2,5 November 2018

","IT 2At 169 minutes it was just too long, after careful consideration as to where to cut this I arrived at the formed viewpoint I could cut out the whole 169 minutes and stay at home instead as this really was a rambling dogs breakfast of a movie.What was wrong, almost everything, this is deeply disappointing after IT 1 which was a great coming of age movie with horror thrown in.1, where was the story, Pennywise back, group return and try to destroy him, that's it.2, the significance of memory, I can't remember what I had for dinner yesterday let alone 27 years ago, hardly a revelation then they have forgotten stuff.3, collecting tokens, this just created a series of cameos, at best a contrivance at worst episodic nonsense.4, no character development at all, the director was obsessed that we were able to recognise which adult the child had grown into, perhaps colour coding or a label would have worked better.5, no internal motivation for Pennywise, why come back, why be evil, why kill, why this group of children, why Derry etc etc6, the actors whilst proficient did not gel, I guess this was the tripe of a script and the nonsensical direction against the CGI backdrop.What was goodNOTHING, don't bother with this banal, overlong, incoherent rubbish.",1,98,158,7 September 2019
Parasite," A Black Comedy That Takes a Sinister Turn
","ParasiteOverall a very enjoyable movie.This started out a black comedy and by the end morphed into something more sinister. We were shown a close knit nuclear family scraping by to survive in a slum-type basement dwelling. They were all universally hard working, inventive and inspired to get on in life, however it was inferred by the script that these attributes were not enough for any social mobility and that any advancement within Korean society was wholly dependent on the possession of family money from the outset.The Director introduced several themes and ideas that he tossed around, never quite landing on any definitive conclusion. We, the viewers were the mouse and the Director the cat. It did strangely have the feel of an Almodovar movie, perhaps this style was an influence.Lastly the obvious intention by the Director to infer wealthy people are parasites due to wealthy inequality was handled badly as it is these very wealthy people that provide currently any wages or opportunity for the poor. The real parasite is the Korean government who collect the taxes and make the laws and have clearly failed to create welfare structures or free education to promote a better society and social mobility. What would happen if all the wealthy people left and there was no tax receipts and communism has certainly not proved the answer.What was goodThe family bonds were well established, they were all in this together. This very much held the movie together.This was very much a simple linear story and most refreshing in its delivery.There was, for the first two thirds of the movie great dramatic impetus, we were all gripped, and I could certainly feel quite an atmosphere in the picture house.The acting seemed competent from the entire ensemble but it was difficult to judge due to the barrier of the subtitles.The subtitles were nuanced and comprehensive and seemed entirely natural.The cinematography was great and the camera made us feel very much the fly on the wall, and very in keeping with this kind of story.The musical score was great.What was problematicThe Director inferred that wealth and opportunity were the way forward and a wholesome aspiration for advancement for the family, but then went onto infer wealth corrupts and perhaps the mere possession of wealth was obscene, this is muddled thinking as it cannot be both as the same time.It was inferred that wealth isolates and anaesthetises you from the realities of other people lives, but the script so over simplified this observation it became irrelevant.We had insufficient character separation they are were just voices of the Director.It was inferred that oppression leads to revolution, I agree, but the family were not oppressed at the moment or indeed previously they were on the way up, so revolution, and this instigation for a bloodbath was flimsy.I enjoyed this movie, it lost its way in the last half hour and arrived at little redemption or conclusion. It really had little to say on the human condition, however it's great strength lay in its inventive comedy.With regard to awards, I would nominate it for best foreign language movie and give the award to Pain & Glory by Almodovar.",7,0,1,25 January 2020
Marriage Story," Very Slow Kitchen Sink Drama........meh!
","Marriage StoryThis was akin to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof without the alcohol and indeed without the hot tin. My mind tells me this 'play-like' drama failed to educate, entertain or inform, and just went totally flat about 20 minutes in. I just didn't see any chemistry between Adam and Scarlett and she delivered her part in a needy and pathetic grating accent. The cast was proficient that's it!This was a kitchen sink I just didn't want to see. Their sexless marriage had precipitated a tawdry affair and this had destroyed any trust they had, hardly a revelatory story!In terms of acting the performances were unvarying and very much on the surface, I didn't even like them so I really didn't care how the plot developed. I learned many years ago that if there is no passion at the beginning of a relationship there will certainly be none at the end.I must say after the court case this picked up somewhat where they all said things they didn't mean and then regreted it but it was so forcefully melodramatic I laughed out loud. My favourite bit was the domestic 'observation' it was inspired.The over sentimental mush ending was quite absurd after what had gone before.The luvvies may think this is good but I found it tiresome. The best thing were the lawyers Laura Dern and Alan Alda.",6,3,10,10 January 2020
Creed II," Great Entertainment
","This is a great movie from start to finish, Michael B Jordan delivers a top class performance, he goes from extreme sensitivity to savagery and back again. His traditional acting style not from the method school is nuanced and moving.Sylvester Stallone is great as the battered coach and there is great chemistry between the two leads.The boxing was great throughout and we were introduced to a whole range of new training tortures...brilliant.",9,0,2,1 December 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Really Quite Uninspiring.
","JoJo RabbitNot everyone's cup of tea, the movie had two strands, the allegorical story of JoJo representing Germany's brainwashed consciousness towards Nazisism and a little boy's struggle to make sense of world as the man of the house during a time of war.After an hour in I thought the joke wore thin, surreality can only hold the attention for so long without any anchors. I laughed about three times throughout this is hardly a high score for a supposed comedy.We had two fine performances from Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell and the rest was uninspiring. To my mind neither performances displayed sufficient range to merit an award however maybe Scarlett for a supporting award, after all the young boy was the star of this movie.The only redemption lay with JoJo becoming disillusioned with being a Nazis, hardly a surprise, and really quite insufficient.",5,1,6,4 January 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," Super Silly, Super Funny, I Loved It!
","What We Do In The ShadowsFrom the simple observation, how do vampires live in the modern world and what are they doing when not killing humans and what are vampire issues a whole comedic world has been created.This is a straightforward modern sitcom surprisingly and is a modern version of the Munsters and Adams Family. Brilliantly written brilliantly acted and just great fun from beginning to end.I love this type of silly humour, its not for everyone, perhaps more for a male audience, but I loved it.",8,0,0,15 June 2019
Green Book," A Really Great Movie
","Wow, this movie had just about everything you could want, incredible story, brilliant acting, amazing cinematography and authentic sets dragging us back to the post war years.The story ran at two levels, the first being the clash of two worlds and the coming together in mutual respect, and dare I say it love, and enduring friendship. The second was allegorical, with Tony Lip representing the American consciousness of the time, fixed, opinionated, racist, white and masculine. Don Shirley represented a whole collection of threats to these societal attitudes and by undertaking a concert tour in the 'deep south', consciously anticipated trouble. It was clear that Don in his own quiet way was doing his bit for the civil rights movement.Both leads were breathtaking in their attention to their craft, Mr Mortensen depth of characterisation was masterful, we all new Tony, we had all met a Tony and we all respected Tony who new his place and inadequacies but was not frightened of facing his demons. Mr Ali used micro gestures and method to convey a talented, fragile loner who we all just wanted to hug.If I had two Oscars to hand out I would give one to Mr Mortensen and one to Mr Ali.I would draw attention to one scene that was so powerful we writhed in our seats and some weak souls cried openly, not me! When Don Shirley said 'I'm not white enough, I'm not black enough, I'm not man enough, who am I!This is a must see, I can see why the movie was called Green Book, but really Mr Shirley's Driver would have been better.",10,2,3,13 February 2019
