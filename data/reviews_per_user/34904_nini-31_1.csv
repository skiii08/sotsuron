The Ring," A waste of my time
","Well, this American remake of Ringu took all that was good and creepy about the original and made everything so obvious, boring and ... well (no offence) American! I suppose it looks good enough... there are some creepy bits... some of the actors weren't utterly useless. But overall it was a huge waste of my time. (I want those 2 hours of my life back... I could have done something more productive like... Oh, Stared at my ceiling?)What made me even more disappointed was that I had seen and enjoyed the original. (If I hadn't then I might just have given this one a 2 or 3 for trying.) It was good precisely because it didn't attempt to shock you at every turn but rather crept up at you and made you feel thoroughly uncomfortable. (In a good way.) Whereas this piece of rubbish tried so hard to be scary that it ended up not being scary at all. See the original instead... it is far superior to this.",1,0,2,23 February 2007
