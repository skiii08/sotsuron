E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," How to fall in love with an Alien?
","With E.T., Spielberg had us made our 'first contact' with an alien on a personal level. Though he brought us close with his encouter of the third kind, in E.T. he pored the soul of an Alien right in to our hearts. What at first looks like a ugly creature, becomes a good friend during the movie.It's not the special effects that makes E.T. so great, but much more the depth of characters. The meaning of the word soulmates gets a whole new dimension. For me E.T. was an instant classic, the moment I saw it for the first time. Although some might consider that this film is a tearjerker, I believe that E.T. (and his well casted friends) are worth every tear you shed. E.T. is a heartfelt and impressive film about friendship that easily sustains the wear and tear of time.Besides that: it's just a fun movie to see for both young and old!10 out of 10",10,3,6,9 August 2003
