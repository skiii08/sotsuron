The Blair Witch Project," Great Idea, poor execution
","The concept of this movie and the story behind it were excellent.  The 'actors' involved in it did a serviceable job.  The biggest mistake made was letting out the fact that this story wasn't true before the film was released.  If I had not known that this was not real, I actually would have enjoyed it.  It had its moments, though few and far between.  The ending was very good.  Once again, if it had not been let out that this was a hoax, it would have been terrifying.  The second movie was much better and the Video Games are incredible.  The Blair Witch Project is a 3 to 4 out of 10 at best.",4,0,2,8 October 2003
