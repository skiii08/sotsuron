The Mask," :)
","There are a lot words that i can say, but for this movie i only can say that this is incredible! Such an awesome movie with the greatest actor ever! This movie is so wonderful that there is NO superfluous frame! It's ideal films! I love it so much that i know all quotes from movie, i play music from film and try to be like Jim in this movie! And it was my first foreign movie i've seen. And since that time i know the ideal script. for 1994 year effects used in this film were INCREDIBLE! No one movie can fight with Mask for really 'usefull' effects that are needed in movie. I'm Russian, and i can't explain this well, but i know such words as incredible, awesome, amazing, beautiful, fantastic... But 'the Mask' is FILM! not comedy or drama, thriller or fantastic... IT'S SUPER FILM!!! MOVIE FOR EVERYBODY! AND THE MOST Wonderful ACTOR - JIM CARREY with the MOST Beautiful ACTRESS - CAMERON DIAZ!!! Oh My God, I LOVE THIS MOVIE more than everything in this world!",10,1,2,2 September 2006
