Ghost," Amazing
","This is a very excellent movie.It, however, is a tearjerker.I cried and cried the first time I saw it.Whoopi Goldberg is very believable as well as Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze.I would recommend this movie.The music in it is wonderful-'Unchained Melody' as well as the theme.Amazing.",Null,1,2,3 March 2002
Cold Mountain," Fabulous
","This movie was excellent. I will not be one bit surprised if it gets an Oscar nod. Nicole Kidman does well. Jude Law is spectacular. His emotions shine so much through his eyes. Renee clearly deserves a best supporting actress Oscar for this role. She made the movie. Natalie Portman deserves one, too, but I doubt she'll even be nominated. She was incredible. Giovanni Ribisi brought a lot of life to his role as well clearly showing he has matured since That Thing You Do! Altogether a fabulous movie. Great! See you at the Oscars!",Null,0,0,8 January 2004
