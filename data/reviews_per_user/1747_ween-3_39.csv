Casablanca," The Best Last Line In Motion Pictures?
","Well..certainly a tie with 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn' on  the score card.. One of the all-time great love stories. Ted Turner didn't really need to update this movie. It's as colorful as they come in black and white. 'Casablanca' is on every movie fan's short list. And for those of you who don't believe in a supreme being who loves us all, remember that Ronald Reagan almost played Rick. If that don't bring out the religion in you.............Everybody goes to Rick's. And everybody sees this movie. Over and over. They don't make 'em any better.",10,1,1,27 December 2000
Minority Report," 'If you loved 'Blade Runner'..........
","Another Philip K. Dick story gets the full Monty for the big screen. The big question here: 'How far is a society prepared to go to ensure public safety'? Does any of this sound familiar to you, folks? I'm sitting here watching CNN reporting that the FBI is hunting for 5 suspected terrorists who entered the US illegally as I write this. 'Pre-crime'? Homeland security? Do the math. This movie came out right on time. The subject is definitely in play.The world of 2054 as portrayed here by our pal Steve Speilberg is not at all implausible. The computers, in particular, look like the next big thing. Ever seen anybody playing a theremin? No? Then how about how they turned Andy Serkes into Gollum for 'Lord Of The Rings'... And the product placement and digital advertising in 'M.R.'? Just remember, kids. You heard it here first. I saw the World's Fair in 64-65. I know how this works. The future is NOW. Speilberg's just showing us how we'll be driving our cars and using our P.C.'s before Chevrolet and Apple get their own ads in gear. The scene with Cruise's character in the mall is coming soon, and I don't mean to a theater near you, either. The film is story-driven and the acting is secondary to the special effects, which are spectacular, but Peter Stormare is a hoot is his cameo and Samantha Morton and Cruise do a creditable job considering the parameters. For you cinematography buffs out there, I believe that I counted 659 different shades of the color blue during the course of the movie. See if you can find them all. It's a fun game.Like I said, if you enjoyed 'Blade Runner' or 'A.I.', then this puppy is right in your wheelhouse. Another classic sci-fi flick.",8,0,0,30 December 2002
Erin Brockovich," So I Sing A Song Of Love For Julia
","Tour de force by Julia Roberts. I saw the real Erin Brockovitch on a talk show and our Miss Roberts pretty much nailed her act...right down to the 'Hooters' fashion sensibility. She inhabits the character completely. This time around, she earns that hugely inflated paycheck that she gets as a reward for her 'Q' ratings. Good for her!Albert Finney gets off a great supporting bit in this one. Real Lou Grant stuff. And as much as I hate those predictable Hollywood happy endings, you gotta love 'em when they happen to REAL people. So sit back, have a sno-cone and enjoy the show.",7,1,2,14 December 2000
Unbreakable," NIGHT FALLS
","Uh...let's see. Now I'm sure I saw this before...Bruce Willis...M. Night...a kid..hold on, now...lemme think...oh yeah...This sequel to 'Sixth Sense' should be renamed 'No Sense'. Completely devoid of anything that could be reasonably termed a 'plot', Night starts us down the road to nowhere about 14 different ways and then leaves us without any payoff. And the 'surprise' ending ain't no surprise, either. It's what your 8th grade English teacher used to call a 'deus ex machina'. For those of you who don't remember your elemental Latin...it basically means that the author doesn't have any rational way to end his story, so, instead, everybody gets run over by a big monster truck. The end.And this movie moves slower than 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Never thought I'd live to see it happen. For a reasonable facsimile of the pace of this movie, I suggest putting glue in a bottle of Heinz ketchup, allowing it to sit and emuslfiy for 4 or 5 days, and then attempting to pour it over soggy french fries. Trust me. It'll be more entertaining than the movie.On the plus side (and I'm really diggin' here, guys) there's some nice moody cinematography. And Bruce decided to forego the hairpiece for a change. That's almost worth the price of admission.As for my pal, M. Night, here's a suggestion--try directing one that you DIDN'T write. That's why they have writers. They write stuff. Sometimes it's good stuff. No need to wear all those hats. Go out and buy some of their stuff next time. They need money, too. And maybe another actor, just for fun. I mean, this ain't exactly a nascent Scorcese-De Niro relationship, Sparky. Let's can it while the going's still good.To the vast numbers of you who loved this film...and I know who you are... I got some old 'Green Lantern' and 'Flash' comics for sale on Ebay. And if you bid right now..........And to those of you who haven't yet been suckered (as I, alas, was) into seeing this puppy, save your $8.50. Don't believe the hype. Like Jacob Marley's ghost, I am rattling my chains in an attempt to save you from the fate I endured this XMAS season at my local cineplex. Be afraid. Be very very afraid!!!!",5,1,1,9 December 2000
Monster," A 'Monster' Performance
","this ain't about just 'de-glamming' charlize theron...this is about her getting 110% LOST in the role of aileen wournos...she's on screen for just about the entire length of the movie and completely inhabits her character for the duration...those awards she's been getting (golden globe, sag and next week's oscar) are a foregone conclusion...you aren't going to forget THIS performance any time soon...christina ricci also scores a personal best here...and the support cast (lee tergesen, bruce dern, scott wilson, et al.), who apparently worked for peanuts on this film, make the most of their screen time....the movie itself? DARK DARK DARK...like 'leaving las vegas', you ain't gonna go home humming the tunes from this one...death penalty/abuse martyr or stone cold killer? the actual facts of the wournos case are on record and you can draw your own conclusions about how the film colors those facts, but there's no arguing that this a superior bit of directing by patty jenkins
(a propos of absolutely nothing, seems to me that theron and ashley judd, who's about one solid role away from an oscar herself, are going to be competing for very similar roles in their cinematic futures...both of them are extremely intelligent actresses who bring somewhat similar dimensions to the roles they play...looking forward to what both of them have in store.)",8,0,0,23 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," 'Yo Ho Ho'
","A movie based on a Disney ride? You gotta be kiddin' me!! But somehow, they did it...a thoroughly entertaining film with a surprisingly funny script and great over-the-top performances by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush swashin' and bucklin' their way through this send-up of the Errol Flynn genre...Maybe a little CGI-heavy, but Walt would have loved it...And as for 17-year old Keira Knightley, her pirate ship has most assuredly come in...Some fun DVD extras (short history of piracy---the original Disney ride history)...Extravagant costumes, sets and make-up but the performances don't get buried, and that's as much as you can ask for in this type of film...My only fear is that if this catches on ('Haunted Mansion', etc.), they'll be making a movie about the concession stands at the park before too long...'AAAAARGGGHHHHH MATEY!!!!', indeed!!",7,1,2,14 February 2004
Finding Nemo," Tank you, Pixar!!!
","As a scuba diver, few things could make me happier than seeing Jean-Micheal Cousteau appear in a DVD extra that millions of kids are going to watch over and over, communicating the gospel of protecting the underwater environment the easy way...with cartoons and humor. For that alone, the folks at Pixar should take a bow. Ya done Walt proud!!!'Nemo', like the equally impressive 'Shrek', features state of the art animation and a working script with more heart and comedy than most of the live-action bombs currently crowding your local multiplex. When you have Willem DaFoe voicing an animated character, you're obviously arrived on a whole 'nother plateau in cartoonland, Sparky! And Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are no-brainers for this sort of stuff...just plop 'em in front of the mike and let 'em do their thing. 12-stepping sharks?... You just gotta love this film!!!
With all due respect to Leslie Nielsen in 'Airplane'...fish for dinner, anyone?",8,0,1,10 April 2004
Insomnia," Turn out the lights..the party's over..........
","Haven't seen the Norweigian original...but it would be hard to top the performances of Pacino and Robin Williams here. The meeting on the ferry between the two is reminiscent of the scene in 'Heat' with Pacino and DeNiro...you're expecting fireworks and instead you get underplay. Once again, it works beautifully. Just two Oscar winners quietly polishing their craft for your amusement. Solid directing by Nolan and a really magnificent opening aerial shot of Alaska.",7,0,0,29 October 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," 'It blowed up reeeeeel gooood!'
","look...whaddya really need to know here, anyway? you saw the teasers on TV...wanna take a wild guess on how this plays out? yeah, i went to see this turkey but i plead guilty with an explanation...i'm sort of a sucker for this kind of mindless drivel, and every once in a while i just wanna see martians blow up the white house, or ghidra and rodan destroy tokyo, or a rogue asteroid hit a starbucks...so i plopped down my $9.25 to see a big wave and a coupla c.g.i. twisters and some rather large ice cubes at my local cineplex...mission accomplished, ya know?truth be told...i already know what i'm in for at this kind of flick and if you serve me up just a little bit of comedy in the middle of the special effects (a la Buscemi, Willis and Peter Stormare in 'Armageddon') i'm a happy puppy...unfortunately, this sucker is pretty humorless...and considering they hired an actor who's a dead-ringer for Dick Cheney to play the vice president, they missed the opportunity to have a whole lotta fun here...so you're basically here for the f-x, kiddies...what can i tell you?..enjoy the big wave and the tornados and try to forget you just saw 'em in 'Perfect Storm' and 'Twister' last year...",4,0,1,6 June 2004
Match Point," 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' goes Brit
","Woody's plowed this field before in 'C&M', but 'Match Point' revisits the territory in a somewhat more dramatic manner, and the acting, particularly by Scarlett Johannsen, makes this a must-see for habitués of the Allen canon. In living color. And wonder of wonders, actual proof that the Woodman may have developed a theory that not all aerobic life forms are confined to the interior of a NYC pied a terre.Note bene...Having seen this one on DVD, I strongly urge that you use the English subtitles, as an awful lot of the duologue is buried in the soundtrack either by multiple conversations (a la Altman) or by inaudible stage whispers.",8,1,3,24 June 2006
Lost in Translation," ms. coppola atones for her sins
","just when i was prepared to spend the remainder of my life hating and villifying sofia coppola for almost single-handedly destroying the 'godfather' trilogy, along comes 'lost in translation' and just about all is forgiven...very original (autobiographical?) screenplay, neat cinematography, and a couple of quietly underplayed performances from murray and johannson...a character study that compels the viewer to fill in a lot of blanks...no grand flourishes, very little exposition and if you're looking for big action or belly laughs, you've come to the wrong place...a little overhyped? maybe...but this is a very solid directorial effort...given this and 'the virgin suicides', i'm getting real close to absolving francis ford's daughter for (m)ucking up those scenes with andy garcia in 'g-3'...",7,0,0,23 February 2004
The Godfather: Part II," NUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET
","What superlatives can I hurl at this film that you haven't already heard? Okay. Let's try this one....The night before they strap me into the electric chair, I'm demanding TWO things...a big plate of cheesy homemade lasagna and one more screening of 'G2' (which should bring my cumulative total up to about 53).This is it. The filmmaker's bible. The ne plus ultra of American cinema. 'TEN' ain't a high enough number for a vote on this one. This is in a category by itself and should be viewed as a one-piece unit with 'G1' as THE reason that they invented film in the first place.Not a word out of place. Not a shot that isn't perfection. Indelible. Wanna impress other life forms in the galaxy? Put 'G2'and 'G1' in the capsule and send it up. And besides, I understand they need a good recipe for meat sauce on Alpha Centauri.When they look back at our civilization a thousand years from now...they'll recognize this film as our generation's contribution to the development of the culture of all mankind. And maybe they'll forgive us for 'Titanic'.",10,1,1,24 December 2000
Cold Mountain," 'Ruby Thewes-Day...Who can hang a name on you?'
","in a film fairly loaded with terrific performances by a bevy of great character actors, Nicole and Jude as the leads almost get lost in the mix...but not Ms. Zellweger, who channels equal parts Auntie Eller and Calamity Jane and pretty much walks off with this movie (and they owed her an oscar for 'chicago' anyway)...great job of directing and cinematography, and i take issue with anyone who complains about this flick's length since Walter Murch's editing keeps this puppy zipping along at a nice clip...the whole issue of the 'home guard' is a dirty little tidbit of civil war history not mentioned in most texts and provides an interesting center for the conflict in the moviewhile it may not quite be 'Gone With The Wind', 'Cold Mountain' is one of the better films to come down the pike in the last few years
the DVD extras include a terrific live concert of the music from the film interspersed with readings from the novel by most of the primary cast...and an impressively thoughtful interview with director Anthony Minghella about the project and after years of ignoring the white stripes, i just became a jack white fan...any friend of t-bone burnett's is okay by me...",8,3,4,24 July 2004
American Beauty," Instant Classic
","I don't know about #2 all-time, but this is certainly the movie of the year and a sure-fire multiple Oscar and Golden Globe winner. Sam Mendes, late of 'Cabaret' on Broadway, goes right to the head of the class with his first feature film. First-rate writing and cinematography and an impeccable cast. I've come to expect this level from Spacey but Bening hasn't had a role this complex since 'The Grifters' and she just knocks it out of the park. This is one of those pictures that you'll be watching over and over for years and getting some fresh nuances each time. Fin de siecle filmmaking at its very best.",10,0,0,20 November 1999
Apocalypse Now," If it walks like a redux and it talks like a redux........
","Look...what hasn't been said about this movie..just writing because I watched 'Redux' again for about the fifth time (add that to the countless views of the original version) and still can't get over how the French Plantation scene was ever excised from the original cut..It's a brilliant reduction of history that explains the roots of the Vietnam War and fleshes out Sheen's character in even greater detail. The addition of the plantation scene plus the tragicomic 'Playboy bunnies' trailer sequence and the outright laughs of the extended 'surfing' shot just make an already classic film even more powerful. #34 on the IMDb all-time list? Sorry, folks...I liked 'Lord of the Rings', too. But let's call a spade a spade, shall we? This one's in a class with Coppola's other 2 little projects (G1 and G2). Let's move this puppy up the list, post-haste!!",10,0,0,23 July 2002
Gandhi," Sweeping Epic With A Bravura Performance
","A magnificent movie by Attenborough and a career-topper for Ben Kingsley. Brilliant story of the man who almost single-handedly brought India kicking and screaming into the world as an independent nation. One of this century's true heroic figures, it is a crying shame that more than 50 years later, we are still dealing with the dangerous fallout of the Indian-Pakistani aggression that he so desperately sought to end.Count this movie amongst the great epics of cinematic history. All the supporting performances, particularly that of Roshan Seth as Nehru, are an absolute joy to behold. Classic cinematography, and a masterwork of a score by Ravi Shankar.  Attenborough, of course, when he's not out raising dinosaurs, is a director of epics par excelllence ('A Bridge Too Far' is another stroke of genius). Ben Kingsley spends the better part of 3 hours on screen in an absolutely riveting performance. The road to peace is a hard road. Just ask Nelson Mandela or John Lennon. This movie allows the viewer to take part of the journey.",10,12,19,27 December 2000
Pearl Harbor," 'Bore-a! Bore-a! Bore-a!'
","'Bruckheimer Goes Hawaiian' goes something like this:1)Start with the boat from 'Titanic'2)Add gun turrets3)Now make a lot more boats just like it4)Blow 'em all up5)Get a chick named Kate to play the female lead. Hey. It worked once.Ya wanna see the 'real deal' treatment? Go pick up 'Tora!Tora!Tora!' (1970) which actually did a fairly decent job of recounting the series of events leading up to the bombing from both the Japanese and US points of view. 'Pearl' is a tremendous waste of good talent and the writing makes 'Armageddon' look like Shakespeare by comparison. Strictly a summer 'it blowed up real good' type of deal here.Unless you loved 'Titanic' or have a deep-seated urge to see Ben Affleck in a Hawaiian shirt, let me save you $7.50 and 3 1/4 hours. Take a pass. And that's a better warning than Hickam Field ever got!",6,0,0,28 May 2001
Quantum of Solace," Bland...James Bland
","Disappointing. 'Quantum', hot on the heels of one of the best in the Bond series, 'Casino Royale', delivers more quick cuts than your average 80's hair-band video. The director doesn't let you come up for air and enjoy the ride. Dialogue and plot, never really a major drawing card for the Bond movies, gets reduced here to nothing more than an afterthought. There's not even the occasional double-entendre or gag line dropped in as a respite from the unrelenting shock and awe campaign of car chases and shoot-em-ups. Daniel Craig is better than this, as witnessed in 'Casino'. Call this a misstep. Craig's batting .500 as the new Bond. Let's see if a new director can get bring the series back up to snuff.On the upside, the DVD video of Jack White and Alicia Keys doing the latest Bond song is probably more entertaining than the movie itself. In fact, Alicia looks like she's auditioning for one of those coveted Bond girl slots. Come on. Dip Alicia in some gold or oil or green toxic slime or whatever and let her show up as the latest in a string of beautiful Bond DBs .Can I get an Amen here? 'Another Way To Die' can take its rightful place in the 'Goldfinger' pantheon of cool Bond themes, probablysomewhere smack in the middle of 'Live and Let Die' and 'For Your Eyes Only'.Here's hoping the next Bond project gives Craig a shot at re-setting the bar.",4,4,11,12 April 2009
Seabiscuit," 'A horse is a horse of course of course.........'
","Sweeping cinematography and a solid cast of actors puts 'Seabiscuit' ahead by a nose in the race for feel-good movie of the year. While, of necessity, there was a bit of 'The Horse Whisperer' redux involved,  the film still manages to do a fine job of telling its story of second chances and redemption without forcing you to grab the Kleenex at predictable intervals.
The always superb William Macy provides some funny moments in his role as an adrenaline-fueled race announcer. However, it's a bit of a mystery why Macy, and not Chris Cooper, was nominated for a Golden Globe as supporting actor in this film. Seems to me that Cooper should have had the 'inside track' on that based on sheer screen time alone.",7,0,0,29 December 2003
School of Rock," Jack Black Sabbath
","You say you need 'over the top'? It don't get no more over the top than the good Mr. Black, who should now be inducted into the Eyebrow Hall of Fame along with Jack Nicholson and John Belushi. On paper, this script may not have looked all that great, but as a vehicle for Jack Black it's just about perfect. The erstwhile lead singer of Tenacious D just lets it fly, and the results are hillarious. And at the risk of being labelled a pederast, i think i'm in love with Miranda Cosgrove...i mean, really...could she be any cuter? Somebody get her into a TV series, and fast. Her interplay with Jack Black on the DVD extras could have been released on its own as the trailer for 'SOR'...it's a riot.  The kids in the movie, most of whom seem to have little or no acting experience prior to 'SOR', are utterly natural and uniformly terrific. While they're mostly there to serve as background for Black, they manage to steal half the movie anyway, which, i suppose, is what the director intended.If you watch Joan Cusack closely, it seems she's channeling her brother John in a few of the scenes...the reads on some of her lines are remarkably similar...five's gotcha ten they worked together on her delivery...'SOR' is one of those family-friendly flicks you can watch with the kids...so give them a few beers and a bowl of guacamole and laugh along with them....",7,0,1,22 March 2004
Shrek 2," Take Another Bow
","yup...they did it again...the comedy writing for the 'shrek' flicks is head-and-shoulders above most of what's passing for 'comedy' in the movies these days...as inspired and original as it gets...while they're not the only ones to turn fairy-tale conventions on their ear for laughs (see 'princess bride'), the cartoon format gives the writers and performers a whole lotta latitude, and they use every inch of it here...the second installment of the 'shrek' series (i can only hope there's more to come) has a ball playing 'where's waldo' with movie/TV/cultural references...they come at you pretty fast and furious, and a second viewing is pretty much mandatory since you're bound to miss a coupla goodies the first time around...the overall concept here is 'meet the parents' in ogre-ville, and boy howdy, this is one FUNNY movie...And from the Meritorius Service to a Moribund Industry Dept:whoever does the music consulting for these movies should be singled out for a distinguished service medal by the appropriate authorities... tom waits? leonard cohen?...i mean, come on, kids...NOBODY in their right mind legitimately expects to hear music THIS good in a cartoon...what a great job they've done introducing these and other performers to a whole new audience...the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission...",9,0,0,9 June 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Date Movie For The Mensa Crowd
","Charlie Kaufman does it again...this guy is well on his way towards a whole separate chapter of his own in screenwriting history...highly unconventional time after time...maybe it's an acquired taste, and maybe he goes off the rails now and then, but this is definitively NOT the sort of linear storytelling you're used to...gotta applaud the sheer originality he brings to the table...Kate Winslet's hair is the target of enough theatrical paint to cover a good sized Manhattan office building with 2 coats...beyond that, she puts in a helluva nuanced performance...Jim Carrey tones it way down except for one truly wacky scene in which he regresses to childhood...(that scene alone is worth the price of admission)...the supporting cast, in particular Mark Ruffalo, provide some unusual comic moments throughout the film...some acting nominations may be in the offing come awards time, but the screenplay is the real star of this film and director Michael Gondry does a nice job of assembling the pieces of this sci-fi tinged puzzle of a love story...",8,0,1,26 March 2004
This Is Spinal Tap," 'What are the hours?'
","To the unfortunate masses who have never spent a moment's time playing in a rock band let me assure you...this movie is NOT a satire. It is the revealed truth. Think I'm lying? Go out and buy a Stratocaster, learn the opening bars to 'Stairway to Heaven' and go play it with your band in front of an assembly of 16 year-old drug-addled geeks at your friendly local bar. Then come back and we'll talk. That aside, any metalhead Beavis can tell you that 'Tap' is one of the top ten funniest movies ever committed to celluloid. What's even funnier is that I happened to be watching 'The Joe Franklin Show' shortly after the movie came out, and it seems that nobody on Joe's staff told him that the band was a goof. Joe proceeded to interview them as if they were the real deal. Proof positive, once again, that truth is not only stranger, but a whole lot more ridiculous than fiction. (By the way, if anyone has a copy of that particular show lying around some roach-infested corner of his/her attic, I would be forever in your debt for just a peek.) And I'm still waiting for the inevitable '1001 Strings' cover of 'Lick My Love Pump'. It's such a poignant melody.",10,0,2,8 August 1999
Avatar," Cameron---The Blue Period
","This is why they invented popcorn.Yeah, okay. This IS a victory of style over substance and yadda yadda yadda...but there's enough just enough substance to sustain the story line, and the style alone is worth the price of admission. For those of us weaned on 'Star Wars', welcome to the new paradigm.Cameron, whether you love him or hate him, has changed the game with this puppy. From a purely technical standpoint, 'Avatar' is absolute state of the art. Don't know if this flick will translate real well to your 36' flat screen at home, but throw in some stadium seating, 3D, and a big screen, and this is a an 'E' ride at Disney.We all liked the circus when we were kids, so let's not pretend this ain't fun. Pretty colors, rhinos with hammerheads and floating mountains courtesy Roger Dean. What's not to love, huh? On a side note, the movie has pulled in about $1 billion in the first 2 weeks. Given the size of the crew listed in the credits for the movie, that only works out to about $2.46 per person. (I did the math). So go buy a ticket and give these folks enough for a gallon of gas.",8,0,1,14 January 2010
The Artist," Run silent, run deep
","Yeah...you can believe all the hype...It really IS that good. A movie for people who love the movies...and this is one that you really DO need to see in a theater, popcorn in hand. Couple of random thoughts: 1) Woody Allen and Mel Brooks are truly unindicted co-conspirators in this project. Their work paved the way.2) No supporting actor nod for Uggie? Really? A darned shame. For starters, more emotional range than Emily Proctor and Jim Belushi, and he probably required fewer biscuits during rehearsals, and fewer takes to get the scene.3) Let's face the cold hard facts, folks. Painful as it may be, it's probably okay to be a patriotic American and like the French again. C'est si bon and all that.4) Billy Crystal's got it easy this year. The opening montage pretty much writes itself, don't it?",10,0,3,20 February 2012

Eyes Wide Shut," You just know that Stanley didn't want to go out on THIS note
","As a dyed-in-the-wool Kubrick fan, I'm aware that the closest Kubrick ever came to depicting sex was the docking sequence in '2001' but I bought into the hype and figured that if Stanley was going S&M and Tom and Nicole were along for the ride this was going to be AN EVENT. What I got instead was 45 minutes of Kabuki theatre accompanied by Gregorian chants and a piano that was missing 87 keys, and another 2 1/2 hours of Stan's Greatest Hits. There were pieces of 'Clockwork', '2001' and 'Full Metal' sprinkled liberally throughout the proceedings in the form of camerawork and pacing. Probably nothing wrong with this movie that a good hedge trimmer couldn't cure. This puppy D--R--A--G--S! Unfortunately, some impressive acting by Nicole Kidman and a great little bit by Alan Cumming gets lost in this ponderous opus. A miscast Cruise and a script that ostensibly is about obsession, dreams and reality never gets the viewer to a clearer understanding of how they are connected. One can sift through some of the more obvious nonsense and sort of see where Kubrick wanted to go, but, like riding the Long Island Railroad, it's just a long, hard way to get there. Considering the body of work that Kubrick left behind, 'Eyes Wide Shut' has to rank as a disappointment. We've lost one of the great American originals, a truly visionary director, and it's seems a shame that his swan song should be one of his lesser efforts.",5,1,2,7 August 1999
The Da Vinci Code," so dark the con of critics
","gotta figure that the hype on this movie was so huge that critics were just drooling over the chance to pounce and tear it up upon release...truth be told, this ain't a bad movie...great cinematography and fairly solid acting by the leads..ian mckellen is long past overdue for an Oscar, and chances are pretty good that he's going to be nominated in support for this flick...wouldn't be surprised if he walks away with it as the sentimental favorite based on his exemplary career...ron howard takes a few liberties with the dan brown novel, but given the density of arcane info in the book, some compression of the plot was to be expected in order to keep the action moving...by the way, glowing letters and numbers flying off the wall and/or page has obviously become the ron howard signature..if you liked the floating numerals in 'beautiful mind', their alphabetical compatriots are back for an encore, kids....don't be put off by the hyperbole that's flying around about the novel or the film...'dvc' is a neat little roller coaster ride..just strap yourself in for a nice evening's entertainment.....nota bene: wanna do some comparison shopping? check out 'name of the rose' if you enjoyed this puppy...it's sorta 'dvc gets medieval on your ass' and mines similar subject matter",7,1,2,2 June 2006
Titanic," 'You're gonna need a bigger boat'. (see Jaws infra)
","It's almost too easy to bash this film. So I'll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the 'pitch' meeting for the film...'I got an idea for a film about a boat. It's about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there's no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it's gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?'Truth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain't bad, but nothing I haven't already seen on the Discovery Channel. I'll still take Cameron's 'The Abyss' every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It's just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual 'acting'. You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In 'The Abyss', Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick. Leo and Co. are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effects.And here's another shining moment for the Oscars.

","With 'I Am Sam' and 'Dead Man Walking' as a backdrop, the academy will undoubtedly hand Sean Penn the best actor prize for this outing. And, god bless 'em, why not? This performance IS remarkable. But in all the hoopla surrounding Penn's performance, it's a pity that similar huzzahs are not being shouted from the rafters for a host of other folks involved in bringing this adaptation of Lehane's novel to the screen. To wit:1)Clint Eastwood---another notch in the belt for an actor's directorwho knows how to create exactly the correct ambience, get exactly the right cast, and then get out of the way...and that's how he gets these perfectly organic performances time after time. 2)Tim Robbins---and now the academy's gonna owe THIS fella the door prize the next time 'round...a bravura performance...pay close attention to his character's walk and posture....beautiful.3)A superb supporting cast (Harden, Fishburne, Bacon, Linney and an uncredited Eli Wallach in the only really funny scene in an otherwise tragic movie...unfortunately, Kevin Conway, who isperfectly cast, and whose character is more integral in the novel, doesn't enjoy much screen time...would have love to have seen him for another few minutes...4)Brian Helgeland's screenplay---why mess with a good thing? he stays faithful to the book and compresses the exposition and internal dialogue of the novel without losing the focus..5)Tom Stern's cinematography---the tone of the movie is set right at the outset. Gritty realism....A good novel and a great film. And Sean Penn is looking more and more like DeNiro every day, isn't he?",8,0,0,28 December 2003
Jaws," Reality REALLY Bites!!
","Absolutely classic re-telling of the 'Moby Dick' story by Spielberg. Ever notice that in this seminal 'action' flick, the action STOPS for about 4 minutes for Quint's monologue. It's the key sequence in the movie, written to perfection and not an Oscar nomination in sight for Robert Shaw who created one of the most indelible images in motion pictures.This movie pretty much set the standard for all the crappy 'shock' flicks that we've had to endure for the last couple of decades. Nothing since that even comes close. And don't bet the family farm on the upcoming 'Deep Blue Sea'. I've got a bad feeling that this new set of teeth is going to have a whole bunch of cavities, too. You can't improve on the original package, folks!",10,2,4,17 August 1999
The Good Shepherd," Sex, Lies and Reel-To-Reel Tape
","A number of the reviews here mention the fact that Bobby DeNiro has stolen a few pages from the Francis Ford Coppola Director's Handbook. Couldn't agree more. And if you're gonna choose a director to emulate, you might as well go straight to the top of the class.The parallels to the 'Godfather' movies are evident throughout the film, most particularly in the way that DeNiro evokes the periods in question with a rabid attention to detail. Everything just looks and feels right. 'Good Shepherd' is one of those films that will bear repeated viewings for nuances, and I believe that's probably the nicest thing that one can say about any film.The acting by all concerned parties is award worthy. It's Damon's movie, but expect any number of supporting actors to be recognized as well, including my personal nominee for next 'it-girl', Tammy Blanchard.DeNiro's direction in 'Bronx Tale' was solid and focused, but 'Good Shepherd' is a quantum leap forward. You say you're looking for an 'actor's director'? One might postulate that you're gonna be hard-pressed to top this fella any time soon. Even odds that come award season, the movie and the good Mr. DeNiro walk away with the whole shootin' match.",9,4,10,25 December 2006
Casino Royale," Danny Boy gets the gig.
","Gotta give credit where it's due. This movie hits all the buttons you want from a Bond flick. Great opening chase scene, great closing blow-it-all-to-smithereens scene, great looking Bond girls and snappy cinematography. And the newest Bond, Daniel Craig, proudly carries on the tradition without slipping into the Austin Powers self-parody trap lurking around every corner.Have to love the opening. After using every imaginable mode of transportation from speedboats to hotsh*t race cars to jets to skis for the chase scenes in the previous Bond flicks, I would have figured they'd run out of options and just re-cycle. So, instead, the producers hit on the ONE mode of transportation that hadn't yet been used... Running. Lord help me. Running. On foot. And it WORKS!!! All I can say to Marty Campbell is 'You had me at 'hello'.Great twist on the 'Shaken, not stirred' line, too. Cute retro move on the opening title credits. The theme song ain't really up to snuff, but that's my only real complaint here.All in all, not quite 'Goldfinger', but not bad. Thought that a blonde Bond would create a rift in the cosmos and suck the universe into a some black hole in the space-time continuum. Thought I'd come out of the movie screaming 'I knew Sean Connery. Sean Connery was a friend of mine. And you, my friend, are no Sean Connery'. But Daniel Craig pulls it off. Go figure. I stand corrected. And more important...I sit entertained.",8,1,2,24 December 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 'Star Wars' for the Pepsi Generation
","Considering that sword and sorcerer movies ain't my usual cup o' tea...gotta hand it to Peter Jackson and the extraordinary effects crew for 'King' and the first 2 of the 'Ring' series. The third installment was a little long on the battle scenes for my taste but the sound, CGI and animation (in particular, Andy Serkis' Gollum) was just terrific. Sure, the acting is a bit overwrought, but hey...it is what it is...(this ain't 'Hamlet')...and Ian McKellan could read the  phone book and still rock the joint, anyway.
Newbie Peter Jackson is pretty much a lock to win the Oscar for direction...the trilogy was a monumental effort and he's earned the accolade. The tech awards are a no-brainer...this is the state of the art in the year of our 'Lord' 2003. And ya gotta figure that Billy Crystal is gonna come out dressed as either Gollum or a hobbit on the February Oscar telecast.",8,0,0,25 December 2003
Pineapple Express," Grist for the weedwhacker
","Sometimes you just have to wonder who's greenlighting this kind of unwatchable boring stoner garbage. You're gonna need heavier drugs than marijuana to find this puppy even remotely funny. 'Pineapple' makes you're average Cheech and Chong movie look like 'King Lear' by comparison. Look..if you're into this sort of thing, might as well pick up a Kevin Smith flick and do it the right way. And for those Hollywood geniuses who insist on foisting Sean Rogen films on an unsuspecting populace, may the good lord have mercy on your souls.Give this waste of time the 'Sticks and Stems' award it deserves. Move along folks. Nothing to see here.",1,11,23,12 April 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Open the Bombay Doors
","So this is how you 'curry' favor with the Oscar and Globes voters. While 'Slumdog' is, at its core, a happy ending love story, the urban sprawl of Mumbai and the unique manner in which the story unfolds set it apart. Danny Boyle and company have been duly rewarded for their originality and this is one of those instances where all the hype is absolutely merited. Couple of quick shout-outs here: 1) 'The Kids Are Alright'---the child actors in this film are fantastic and worth the price of admission on their own 2)Get yer Bollywood on---that full-on cast-of-thousands dance sequence that runs over the end credits is a great way to wrap things up. Jai-Ho!!, baby.",9,0,4,14 April 2009
Gladiator," 'I AM SPARTACUS!!'
","The opening scene here is similar to the opening scene in 'Saving Private Ryan'..just substitute horses for boats, tunics for fatigues and helmets for..well..really BIG FANCY helmets. Anyway... any time a movie kicks off with a severed head, you know you're in for some rollicking family fun. Even King Arthur takes a break from Camelot to join the party.Seems that Commodus (Phoenix) is the Marcus 'W' Aurelius of Rome. He wants his dad's old gig. Dad wants to give the job to workingman's hero Maximus (Crowe). Ergo...bye bye, Pops. Commodus then gets 'Braveheart' on Maximus' ass, tearing up his vegetable garden, and his wife and kid. So what we got here is a WWF-worthy death-match type conflict. And away we go.....In the immortal words of Peter Graves in 'Airplane'..'You like to watch gladiator movies, Timmy?'. Well, you could do lots worse than this one. For starters, some neat cinematography courtesy John Mathieson. Djimon Hounsou doing his 'noble savage' thing straight outa 'Amistad'. Derek Jacobi grabbing the 'I Claudius' toga for a redux. Oliver Reed in a Moroccan approximation of Fagin. Connie Nielsen looking almost as good as she did in 'Devil's Advocate'. And Phoenix getting that nasty Jack Palance evil-eye thing down to a tee and pasting it onto a little Nigel Tufnel spoiled-rock-star panache. Hey. What's not to love here?This is a real Dino De Laurentus type old-style epic. A 'Spartacus' for x-genners. 'Gladiator' is gonna take home a handful of awards for costuming, cinematography and scenic design, which it deserves. Not as certain about the major nominations, but nobody involved with this picture has anything to be ashamed of. Solid entertainment the way mama used to make it. And Crowe gets to go home to Meg Ryan either way...Oscar or not...and that's what I call a win-win situation, kiddies. Saw this one on a big screen TV but if it goes back into theaters before the Oscars, I'll be on line. This has 'Panavision' written all over it.",7,0,0,26 December 2000
The Wizard of Oz," And Your Little Dog, Too!
","I don't care who you are. If you grew up in an Englsh-speaking country, THIS was your favorite movie when you were 5 years old. That's right. Before you understood those camera angles in 'Citizen Kane', before you could appreciate the grandeur of 'Gone With The Wind', before you could wipe yourself without Mom's assistance...Margaret Hamilton scared the living crap out of you. And you never ever wanted to move to Witchita with all those mean monkeys flying around.And now you're watching it with YOUR kids every Thanksgiving. And little Mikey can watch you recite every line word for word and sing every song note for note. And guess what? Little Mikey will be mouthing the words in front of the tube just like you one day. For HIS kids.",10,1,2,27 December 2000
High Fidelity," Not quite 'top 5'..but damn close!!!
","Seen this one about a half dozen times and it's climbing the charts every time I see it. Great directing by Frears. Very original concept. John Cusack in his best performance since 'The Grifters'. Jack Black's breakout. Funny as hell and, no big surprise given the subject matter, a bang-up soundtrack. Add a cameo by 'The Boss' and hey, what's not to like? A minor classic.",9,0,1,6 September 2002
