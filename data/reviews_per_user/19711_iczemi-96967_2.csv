First Man," Was a great movie re-enacting a great mankind achievement.
","Loved the movie. It's realism of the events the tension the risk and complexity of the mission given the technology available at the time. Extraordinary effects. I liked also the social aspect how was described the human interactions, emotions.
The movie took me to the Moon and back.",10,0,1,17 March 2019
La La Land," I tried to watch it I could not finish it.
","I tried to watch it but honestly I could not. I felt pain. I loved Marry Poppins. I loved The Sound of Music. Yet I struggled to watch this one and I failed. I simply could not finish it. I do not understand why it is acclaimed and why it got the golden globe. Of course I have to write 10 lines of text, and I will try just to be able to express my disappointment with this movie. I do believe that there is something really wrong with these movies, it brings back a memory from an Oscar two years ago (I think) when another weird movie got the best movie. It was The Bird man. No one liked, no one spoke about it, no one even remembers it. It appears to me that the academy jury like to vote for movies about themselves movies about actors and acting. That a closed circle, without connection to the rest of the world.",Null,5,8,11 February 2017
