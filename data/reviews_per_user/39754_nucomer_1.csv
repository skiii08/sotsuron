Blade Runner 2049," Gorgeous
","Finally, it's something rare and unexpected. This slow-paced picture shows beautiful images all the way. It's marvelous even it's compared to the original. Cold / warm, light / shade... This is what movies and cinemas were created for. Acting is great. Sound design is exceptional too. Regarding the story - I'll make it short. It's subject is now more a disturbing reality than it was 25 years ago. Be prepared for a long journey that has it's flows yet still providing a shockingly fresh sequel. (Being an early 80's kid and seen every bit of big-budget stuff, I was looking for something similar when I went to see The Force Awakens).",9,2,8,18 October 2017
