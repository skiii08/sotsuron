Walk the Line," The best film made in years!
","Well I have to say, I did (and do) like Johnny Cash's music before I saw this movie. But after seeing this movie, I saw the person, the character who wrote these songs.This movie is one of the greatest I have seen, whatever genre. It really feels like you get into J. Cash's life and the actors! WOW! They do an amazing job! The feel when Joaquin Phoenix (as J. Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (as June Carter) perform on stage in the movie, can only be described as... hmmm.. beyond amazing! Nothing in the movie feels over-made or unreal. To sum it all up, I say: 'I drowned in the movie, and at the end of the movie, I felt like I was waking up from a very real dream'SEE THIS MOVIE!!",Null,1,2,27 December 2006
