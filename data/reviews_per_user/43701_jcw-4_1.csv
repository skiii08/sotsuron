Mission: Impossible III," Even if you think Tom is a w@*&er go see this!
","This has to be one of the best action movies to be released since the matrix 1 and Run Lola Run. Edge of your seat entertainment from beginning to end - your popcorn will be finished in the first two minutes! I personally decided to boycott this movie in case tom had put in some wacky Scientology subliminal brainwashing (maybe he did?) but there was nothing else to see, so for a bit of mind-numbing entertainment I decided to forget my principles and fund his church. Oh well at least I'm not the mother of his alien.. So my point is - go see it, it is a really good action film and there's so much more to it than tom cruise - he only provided the comic relief.",9,0,1,9 May 2006
