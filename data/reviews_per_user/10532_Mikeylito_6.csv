United 93," Do Not Go Gentle...
","British documentarian Paul Greengrass has constructed a chilling re-creation of the events of that morning by focusing on the one of four flights that did not reach its target.Greengrass and his collaborators interviewed over 100 friends and family of the crew and passengers of United Airlines flight 93. The result is an absorbing theory of what happened on that morning.The movie opens with a rare, for this film, moment of melodrama. A man, presumably in a Manhattan hotel room, is praying in Arabic. His companions soon tell him, 'it's time.' We quickly move to Newark International Airport where we view routine happenings. Pilots and flight attendants arrive for the flight. Passengers, including the soon-to-be hijackers, are passing through airport security. The plane is being loaded with luggage, food and, ominously, fuel.We're taken to various other locations: Air Traffic Control in Boston and the FAA's command center located in Herndon VA. In Herndon, we're introduced to Ben Sliney. It's his first day on the job as National Operations Manager for the FAA. At this point, the day is normal.Sliney meets with his staff as the plane is loaded and taxied onto the tarmac. Because we, the audience, know what is about to happen, there is palpable tension in the unfolding of routine events: the stowing of carry-on luggage, the taking of breakfast orders, a pre-flight checklist.While United flight 93 waits on the ground for over 30 minutes for takeoff clearance, American Airlines flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175 have taken off from Boston and are in the air. Greengrass takes us to Air Traffic Control in Boston where a controller notes a problem with American 11. It is off-course and he can't contact the pilots on the flight.Back at Newark, the pilots of United 93 finally are cleared for takeoff. A familiar command is given. 'Flight attendants: prepare for takeoff.' For United 93, the point of no return has been reached.Greengrass masterfully unfolds the events of the morning taking us from the plane to the decision makers-turned-bystanders at air traffic control centers in Boston, Cleveland, and New York. Sliney and his crew desperately try to gather information as one hijack after another becomes apparent.This is a docudrama. However, what separates this film from the melodramatic fare that normally occupy this genre is the near-total lack of melodrama. Greengrass assembled a cast of largely unknown actors to dramatize his work. In fact, a sizable portion of his cast includes actual participants in the various ground locations to which we are taken, especially the aforementioned Sliney.However, the key cast member, which goes uncredited, is our memory (, or in the case of those not alive on that day, history). We remember what happened that day: in New York, in Washington, and on Flight 93.We sit and watch a meticulous and dramatic re-creation of what may have happened that morning on Flight 93. Since no one survived, we will never know what actually happened. However, Greengrass' interviews including anecdotal accounts of telephone calls from the plane, cockpit transmissions, and other events probably come the closest to giving us a sense of what happened that day.",10,1,3,11 December 2006
Saving Private Ryan," The greatest war film of all time!
","This is not an easy film to watch. Clearly, that was not its intent.  The story begins in current time at the Normandy American Cemetary in France.  An elderly man, followed by his family, walks as if compelled toward a single grave.  When he arrives there, his memory takes a different journey back to the beaches below on the date, 6 June 1944.From this moment on, especially for the ensuing 25 minutes, we are thrust into a story that, if it is hard to view, must certainly have been harder to live.  As the troop transports approach Omaha Beach, the eerie sense of calm gives way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most powerful statements ever put on film.When all is said and done, two brothers surnamed Ryan have died on the beaches of Normandy.  Another has died within a week in the Pacific.  It is discovered that a sole surviving brother has parachuted somewhere in France. It is the assignment of a survivor of Normandy and his platoon to find this brother and return him home.Director Steven Spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the surface and he does it once again with a film which is gut-wrenching.  However, the movie isn't all blood and gore; it's the story of young men and boys who fought and died to preserve a way of life and to eliminate the evil that they saw.Tom Hanks heads the cast as Capt. John Miller, the man who is given the mission to find Pvt. Ryan and bring him home.  In one sense, it works against the film to know that Matt Damon plays Pvt. James Ryan, but not so much that you can't appreciate the nuances which Miller and his platoon come up against time and time again during their mission.I agree with those who say that Spielberg puts us, his audience, into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening moments until the film's end.  It is a masterful piece of filmmaking that makes us feel that we have survived, although we were never in danger.Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.My vote:  11!!",10,0,0,19 December 1999
For Love of the Game," An excellent baseball movie; an above-average romantic comedy/drama
","The framework is a major league baseball game.  The memories are those of an aging pitcher, Billy Chapel, whose day is not going well at all.  His team, the Detroit Tigers are out of the pennant race and expected to lie down like a dog at the behest of the New York Yankees.  Moreover, the team has been sold and Chapel is expected to be traded to San Francisco when the sale is announced.  His lover, Jane Aubrey, has told him that she 'can't do this anymore' and she's headed to London and out of his life.  As his catcher, Gus Osinski, told him, it's just not his day.We're often told that baseball is like life; it meanders and goes along paths we may not expect.  And so it is with Billy Chapel, who is pitching his heart out while he relives his life.If you like baseball, you'll love this movie.  Kevin Costner, who co-produced, must bring something extra to movies about baseball because of his love of the game.  This film is one of those that truly has something for everyone and almost completely pulls it off.  I heartily recommend it.My vote: 7",8,0,0,18 September 1999
Joker," The best R-Rated comic book movie since 'Logan'
","Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix team for an unconventional comic book movie about a man and a city's descent into madness. There has been some discussion that this isn't a comic-book movie, but it undeniably is. It is an origin story.Arthur Fleck is a devoted son. He lives with his mother, but he is not dependent on her. Rather, he takes care of her, and he does it by working as a clown for hire. His job takes him to various places: for example, a music store going out of business and a children's hospital. Arthur also suffers from a (real-life) condition, which causes him to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate times. So much so that he carries a card that can explain it to people when he cannot.The construction of the story is masterful and subversive, and it requires the audience to think and deduce some of the action going on before them.
Phoenix's performance is nuanced and skilled. It captures some of the cartoon-like nature of The Joker without it being cartoony. In some form, you respect Fleck's struggle, and then he shocks you with his behavior. In a sense, Fleck has a code, and until the very end of the film, he never violates it.To tell you more would spoil the experience.Rated R by the MPAA for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images, Joker is the best comic book film with that rating since Logan. I highly recommend it.",9,1,2,14 October 2019
The Sixth Sense," A contrarian view
","I may want to see the movie again, if only to see if I missed anything during my nap.  As for the so-called surprise ending? Well, I won't reveal it here, but I will say that if you had your thinking cap on and were paying attention, it wasn't much of a surprise.My vote, subject to revision: 5 And I'm being kind.",5,1,2,18 September 1999
Contact," Is there life out there somewhere?
","Bear with me.A young girl is encouraged by her widower father to explore the world and beyond; soon left orphaned, she turns inward and relentlessly pursues the signs for intelligent life in the universe, only to be thwarted at every turn by an evil nemesis and yet be assisted by a mysterious shadowy figure with the power to make his machinations stick.  Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount Everest.However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.Jodie Foster is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him no less devout as a messenger for God's word.What evolves is a story that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.Lest you think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis, aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.One of the more endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.  From beginning to end, every part of her experience rang true.So, for a thoughtful way to spend 2Â½ hours, rent or purchase this film. You'll enjoy it.My Vote: 8",8,3,7,8 January 2000
