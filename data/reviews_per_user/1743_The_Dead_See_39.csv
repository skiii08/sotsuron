The Avengers," An amazing symphony of perfectly intertwined moving parts.
","I'm not the biggest fan of the setup movies for The Avengers. I think they're tremendously hit and miss, and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits. See, I like the odd comic book, but I'm certainly not a comic book fan. What I am a fan of is good, solid storytelling. You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh. Captain America spent far too long without any actual Captain America in it, and Thor - hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it. So back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that The Avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together, I didn't really get much of a sense of excitement. A few years later, as the end credits rolled on Thor, I pretty much made up my mind that The Avengers movie was going to screw up badly. If the industry couldn't pull off a good movie with just one hero in it, how could they ever pull off one with six?Then I heard that Joss Whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled. After all, I've seen him handle symphonies of characters before - with the Scooby Gang and the Serenity crew. If anyone could do it, Whedon could.But still I was wary. Just didn't want to let my expectations get too high - superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all. Maybe even Whedon would screw it up.Boy was I wrong.I don't think I've had this much fun at the cinema in years. Since the first Matrix movie in fact which was, what? Twelve years ago? (God I'm old). The Avengers had everything a good popcorn flick needs - major action setpieces, beautiful sfx, some neat and effective humor, yada yada yada. But none of that is what left my jaw on the floor. What really blew me away - and what compelled me to come here and write the first review I've done on IMDb in quite some time (years probably) - was just how perfectly done the script was. Every character is given their moment to shine, every interaction is perfectly in tune, this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony. Every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn't have taken out one single character - not even the arguably 'second tier' characters of Hawkeye and the Black Widow - without the whole thing coming apart. This is no Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, or Spider Man movie; because while those multi-protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining, the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess. Not so in The Avengers. Everything clicks so perfectly I can't even find the words to describe it. You'll just have to go see it for yourself to see what I mean.",9,6,13,11 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," I preferred Ang Lee's version
","Ang Lee's 2003 version of the Hulk had flaws aplenty: hulked out puppies, plastic-looking CGI, an inexplicably 'acid-trip' climax, and a baby-faced hulk design to name but a few. This reboot attempt neatly avoids many of those flaws but sadly introduces a whole new set of it's own.On the positive side, the relationship between Banner and Betty Ross is far more palpable and emotional here - thanks mostly to Norton and Tyler's fantastic acting. The hulk design itself just looks cooler, with more realistic CGI (though still far from perfect), and more adult facial features. There are some great cameos and worthy homage paid to the TV series that many of us enjoyed when we were kids. Tim Roth is excellent as always. In other words, director Louis Leterrier has definitely gotten some things right.For me though, this version falls down in two major aspects. First, there seems to be a lack of rising action in the script. The plot certainly escalates, but somehow the finale is no more exciting or interesting than the opening scenes. Each action scene, though fun in it's own right, does not increase the conflict, tension, or drama of the previous scenes. The result is a mechanistic emotional flatline. Put a simpler way, when two giant monsters are on-screen, battling and destroying a city, and I catch myself glancing at my watch, something, somewhere, ain't quite right.The biggest problem I have though, is that the essence of the Hulk is watered down here. Traditionally the Hulk is the raging, uncontrollable, dark side of man. And its strength and power increase according to the depths of its anger. The madder the Hulk gets, the stronger the Hulk gets. Ang Lee's Hulk did this - the bigger the threat, the bigger the Hulk! We saw him take out military helicopters and fighter jets as if they were children's toys. We saw him toss 70 tons of Abrams tank off to the horizon! This was the true essence of the Hulk. This new take, however, sees the Hulk diluted to a Disney version that flinches at bullets from a .45 handgun and hurts his head when he bumps it on a cave roof. The largest thing he handles is a small forklift truck.It's a small gripe, I suppose, but an important one. I would think that if a film about a creature with superhuman strength is to be better than it's predecessors, surely the creature should be... well... better than it's predecessors.In conclusion, if you want to see a better *film*, see this version; but if you want to see a better *Hulk*, then Ang Lee's version has that nailed.",6,3,7,16 June 2008
In Bruges," Very slow first act, but soon warms up into a fantastic, thoughtful movie
","In Bruges has flaws in abundance, particularly through the first 30 minutes where you are served a couple unlikeable characters, a very slow plot build, and bad dialogue with an extremely distracting overuse of the F word. For a while, you might be forgiven for wondering if you are watching something written by a fourteen year old boy trying (unsuccessfully) to emulate Tarantino or Guy Richie. I caught myself wondering if I should turn it off and do something better with my time instead. My wife commented on how bored she was.Fortunately for us, we bore through that terrible first half-hour and were subsequently rewarded with a movie that became increasingly enjoyable, fresh and... dare I say it... poignant, as it moved along. This is, for the most part, down to an amazing performance by Brendan Gleeson. Collin Farrel is good here, and Ralph Fiennes is great as usual; but it's Gleeson who steals every scene. And it's the honour and integrity of his character Ken that will linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled.",8,0,5,12 July 2008
Captain Marvel," Great acting. Great sfx. Not a great script.
","Sadly, the fact that this had eight writers really shows. It's script is dull and predictable in places and just messy in others - feeling very much cobbled together. You can almost hear the producers bickering over what gets included. Way too many cooks in the kitchen here.Worst of all it's missing a good character arc for the hero. One of my favorite elements in superhero movies is that spine tingling moment of self-belief or insight that enables them to finally reach their full powers and start kicking ass. These pinnacle moments really work when the character has believable self-doubt and the plot takes them logically to their full potential - think Neo in the first Matrix suddenly being able to 'see', or the moment in Thor Ragnarok where he realizes he doesn't need his hammer ('what were you the god of again?'), or Wonder Woman realizing she is the 'God Killer', not the sword. Captain Marvel attempts to do something like this with the 'always getting up' thing, but it just doesn't work. She's a badass from the opening moment and there's not really any believable or satisfying moment of insight for her that lets her overcome whatever was holding her back because, well, nothing was holding her back. Nothing satisfying at least. Her revelation just seems to happen randomly.I was super hyped up for the first Marvel female-led superhero movie (though I still kind of think it should have gone to Black Widow in fairness). Especially after DC rocked it with Wonder Woman, my line of thinking was 'if DC can do it that well after muffing up everything else, then maybe Marvel will totally blow us away'. Not the case unfortunately.On the positive side. Larson was great. The CGI de-aging of Fury and Coulson wasn't too distracting. And it had some funny moments. Also a touching Stan Lee opening animation and an after credits scene worth waiting around for.Oh and it passed the Bechdel test too.. so at least that's progress.I think the Russo brothers will really do great things with Captain Marvel in Endgame. Sadly, the smorgasbord of writers and directors here didn't.",5,2,9,12 March 2019
World War Z," Played safe to the point of being incredibly dull
","I need to get two things straight right up front here. The first is that although I loved the book, I have no qualms with a movie that diverges completely from the source material. The second is that I have nothing at all against PG-13 horror movies. While I see countless fellow horror fans complaining about PG-13s, some of my favorite (and personally most terrifying) horror movies have had that rating (The Others, The Ring, Skeleton Key, Jaws etc.)I went into WWZ knowing it diverged from the book vastly and not caring if it was PG 13, all I wanted was some half decent entertainment. Unfortunately, this film played it so safe that it was terminally dull - and I don't mean in terms of having no gore, I mean in terms of not being willing to take one single risk in the script. There's simply *nothing* here that wasn't, at best, obvious; or, at worst, dumb. It's one of those films where you figure out what the protagonist has to figure out looooong before he does so, then spend the rest of the film clock watching and waiting for him to have the a-ha moment. Sometimes those kind of films can be saved by fascinating character arcs, or perhaps by some interesting cinematography or direction or even by a rousing score, but again WWZ plays it horribly safe in all those aspects too. Not one moment of the music will stay in your head, not one shot will make you think 'nicely framed', not one character will have you saying 'I didn't know they were going to say that'.I can only imagine the things that went on behind the scenes to make this so horribly mundane. I suspect it involved a great deal of high level pressure to make it inoffensive enough to market to teenagers. But here's the thing - the very subject matter of the dead returning to life requires, nay *demands*, boldness - not necessarily gore or violence, but at the very least BOLDNESS - yet WWZ is as meek as a movie can get. You could show it to your Grandmother over tea and biscuits and she'd probably be just as bored as you would and forget everything that happened just as fast.I'm a big fan of Pitt. Usually he has the intensity to pull even a weak movie up to higher levels - but not so here. His character is the safest of the bunch, a doting dad with nary a flaw in sight. He wanders, set-jawed and honorable, from location to location without his character experiencing a single moment of intensity, internal conflict, or weakness. WWZ is a beige wall, it's a light gray cardigan, it's a glass of room temperature water, it's a placebo sugar pill. It won't offend you, excite you, upset you, fascinate you, thrill you or scare you in any way. It will enter your system and leave without trace or effect.",3,11,23,29 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Completely misses the tone of the enlightened future that Roddenberry envisioned...
","So it seems JJ Abrams has traded in too many lens flares for too many closeups. The working title of Star Trek Into Darkness could probably have been 'Chris Pine's Facial Pores'. Seriously JJ - there is such a thing as long and middle shots too you know, and what's more - if you use them - when you *do* use a closeup, it has more dramatic effect, just sayin'...Anyway, directorial style flaws aside, my big gripe with STID is that it's 'just another' sci-fi movie. What always set Trek apart was that Roddenberry created an enlightened future, a refreshing change of pace to most sci-fi, and the conflict therefore had to come from cleverer places. But with this reboot every character is constantly bickering, I frankly left the theater with a headache as if I'd just been to a teenage kids birthday party. I can get bickering, and grit, and violence from *any* sci-fi feature, and sadly now it seems like Trek has followed suit and lost its original edge. It's not until the very final minute where a little bit of the original Trek feel is re-established, but for me that was far too little, far too late.There's some giant plot holes too, if you're actually thinking about what's going on. It seems like Abrams hoped that if he put enough glitz and dazzle on the screen, most people would entirely miss the fact that they are there. I guess his gamble was correct, since the film is currently standing at an 8.4 IMDb score.It's not all bad. Benedict Cumberbatch is an incredible, intense villain and the film is worth seeing for his performance alone. And as with the first, the rest of the cast is exceptional. There's nothing wrong with the acting, music, or look of this film... just a lot wrong with the script and the tone of the whole thing. If you're not a Star Trek fan, you'll likely enjoy it... it's big, frenetic, popcorn munching silliness. But if you are a Trek fan, particularly of the quieter explorations of the human condition that TNG did so well, then you might be pretty disappointed.",5,163,268,20 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A fun ending doesn't make up entirely for the mess that precedes it
","Wolverine was like a sandwich made with good bread but poor filling. The opening and closing sequences were tasty, but the middle was pretty much an inedible waste of time.I'm not a big comic book reader so I can't comment on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of characters like Gambit or Deadpool. Whether they are done well or not is the least of the films worries. What i can say is this: Gone is the brash, bold Logan of the first movies - replaced by a rather bland 'all round nice guy' that's just not as fun to watch and far too predictable.None of the character motivations seem to make much sense... People are good guys one minute, bad guys the next, good guys again the next - without any truly believable concrete events to signal such changes in behaviour.Finally we're served up a hackneyed love affair subplot that's like a one-dimensional cardboard copy of every other romance plot out there. It's not fresh or engaging and the audience is consistently one step ahead of what's going to happen. Worse, there's no chemistry between the leads to suggest that they are really in love.On the plus side, Ryan Reynolds was great... for the three or four minutes he's in the movie, that is. Liev Schreiber looked like he was the only one having any fun and so managed to energize his portions of the movie and elevate them above the general blah of the other scenes. The sfx are impressive and the action scenes deliver on the high pace, but sadly without any depth or rationale to the characters the movie falls flat. It's definitely the worst of the series so far.",3,1,5,6 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Such a waste of potential.
","It could have portrayed the dark, stylised future war only briefly glimpsed in the first two movies... but it didn't.It could have been a brilliant character study of how John Connor achieves his near-mythical hero status... but it wasn't.It could have pitted humans against an enemy so fearful and unstoppable that the audience might have been driven to anxiety... but they weren't.It could have been a poignant prequel about a son sending his father to his own death for the greater good... but it wasn't.Coulda shoulda woulda.Instead you've got transformers and every other Michael Bay dreck ever pumped out, a little GI Joe in the mix, a script that is barely more involving than the average SyFy channel B movie, and a bunch of actors who look like they know the work they're involved in should be better but have given up hope.I know I shouldn't have expected anything else, after all - the director is the guy who brought us Charlie's Angels and the writers are the guys who brought us Catwoman. But what can I say, I tried to give it a chance.I hate to say it... but I think even if Michael Bay himself had gotten his hands on this it might have been better. McG is possibly the worst thing to happen to movies since Uwe Boll. A crying shame.",3,4,8,3 December 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," An over plotted mess
","I have to admit I enjoyed the final hour of POTC3, which was a fun extended swashbuckling sea battle.But sadly I had to wait through almost two hours of convoluted, confusing, boring and directionless film to get there.There is a line in POTC3 where a character says of Jack Sparrow 'Do you think he plans it or just makes it up as he goes along'. Well, I don't know about Cap'n Jack... but it certainly seems like the screenwriters (there must've been dozens of them judging by the inconsistencies) made it up as they went along and didn't feel the need to go back afterwards to tidy up the mess they'd made.And it's such a pity too. Because the poignant ending and fantastically conceived final battle could have been the crown on the top of a masterpiece; but instead ends up as the cherry on the top of a burnt and mostly inedible cake.",3,3,11,29 May 2007
Oblivion," An entertaining and thought-provoking sci-fi drama, mis-marketed as an action movie.
","I truly enjoyed Oblivion. It's one of those increasingly rare sci-fi movies that takes the more courageous visual route of being 'clean and polished' instead of the boring trend of gritty, blue-filtered futurescapes. It's post apocalyptic but it's gorgeous, the downed landmarks of the western world look like tourist attractions in the morning sunlight, the technologies and habitats look sparkling and well maintained. It's a very bright and airy movie visually and the cinematography is stunning throughout.It's not only courageous in it's visual style either. The story is balls to the wall sci-fi, unhampered by human antagonists. We're talking alien minds, memory wipes, laser guns and combat drones. I won't go so far as to call the story original - in fact it seems quite derivative of several popular sci-fi films. There are shades of The Matrix Revolutions, Moon, Total Recall, The Island, Logans Run and others. But instead of throwing these homages together into a mashup that just makes you want to watch the original films instead, it blends them seamlessly and emerges as a solid and entertaining movie in its own right.It's not perfect though. I have three gripes with it. First and foremost is that it was horribly mismarketed as a sci-fi actioner and it isn't. There are a couple of decent (but not outstanding) action set pieces but the majority of Oblivion is a moment-of-awakening drama and a love story, with thematic elements of what it means to be mortal and to die well running through it. Its going to disappoint the hell out of kids who go in looking for big bangs. This is much closer to 'Moon' in pace than something like 'Star Trek Into Darkness'.My second gripe is that, as thought-provoking as it was, I can't help but think there are some hefty plot holes in there. I would have to watch it a few times over to pull them out clearly but my gut instinct tells me they are there. Most of them are explicable if you extrapolate far enough with your own imagination, but it would have been a stronger film if the concepts, plot elements and character motivations were more watertight.Third gripe is a minor one, but significant enough for me - Morgan Freeman was massively underused. His character is a cardboard cutout cliché of a rebel leader and could have been so much more interesting and complex.The gripes aren't enough to bring a good movie down though, and Oblivion is a really good movie. A grown up, engaging, speculative tale that's stunning to look at. It will take a place on my sci-fi DVD shelf.",7,3,6,6 September 2013
Man of Steel," Loses itself when the action starts
","In a nutshell, MOS is a little schizophrenic. The first half is beautiful, touching, well-written and goes on an engaging exploration of this iconic figure; but when the action starts it's almost as if a different writer and director took the helm. Shaky cam simultaneously adds to the sense of you being there in the middle of things but also makes it so you actually can't see what the hell is going on. The majority of the second half of MOS is basically a blurry cloud of dust and flames with occasional glimpses of the characters in the middle of it all.The first half though - was a clean 9/10. The destruction of Krypton was a visual feast, the letting go of Cal El by his parents was genuinely touching and I even felt a tear welling. The film smartly jumped straight into adult-superman's life and presented his backstory with Jonathan and Martha as well-done flashbacks. Michael Shannon was incredible and sympathetic as Zod. Kevin Costner was simply brilliant (stole this movie imo). It was all good until - well, I dunno what happened really, I guess the suits up on high decided that they had to meet a quota of destruction or something, so they just abandoned all story, characterization, and theme and went for the big light show.Big, BIG shame.The closing few minutes of the movie, do redeem it a little, but after the hour of shaky cam headache that came before it, it's too little too late to save everything. Two major elements that made the Reeve movie so memorable are missing here. First, Lois knows who Kent is from the outset, so there's none of that tension of his discovery to be explored. Second, there's not even a single bar of homage to the iconic music in the theme of MOS. I understand that Snyder and Nolan were trying for a brave new direction but to remove those two supporting structures without replacing them with something similarly strong is just asking for the roof to come down.All said and done though, I'm glad I saw it, it was mostly enjoyable, and being a superhero movie fanatic I'll probably own it on DVD as soon as the price drops to reasonable levels. But if you think it's going to be as solid or spectacular as The Avengers you'll be sorely disappointed.",6,13,26,18 June 2013
Knowing," Warning: GOD movie
","Knowing was a worthwhile film up until the last thirty minutes. It had a decent intriguing plot line, laced with some great special fx setpieces and some genuinely creepy scenes too.Then it became a Christian flick. Pushing a dose of religious nonsense that no one but a hardcore fundamentalist could stomach without wretching. Innocent children with their little white bunny rabbits saved by glowing angels while doubting scientist father is left to burn on earth with the rest of the heathen scum. Said children become Adam and Eve on alien planet. Yah. No thanks.I swear this sort of thing should be illegal. They have to label films accordingly by law if they have sex or violence in them. Why should they not have to label them 'religious propaganda' as well when they contain such material which is, lets face it, extremely offensive to some viewers.",1,6,14,16 July 2009
No Country for Old Men," No Ending for These Men
","This film has no ending. I mean it. The third act has no resolution, no climax, no tying up of threads, no questions answered, no drama, no action, no character-arc completion, just... nothing. It's made all the more terrible by the fact that the first two acts are very well done and worth watching. For almost two hours we are led on an intelligent, tense cat and mouse chase, then suddenly - POOF, the Coen brothers make all the good stuff go away in a single moment. The viewer is left thinking two things: 'what the F**K?' and 'I was enjoying that until...' It's a bit like lighting the fuse on a really big firework, standing back - tense with anticipation - watching it sail up into the air and then... it fizzles into the night sky without so much as a sound. A dud. A complete and utter dud.You don't need any spoiler alerts here as there is no story resolution. Aside from one character, you actually aren't even told what happens to any of the other people you just invested two hours in. Oh, and by the way, don't follow that bag of money, because you never even find out who gets it. Don't follow that good guy vs. bad guy plot line, because neither of them ever confront the other - oh except on a telephone call about two thirds of the way in. Don't follow that... Oh wait, there aren't any other subplots to follow anyway.I suppose I can't entirely blame the Coens as I'm aware this came from a novel. I haven't read the novel but if it ends as unsatisfyingly as the movie did then this man has no business calling himself a storyteller.",5,18,35,21 March 2008
District 9," A wild, gruesome, kinetic epic with a big heart.
","I went into District 9 expecting a 2 hour mockumentary but I got far more than I bargained for. The first half hour or so is indeed an entertaining mockumentary but then (fairly suddenly and shockingly) the film shrugs the pretence and moves into a more straightforward story, though still on hand-held camera for the most part.There haven't been too many films in the past few years that really hit a satisfying note with me on both an emotional level and also on a level of pure (or some may say puerile) entertainment, but District 9 did both. You can watch it as an effective, thought provoking commentary on the nature of segregation, poverty and mans inhumanity to man; or you can watch it as a violent (and oh is it violent!) video game with possibly the best special effects I've seen on a movie screen since the original Jurassic Park.Fair warning, it's a bloody movie - the third act is filled with decapitation, dismemberment and exploding bodies; but it's also filled with intelligence and a poignant, powerful message that there might just be hope for compassion left in us yet.I won't go so far as to call District 9 a masterpiece, but it was a tremendously well-executed, occasionally moving, always fascinating movie. You could do far, far worse than dropping twelve bucks on this one.",8,1,4,26 September 2009
Insidious," If you've seen a lot of ghost movies you certainly won't find this as scary as some reviews are claiming
","After all the hype I was pretty keen to see Insidious. It seemed right up my alley; supernatural movies are my favorite subgenre of horror and I actively seek them out, from the mainstream right through the low-budget indies. But ultimately Insidious was a disappointment.Most people who didn't enjoy the movie cite that the third act borders on absurd. While that's partially true (there were actually points where I felt like the protagonist was being attacked by The Crow and Darth Maul, and the explanation is a bit of a stretch) that's not the reason the movie didn't work for me.The reason it didn't work for me is that everything about it was 'overcooked'. Even the opening credits, which could have been understated and dread-inducing, were diminished by CGI effects. It pulled out all the good old tropes that us ghost movie fans look for - the kids drawings, the creepy tune on the gramophone, the gentle buildup of sinister events etc. - but in each case it was just handled too heavily, too evidently, too gaudily to sustain the foreboding atmosphere that drives the best of these types of movies.The only two genuinely creepy scenes were already revealed in the trailer and everything else unfortunately served to detract from those moments by being so heavy handed. It begins by masquerading as a ghost movie for adults, but don't buy into it... by the third act you'll probably agree that this was clearly targeted at a younger, dare I say it, sure I dare - ADD - generation.I see what James Wan was trying to do with Insidious, I really do - it was a brave attempt to update Poltergeist for a new generation - but now I realize it takes someone with a finer touch than him to pull off a feat that big.",4,0,2,16 July 2011
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Not great, but pleasant, light, and will leave you feeling a little inspired
","I must admit I was hoping for a bit more from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The trailers made it out to be one of those potentially life-changing drama/comedies that can leave you on a real high when they hit the mark (I'm thinking Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Good Will Hunting, Up in the Air etc.).TSLOWM comes close, but doesn't quite make it. It's more like, let's say, The Truman Show or Miss Pettigrew lives for a day, in that it's a perfectly good way to kill two hours but it might also frustrate you because it could have been much better with just a little tweaking. Mitty's character arc, from daydreamer to life-liver isn't as clever or as subtle as it could have been. His moments of realization aren't quite as high on the emotional scale as they should be. Also the romance between Stiller and Wiig could have been a lot more exciting, it seemed as if they were always going to get together without question - there was very little anticipation or sexual tension involved.Gripes aside, it's a beautiful looking movie, full of scenic landscapes and nice transitions. And it's got a good heart and a sensible core message, so unless you're a pessimist of the highest order it should at least leave you feeling a little happier and more inspired than before you watched it.",6,0,0,9 June 2014
The Hurt Locker," One of the most disappointing modern war movies, not deserving of such a high IMDb score
","Being a fan of all modern war movies; from the action-packed thrillers of 'Black Hawk Down' and 'The Kingdom', to the fascinating and more gently-paced examinations of 'Jarhead' and 'Home of the Brave'; I was really eager to see The Hurt Locker. Word on the street was good, the IMDb score was high, not to mention that I've enjoyed all Kathryn Bigelow's previous movies and I find Jeremy Renner very likable in anything I've seen him in...So what a surprise it was when The Hurt Locker turned out to be uninspiring and dull-as-dishwater. If Bigelow's intention was to make the viewer feel as restless and bored as the guys behind the wire, then she succeeded. If her intention was in any way to thrill us, or to give us a glimpse into the life and mind of a modern soldier, I'd say she failed miserably.The main problem with The Hurt Locker is that it feels like a bunch of (reasonably competent) scenes strung together with no rhyme or reason. There is no plot to speak of, and very little attempt is made to build audience identification with any of the characters. Every character leaves the movie just as ambiguous and unlikeable as when they entered it.Some other reviewers have mentioned the inaccuracies. Not being a soldier myself I have no idea exactly how operations are run in the middle east... but I will say I harbored strong suspicions throughout the movie that it was wildly inaccurate. Rogue team leaders gallivanting around in the night? IED disposal experts that were also fully trained sniper units? I just wasn't buying it.I'm truly surprised this film has such a high IMDb score. If you want action, it doesn't really deliver - go get The Kingdom instead. If you want good drama try Jarhead instead. The Hurt Locker is a poor substitute for a whole host of much better movies.",4,10,19,24 January 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Silly, fun, and pretty to look at
","You know, I could easily examine Rise of the Silver Surfer from the pessimistic side and claim that it's script was fatally flawed, that it was full of improbable 'deux-ex-machina's', or that it was hammy and clichéd.But after a summer of bloated, incoherent screenplays (Pirates 3), passive and dull screenplays (Shrek 3), or sugary and self-indulgent screenplays (Spiderman 3), F4-ROTSS was positively refreshing. It was a straight, coherent story, with its tongue firmly in it's cheek, and it didn't over-complicate things with too many characters or too many plot turns.ROTSS knows exactly what it is - a simple, special effects driven, comic book panel - and sticks to its guns. It's dumb fun, fast and pretty, and it never gets much deeper than that. But in all honesty, what else are you looking for in a superhero summer blockbuster? I thought it hit the mark perfectly and I found it made for a thoroughly enjoyable night at the movies.",8,1,4,16 June 2007
Evil Dead," Wow. Good horror is alive and well.
","They say it's a good thing to know thyself, and if I'm brutally honest with myself, I can admit I'm a jaded, pessimistic, old man when it comes to horror. I've watched it for four decades and seen the best and the worst. I've read it since a child - first the Witching Hour comics and then every novel I could find. For the past decade I've written it and published it. Horror has woven its way through my entire life and it's hard to put something in front of me that makes me sit up and take notice. It's even more difficult when that thing is a 'reboot' of one my childhood favorites.So when I heard of the remake of Evil Dead I face-palmed and went on a ten minute rant about how awful it would be, how disrespectful to the source material, how mainstream, how dumbed-down, and so on and so forth. When I saw the trailer a few months later I was equally cynical - it just looked like a gorefest, a well done one perhaps, but just a gorefest nonetheless.Well, I eat my words.What I just saw was, I think, possibly as good a movie as a reboot could possibly be. Evil Dead managed to create its own original tone and atmosphere while still paying respectful nods to the original. The tree rape is still there, and so is the Raimi-esque montage directing style that made The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II so much fun. There's a smart and particularly gruesome homage to the chainsaw arm. The soundtrack is old-school enough to evoke nostalgia but the sound effects are contemporary and brilliantly done (even the slightly ripped off siren sound from Silent Hill is well used). Best of all the sweeping camera movements through the woods are retained, along with the original sound effect (or a very worthy duplicate) and I think most horror fans would agree that iconic image of the camera roaring through the forest was one of the things that made the early films special.So in terms of paying homage to the original, I'd say this won on every level. Any more homage and it would have been an unnecessary remake, any less and there wouldn't have been a reason to call it 'Evil Dead' at all. It hit an optimum balance in my opinion.But how about as an original film in its own right? Well, yes it's strong there too - very strong in fact. Over the years I had a sort of working theory that gore and fear were mutually exclusive. It seemed that the more grue you splashed onto the screen, the further any atmosphere, tension or scare factor receded. This is why many of the films that have terrified me most through the years (The Exorcist, Session 9, The Changeling, Lake Mungo etc.) have all been practically bloodless. But Evil Dead 2013 broke new ground for me. The gore level was off the scale, and tremendously realistic, yet director Fede Alvarez managed, somehow, to maintain a level of creepiness and dread throughout. The film is actually scary. Not off-the-charts scary perhaps, but scary enough to get under your skin a little, and considering the amount of blood in this movie (literally buckets of it) that was a big surprise to me and a humbling reminder to not try to make generalizing theories about movies.Horror aside, the underlying story impressed me too. It was shallow, as is to be expected from a movie that is principally about demons slaughtering young people in the woods, but there was enough common sense and humanity there to elevate it above the usual drivel. These teens have a valid and serious reason for isolating themselves in the woods - an attempt to get one of them off drugs for good - which lent a much more interesting perspective than the usual 'yo let's go to our aunts cabin and get drunk and have sex y'all' cliché. The brother and sister relationship between David and Mia is believable and in places quite poignant. Even the throwaway friends were given enough personality and backstory to legitimately feel like they belonged in the peer group. In short, it was well thought out enough that I didn't have to spend the buildup of the movie rolling my eyes at the ill-fitting jock/slut/nerd/token minority/junkie/quiet girl mixture that most movies of this ilk seem to phone in. This review is getting much longer than my usual quick takes, which I suppose says something about how much the film impressed me. There's one more thing I want to mention before I sign off and it's the most surprising thing of all: somehow - amidst all the doom and gloom and blood and guts and dead-pan playing - the movie turned out to be FUN. I don't quite know how Alvarez pulled that off but I'm sure gonna be on the lookout for his future work. Evil Dead is a respectful, gruesome, scary and fun reboot. Easily one of the best horrors of recent times and as soon as I get $20 spare, it will be right there on my DVD shelf alongside the originals.",8,3,15,21 July 2013
Paranormal Activity," Don't buy the hype. If you really want to be scared watch 'Noroi' or 'Rec' instead.
","Paranormal activity wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best of the 'found footage' subgenre of horror either. And it most certainly isn't 'the scariest movie of the decade' as I've heard claimed. It doesn't even come close to the Blair Witch Project, lacking the intelligence and the longevity of the final sequence altogether.In fact, it's just a pretty average hand-held style movie with one or two creepy moments towards the end. Nothing that will keep you up (unless you only watch Dora The Explorer) and nothing particularly inspired. The acting is proficient enough and the night-time setpieces are samey but well done. It brought to mind the old BBC Ghostwatch mockumentary that was in fact much scarier. I would put this one on a par with the lower level found footage movies like 'The Last Broadcast' or St. Francisville Experiment.' If you want to be really scared by works in this genre I recommend 'REC' or 'Noroi: The Curse' -- both of which leave Paranormal Activity in the dust.",3,0,1,23 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Self-important, over-dramatic, uninspired.
","It's hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie. After all, it's well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues.Problem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama? I like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan...But lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment? Sadly, not this much. And I'm at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing). The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of over-enthusiastic, and apparently very easily-pleased, youngsters just reached movie-going age and skewed the results. Go figure.",6,15,29,26 July 2008
Taken," Commando for the 2000's
","I've been relatively disappointed with the state of action movies for the past couple of years. They seem to have been relying more and more heavily on perversely complex plots, overdone cgi, and contemporary 'gimmicks' like shaky cam while missing the simple point of exciting the audience. But not Taken. Taken gets it just right.Those over 25 might recall that almost a quarter decade ago, Schwarzenegger (still in his fun prime - not yet his shameful republican deficit years) starred in 'Commando' as John Matrix - an almost superhuman all-out good-guy who must rescue his daughter from the forces of evil that have abducted her. What follows is an unbelievable, violent, and fun guilty pleasure for the viewer. It occurred to me while watching Taken that this movie is really just an updated version of Commando - a little more realistic in terms of plot perhaps, but no less fun for it.Neeson is a superhero in this film, untouchable and unbeatable, it's supremely satisfying to see the simplistic bad-guys get their violent comeuppance in various gruesome ways. Dare I say, it's truly refreshing to see a return to the good old action basics that have been so apparently absent in recent years.",7,0,0,18 July 2009
Mama," Completely spoiled by awful and over-used cgi
","Rented Mama from a local Redbox this weekend, grabbed a bowl of popcorn, turned out the lights, been looking forward to this since I missed it at the theaters.It started off beautifully, quietly setting up a solid tragic back story that flowed into opening credits that had a fairytale, mythic quality to them. It had the fingerprint of a Guillermo Del Toro masterpiece like The Devil's Backbone, even though he only produced it.It retained its strength through the whole first half, with kid actors that weren't annoying and Jessica Chastain putting in a pretty awesome performance as a conflicted caregiver being forced to grow up.Aaaaand then... cgi.And not even subtle cgi either... like, freaking 'nothing was real on the whole screen' cgi. By the end I felt like I was watching a damn cartoon. Does this seriously not bother younger audiences today? I don't get it, here we had a potentially terrifying, potentially poignant film completely destroyed by cgi yet it gets decent reviews.So yeah, if you don't mind abysmal (and we're talking, SyFy channel level abysmal) cgi plastered all over your final act, then you might enjoy Mama. As it stands, I give it 7 stars for the first half and deduct 3 of them for the second half. 4/10.",4,8,15,10 June 2013
Super 8," A kids film, perfectly done in the style of the mid 80's. Expect that and you'll enjoy it.
","I think the marketing strategy in part is working against Super 8 - preventing it from getting better reviews. For months we were fed mysterious viral footage online and teased with images of something huge and terrifying beating it's way out of military train wreck.Obviously when you set a film up like that you're going to get a lot of disappointed reviews from audience members who expected something a little more adult, more serious... more... Cloverfield.But let me tell you what this film is, straight up: it's a kids film.It's 100% nostalgia - a pleasant trip back to the mid 80's. If you fondly remember The Goonies, The Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, ET, Gremlins and their ilk then you're going to dig this. There's no attempt at an evolution or updating of those styles - the film is pure homage and JJ Abrams nailed it.There's a certain sadness here for the thirty-somethings that grew up in the 80's - a realization that those old films you loved weren't *that* great and were in fact, kind of shallow and cheesy - as is this one. But there's also a big deep breath of fresh air - a momentary relief from the current trends of rapid editing, shaky cam, perversely convoluted plots and arcless characters. This is good, old fashioned three-act, well-arced storytelling. The camera, for the most part, is firmly fixed on a tripod. There's a simple love story. Some simple parent-child relationship stuff, and a clear theme of moving on from loss. I for one found myself grinning from ear to ear through most of it.",7,1,2,27 June 2011
Jack Reacher," An enjoyable episode of Law and Order with a car chase and a gun fight thrown in
","As condescending as it sounds, that summary title really is the best way I can describe how I felt about Jack Reacher. It's an enjoyable episode of Law and Order with a car chase and a gun fight thrown in. I hesitate to call it an action movie because the car chase and gun fight really are the only action sequences. The rest is a sort of noirish police procedural... a very straightforward bad guy vs good guy kind of deal. The strange thing is while Tom Cruise didn't feel big or imposing enough to play Reacher, this film also didn't seem big enough to hold someone like Cruise. It's a strange dynamic and it doesn't spoil the movie in any way, but all the way through I couldn't help but feel like I was watching something that wasn't quite spectacle enough for a celebrity of Cruise's status. Still, it's a rock solid thriller, with a dash of cheesy superdetective thrown in. The action scenes are gritty and realistic, the fight choreography is satisfying. I enjoyed myself with this one and I can't help but think it might have done better at the cinema with a more enticing title.",7,2,4,19 August 2013
The Happening," Made me rethink my status as an M. Night Shyamalan fan
","If you happen to be a fan of Fox's Family Guy, you may have seen the episode where they make fun of Stephen King's later works. The scene depicts Stephen King sitting with his agent/editor. Stephen says: 'and now for my 300th novel, a couple are attacked by a...' he looks around the room frantically and picks up the desk lamp... 'a giant uh... lamp monster... Ooooooo!'.The editor replies 'you're not even trying anymore are you?' then he sighs and says 'okay, when can I have it?' 'The Happening' made me think that a scene similar to this must have played out between M Night and his production companies. This movie is to Shyamalan what Star Wars Episode 1 was to George Lucas - a sincere disappointment.It was such a shocking departure from his usually tight scripts, tense direction, and haunting atmosphere. It was a clunky, awkward movie - brimming with bad exposition dialog, confused character motivation, blatant plot holes, and seemingly first-take acting. On leaving the cinema, my wife and I commented that it seemed more like a first-draft screenplay than a polished, finished version... like something that was hacked out overnight to meet a deadline.There are a few interesting concepts, and a couple of touching scenes, and as usual in Shyamalan's works, the music was haunting. But for the most part it was simply awful. Up until now I was a big fan of Unbreakable, Signs, The Sixth Sense, and Lady in the Water. I even thought everyone's favorite M. Night movie to hate - the Village - was okay. But 'The Happening' is truly best avoided. A crying shame.",2,5,11,19 June 2008

Hancock," I guess some people just can't take a switch in tone.
","I've read a lot of the reviews here complaining about the film flagging in its final act. I respectfully disagree.Hancock is most definitely DIFFERENT in it's last half - it drops off the comedy significantly and introduces some fascinating superhero mythology that is almost like an ancient Greek myth in its context. It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kid-friendly summer blockbuster that they are. However, both halves have their own merits - the first being the humour, and the second being the (almost tragic) origin mythos. I suspect if you are prepared for the switch in tone, rather than shocked when it arrives, you might enjoy Hancock as much as I did.",8,292,428,5 July 2008
WALL·E," Possibly one of the most important children's films of our time
","Stunning animation, charming comedy, cute characters, yeah yeah... yada yada yada... you've heard all that already if you've read through any of this board. But if you look past the groundbreaking animation and the brilliantly-conceived characters, you're left with a film that is drilling some truly important messages into the heads of our children.WALL-E manages to successfully communicate several key themes about the environment, over reliance on technology, and love. It does so on a level that impacts both the adults and the children in the audience. It's an admirable and responsible effort to steer young and impressionable minds onto a decent track. Bravo Pixar. Bravo!",9,3,7,5 July 2008
Centurion," Reasonably entertaining pseudo-historical actioner but don't expect big battles
","I still haven't figured out if I'm a fan of Neil Marshall. I love 'The Descent' and 'Dog Soldiers' to bits, but neither 'Doomsday' or 'Centurion' really hit the mark for me. Neither of them were *bad* but neither really got far above average either.The first thing mention is that if you're looking for big battles involving hundreds of extras or thousands of CGI characters, look elsewhere. One might expect that a film specifically about the loss of the mythical Roman ninth legion to the warrior tribes of Scotland would involve some kind of grand scale clash, but there's no such thing offered here. Centurion is about a handful of survivors from the legion fleeing across the bleak highland mountains while group of vengeful Picts pursues them and picks them off one by one. At it's core it's very similar to a backwoods slasher type flick such as Wrong Turn or Deliverance.It's an entertaining enough scenario though, and Michael Fassbender and Olga Kurylenko put in fine performances as the principle adversaries. The films moves along at a good old click and there's not much time to get bored. There are two things that Centurion does in droves, though, that I personally don't enjoy. The first is the use of a 45 degree shutter angle during every action scene to give it that 'hyper kinetic' look that Spielberg introduced us to in Saving Private Ryan (where it worked) and Ridley Scott followed up with in Gladiator (where it barely worked). But Marshall, as talented as he is, is no Spielberg or Scott, and the hyper kinetics in Centurion yanked me out of the movie every time an action scene began. It's a big shame because otherwise the action was pretty well choreographed and satisfyingly violent.The second thing I don't like (and there is NO movie where this technique works) is CGI bloodletting. Centurion strives to go one step further than, say, Braveheart in the brutality of its combat. Limbs and heads go flying left right and center. It's perhaps not quite as over the top as 'Ironclad' but it's close. The dude in me likes this of course, but give me blood bags and prosthetics any day. The CGI blood and dismemberment of Centurion seemed simply unrealistic and distracting.Despite these two pet peeves of mine, Centurion is still a silly, fun flick that unashamedly eschews historical accuracy in favor of good old action entertainment. It could have been much, much better though - with a bit of a screenplay polish and more careful directing choices - so I can't in good conscience give it much more than a 6/10.",6,0,4,31 August 2013
The Conjuring," And the worst offender for cheap jump scares award goes to...
","The Conjuring has solidified my theory on the films of James Wan - he makes movies aimed squarely at teenagers. I can't knock him for that, it's a pretty solid success strategy and it makes perfect sense that they've slated him as the director for Fast and Furious 7 - an entire franchise aimed at teenagers. I can't help but think it's a shame though, because the guy does have talent. You can see glimpses of it shining through the cheap jump scares that litter every frame of The Conjuring. He clearly knows how to use his framing in unique and interesting ways, he clearly knows his history of cinematic trends, and he's got a Spielbergian knack for throwing in much needed light moments. It's like he wants to make a scary movie for adults - one with an actual story and atmosphere - and he knows he's got the ability to do it, but either he's too afraid to take the risk of it failing at the box office due to teenage attention deficit, or pressure from higher-ups is reigning him in. The Conjuring isn't a bad ghost movie, it's just not the kind of ghost movie I can get into personally. I need more to chew on than gimmickry or my attention starts to wander, and by the tenth time I'd watched someone in a night gown creep anxiously towards a strange noise, boy was it wandering. Lili Taylor and Vera Farmiga are very good in their roles and I would say it's perfect for something to watch with a group of talkative friends and giggle at the jumps; but if you want something to engage you on an individual basis with a story or character development, this is about as far away as you can get. Those of us who want a thickening tension, slowly revealingly backstory or sense of progress in the plot will have to go back to watching movies like The Changeling, Session 9, The Others, or Burnt Offerings instead. Maybe the next ghost movie James Wan makes, he'll be a little braver and make one for us instead of the kids.",5,3,9,20 July 2013
The Wolverine," The dullest and sloppiest entry into the whole X Men canon.
","I'm gonna come straight out the gate and say The Wolverine was the dullest and most amateurishly wrought entry in the entire X Men canon. I didn't particularly like 'Origins' but it had a whole lot more entertainment value to it than this lackluster attempt, so that's saying something. Jackman is fine as usual, which is pretty impressive given the material he got to work with here. Unfortunately he gets to spend most of the movie getting wounded and then waking up on various beds and makeshift operating tables and that's about it. It seems like a huge attempt was made to make the movie grittier and more complex than the simple soap opera that was Origins, but in doing so director James Mangold completely overshoots the mark and throws the baby out with the bathwater. What's left is an extraordinarily dull work that had me looking at my watch and even considering leaving the theater. Considering this is a superhero movie, there's a surprising lack of superheroes. In fact, other than the rather lame villain - the viper - there are no mutants in the film other than Wolverine, and he spends 90% of the movie without his powers.While there are a couple of action setpieces (a fight on top of a train that's a little too close to the first Mission Impossible climax for comfort, and a fight with a Samurai suit of armour that's a little too close to the Iron Man climax for comfort), The Wolverine never seems to build up enough steam to get really rolling. Just when it seems a high point might be in view, Mangold throws in another half hour of fairly forgettable drama.To cap it all off, there's an after credits scene that actually has the opposite affect as intended. It's a good after credits scene, and yes it tickles the fancy for the next installment, but what it also does is remind you how lacking the film you just saw was in just about every department. If James Mangold is let anywhere near the next entry, I'll be waiting for it to hit cable before bothering.",3,1,9,28 July 2013
Signs," Finally, a frightening movie!
","This has to be one of the first movies in years to realize that the less you see of the monster - the scarier the experience. Although Spielberg's 'Jaws' employed this technique so well, most films these days took the other route - showing us the evil in it's full glory instead. As a result, in these films the fear factor is lost under mountains of animatronics or cgi.
In Signs, we are kept in complete suspense for the majority of the movie - An inhuman leg here... a flitting shadow there... Our minds do the rest for us. And it works fantastically.Signs takes the alien invasion plotline and examines it from a whole new angle. M. Night knew that he didn't need to show us huge ufo's blowing up the white house. Instead, he stays with one small family in one small town throughout. Our only link to the outside world is the occasional tv report. Yet still you get the sense that something terrible is happening in the world outside - all over the planet. And you feel closer to the action than you ever will in event movies of the same theme. When Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are trapped in the middle of their own house - with shadows of creatures moving past the windows looking for a way in - you are right there beside them. Because Signs depends so much on the emotional intellect of its audience, those with little sense of imagination will probably be dissapointed with its underplayed manner. But those who can't walk past an open doorway at night without conjuring some skeletal creature in the darkness beyond will probably find it the most frightening experience they have ever had.",7,0,1,3 August 2002
Godzilla," A string of ridiculous coincidences derails all the fun.
","Godzilla had two things going for it, the special effects were nice, and Bryan Cranston. Unfortunately Cranston's character is killed off after about fifteen minutes and the pretty visuals just aren't enough to hold the rest of the movie together. The writing is the true villain here, the concept itself is somewhat flawed, with Godzilla basically being an jerk who seems hellbent on stopping the Mutos from having babies no matter what with little to no reason; but it's the string of ridiculous coincidences that really puts the nail in the coffin, not the least of which is that the protagonist hilariously finds himself wherever Godzilla is no matter where he goes on the globe almost to the point of it being like a spoof. Additional bad writing sees our intrepid hero as being a trained paratrooper, nuclear weapons specialist and wearing a variety of other lifetime-career hats too - pretty impressive for a twenty-something. At its most laughable moments the military play hide and seek with a skyscraper sized monster which, although it shakes the ground with the slightest fart, seemingly also has the capability to tiptoe around like a ballet dancer. The finale, a fight between GZ and the two Mutos is a little bit of fun. But putting a cherry on top of a turd still doesn't make it pleasant eating. All in all, it was an improvement over Emmerich's terrible attempt at Godzilla, but it still sucked.",3,4,10,18 May 2014
Life," Flawed, but still entertaining and horrifying
","I went in to LIFE with zero expectations and ended up quite enjoying myself.No, scratch that. 'Enjoying' isn't really a term that can be applied to this movie (unless bleak and horrifying downer scenarios are your fetish), so let's say I was 'entertained' instead.It's your standard 'Alien'/'The Thing' scenario - small group of people stuck in an isolated location with an unpleasant lifeform - That's pretty much it. However, 'Life' doesn't come close to creating the atmosphere or tension of either Alien or The Thing. The reason for this is, I think, in the characters who weren't near as empathic or sympathetic as those in the aforementioned masterpieces. The big flaws here lie in some illogical character decisions and some phoned in acting.Where Life does succeed, though, is in three areas: 1) It gives us a believable and horrific creature, that thanks to its early introduction scene makes you uneasy every time it appears on the screen. The sense of danger was very palpable and well handle. 'Calvin' had me squirming for sure.2) Wonderful sfx, most notably an impressive single tracking shot that opens the movie.3) And this is the big one for me - it dared to do something that even Alien and The Thing didn't do - to not have a happy or even ambiguously hopeful ending. For this I give it major props. If you're wondering if Life should be categorized as a sci fi or as a horror, by the time the credits roll, it's firmly, unequivocally horror.I'd recommend it to all sci fi horror fans - If you liked Event Horizon, Pandorum, The Blob, Europa Report, Infini, Leviathan, deep Star Six, Deep Rising, Titan Find, Splinter, Sunshine etc. then you're probably going to enjoy this. It's not Alien or The Thing, but fortunately it's not Harbinger Down or Supernova either.",7,5,12,10 April 2017
Cloud Atlas," Like a clumsy, bloated version of 'The Fountain'
","If you're going to tell a story about how actions and intent ripples through centuries and across the universe, you need a deft and subtle hand, which I don't think is something the Wachowski's can list in their strong suits.In 'The Fountain', Darren Aronofsky achieved this with astonishing success - creating a masterpiece that stands strong on first time viewing and only gets richer and more complex with each viewing. I'd recommend you watch that instead of Cloud Atlas. It's cleaner, smarter, and far more touching.By comparison, if I had to describe Cloud Atlas in just two words, all I could really think of would be 'Clumsy' and 'Bloated'. It's certainly spectacular, in both vfx and makeup, and it has enough high points (usually involving Jim Broadbent) to not make it a complete waste of time at all. But considering its grand ambitions and theme it just didn't have the toolbox to pull off the job.",5,3,6,24 June 2013
Cube," Enough to give you nightmares for a week.
","I have read so many people moaning about this films lack of closure, failure to answer some of the questions it poses. In my opinion, these people have missed the entire point. One of the characters actually says 'you can't see the big picture from in here, you gotta concentrate on what's in front of your face!'. That's exactly where this films strength lies, you are trapped throughout along with the characters. You don't even get to glimpse the outside world at the beginning. Instead you are thrust straight into the disturbing and claustrophobic plot. If you thought that the truman show was smart or original then think again... If you are after gore then you'll get plenty of the red stuff. If you're after laughs then sure, there's one or two... but most of all, if you are after nightmares and thoughts plagued for days with the intricacies of a tidy, intelligent, and utterly edge of seat movie then this is the film for you. 5 out of 5 just for not pandering to the masses.",7,0,0,4 June 1999
Gangs of New York," Hallo... my name is Amsterdam.. prepare to die...
","Gangs of New York had so much potential. It could have been a powerful, gut-wrenching, pseudo-historical epic... but alas, no such luck.
It suffers most from a lack of aim. It doesn't know whether to be a tale about an aggravated period of New York's history, or a simple tale of revenge. And after stumbling back and forth for three hours trying to decide which direction to go in - it ultimately fails to satisfy on both accounts. Daniel Day Lewis pays wonderful homage to Deniro (although I'm not sure if that was intentional), and the rest of the cast do an okay job. But if I were you, I'd leave after the opening sequence 'cos it ain't going nowhere but downhill from there my friends.",5,0,0,4 January 2003
Moon," Thought provoking and engrossing, but lacks emotional punch and tension.
","There's something subtly wrong with 'Moon' that stops it from being a great film (though it's still a really good one). In many ways it's a beautiful piece of movie making - thought provoking, finely shot and engrossing. Sam Rockwell is puts in a tour-de-force performance and the interactions between him and his mirror self are flawlessly executed. As the credits rolled I was left thinking 'I should have really LOVED that, but instead I just kinda enjoyed it instead.' What went wrong? I think somehow the film lacks an emotional punch and a sense of building tension. The events that take place call for a multitude of deep and powerful emotions - isolation, terror, confusion, sadness, excitement and finally joy - yet it fails to really take you to these places. It borrows (in a good way) from other movies that unfortunately *did* get those target emotions right (eg. 2001, Silent Running, Solaris, Gattaca, and Blade Runner) so you always have this comparison field in your head as you are watching it. It's not as lonely as 2001, not as touching as Blade Runner, not as haunting as Solaris, not as joyous as Gattaca, for example. The problem lies in part with the screenplay, which is a little too placid for its own good, and in part with the directing - which reaches for Kubrick but never quite gets there.But enough focusing on the negative because I don't want to give a skewed opinion of the movie. All told, Moon was an exceptionally well done sci-fi movie that should be seen by all lovers of the genre. It may not excite or punch you in the gut like you'll wish it had, but it gets REAL close. And it's still a refreshingly intelligent and peaceful movie in a field awash with lesser quality work.",6,3,8,16 January 2010
