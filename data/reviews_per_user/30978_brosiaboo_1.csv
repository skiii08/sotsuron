The Ring," Very Suspensful
","When my husband (20) and I (18) went to see The Ring, we were expecting a lot less than we got.  The entire time that the movie is showing, I looked around the theatre and saw young couples clutching each other.  Mainly the boys holding the girls.  To my dismay, I was the one holding my husband! He said that he would never watch it again.  The music was what got to him. In most horror flicks, the music leads up to a scary scene.  This movie didn't do this and that was the best part.  You couldn't expect anything to happen. My husband claims not to see it again not because it was bad, but because it was too scary for him.  I, on the contrary, have seen it 3 times in the theatres and am planning on buying it once it comes out.  If you enjoy suspensful, edge of your seat movies, I would strongly suggest watching this movie.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  Love, Brosiaboo.",10,0,0,29 January 2003
