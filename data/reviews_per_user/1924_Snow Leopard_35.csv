Vertigo," Distinctive & Unforgettable Masterpiece
","One of the many things that made Hitchcock such a great director is that he did not just stick to the same formula time after time; all of his best movies have their own unique feel and characteristics.  'Vertigo' is particularly distinctive, both as a complex story filled with suspense, and as a fascinating study in psychological tension.  While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events.  Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere.  The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort.  It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.There are also some great acting performances.  Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona.  He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character's actions and decisions.  Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance.  The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's (Stewart's) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie's character.'Vertigo' is a classic by any standard.  It's a must-see that remains just as impressive with each viewing.",Null,275,360,19 June 2001
Spartacus," An Entertaining Spectacle That Also Has Some Substance
","The main reason to watch the epic 'Spartacus' is probably for its sheer entertainment value, since it offers interesting characters, a great deal of action, and numerous lavish settings and sequences. But it also has some substance as well, even if it is not as noticeable as the rest. Without knowing who the director was, it might come as a small surprise to know that Stanley Kubrick directed it, but then again, his craftsmanship and distinctive style are quite apparent at times.The story certainly lends itself readily to cinema, and with all the battles, confrontations, and tumultuous developments, it's little wonder that they decided to film it as an epic. It makes for an interesting contrast with the movies on which Kubrick put his own stamp, but then again there are times when the subtleties in some of the characters, and some of the less-obvious possibilities in some of the sequences and settings, add some depth. It makes the movie worth re-watching to catch some of the detail, since the action and spectacle tend to dominate your attention at first.The cast likewise is an interesting combination of talent, and most of them work quite well in defining their characters. Kirk Douglas makes a very suitable movie version of Spartacus, and several of the other cast members get the chance to stand out as well. In particular, Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton both steal more than their share of scenes.It's very easy to understand why a director of Kubrick's stature would have been disappointed not to have complete control over a project like this, and given the opportunity he could surely have produced a different version of 'Spartacus' that would have been worthwhile in its own way. Alternatively, they could have filmed a more strictly historical version of events. But the 'Spartacus' that they did create is more than worthwhile, as an interesting and often enthralling drama with many memorable sequences, and one that also contains some interesting observations on its subjects and themes.",Null,5,10,26 January 2005
Casablanca," A Classic Worth Remembering
","While there's not anything new to be said about 'Casablanca', it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention.  By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly.  Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast.  Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments.  It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films.  It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly.  (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else.  Different viewers probably remember and enjoy 'Casablanca' for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything.  While perhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching.",Null,97,122,6 December 2001
Lifeboat," Quite Interesting
","One of the things that made Hitchcock great was his willingness to experiment, rather than just sticking with a proven formula all of the time. While not all of his experimental movies measure up to his greatest achievements, they're always worth watching, and 'Lifeboat' is much more than just watchable.  It's a tense drama that combines psychology and action in an efficient and memorable style.This is quite an interesting movie in several respects, and not least for the ways that Hitchcock squeezes so much out of one single setting.  Into the simple 'Lifeboat' setting, he puts lots of details that are both interesting and appropriate.  The characters are interesting and believable, and most of all, the story is full of both suspense and substance.  As an extra bonus, there is one of Hitchcock's most creative cameo appearances.Aside from the technical features, it is also noteworthy to see the ways that the characters are portrayed, with the contrasts among them perhaps a bit stylized at times, but done so as to make some important points.  The cast does a good job in making each of the characters come to life, and all of them get a chance to have some good moments.  It all fits together to make an unusual movie that is well worth watching.",Null,44,51,12 August 2002
To Be or Not to Be," Classic Satirical Comedy That Gets Even Better As It Goes Along
","Beneath all the one-liners and amusing gags, this classic comedy has an undertone of satire that is quite effective. Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.Very few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.While providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis' inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.Aside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack's character, who is (through no fault of Stack's) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up, the members of Benny's acting troupe get some fine moments of their own, Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters, and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale.",Null,34,70,28 October 2004
Citizen Kane," Still Pretty Impressive
","Still impressive after all these decades, today 'Citizen Kane' is probably more admired and analyzed than it is enjoyed, but there is plenty to admire. Even for those who just want to watch a good movie, not to analyze one, there's a lot to see.  True, it's not really 'the greatest film ever made', especially because there isn't really such a thing, anyway, as 'the' one greatest film.  There are a lot of great films, and by almost any standard this is one of them.Welles used his own skill and creativity along with his talented cast and crew to create a story that is a compelling character study and a thoughtful look at some significant aspects of life.  The main character was based on a notorious figure of the era, but Welles made it much more than a story limited to his times, by bringing out what was behind his characters, and making the audience understand what the characters did not see about themselves.  There are Kanes in every era (and also equivalents of those around him), some as large as the character himself, and others merely small-scale replicas.  Since the story is based on characters and on ideas, rather than on action, it can seem slow if you are expecting more activity, but it's a story that has something to offer.  Its outstanding technical accomplishments and historical importance may not be so obvious now, only because Welles's ideas and techniques have influenced so many later movies in one respect or another, making much that was imaginative then seem commonplace now.  But it was quite an achievement all the same, and worthy of the attention it is still getting.",Null,2,6,6 December 2001
The Birth of a Nation," The Conventional Wisdom is Partially Right
","The conventional wisdom about 'The Birth of a Nation' is that it represents an impressive and innovative display of cinematic skill that was unfortunately wasted on a story that promotes a bizarre and disturbing point of view. While that is certainly true in a general way, it might also be something of an oversimplification.It really is almost like two different movies. The first part, which takes place in the era before and during the Civil War, contains little objectionable material, and it deserves praise both technically and for the acting. The second part, set in the reconstruction era, contains almost all of the disturbing material, and it also is really not all that great in terms of cinematic quality.Then also, the degree to which 'The Birth of a Nation' may have influenced the development of cinema has very likely been overstated . The controversy that it generated may very well have helped it to remain better known than other films of the era that were equally innovative and/or lavish, or nearly so.If the movie had ended shortly after the memorable and well-crafted Ford's Theater scene, the anti-war sentiment and similar themes would remain the main focus, since the effects of war on families and individuals is depicted convincingly and thoughtfully. In that case, its occasional lapses would possibly at the worst be called 'dated', given the quality of the rest of this part of the movie.The second half, though, is completely unfortunate in almost every respect. Not only does it promote a distorted viewpoint, but the story becomes labored, and the characters lose their depth and become more one-dimensional. The purely technical side, such as the photography and the use of cross-cutting, might still be good, but much of the rest of it loses its effectiveness.Perhaps more importantly, it really seems rather difficult to justify the credit that this one film gets in the development of cinema. There had already been numerous feature-length movies, and most of the techniques that Griffith used were also in use by others. He may well have been ahead of the pack in terms of appreciating their possibilities, but that does not mean that cinema would not have developed as it did without this particular movie.Just as one example, the Italian epic 'Cabiria', from the previous year, has the same kind of lavish scale, is quite resourceful in its techniques, and is quite entertaining, without causing so much controversy.Other early feature-length films also include some creative efforts to adapt film-making techniques to longer running times and more complex stories. Finally, many short features from the pre-Griffith era experimented with the same kinds of techniques that he later would use systematically. There's no denying Griffith's considerable technical skill, but others of the era also deserve some credit, even if they and their works were less controversial, and are now largely forgotten as a result.",Null,218,287,26 January 2005
12 Angry Men," Unsurpassed Character Study & Very Good Drama
","The unsurpassed character studies of the '12 Angry Men' would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",Null,5,7,27 September 2004
The Great Dictator," Still Entertaining, Still Pertinent
","For all that Charlie Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' was very much a topical movie in its time, it is still both entertaining and pertinent. Chaplin treats the subject of the Axis dictators with enough satirical humor and thematic depth to make it carry beyond the immediate concerns of the day. Chaplin's silent masterpieces are still his best movies, but this one shows that he was also capable of making a smooth transition to sound pictures.Chaplin himself does very well in his dual role, which gives him plenty of room to perform a good variety of material. After her excellent performance in 'Modern Times', Paulette Goddard's role here is unfortunately much more limited, but she does well when she has a chance. Chaplin's most entertaining scenes are probably the ones with Jack Oakie, as the dictator's would-be companion in conquest. Together, the two make those scenes work both as funny satire and as a clever depiction of the dictators' fragile personas.Even if this hadn't worked so well, it would have been quite a creditable attempt by Chaplin to find humor in such a grim topic. Very few film-makers could have made a picture that hit the appropriate balance as well as this does. 'The Great Dictator' no longer has the urgent significance that it held for its original viewers, but it retains its relevance in a more general sense. It's nearly as entertaining as Chaplin's best silents, and like them, its message still holds something worthwhile.",Null,1,3,6 October 2004
The Hustler," Masterful Characterizations, Excellent Atmosphere
","The story in 'The Hustler' is quite interesting in itself, but it is the characterizations and the atmosphere that make it so good. The characterizations are masterful, and the acting makes all of the characters believable and lifelike. Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, and George C. Scott could not have been better, and they are joined by a fine supporting cast. The atmosphere likewise is excellent, forming a fine complement to the characters and their story.Eddie, Minnesota, and Bert are all quite interesting in themselves, and the three characters also make for some nice comparisons and contrasts with each other. As the young pool star Eddie, Newman very effectively portrays the strengths and weaknesses that come with his great ability and self-confidence. As the old pro Minnesota, Gleason gets fewer opportunities, but he delivers flawlessly. He's a great character, and even though the movie is not really about him, he leaves you wanting to see more of him. The first, lengthy battle between Eddie and Minnesota is one of the fine set pieces of its era in cinema.Scott's character is thoroughly unlikable, but undeniably intriguing, and Scott's distinctive style is perfect for the role. The supporting cast, likewise, features some effective character actors who make the best of their roles.The story slows down considerably in the middle, as Piper Laurie's character comes onto the scene, but the change of pace is important in understanding Eddie and the things that lie ahead for him. Laurie's role is sometimes thankless compared with Newman's, but her character is an important contrast to Bert (Scott) and the way of life that Bert wants to offer Eddie. There are numerous somber yet important moments as everything plays out.Naturally, the most fun parts of the movie are the pool-playing scenes, and they work even better than you could have hoped for. The atmosphere makes you feel as if you were there watching the action, and the musical score is surprisingly helpful in complementing the settings. Everything fits together well to make 'The Hustler' a worthwhile classic.",Null,2,5,3 March 2005
The Best Years of Our Lives," Memorable, Worthwhile Characters & Story
","The memorable characters and story make 'The Best Years of Our Lives' an interesting and entertaining drama, and it is also worthwhile and thoughtful for its portrayal of the problems of ex-servicemen and their families. Although the specific problems in the movie might not be such a widespread concern at present, it is nevertheless a thought-provoking reminder of how easily we forget or ignore the problems of others, even others who have served us well, and who have accepted risks and made sacrifices in order to do so.The cast is a good one, especially Fredric March and Myrna Loy. March's character is interesting in himself and also in his ways of reacting to the situations that his friends encounter. Myrna Loy excels as always in her interactions with March and the other characters. It is also hard to forget Harold Russell once you've seen this movie. Though he is inexperienced as an actor, he more than makes up for it with his sincerity and innocence.The story is also well-conceived and well-directed. The characters are put in a variety of situations that not only reflect some very common concerns of the movie's own era, but that also provide insights into human nature that go beyond the specific situations themselves. Despite a long running time, there is ample material to hold your attention and to make you care about the characters.",Null,5,9,16 September 2004
Battleship Potemkin," Vivid & Memorable
","This classic is filled with vivid images that stay in your mind after you have watched it, and there is a lot to appreciate in the way that the key scenes were set up and photographed. The visuals are so impressive that the movie's imperfections are usually not so noticeable, and they don't keep it from being a memorable film.The movie certainly deserves the praise that it gets both for the influence that it has had, and for some ideas that for the time were most creative. The famed 'Odessa Steps' sequence alone demonstrates both fine technical skill and a keen awareness of how to drive home an image to an audience. It deserves to be one of cinema's best remembered sequences. Some of the other scenes also demonstrate, to a lesser degree, the same kind of skill.It says a lot for how effective all of the visuals are that so many viewers think so highly of 'Battleship Potemkin' despite a story that is sometimes heavy-handed, and despite characters and acting that are both rather thin. These features might simply stem from the collectivist philosophy that lies behind the story, and they are obscured most of the time by Eisenstein's unsurpassed ability to present pictures that viewers will not forget.Despite the flaws, this is a movie that most fans of silent films, and anyone interested in the history of movies, will want to see. There's nothing else in its era that's quite like it.",Null,34,45,19 December 2001
The Grapes of Wrath," Fine Cast & Production
","This classic adaptation of 'The Grapes of Wrath' features a fine cast as well as a skillful production headed by director John Ford. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are well-remembered for their roles, which are among the defining roles in their careers. The only limitations that it has come from the original novel, with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story.Besides Fonda and Darwell, the supporting cast features plenty of good supporting players, including Charley Grapewin and John Carradine. All of them make their characters come alive believably. They also fit together well and complement one another's performances, which accentuates the themes involved in the struggles of the Joad family.For all that the Steinbeck novel is so revered, and for all that his story is an often compelling depiction of its characters, with whom many in the era could identify, it would have been better if it had not been so heavy-handed. Even given that the times were bad, more balance in the characters outside of the family, and in the Joads' experiences, would have made it an even better story. Certainly, this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many present-day movies and novels, which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film. Ford clearly appreciated the potential in the material, and he and the cast work together to make each character count, and to give meaning to each scene.",Null,22,30,26 October 2004
The Passion of Joan of Arc," A Powerful Experience Not To Be Missed
","Watching Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent film masterpiece, 'The Passion of Joan of Arc', is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences you will ever have.  Amazing direction by Dreyer, with extraordinary acting by Maria Falconetti as Joan, enable the viewer to sense every nuance of Joan's ordeal throughout her trial and eventual execution.  The experience is so realistic and overpowering that by the time the fire is lit under her stake, you can practically smell the burning wood.Almost the whole film is a carefully filmed and edited sequence of close-up shots that emphasize every aspect of Joan's plight, and that enable us to share in the deepest of her feelings.  The masterful shot selection takes full advantage of Falconetti's unparalleled performance as she shows us who Joan was.  By keeping everything in close, we never take our attention off of what Joan is enduring, and the intensity of the experience is never allowed to dissipate.After following Joan's lengthy trial and interrogation, the film climaxes with a phenomenal look at her execution.  It cycles through shots of Joan, the stake, her tormentors, and the crowd, and occasionally a shot of birds flying gracefully overhead, overwhelming us with moving sensations.To be sure, this is not the kind of film that casual audiences would necessarily enjoy.  What Joan of Arc endured was an unspeakable combination of systematic humiliation and physical agony, and Dreyer's film makes us feel every bit of it.  And to appreciate fully some of the details in the film, it probably helps to have some basic historical knowledge of Joan's life - the film starts immediately at the trial, with little or no explanation of prior events.  But even if you had no idea who Joan was, watching this account of her would still move you, and you would still come away amazed at her great inner strength - the film is that effective.If you appreciate dramatic cinema, whether you usually like silents or not, make sure to see this masterpiece when you can.",Null,7,12,17 May 2001
The Caine Mutiny," Excellent Psychological Drama
","The heart of 'The Caine Mutiny' is the psychological struggle between the U.S.S. Caine's neurotic Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart, who gives a great performance in a role that was somewhat atypical for him) and his officers, most of whom have their own inner struggles.On a first viewing, the movie is an effective and gripping drama.  We first agonize over the dilemma of the officers who wonder whether they should openly resist their Captain as his grip on reality continues to deteriorate, and then, after the inevitable confrontation, we anxiously wait to see whether the officers will be punished for doing what they were convinced was necessary.  Both of these are enhanced by an outstanding cast and by many interesting sequences and attractive visuals.Repeated viewings are also satisfying, since they make it possible to get a deeper appreciation of each officer's motivation, and of how each one's actions are reflective of his own personality and his own problems.The main story is framed by a beginning and ending involving young Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) and Captain De Vriess (Tom Tully, who is terrific in this smaller role), the crabby old captain who preceded Queeg on the Caine, plus a sequence in the middle involving Keith on leave from the ship. This device (or sub-plot) does not work nearly as well as the main story, primarily because Ensign Keith's love interest and family difficulties slow things down considerably, without adding much interest to his own character. This is really the film's only noticeable imperfection.Although set in World War II, it is not really a war film, and thus is well worth seeing even for viewers who are not interested in war movies. Anyone who enjoys excellent characterizations, psychological tension, or just good cinema, should enjoy watching 'The Caine Mutiny'.",Null,3,5,11 May 2001
North by Northwest," Terrific Entertainment From the Master
","With everything you expect from Hitchcock and more, 'North By Northwest' is terrific entertainment from the master.  There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcock's best-known set pieces.  It's capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for 'Psycho'.Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun.  As one of the man-on-the-run characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations.  The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.The story is one of Hitchcock's most exciting.  It's slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at.  Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely.  At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcock's mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director.  You can watch it several times and still find it just as entertaining.",Null,45,65,21 September 2001
Judgment at Nuremberg," A Very Interesting & Well-Crafted Look at a Difficult Subject
","This is a very interesting, well-crafted, and thought-provoking look at a difficult subject from a difficult period in world history. It recreates the complex feelings and issues of the era with care, and it goes out of its way to be fair to all of the characters and what they stand for.Between the difficult decisions involved in determining responsibility for the outrages that took place under the Nazi regime, and the diplomatic worries of the era, there is a lot of emotionally charged material, and yet 'Judgment at Nuremberg' uses an excellent cast and well-conceived characters to create a movie that is both worthwhile for its themes and interesting to watch.The characters are well-chosen so as to allow the opportunity for each major perspective to have a hearing, and the cast members do quite well in bringing their characters to life. Spencer Tracy gives one of his finest performances as the judge in the center of it all. Very few other actors could have been so believable in portraying the character as he carefully weighs so many different viewpoints, knowing that he must come to a decision.Burt Lancaster is very effective as the most interesting of the defendants, and the one whose case is the hardest to evaluate. His character is contrasted effectively with the other defendants, and Lancaster makes the character interesting and his case significant. Maximilian Schell also succeeds in a challenging role. Marlene Dietrich works well in her role, which represents yet another aspect of the general situation. The other characters likewise all have a purpose, and are all portrayed believably, with Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland in particular standing out as two traumatized witnesses.Even within the lengthy running time, it would not be possible to cover every significant point involved in the discussion. But this dramatization is one of the best depictions available of the dilemmas and challenges that had to be faced in the aftermath of the Second World War.",Null,3,4,20 January 2005
Duck Soup," The Marx Brothers At Their Very Best
","There are a lot of reasons why so many different reviewers suggest that 'Duck Soup' is a genuine candidate for the funniest movie ever made.  It has the Marx brothers at their very best, with rapid-fire laughs combining with a satirical 'plot' that is very funny in itself, without getting in the way of the individual comedy sequences that are the real highlight of the film. Their timing and material are as good here as they ever have been.The Marx brothers are still beloved today because when at their best, they treated their audience to a lot of riotous slapstick that cannot be watched without laughing, while at the same time rewarding their viewers for paying attention with a steady stream of puns, deadpan one-liners, brief sight gags, and other subtler humor.  The more you watch, the more you notice.'Duck Soup' has a lot of their very best material, and everyone has their own favorite scenes, whether it is the mirror sequence, or Chico and Harpo giving their report to Louis Calhern, or the street vendor scenes, or ... . The variety of comic settings and comic material is amazing, and when you add in the entertaining musical sequences (which again are particularly good in this one), it is a feast that never stops.Any Marx brothers fan has seen this one several times, and does not need to be reminded what great fun it is.

Gone with the Wind," Top Quality Story-Telling Helps Make Up For Its Weaknesses
","Story-telling technique doesn't get much better than this, so it's no surprise that the movie is still so well-known despite its age and length. From the detailed, lavish settings to the carefully filmed action scenes to the well-timed, steady pace, many things are done masterfully.  These and other strengths make it an entertaining and sometimes exciting classic despite some weaknesses in its characters and its historical perspective.In one sense, you have to wonder whether it would have been a better story if the main characters were more worth caring about.  Nothing against Gable or Leigh, who both give fine performances that bring out exactly what their characters are about, but despite Rhett's resourcefulness and Scarlett's strength, they really are not very admirable persons, and it's just hard to care very much whether they are happy or not.  It makes the whole movie rather less affecting; it's always interesting yet only occasionally is it really compelling.  Yet at the same time, the characters in themselves are convincing, and perhaps their less-than-admirable nature makes for a more believable balance to the historical backdrop, which is a highly idealized, not to say sanitized, portrait of the Old South.All that aside, whether you like the characters and settings or not, it's filled with good examples of how to tell a story on film.  The escape from Atlanta sequence deserves its place as one of the finest set pieces in movie history, and although nothing in the rest of the film has the same intensity level, there are many other good scenes that make it a picture well worth watching.",Null,5,9,16 May 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," A Memorable, Expertly-Crafted Epic
","Worthwhile for any number of reasons, David Lean's filming of 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a memorable, very entertaining, and expertly crafted epic. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of T.E. Lawrence works even better than you could have hoped for, and the entire cast of talented actors is given first-class material to work with. The script, settings, and the entire production are of fine quality.O'Toole's distinctive, original style is a good match for such a complicated and unusual figure as Lawrence, who was one of the most complex historical figures of his generation. Even in the nearly four hours of running time, you could not cover the entire life of such a man, yet because of the way that O'Toole is able to capture the character so memorably, you come away from the movie with the feeling of understanding more than just the events themselves.The rest of the cast likewise could hardly be better. Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Omar Sharif, and all the rest bring their characters to life believably, and they are an indispensable part of creating the world around the main character.Lean's own ability to film this kind of large-scale story was never put to better use. When watched in widescreen, there are times when you can almost feel the sand and the desert heat, because of how carefully the scenes and settings have been rendered.To be sure, it's a very long movie, and it defies a lot of the movie conventions that normally apply to such a large-scale production. And as a period piece, it shows us some things as they have not been for a long time (yet that still have some significance). But because of all this, it rewards careful viewing, since many of its subtleties can be even more satisfying than the exciting action sequences.",Null,2,5,3 February 2005
La Grande Illusion," A Timeless Classic
","Jean Renoir's classic 'La Grande Illusion' has something to recommend it to anyone - there is fine acting, directing, writing, and photography, and a story filled with memorable characters who are involved in action, suspense, and drama, with some comic parts and even, later in the film, some romance. All of it fits together perfectly to create a timeless and very satisfying experience.The movie takes place during World War I, and is often considered an anti-war film, but the themes about humanity, relationships, loyalties, and identities are all timeless and go beyond any mere political statement.  The interplay between persons of different nationalities and classes, thrown together by the war, leads to good drama and makes some profound points about human nature.  The story primarily follows three Frenchmen who are taken prisoner by the Germans, showing us how they manage to deal with their confinement, and allowing us to watch their disappointments and their attempts to escape.  The other main character is a German prison camp commander with whom they become friendly, raising complicated questions of loyalty and duty.The character studies are excellent, and all the fine acting and directing get the most of out the possibilities.  The settings are convincing and help the viewer feel what it was like to be in camp with the prisoners, sharing their boredom and their longing for freedom.  The plot itself is interesting, and has some exciting moments, but the main emphasis is on what the characters learn about themselves and about humanity in general.  There are many thoughtful scenes and some nicely defined secondary characters that round out the picture.This is a fine movie, deserving of its reputation, and one that should appeal highly to anyone who enjoys classic cinema.",Null,36,46,21 June 2001
Singin' in the Rain," Great Entertainment
","With an entertaining story, interesting characters, a good cast, and song sequences that are often both lavish and creative, this has everything you could ask for in a musical.  Besides being one of the best musicals ever made, it is also one of the best of the movies that Hollywood has ever made about itself.The story is a somewhat exaggerated and very amusing look at Hollywood as it underwent the transition from silents to sound.  The main characters are defined nicely, and the cast does a fine job with them.  The trio of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor really look as if they are having a good time together.  It gets a lot of mileage out of even the simplest aspects of the changes that sound pictures brought, and while the main plot is fairly simple, there are plenty of laughs.  Most of the musical numbers work quite well, although the rest of the movie is so good that it probably could have stood up pretty well on its own anyway.This classic is great entertainment, and a movie you can enjoy whether or not you usually like musicals.",Null,4,7,1 April 2002
Some Like It Hot," Wilder & A Fine Cast Make a Goofy Story Very Enjoyable
","Billy Wilder's great story-telling skills and a fine group of performers take a pretty goofy story and make 'Some Like It Hot' a very enjoyable movie, whose carefree disregard for realism belies a skillful and creative production. With a tale so full of implausible developments and characters, it's almost as if Wilder wanted to see just how far he could stretch it and still come up with a top-quality picture. It's hard not to compare it with Hitchcock's 'North By Northwest', released the same year, in which Hitchcock and another excellent cast tell an equally unlikely story with exceptional craftsmanship.With their energetic yet contrasting personas, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis make an ideal leading pair for a movie of this nature, . Their energy and their sense of just how far they can exaggerate things make it very easy to like their characters and to become interested in what happens to them, and in turn that makes everything else fit together.While much of what Marilyn Monroe does cannot properly be called acting, she does work particularly well here. She was very well-matched with her character, and comes across quite naturally. The supporting cast all have much smaller roles, but they are also crucial to making the movie so entertaining. George Raft, Nehemiah Persoff and Joe E. Brown all get some particularly good moments.Wilder himself pulls out all the stops to add a lot of creativity to the settings and to move things along at an ideal pace, bringing the characters to one new predicament after another. The most implausible developments become amusing when handled with such craftsmanship. While some of Wilder's other pictures were more impressive as artistic achievements, for entertainment value this is as good as any of them.",Null,2,4,20 September 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," Rises Far Above Most Movies of Its Kind
","This movie rises far above most films of its kind.  Not only are all the important aspects of the film done with care and skill, there is much more substance to it than there is to most 'feel-good' movies or holiday stories. It succeeds where many similar movies fall short, and while it is ultimately a feel-good fantasy, many viewers who don't ordinarily enjoy such stories end up liking this one.One of the major strengths is that hero George Bailey is not a one-dimensional good-guy, but rather must combat his own weaknesses and disappointments at the same time that he is trying to help others.  He has his own dreams and hopes, which never seem to materialize, and this is a genuine struggle for him.  And it doesn't hurt that the character is played by a terrific actor like Jimmy Stewart, who brings out all the sides of George's character, and who gives almost any viewer something to relate to. There are many other positives as well - plenty of interesting characters, a very good cast, and a story that makes use of every available resource. 'It's A Wonderful Life' is an enduring story that is still worth watching and remembering.",Null,5,11,21 December 2001
Psycho," Thrilling & Masterful
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is so well known for inducing suspense and terror that it is easy to overlook what a great achievement it is in many other respects.  It works so well as a thriller because everything fits together perfectly - the directing, acting, and music all help to turn a good story into a great movie.The plot begins when ...  But anyone reading these comments has either (a) seen 'Psycho' already, perhaps several times, and thus knows everything that happens, or (b) has not yet seen it, in which case the less you know about the plot, the more you will enjoy it when you do see it.  While this is a movie that you can thoroughly enjoy over and over, some of the surprises are especially good if you aren't sure what to expect.  So this comment will avoid any plot details at all.Although 'Psycho' is usually remembered as a shocker, there is actually very little violence, and it is not especially graphic.  Its effect is maximized by skillful build-up and by the atmosphere that Hitchcock so carefully created.  The pacing is masterful, slowly building up the tension and only releasing it when it will have the maximum effect - that is why it creates such a sensation.  The main settings - the Bates Motel and the Bates' old house - are perfectly designed to create an atmosphere full of possibilities.  (Hitchcock also made a terrific trailer in which he took the viewer on a tour of the house and motel.)  And it is not possible to say enough about the famous Bernard Herrmann score, which always fits the mood and action perfectly.  The exciting music makes even the opening credits fun to watch.The fine cast is led by Anthony Perkins, who is simply outstanding in a very challenging role.  The movie would not have been quite the same without his underplayed but thoroughly memorable performance.  Janet Leigh is also particularly good as the kind of complex, mysterious woman that she excelled at portraying.All this together makes for one of the greatest of all movies, and a genuine must-see for any fan of quality cinema.",Null,9,17,29 May 2001
All Quiet on the Western Front," Still One of the Best Movies of Its Kind
","Still one of the most worthwhile films about the hard realities of war, 'All Quiet On The Western Front' has numerous memorable images and thoughtful moments.  Too many war dramas, regardless of their perspective, resort to distortions of history and overblown characters that make them convincing only to those who watch uncritically.  This one works nicely by keeping the characters low-key and by, for the most part, allowing the events and situations to speak for themselves.  It's not perfect in this respect, and it is perhaps a movie more to be respected than enjoyed, but it has many notable strengths.The characters, most of them young soldiers, are played very simply, even plainly, but this is by no means a weakness - rather, it allows the movie to show what war is like for real soldiers rather than for idealized or stereotyped characters.  The two most important characters are developed more fully, and are played well.  Louis Wolheim's resourceful 'Kat' is the liveliest of the soldiers, and as Paul, Lew Ayres is quite understated but very believable.  His character is well-chosen as the focal point of most of the movie.  The close-fighting nature of World War I particularly lends itself to this kind of movie, and the atmosphere is convincing and detailed.  The contrast with the civilian scenes is also set up well, although the civilian scenes sometimes seem slightly less convincing.  The overall effect is a movie that, while you probably wouldn't call it exciting or fun, is one you won't forget.",Null,61,74,16 May 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," A Fine Classic Whose Meaning Goes Well Beyond the Story Itself
","A fine adaptation of a fine novel, 'To Kill A Mockingbird' not only brings the story and its characters to life, but also creates a world whose meaning and significance go well beyond the story itself. Gregory Peck gives what might be his finest - and what almost certainly is his best-remembered - performance, yet he is only one of several strong points of the movie.It's understood that the movie version is going to be somewhat different from the book, yet this adaptation is very well-conceived in its selections from the novel and in achieving what it sets out to do. It concentrates on the Tom Robinson case and on the children's exploration of their neighborhood, and it meshes these story-lines together nicely.The main themes of justice, acceptance, and related ideas are obviously of great importance, and yet what helps this movie to stand out from so many others that promote the same values is that it does not stop at simply re-affirming right and wrong, but puts these and other issues into a framework, a way of looking at the world.Almost the whole movie is viewed from the world of the children, and it is not the over-simplified or stereotyped world of most children's stories, but rather a world where so many things seem so much larger and so much more mysterious than they seem to adults. The true mystery and curiosity of a child's world is hard to capture either in print or on film, but from the very beginning 'To Kill a Mockingbird' effectively helps its viewers to look at things from that kind of a perspective.Peck's performance works very well, especially with this in mind. Most of the time, he allows the issues to speak for themselves, not indulging in theatrics or emotion, even to make the most important of points. For this reason, on those few occasions when he does become more vehement, those moments are that much more effective. The child actors, especially Mary Badham, are a perfect complement to Peck, and Robert Duvall's brief appearance fits in wonderfully.Both the original book and this movie version are quite worthwhile, and there's no reason to have to choose between the two. Both of them succeed admirably in their own sphere, and both add their own dimensions to the story, the characters, and the world that they live in.",Null,0,3,22 February 2005
The Bridge on the River Kwai," An Engrossing Drama With Memorable Characters
","The unusual setting, conflict of wills, and memorable characters make 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' a worthwhile and engrossing drama despite some shortcomings. It would be hard to top the performances by Alec Guinness and William Holden, as two of the three main characters. (Sessue Hayakawa also has a couple of good scenes, although much of the time he is saddled with an unrewarding and rather thankless role.) Their portrayals and David Lean's direction make the movie work on a level far above the quality of the story itself. The story's historical distortions and implausible turns, which would have been fatal in a production of lesser quality, are concealed most of the time by the high quality of the other elements of the film.Besides the good work by the cast, the remote setting and the tense story make all of it but a handful of slower stretches intriguing and satisfying. There is so much quality here that it seems a bit unfortunate that the story could not have been more true to the historical setting, rather than relying so much on developments and motivations that, while dramatically effective, are historically doubtful. There are also some implausible stretches that, though carried off well enough by the cast, were not really necessary. While most viewers probably won't mind them anyway, both of these are a little too plain to avoid being noticed.As a movie, though, this is an absorbing story with strong production values and some fine scenes, and it is certainly well worth seeing.",Null,1,3,16 September 2004
Stalag 17," Absorbing & Very Entertaining
","This absorbing and very entertaining movie creates a believable and interesting cast of characters, puts them into an intriguing story, and uses its settings, props, and other resources very creatively. It is a fine combination of drama and comic relief that stands up very well against anything else of its type. The setting and atmosphere are quite believable, and they make it easy to enter the characters' world.The opening sequence sets up everything nicely, with most of POW's helping two of the prisoners in an escape attempt, while William Holden as the cynical Sefton separates himself from the rest. Sefton is interesting enough as it is, a man who simply by remaining true to his nature cannot help arousing suspicion and antagonism, and Holden was quite a good choice to play him. The story builds up nicely, with developments coming at a careful pace, and some good stretches of lighter material.There are numerous interesting characters and good performances among the other prisoners, and in particular Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck steal more than one scene with their antics which, though goofy, are also an appropriate complement to the main plot and the setting. The German characters are more stylized, but both Sig Ruman and Otto Preminger make them come to life, and help them fit in seamlessly with the others.Billy Wilder's direction and the photography also deserve praise. Besides the way that each sequence fits together so nicely with the others, there are several individual scenes and shots that are done in an impressive fashion - not flashy, but creative and thoughtful. The scene with Holden lying on his cot while most of the others sing and celebrate is one particularly good example. There is a wealth of good material throughout, making 'Stalag 17' a classic that has lost nothing over the years, and one that can be seen and enjoyed several times.",Null,33,41,16 September 2004
Paths of Glory," An Interesting, Tense Story
","The story in Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' is tense and interesting, with the action and chaos of a bold yet ill-advised attack followed by the drama and fear caused by its repercussions. But if it were only an anti-war film, it would be a bit too pat, aiming at some generally easy targets. Though set in the heat of the action of World War I, the story and characters are vivid enough to suggest some more general themes about human nature.As the man in the middle of it all, Kirk Douglas has plenty of energy, and he handles the various confrontations believably. His character has more depth than the others, and in addition to playing an important role in the events, his reactions also form the lens through which the viewer sees everything else. From the first scene to the last, Colonel Dax is spirited in his responses and acute in his observations.Adolphe Menjou gives a generally effective portrayal of the bureaucratic officer in charge of it all, though sometimes it is hard not to view his character in the same light as the various charming scamps that Menjou played in his less serious movies. George Macready's character is one-dimensional and disreputable, but he plays the role as it was intended. Ralph Meeker has the most presence of the three prisoners.As the story unfolds, some of the characters' decisions are deplorable, but most of them are believable, and not only in a war-time setting. It is possible to see in the characters some parallels to everyday behavior. This is one of the things that sets the movie apart from the many run-of-the-mill anti-war pictures, and it helps 'Paths of Glory' go a little beyond its immediate genre.",Null,2,5,4 October 2004
Ben-Hur," Sometimes Overdone, But Entertaining & Worthwhile
","It's hard to deny that William Wyler's lavish version of 'Ben-Hur' is sometimes a bit overdone, but it nevertheless remains an entertaining and worthwhile classic. The material does justify the big-budget approach, since the story contains several interesting themes as well as plenty of action sequences. While some parts could have been stream-lined with little loss, in order to make the movie as a whole flow more smoothly, in general the film as it is keeps a good balance between action and substance. There are some very good dramatic moments in addition to the action highlights.Charlton Heston is well-cast as Ben-Hur, a role that plays right to his strengths. The strained relations between Ben-Hur and Messala provide one set of themes for the story, as well as driving much of the action. Heston handles his end of it pretty well, although Stephen Boyd could have been a little less static in his portrayal of Messala. Jack Hawkins works very well as Quintus Arrius, and his scenes with Heston are used well in establishing some of the inner workings of Heston's character. Hugh Griffith also has a couple of good scenes as Sheik Ilderim.The chariot race and other action sequences usually get most of the attention, but there are also some worthwhile ideas in the story (which are really the focus of the original novel) that are developed well enough. There is also a very good silent movie version of 'Ben-Hur' from 1925, which at times takes a different approach from this version, and which is well worth seeing in itself for those who like the story.",Null,56,114,23 September 2004
Rear Window," A Deep & Entertaining Classic
","One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, 'Rear Window' is a deep and entertaining classic with many strengths, and a little bit of everything.  A fine suspense story is combined with romantic tension in the main plot, and there are numerous sub-plots, some humorous and some moving, all with many psychological overtones.  The main characters are wonderfully portrayed and full of life.  The apparently simple setting in an apartment complex is developed into a world filled with intriguing and sometimes unsettling possibilities, and this apparently average neighborhood comes to life with a wealth of lavish visual detail and interesting minor characters.  It is the kind of film-making that (like many of Hitchcock's greatest movies) is very flattering to the viewer.  The director assumes that his audience will pay close enough attention to appreciate the many subtleties with which he has filled the movie.  It rewards both careful attention and repeated viewings, since there is much more here than merely a suspense plot, as good as that story is in itself.For the first 30 minutes or so, we simply get to know the characters.  Jimmy Stewart gives one of his best performances as a photographer recuperating from an injury, forced to spend several weeks staring out his apartment window at the minor dramas in the lives of his neighbors.  Grace Kelly is ideal in the role of his perfect girlfriend, who can never find a way to break down Stewart's reserve.  The study of their relationship would have made a good movie by itself.  Almost every action and every word between them is filled with meaning, and what they see in the lives of others is an interesting reflection of the tensions and possibilities in their own present and future.  Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a colorful, no-nonsense nurse who constantly sheds some light - sometimes unwanted - on what is happening between them.  The action and suspense that occur later serves in large part as a catalyst that resolves some of the important issues between the two.After we get to know the characters and their world, things start to happen, as Stewart becomes engrossed in some of the things he has seen.  The ethical and moral concerns of meddling in others' affairs become intertwined with more urgent questions about what may have happened in those other apartments, and from then on the tension builds steadily.  It leads up to a riveting climactic sequence filled with suspense, and made even more meaningful by our awareness of its deeper significance to the main characters.There is much more that could be said, but you should see this for yourself. It is a classic that will be enjoyed not only by thriller fans, but by anyone who appreciates carefully crafted movies with a lot of depth.",Null,133,171,20 June 2001
Saboteur," Works Very Well As Light Entertainment
","This film's wartime message may not be as convincing now as it was to its original audience, but 'Saboteur' still works very well as light entertainment.  Hitchcock used a lot of imaginative ideas that produce a fast-paced movie filled with good scenes, and whose entertainment value outweighs the rather stereotyped characters and what now comes across as a somewhat clumsy message.Robert Cummings stars as an aircraft factory worker framed for a fatal fire caused by Nazi-sympathizing saboteurs.  He spends most of the film trying to evade the police while trying to locate the saboteurs, using only a couple of small clues.  Along the way, he runs into a great variety of mostly interesting characters, some who help him and others who try to turn him in. It's quite similar to, although not as good as, 'The 39 Steps' or 'North By Northwest'.  There is not much to most of the main characters or to the dialogue, but there are several pretty good action and suspense sequences.You shouldn't expect the depth from 'Saboteur' that you usually find in Hitchcock's thrillers, but there should be enough entertainment value here to satisfy most of his fans.",Null,1,1,22 June 2001
The Wizard of Oz," Still Has Its Magic
","Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', and the rest of this fine production of 'The Wizard of Oz' have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.",Null,105,118,27 September 2004
From Here to Eternity," Has Some Compelling Sequences, Though Somewhat Uneven Overall
","Though a little uneven overall, 'From Here To Eternity' has some compelling moments and sequences, and it also has an assortment of interesting, if not entirely sympathetic, characters. It succeeds fairly well in at least two basic ways. First, it gives an interesting and credible portrayal of the nature of the servicemen in Hawaii, showing both their good and bad sides. Then, it also is effective in contrasting everyone's peacetime concerns with the sudden new concerns brought on by the outbreak of the war.Most of the characters and their situations are quite interesting, and much of it is presented in a surprisingly unflattering and uncompromising light. The way that it portrays military life is probably the most interesting aspect of the movie. Nothing is glorified, yet it doesn't take a lot of cheap shots at easy targets, either.The cast does a lot to keep the material on track. Burt Lancaster probably has the most interesting character, and he does a good job in the role. Frank Sinatra does well in making his rather pitiable character into an interesting presence. Montgomery Clift's role gives him plenty of opportunities for brooding and looking melancholy, so he is right at home. Some of the minor characters are also portrayed well. Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr do well enough in roles that don't really give them a lot to work with - they mostly have to react to the male characters.A lot of the material is pretty weighty, and as a result there are a few times when it might would have been better to lighten things just a little. But overall there are enough good, tense scenes, and more than enough depth to the characters, to make it worth seeing.",Null,10,18,8 October 2004
