Scarface," Very Good. Must see
","I really liked this movie and I highly suggest anyone who is anyone to see this great movie. Al Pacino and Pfeifer ( don't know how to spell ) know what they are doing in this classic. I was watching the beginning thinking 'hes going to jail for what? Did I miss something?' then I found out he is a criminal and the ending has got to be one the best you can think of. They really close the book on this one. The best friend dies, the wife leaves him, the sister dies, his life is ruined, his empire crumbles, and soon enough he is filled with lead and still standing until a good shotgun blow kills him. I, for some reason watched the movie on VHS and didn't like the quality of the movie. but I'm sure the remastered version is a perfect quality in HD. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who for some reason has seen this instant classic of a movie.",9,0,1,4 February 2007
