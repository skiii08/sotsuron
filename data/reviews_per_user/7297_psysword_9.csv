Blade Runner 2049," Underwhelming
","I really was afraid that I would snore in the theater, while the movie played on. This new film copies and rips off scenes from the original with gleeful abandonment and interjects modern cinematography for a very thin and predictable story. It felt as if shading the movie would cure all the boring parts and we would gasp with wonder. The original romance was palpable between Decker and the girl. Here in this film I felt nothing. Lots of heavy lasers, special effects and the dreaded CGI. That grimness of the original was missing. Instead this film felt like everybody had moved to better digs. Hell, even the Chinatown scenes weren't as convincing as the original. And then my biggest gripe. They replaced Vangelis to give us absolutely earth shattering bass that any generic synthesizer in the hands of a child would make. No memorable dialogues like the original either. 'If only you could see what my eyes have seen' if I remember correctly among other samples that I used in my trance music production. Straight up unemotional and the ending entirely ludicrous. The human touch was missing and Gosling and the faded Ford refused to impress with their woody dialogues. The original remains King.",2,11,23,21 October 2017
Midnight in Paris," Brilliant attempt at glorifying the Present and the Past together.
","Midnight in Paris, started out with as a funny title, and the story described in it ridiculous. I didn't even consider the Director, Woody Allen as encouraging, considering his latest films had appealed little to my palate. But then I had just left Paris and sitting on the Airfrance flight to USA, figured that it might just be a good idea to see this story about 'Romance in Paris', and 'dis' it as i watched it. It was my third choice on the flight after watching a few other flicks, called 'Spies', and another one.So began the movie quite simply with a couple arguing about the merits of Paris, moving swiftly to show us that this couple was eminently unsuitable for each other. it shows us quite convincingly that the boy, Owen Wilson, needs to pursue his own desires. then very easily slips into the supernatural, as we see the ride into the twenties,, and the roaring fun that they would have over there. amazing delights very nicely detailed, yet so casual that you wouldn't know they had time traveled till later on. i love this concept of time travel, and having written the book, 'Black Shark Valley', i was very surprised pleasantly to find Woody taking me down a similar path, very dear to my heart, Nostalgia.Loved this emphasis on nostalgia, and love of the artists of Paris and of course some very real lessons learned from this sort of dreaming. we have all unfortunately realized the futility of day dreaming but then we can make it productive by making it work through art. that includes writing, movies, and painting. amazing if we can truly capture it in the past, or even better if we capture it in the present. yes Woody then celebrates the glory of the Present, another theme that i strongly agree with, tying the past in our glorious Present. After much soul searching, i have realized that the Present is the most glorious of all and its best to make peace with it. Woody does so brilliantly, while rupturing the ill-fated engaged couple, and onto the new. Paris is indeed the place of Romance, and thats what you can find aplenty in Paris. Even to this day, Mr Pablo PIcasso, Ernst Hemingway, and Mr Salvadore Dali!",Null,2,3,1 September 2011
Oblivion," A movie with hidden meanings
","On the surface of it, the movie seemed like another summer CGI attempt with a lot of special effects and an incomplete story with so many untied loose ends that it was destined to fail with most people. Almost! But this is Tom Cruise of the Church of Scientology that we are dealing with over here. He is no mere man. He has understood the mechanics of Quantum Physics and is very elegantly trying to show you that there is much more to life than what it seems. We think that we are Alive, Special, with Memories. But what if you are just another clone, with some memory implants? Isn't that what God does to us, our flash-backs, our deja-vu about past lives and small memory traces of another life.We feel it, but then society has given us roles to play. To break out of this role-playing is overturning the system, losing your wealth, property, your wife, and everything that you hold dear. The physical structure will not allow you to break free unless you posses that rare suicidal spirit to destroy the System. To be the ultimate Rebel. To be like Jesus! And that is precisely what Tom Cruise does. He blows it away with an amazing performance so elegant and light, that it took we a few days to digest what he'd done right in front of me. A movie that appeared so bland initially but with so many cosmic truth embedded in it that it can easily become a video manual on Ron Hubbard's Dianetics. Amazing breakthrough story and acting. We are all clones and living meaningless and pointless lives till we really break out of the System! The title says a lot, 'Oblivion'. If you stay within the system, then you are living in OBLIVION. I think we have reached a point in Human history where we need another 'Reset' of our Civilization. When was the last time that you really did something wild? Like take on the Zionist Federal Reserve or the Zionist C.I.A? Till then we are slaves of the System. Be the Rebel! Destroy the Federal System.",9,6,15,17 April 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Excellent medieval fairytale
","What a way to bring one of my favorite German fairy tales to life. It was superbly executed and right from the beginning had my interest with the forest narrative, and its heavy leanings on its German origin, made it that much more authentic. The support staff, mostly from Middle Europe were wonderful, and lent authenticity to the whole story play. The weapons were outrageous for the time period, but possessed enough home-made effect for it to be somewhat believable. The insulin shot taking Hans was a great message to Americans to cut their sugar. Overall the action was spot on, and everything about the movie screamed quality. The actors didn't really stand out in the movie but moved like integral parts and in harmony. No one really stole the show here, but that just allowed the whole movie to be a great experience of harmony. The all German technical production of this movie shines with sweet special effects, and the music gels well with the movie. I'm not sure if it was Hans Zimmer on this movie, as i saw a host of other musicians too listed along with him. I'm sure they coordinated to bring a very seamless music production/ score to arouse our passions at appropriate moments, and it was beautifully done. The setting of a German forest was very appropriate, and I saw this movie in IMAX, and I urge everyone else to do the same. Unforgettable!",7,2,4,1 February 2013
Django Unchained," Terribly biased movie
","Man what a movie it could have been, but I was so disappointed by the usual Hollywood bias against White Folk. Dr King Shultz, with a easy reference to MLK, and a short Jewish German (typically a dentist) character teaming up to fight the evil White Folk of Southern United States. There are no references to the fact that the slave trade was controlled by Jewish ships, and that they were involved in it neck deep too. It took a World Wide revolution to change these values but to see White Americans continue to get such a poor deal in Hollywood movies with them being portrayed exclusively as villains and the Jewish characters as Angelic. It is a pathetic film in my opinion with a terrible story line. Hollywood though does best at Cinematic and Special effects which I found were the usual top notch quality but lacking any meaning except for the usual excessive gore served hot. Even a whole minute dedicated to the KKK and then they are all blown up. It is a dark fantasy of Quentin Tarantino, and it come to life quite well, though disappointing in its Human failure of seeing White Americans as the 80 percent majority of America, and in Human terms. The White Majority of America are forced to watch and seethe helplessly in America and there is no outlet for their displeasure. I am hoping that Hollywood changes its tune and starts to see White Americans as the only future of America if it is to be a technical prosperous Global World Leader of the 21st Century.",1,7,17,25 March 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Fabulous, real, heart-wrenching, soul-searching
","The Adjustment bureau, I walked into this movie thinking that it was going to be a nice SCI-FIÂ…with its great reviews and then after a few minutes I felt that this was going to be a copy of the Master SCI-FI film, 'Dark City', but no, there was an unexpected twist. Instead of the expected forces that shape higher destiny, this movie focused on an emotion that can destroy the best laid plans. Love. Love and this movie had oodles of it, and some real powerful performances by Matt Damon not fighting with weapons, but with his heart. Wow, never thought that I would enjoy such a movie, that even mentioned the Holocaust and that made me nauseated for a few minutes, but then the movie just kept coming, and I loved it. The tech and its seamless integration into the movie was sensational. Awesome low cost ideas that looked far better than any Ipad tech out there. This movie was all about Human Endurance. Spirit and chance encounters. The film was fascinated with chance and free Will and I think that it plays out very well for this film. This movie does break new ground, and is a pleasure to watch brilliant performances by everyone. Top class.The people who made this movie are great, but top credits go to the Storyline, and that's where the film scores heavily for me. I give it an eight because the story had me guessing, and there was sheer genius in whoever wrote this movie. Genius Direction, and great acting with a great message for Humanity that Life is indeed a Puzzle, but do we have the balls to 'Write' our own Story? Hehehe. That's why I became a Writer myself",8,0,2,4 July 2011
Prometheus," A could have been great film
","'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', is what Scott Ridley's theme is over here, as he makes the most of the Alien series using better film production advantages of the present. But the same predictable thrills are embedded in this movie, along with an interesting premise, degenerating into another 'Alien' movie. On the positive note, the filming, Space-Tech, though the space ship itself is pathetic, the production values are great, and worthy of Scott Ridley, but the story and how it ends are just silly. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, walking into it completely unaware of Scott Ridley till the title opened, so I wasn't all that pumped up for the movie had I been waiting for it. Seen as purely from a sequel point of view, it's awesome. As far as breaking new ground over here in this film, a sore disappointment awaits you, but it's definitely still one of the best SCI-FI films to come out this year. It's still better than most other Hollywood films.",7,0,2,25 September 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A big Bang Movie with some hidden Ideology
","The movie starts out nice, graphics galore, all in space combat, with space ships, and guns blazing. Then we get to Earth where things start to fizzle out, the Auto-bots , protectors of Earth with what would seem like an Israeli-Jewish bent to their Protection, single out Iran as a troublemaker and make it clear to any Iranian watching the film that Jewish 'Autobots' are patrolling their skies. Kind of what is already happening in the Global war on Terror with Drones patrolling vast swathes of Islamic Lands, something the Nazis fantasized about doing with the Slavic People. A pathetic shot of Chernobyl, and a Metal Monster ripped straight from the Japanese animes. Talk about Original ideas, this movie has none.Then the movie launches into some sloppy Shia Labeouf job hunting along with some simple-minded relationship building. The girl does all of us a favor by keeping her gob shut most of the time, and performs extremely well as the 'blonde eye-candy', not to mention with what I think is her Australian accent, gives her a half intelligent sway.But of course evil lurks and the simple-minded UN can't be expected to do the right thing and all hell breaks loose on Earth. Fortunately the Plot is feeble enough that even if you missed half the movie, you would still feel right at home no matter where you rejoined it. Then the amazing Hollywood 'big money' goes into effect. The destruction of Chicago, and intense, frantic action, one sequence after another. You certainly get your money's worth of any sort of dislike that you might have harbored for Chicago is amply rewarded by its epic destruction. But Shia Labeouf is at hand to save the rest of the World. Of course there is the bad guy with the money, the girl, and the Bots. Cheesy storyline and after the X-Men First Class, another movie that glorifies Revenge and calls for Endless War. Kind of preparing our Youth and our People of what to expect when the Jewish New World Order firmly establishes itself on this Planet. Hollywood is certainly preparing the ground for impressionable minds to be impregnated with ideas of only Death and no Forgiveness. The theme of 'Never Forget' hangs in there. Other than that, the movie is quite enjoyable in the company of popcorn popping young girls. It's definitely a 'School's out for the summer' movie. I give it four stars primarily for its fantastic camera, CGI, and Production. Everything was awesome except for the Story and some of the acting that was absolutely appalling.",4,1,4,3 July 2011
In the Land of Blood and Honey," An excellent movie
","Hi there, saw the movie without reading any prejudiced reviews, and then i was shocked to read the reviews on IMDb. Wow, I see everyone whining about the story, direction, uniforms, medals, etc, etc. But are we all missing the point here? Serbs killed and Muslims died. How hard is that narrative to grasp? Now Angelina is way too classy to portray events in a simplistic manner. Instead she tries to imbue this movie with a surreal romance which is quite convincing. The Serb plays his part wonderfully well, and Alja is simply sensational. I figure that most of these negative reviews written are by opposing Serbs or by uninvolved Westerners. Anyone with an emotional stake in the story of Bosnia will see that Angelina has captured the story beautifully in that short amount of time. The Serbs and the Muslims are shown in their roles quite well. The only part missing was the Bosnian Army, kicking Serbian ass by the time the Dayton accords were signed. In fact the Serbs are shown to be opposing the Dayton accords; however the accords saved the Serbs from a Muslim outright victory. I was actually quite unhappy the way Clinton stepped in to stop Bosnia from being declared an Islamic state, with an 80 percent Muslim population. Hypocrisy and underhandedness keeps Bosnia still on the boil and Angelina has done a marvelous job. Well done darling! A brave Human indeed!",10,8,30,28 May 2012
