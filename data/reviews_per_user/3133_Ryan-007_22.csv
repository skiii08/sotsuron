The Blair Witch Project," I don't know what to believe...
","This movie, I think, was totally overhyped.  The movie was actually pretty funny for the most part.  Watching the three babble on and make stupid jokes at each other was quite entertaining.  It really wasn't that creepy.  I mean the movie as a whole was not creepy at all.  It was just about three students who get lost in the woods and finally get what is coming to them. I have to admit that a few parts did have me frightened, but I frequently laughed at the movie.  The ending was the only truly scary part in the entire thing.  However, you just don't see what exactly happens to them as the camera just drops to the ground and the movie ends.  That kind of left me wanting for more.  I just think that this movie was merely more of 80 minutes comedy and drama, and 10 minutes horror...which hardly makes for a true horror film.  Oh well, at least I had a cute girl that was clinging on me.",5,0,3,18 August 1999
Minority Report," One of Spielberg's best?
","This is one absolute first-rate thriller.  The first noticeable achievement is the excellent way Spielberg portrays the future 50 years from now.  He gives a very accurate description.  Cruise comes back with a great performance after the narcissistic character he played in 'Vanilla Sky.' The build up to the climax to the movie is great, and had me on the edge of my seat.  This movie shows Spielberg's great direction and can easily be ranked as one of his very best movies.  This movie is that good.",Null,0,0,9 July 2002
Training Day," This movie is just tight.
","Denzel Washington is just flat out impressive in this movie.  If I'm correct, this is the first time he has truly acted out an evil character. And what a job he does.  Playing a very convincing role in a movie that goes a bit over the top, he is able to pull it off in style.  Ethan Hawke plays the inexperienced rookie, and he plays his part well.  Even though this movie goes a bit to the extreme, it kind of lets you know where it is going. And takes you along for the ride...with help from Washington no less.",Null,1,12,5 November 2001
Memento," Brilliant, credible, and original.
","I can't give enough praise to this little gem of a movie.  Brilliantly starts from the beginning and end of the plot in two different scenes, and moves forward swiftly and accurate to the climax at the end of the movie. It raises questions at every scene, and while not answering all, gives you enough insight to know what is going on.  Incredibly original in so many ways.Beware, this movie is highly complicated, and you should be ready to remember what happens exactly when, so you can piece together the puzzle later on in the movie.However, a movie that definitely makes you think, and how refreshing that is.",Null,0,1,24 February 2002
Armageddon," It is especially close when you are in the first row.
","Armageddon was one of the movies that was a tossed up by the critics and loved by the public.  When I first saw it, I was in the first row with my neck bent trying to watch the movie.  The theater was packed.  I thought it was a very good movie indeed, with nice special effects.  Only when I watched it at home for the first time, did I really enjoy this movie.  It had a plot, but no one thought that a bunch of rough tough oil drillers could go up and do that.  Maybe they couldn't.  The fact is that it moves you emotionally at the end.  I was sad, but happy at the same time.  I overall enjoyed this movie very much.  I give it an eight.  This movie was up on the sound enhancement too, and that is why I couldn't hear my girlfriend say goodbye when I walked out of the theater.  I didn't care, I went home and iced my neck.",Null,0,1,10 April 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," This is the ultimate showdown
","Terminator 2 probably showcases the best good guy - bad guy duel ever.  The score to this movie really adds so such feeling and you can really get into it.  It really makes the movie something special, just like The Shawshank Redemption or Speed.  Robert Patrick makes an excellent portrayal of a shape shifting cyborg called T-1000.  His facial expression during the entire movie makes him all intimidation.  The plot flows methodically and there aren't any plot holes in the entire thing.  Perfect ending to a perfect movie, I just hope 3 is as good.",Null,1,1,5 March 2000
Saving Private Ryan," An underlying message...
","My mom would tell me, 'Your grandfather was a paratrooper in World War II.' I never had any idea what she meant.  However, after seeing this movie, I now realize the hell that my grandfather went through as he fought for our country.  Steven Spielberg perfectly portrays the pure horror of war and why it should not be viewed as an action packed event.  I was somewhat astonished while I viewed this movie, as many men never even made it to land.  The acting is great, and the war scenes are perfectly, I mean perfectly, done.  I never got to meet my grandfather, as he died of cancer shortly after I was born.  I now realize how brave he really was, and I view him with a lot more respect than I once did.",10,0,0,7 July 1999
Ghostbusters," Up there with the Indiana Jones and Back to the Future series
","Ghostbusters is a one of a kind movie of its time.  This movie takes on the ghost topic from a different angle.  There is no gruesome horror or gory violence, just plain fun.  It is just fun to watch these guys go from zeroes to heroes.  The soundtrack is a very good one for the 80's era.  Every actor gives a good performance in this film, and the plot is a very simple one to follow.  Fun to watch, as it mixes many movie elements into one.  This is a movie that should be enjoyed by people of all ages.",Null,0,0,8 July 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Hard to judge
","Being one of the few people who totally understood the first Mission: Impossible, it's really hard to judge whether this one is better.  First, there is John Woo.  Oh, the visual master that Mr. Woo is.  He kept this movie afloat with his visual camera angles and Xen-like camera movement.  I personally wish Tom Cruise had short hair in this one just like the first one.  The action scenes kick it all over the place, and Cruise moves with more grace in this one.  The soundtrack is ear pleasing also.  This one delivered on many levels, and is ultimately better than the first one.",Null,0,0,30 June 2000
Mission: Impossible," Impossible to understand maybe? I don't think so...
","This movie's complexity just baffles half of the crowd who watches it.  I didn't understand it either the first time, and it left me scratching my head.  When I watched it the second time, I understood it a little better. I started watching it the third time, and everything just clicked.  This movie has a great plot, along with a slick cast.  The action at the C.I.A. center in Langley, Virginia is absolutely great.  I found this movie fun to watch, personally because I'm a Bond fan myself.  You just have to get the gist of things, and then it rolls to an exciting climax...'Red light...green light!!!'",Null,0,0,20 April 1999
Scream 2," This one stands alone, slightly better than 3
","Even though Scream 2 doesn't propel itself to movie slashing greatest, I do think it achieves the effect of a worthy sequel.  There is plenty of killing and plenty of laughs.  The score to Scream 2 is absolutely brilliant, and the music used when Dewey appears at the beginning of the movie is ear catching.  The thrills are there, but of course suffering from the all too predictable outcomes.  The ending in the first was pulled of in fashion, but 2 incorporates too many guns and not enough knives.  Where has the good old slashing gone!  The characters are seemingly better developed, and the plot somewhat makes sense.  A worthy installment in the series that makes you laugh, and makes you scream...most of the time.",Null,0,0,4 March 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Ah, what a ride this one was...
","This is one true action movie.  This movie hits the action from the word 'go' and it never lets up.  I consider this film the best of the series, because there is not a scene that really bores you and has you wishing that it would end.  Don't get me wrong, the other two were good, but I just think that this one stands out from the other two.  Samuel L. Jackson joins the mix and I think that Jeremy Irons is a smart, creative villain.  Willis is as good as usual, but he has seemed to of lost his touch a little.  I think it is pretty fun to watch Jackson and Willis run around New York City, though.  The villain that Irons plays seems a bit more true than the other two.  He knows exactly what he is doing, and he doesn't let things get out of hand.  Excellent ideas were used in this film, and the explosion sequences were top notch.  Great action movie!",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
Jaws," Oh, If only I was alive then
","I surely would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if it was made during my time.  However, I still consider this an excellent movie made by the brilliant Steven Spielberg.  Robert Shaw is probably my favorite actor from those days, and his acting is always dead center.  This does make you think twice about entering the ocean, let me tell you.  The showdown with the men and the shark during the last portion of the movie is well drawn out and is able to keep audiences interested the whole way through.  I couldn't think of a better ending to the movie either.  This movie was great, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good scare.",9,0,1,17 January 2000
The Waterboy," Adam Sandler hits with authority...
","When I first heard that Adam Sandler would be doing this type of movie, I just couldn't wait for it to come out.  I anticipated it everyday, and when the day finally came, it was sold out.  I snuck in.  This movie was hilarious from start to finish.  It is quite stupid I must say, but what do you expect?  The hard hitting action that Sandler displays is great.  Leave your technical issues in the movie store, and rent this movie.  'The Waterboy' does not disappoint.",Null,1,2,24 April 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Steven King wrote this?
","Absolutely the best movie I have seen in my lifetime.  I'm a hardcore action fan, but I sat and watched this movie and never checked the time.  This movie is compelling.  Tim Robbins gives a great performance nonetheless, but it is Morgan Freeman's character that adds such emotion to the movie.  I always catch the movie on TNT and I watch it to the end.  The end is fantastic, and it leaves me with tingles (if you know what I mean). Morgan Freeman's line 'Get busy living, or get busy dying...' is one to remember. He adds so much feeling to the movie, and the entire thing is flawless. There isn't a line or scene out of place in the entire thing.  I sat there thinking hard about the movie for a while, but then I got up and headed to the nearest shop.  That movie was going to be my own.",10,1,2,11 April 1999
Any Given Sunday," This IS hard hitting action
","Any Given Sunday is a behind the scenes look at the light and dark sides of pro football.  This is one of the best 2 1/2 hour movies I have ever seen. It is the best football movie I have ever seen.  All the action and acting is great.  I never got bored with the characters, but I wish that James Woods would have gotten more screen time.  The football scenes are well done, and you really get a feel for what it would be like out on the field. Go see this movie, and if you play football, you will really get a feel for what message this movie is sending.  Keep an eye out for various cameos, but watch out for the post-game locker room scenes.  Some are quite unpleasant, to say the least.  Any Given Sunday combines great action with great acting, and it pulls it off so well, you will really think you are watching the real thing.  Go see it.",9,0,0,24 December 1999
Speed," Slick action that doesn't let up.
","Speed is a great film, right from the start.  The action never lets up, at all.  The explosion with the bus and the freight plane is fantastic. Dennis Hopper makes for a great villain.  Keanu Reeves is great, and so is Sandra Bullock.  She actually adds something to the movie, unlike in Speed 2.  Jeff Daniels adds a good supporting role, too.  Pick this movie up, it will leave you satisfied.",Null,0,1,11 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," I hate to admit it...
","I found this movie rather boring.  I know it has a great plot and great acting, and blah blah blah.  I just couldn't get into this movie.  Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, but I just couldn't help dipping my head in a daze.  Maybe I didn't pay attention, maybe I just didn't care. There was just too much and too little going on during the movie. The little boy can act, but it just didn't give me any feeling.  Plus, the ending for me was crazy and confusing.  I understand it better nowadays, but I still get no satisfaction out of the this movie.  Maybe it's just my seventh sense coming into play.",Null,0,0,29 December 1999
Final Destination," Finally, teens and death come together...again
","No, this movie does not have a mortal killer.  Yes, people get killed.  That is what makes this movie so great.  From the opening scene to the final one. Surprises?  Yes, a whole lot of them.  Expecting to jump out of your seat? Yes, plenty of times.  Think you are going to scream in the theater?  Yes, enough said.  What makes this movie so good is the element of surprise, and the lack of a true killer.  It just happens, and in very crazy ways.  The movie itself is quite graphic.  However, it succeeds on being original.  The acting is all passable, too, which is a bonus in the horror movie column. Catch this movie if you can, it's worth the money.",Null,0,0,29 April 2000
The Matrix," Brilliant...period
","Wow.  This movie completely blew me away.  It was nothing of what I expected it to be at all.  This movie took on a whole different angle than what I supposed, and I never took it seriously.  The visuals are the best I have ever seen.  The plot is so visually stunning, and so engrossing, it is hard not to like this movie.  I love it.  The best action movie I have seen in a long time that actually has a plot that sticks.  The whole machines take over the word thing has been done before (The Terminator), but not in such fashion.  The 'Matrix' is a great push which I found very creative.  The acting is top notch in my opinion, not once did I not feel someone giving it their all.  Great detail and Agent Smith makes one very good villain.  The fight scenes were pulled off with a fashion.  Man, this movie was so great! I can't wait to watch it on DVD.  Flat out 10.",10,0,1,18 October 1999
Gladiator," It gets the adrenaline going...
","Russell Crowe, now that name sounded vaguely familiar to me.  Yeah, he played in a little movie called 'Virtuosity' with co-star Denzel Washington back in 1995.  Now this movie didn't earn very much recognition, but I'm sure Gladiator will.  The movie had me hooked from the beginning with the battle between the Romans and Barbarians.  The panoramic shot of the battle was breathtaking.  Russell Crowe delivers one heck of a performance, as one would say 'whoa'.  I heard myself muttering that word over and over again. The battles are very well done and flow with smooth perfection.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it was definitely fitting, nonetheless.  This movie is a must-see, for movie fans of all genres. Gladiator delivers a bit of everything.  Perfect 10.",Null,0,0,12 June 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I told you...don't call me Junior
","This is the best Indy.  The third installment in the series introduces Indy's father, played by Sean Connery.  A very slick move by the producers, as Connery adds a great deal to this movie.  The movie also introduces how Indy got his hat, his whip, and his hatred toward snakes.  The opening sequence is a very good addition to the movie, and the switch scene from young Indy to the older Indy is great!  I could go on for a while.  This is a movie everybody should see, and enjoy.  One of my favorites.",Null,0,0,6 July 1999
