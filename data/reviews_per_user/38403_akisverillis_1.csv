Conquest 1453," Do not see
","Unfortunately another movie which is trying to change history and which tries to make us think that the Turks are heroes, good lords and that the did not kill, rape, destroy when they conquered Constantinople. Not worth to see, if you are not Turk. Apart from history as for the movie, the effects are premature, the direction is at least bad, there is no script and the performance of the actors and especially from the leading actor is so awful, that if the movie was an American production he would be nominated for a golden razzie. Even if it is a commercial success in Turkey, it is still a tragic movie. Fortunately, there are some good movies from this country, like Honey and Once upon a time in Anatolia, which declare that the Turkish cinema has something good to give apart from garbage.",1,108,217,23 August 2012
