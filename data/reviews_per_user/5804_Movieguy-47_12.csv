The Blair Witch Project," Sometimes eerie, but never scary
","I walked into the highly-anticipated, mostly well-received 'The Blair Witch Project' expecting a terrifying little movie about three student filmmakers who are hunted by an evil entity in the backwoods of Maryland.Boy, was I wrong. I mean, that's the basic outline of the film, but, to me, 'The Blair Witch Project' was more of a survive-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, distinctly amateurish indie flick.We never really get to know the three college kids (unless you count their foul-mouthed comments and antics as character development). And, come on, as a member of the so-called 'Generation X' group of kids, would we really stand around and drool whenever we found out that there was no way out of here and that we were going to die? I don't think so. I think we would've put up a fight. We might not have won, but we would have certainly died trying.In short, 'The Blair Witch Project' is sometimes eerie, but never scary. I suppose this is one of those movies that is meant to be more psychologically stirring than, say, the cat-jumps-out-from-the-corner genre filmmaking. Still, I didn't have any trouble sleeping, as some supposedly did. Rated R. 82 minutes. 4 out of 10.",4,0,2,1 August 1999
Vertigo," Shock Time
","This may come as a shock to some people reading this, but I'm quite a big Hitchcock fan and 'Vertigo,' in my opinion, is not his best film. 'Rear Window' is the finest feature he ever made, and 'Psycho' was his most purely entertaining (although I would rank the famous horror film third, after 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo').James Stewart plays a private detective who is hired to follow a beautiful blond (Kim Novak) whom he quickly falls in love with. She commit suicide (or did she?) and, later on in the film, the Stewart character finds the glowing image of her in an equally beautiful redhead. I won't give away anything else.Now don't get me wrong, 'Vertigo' is a near-excellent film that I love and cherish. Most 'Vertigo' detractors say the film can be seen from too many different points of views  (surreal dream, detective story, romance, etc.) and that is has no clear narrative flow. Actually, I like that aspect of the movie. My problem with 'Vertigo' is a more primitive one; I just think the buildup to the blond's suicide is too long and worked up. 'Vertigo' may be a near-great movie, but it's not one I could watch over and over again. Not Rated. 128 minutes. 9 out of 10.",10,3,4,31 July 1999
The Big Lebowski," Respectable Raunch
","The Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) are the most innovative and, perhaps, the best filmmakers working today. Or they at least rank along side the likes of Martin Scorsese and rising director star Quentin Tarantino. Think about it: 'Blood Simple' was the best film of 1984; 'Raising Arizona' was the best film of 1987; 'Miller's Crossing' was the best movie of 1990; 'Barton Fink' was the best movie of 1991; and 'Fargo' was the best movie of 1996. Now comes their latest effort, 'The Big Lebowski,' which, while it isn't in quite the same league as the above films, is still one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies of 1998.It tells the shambling story of a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself The Dude (Jeff Bridges). The Dude's apartment gets broken into and a thief urinates on his rug. He finds out that the criminals were not looking for him, but looking for the OTHER Jeff Lebowski, the disabled millionaire (played by David Huddleston). That's all I can tell you. The rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words; but it's bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the words.Still, what I'll remember most about 'The Big Lebowski' is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances. Bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lie-about who just wants to be left alone. John Goodman is the real comic gem here as the forever-loudmouthed Walter, The Dude's bowling partner and best friend. Steve Buscemi co-stars as the dimwitted, bug-eyed Donny, the third bowling partner; there's a small but interestingly offbeat spot for Julianne Moore; and John Torturro stops in, as Jesus the bowler, for what is probably the best walk-on performance in years. If you are a Coen brothers fan or like humor that is distinctly offbeat, you have found your movie. As a rather avid moviegoer, I found the film to be a great excersise in pointless extremeties and respectable raunch. Rated R. 117 minutes. 10 out of 10.",Null,159,294,29 July 1999
Notting Hill," Charming and Enjoyable
","Roger Michell's 'Notting Hill,' from a screenplay by Richard ('Four Weddings and a Funeral') Curtis is a charming, engaging little movie that fortunately gets saddled with two stars with real chemistry. Julie Roberts plays, somewhat ironically, a famous American movie star who, through a series of enjoyable contrivances, keeps running into a foppish, handsome travel bookstore owner (played by Hugh Grant). The screenplay is rather stereotypical, but Curtis doesn't write these two characters off; they are intelligent, literate, and we get a sense that they truly fall for one another. My major quip towards the film was that I did not care for the ending; it's the same old thing and, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of it. Rated PG-13. 123 minutes. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,6 August 1999
BASEketball," Sophomoric but funny
","David Zucker's 'BASEketball' is sloppy and extremely uneven, it has a sophomoric look to it; yet there's still a few really big laughs in it that are worth a screening. It stars the creators of the controversial cartoon show, 'South Park,' played by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. From this film, and it's extremely uneven edge, it's pretty unclear to tell whether these two have a talent beyond that of two high school impromptu students. Still, 'BASEketball' is worth it for a few undeniably big laughs, especially a few genuinely funny segments with Robert Stack satirizing his 'Unsolved Mysteries' persona. Rated R. 103 minutes. 6 out of 10.",Null,1,2,2 August 1999
Reservoir Dogs," A Few Good Ideas
","Before the brilliant 'Pulp Fiction' and the epic 'Jackie Brown,' writer-director Quentin Tarantino burst onto the independent films scene with this morbid little piece of filmmaking called 'Reservoir Dogs.' It tells the terribly unpleasant story of a few chatty thugs, with color-coded names, who assemble in an abandoned warehouse after a jewel heist goes terribly wrong. Loud arguments, gun-fights, and a nasty little torture scene ensue. Still, Tarantino had a few good ideas, and I'll give him that. Narrative through flashback was done with a clever flair and I did like the way Tarantino chose to have all his characters lacking morals (even the 'blue rat'), so we wouldn't be forced to sympathize with any one of them. That's all that 'Reservoir Dogs' really is though, a few good ideas but a genuinely unpleasant moviegoing experience. Rated R. 99 minutes. 4 out of 10.",4,3,6,30 July 1999
Scream 2," An Even Better 'Scream'
","'Scream 2' is a hip, funny, and scary sequel to a movie that made big bucks and got good critical reception because it was about teenagers in a horror movie who knew they were in a horror movie.Now, in 'Scream 2,' those surviving characters have gone off to college, and have seen a movie called 'Stab' about their terrifying, tragic days back at home. Unfortunately for college student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), more gruesome killings have been committed and the threatening phone calls have started yet again.Which did I like more? Well, I personally liked the comedy element over the horror, so I'd say that 'Scream 2: The Sequel'  is better than 'Scream' in my opinion. Once again, writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven have created a neat showcase for a couple of kids that know all the angles of the horror movie sequel they find themselves in. Rated R. 116 minutes. 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
Scream," Something to 'Scream' About
","Wes Craven's 'Scream' is a horror movie with a difference: the characters in it have watched (and know all the cliches of) horror movies. The film was written by Kevin Williamson, whom was paid a rumoredly very large sum for his horror-comedy screenplay called 'Scary Movie,' and it's easy to see why. On paper, this is a movie with scares and a surprise abundance of laughs and in-jokes; it's a crowd-pleaser and a critic-pleaser as well. Miramax bought it, a famous director was attached to it, and the title was changed. The rest was history.It tells the story of Sidney (played by Neve Campbell), who begins receiving threatening phone calls from a ghost-masked killer that quickly begins slashing the local teenagers. The movie also stars, among others, David Arquette (as a dim-witted policeman), Courtney Cox (as a nosy reporter), Skeet Ulrich (as The Boyfriend), and Drew Barrymore (as a possible victim).The plot in 'Scream' is definitely pretty standard and plays out just the way we expect it to; it has fun letting us guess who the killer really is. And the standardness of the plot is really more of a tool than a setback. By showing us a typical horror movie plot with a rather typical outcome, screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven have come up with a worthy showcase for kids who know all the angles of the movie genre they find themselves in. Rated R. 111 minutes. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
Halloween," A Genuinely Frightening Film
","I am one of the few that is reluctant to call the film a classic, but John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is a genuinely frightening moviegoing experience. (What also helps is Carpenter's chilling piano musical score, proving that less can be a whole lot more.)It tells the simple yet extremely well-directed story of a young boy who stabs his sister and then grows to become a masked murderer named Michael Myers (played by Nick Castle). Once he is an adult, fifteen years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown to kill again. His hopeful victim shall be Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).Carpenter's talent is clearly evident here, and it's easy to see why he went on to make a big (if not always well-received) splash in Hollywood. And his low-budget shocker 'Halloween' is, once again, a truly frightening experience. Rated R. 93 minutes. 9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,29 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Excellent Ghost Thriller
","THE SIXTH SENSE. M. Night Shaymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is an enjoyable ghost thriller, sometimes funny, sometimes creepy, and surprisingly rewarding. Bruce Willis is excellent as a child psychologist named Malcom Crowe whose latest patient is a nine-year-old kid named Cole (played stupendously Haley Joel Osment) who claims that he can see dead people. What follows is an intriguing and effective chiller that relies much more on characters than special effects. Rated PG-13. ***1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Rear Window," The Epitome of Hitchcock
","Alfred Hitchcock reached the epitome of his career with a clever little thriller named 'Rear Window' (1954), about a temporarily disabled photographer (played by James Stewart) who is convinced he saw one of his apartment neighbors commit a murder. I shall not reveal anything else; you really should see this one for yourself.I've been trying to come up with a list of the ten greatest Hitchcock films, but I haven't been happy with one yet. For sure, though, I can tell you my numbers one, two, three, four, and ten. 'Rear Window' is his best, his epitome; 'Vertigo' is his second; 'Psycho' is his third and most purely entertaining work; 'Rebecca' is his fourth best picture; and I'm pretty sure my ten spot is going to remain with 'Rope,' Hitchcock's great experimental, ten minute shots film. Not Rated. 113 minutes. 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,31 July 1999
The Truman Show," Not What It Seems
","Jim Carrey gives a tour de force performance as an insurance salesman named Truman Burbank. He is surprisingly restrained, enjoyably funny, and shockingly touching.'The Truman Show' itself is a shockingly touching piece of filmmaking. Even if you know the controversial 'Secret of the Show,' it's still utterly heartfelt as we root for Truman to find out his proper place in the world and not let anyone get in his way.The film was impressively directed by Peter Weir on an epic scale, from an epic script by Andrew Niccol. More importantly, though, this movie deserves to be seen because Jim Carrey gives what might be the single best performance of the year, or at least a very close second to Jeff Bridges as The Dude in the Coen brothers' thoroughly entertaining 'The Big Lebowski.' Not to give away anything significant, but when Truman finds the 'wall' and decides to make the 'exit,' we remain utterly still and hopeful. And when the 'exit' is made, we feel the triumph of a human being. Rated PG. 102 minutes. 10 out of 10.",Null,0,0,29 July 1999
