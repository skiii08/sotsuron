Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Worst movie ever
","The first part of Kill Bill was good, I say good, not excellent or anything, it was OK, you had to keep your brains aside to watch it, but at least it provided us with stunning action sequences, which although defied logic were fun to watch.But this sequel is totally absurd, it defies logic totally and there's not much action, only about 10% of the movie is action the rest 90% is pure BS talk, which doesn't provide any drama, it is not intelligent at all! I'm not saying I don't like movies which have a lot of talking and no action, but this movie is really awful, it will bore the hell out of you.There are so many plot holes, But I can't point them out as I may be blacklisted for posting a spoiler.I am a person who loves these movies - The Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Enemy at the Gates, etc.. I'm not the Alien vs. Predator type movie buff.I give this movie a 1 out of 10. I bought this movie seeing its 8/10 score. It doesn't deserve a 8. I have never commented on a movie on IMDb before, but I hated this movie so much that I could not resist posting about it.It doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 movies of all times. I agree with the rest of the movies there, they really deserve to be there. I'm really disappointed to see this movie there. I just can't comprehend how did IMDb users trate this piece of 'you know what' this high??!!!",1,5,10,23 February 2007
