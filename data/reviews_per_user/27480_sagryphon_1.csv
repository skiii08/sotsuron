Sucker Punch," I wish I could give this title a zero
","Worst piece of garbage I've ever seen! What a waste of time. I wish I could give it a zero, but IMDb doesn't allow that unfortunately. Cool graphics, costumes, scenery, makeup, sure... but the story makes no sense and is just awful. Two hours of my life I'll never get back.I went to this movie with a friend and he got tickets through his work. It was before the movie was officially released. We both wanted to walk out so badly, but couldn't because his bosses and co-workers were there and we didn't want to be rude. Just save your time and watch something else instead.",1,3,12,29 June 2013
