Angels & Demons," Great Movie
","Just saw the movie and it's great... even better than the Da Vincci Code I would say. For those who read the book, it might be surprising and exciting to see it, nice opportunity to bring your imagination into 'reality' and to give you the desire to read it again ! And for those who did not yet, I'm sure the first thought is: if the movie is so nice then how about the book, for me it's a good reason to read it. The pace of action was pretty amazing and the music was great. Tom Hanks was as expected the smart, funny and brave American expert! Few scenes are in some way chocking to see, but not that much. The story is also pretty nice, mostly because it's including many original monuments in Rome and in the Vatican Area. I would not expect too much critics as it was the case for Da Vincci even if I think that this time the issue is as important as the other one when it comes to questioning the Church faith. The final shot is amazing, It let me think for a while about the judgment day !!!",9,6,18,13 May 2009
