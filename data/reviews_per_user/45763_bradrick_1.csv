The Blair Witch Project," Very unsettling movie.
","The Blair Witch Project's strength comes from the fact that the audience is watching the story play out as it actually occurs - instead of the gratuitous, studio-ized, inane dialogue the movie going public is patronized with too often in horror movies today.   The humor is real, the paranoia is real, the lines are real. With the exception of the scene where the ill-fated three encounter a couple of idiot fishermen, the movie plays its hand with stealth-like reserve. These kids are walking into their doom.  But who or what is waiting for them in the woods is not the magic of any Hollywood studio and refreshingly for that matter, neither is the script.Not a perfect film, Blair Witch makes up for its shortcoming in its originality and its ability to conjure up excruciating tension.  It's like sitting in the dentist chair and waiting for him to come in for an hour and 20 minutes.   And then when he does, he just grabs the drill and turns off the lights - and leaves you there.  Even though that would piss you off, it'd still scare the crap outta you!",Null,1,1,26 July 1999
