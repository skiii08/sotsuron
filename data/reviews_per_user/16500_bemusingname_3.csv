Alien 3," Give it another go
","This review relates to the special edition on the Quadrilogy box set**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS BELOW** SPOILERS**SPOILERSWhat can i say, i love this film. Right from the beginning you know that it's going to be nothing like Aliens, it feels like more of a sequel then Aliens in spirit and atmosphere. Everything has been stripped right down and is almost raw. Ripley has been stripped of anything that gave her comfort, hicks, newt, bishop, the film even goes so far to take her hair. She looks sick, like a patient suffering a terminal illness, and as the film progresses we find out that it is terminal and the alien queen grows inside like a cancer. She is the only one left, Hicks and Newt are long dead, even their names have slipped away as they become simply the child and the man.Reversing Ripleys decay is the birth of a new alien, perversely bursting from a dead ox. The alien is different now, moving on all fours, even more animal like and further removed from anything human. As the films progress through the series the connection between Ripley and the alien becomes stronger and stronger. In this film she carries part of it with her and now in a reverse of what has gone before she is not at risk from the outside threat, only that which is growing inside herThis film was clearly a difficult birth and this anguish and difficulty is all up on the screen. Here's a film which began shooting with no concrete script having been greenlighted on a different concept. It's only the skill of the director Fincher and the excellent cast which hold it together. The film is infused with the dark grimy view that became famous in Se7en, The Game and fightclub. Only here it was years ahead of its time and unacceptable to audiences after the whizz-bang wow factor of Aliens with its gung hung macho chestbeating. The accusation that it's just a bunch of identical looking bald british blokes running round in the dark is one made out of the great ignorance. The film may have been made without a clear script but Finchers visual style still gives it structure and substance. An excellent score underpins the emotional content of the film.This film is unforgiving, there is nothing to uplift you or give you hope. Ripley seems doomed from the moment the film begins and the ending seems a perfect full stop to the trilogy, spoilt by the horrendous and unforgivable Alien Resurrection. Watch the DVD extras on the other disc, it gives an insight about what Fincher was trying to do and what the fox executives were trying to do. The ignorance of the two execs that give interviews is astounding and their defence of their 'creative decisions' makes for good watching. If you saw this film on its cinema release and hated it nows the time to give it another go, it might surprise you.",Null,1,3,21 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Running zombies are very scary
","MASSIVE SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERSThis is a big budget remake of the 1978 George A. Romero classic and because it's the new millenium it comes slicker than an oiled weasel. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, the original is the better version but it does something different being more a statement of american consumerism than a straightforward horror film. This remake pretty much discards this in favour of jump out your seat shocks and lashings of gore.A young nurses life is destroyed overnight by the advancing hordes of the living dead, she barely escapes from her zombified partner and hooks up with a tough cop and a young couple expecting a baby amongst others. They eventually end up seeking shelter in a local mall with the dead waiting outside for them in ever increasing numbers.Gone are the blue faced shambling corpses of before and in their place are the screaming rotting RUNNING turbo zombies. A lot of people are complaing about these next generation zombies saying they're not scary. In my mind if you're not terrified by the decomposing corpse of a loved one running at you at high speed to chew your face off then there's not much in this life that holds fear for you. Personally i find them terrifying even if they have been lifted straight from '28 Days Later'.The movie is well paced, it doesn't waste anytime at the start and in doing this conveys the speed at which society collapses in the face of the zombie threat. The characters have no time to take stock or reflect as they flee and neither do we. Things slow down slightly as we reach the mall, many new characters are introduced including the obnoxious and possible slightly unhinged CJ and his security goons. Some of the new characters are somewhat pointless (old man and red lipstick girl anyone?) and by making the survivors group too large we loose time with the characters that we are meant to care about (Sarah Polleys nurse and Ving Rhames Cop for instance).
The film goes it own way and doesn't stick closely to the originals plot. There is no biker gang, in this film the threat comes staight from the zombies. For a relatively inexperienced director this is a good move, given the films tone it would have felt clumsy to have shifted the focus onto a human conflict midway through. The only thing that leaves a slightly bad taste in the mouth is the inconsistancy of some of the characters, it's almost as if the second half of the script underwent some major changes without the first half being revised afterwards. CJ's character changes midway through from difficult controlling dimissive gun toting security nut to heroic save the day self sacrificing good guy. I don't know if scenes were cut showing some sort of character development but this doesn't seem to ring true. Another female character after being level headed for most of the film sacrificies the safety of the whole group to rescue a dog which has been with them for a very short period of time.The films final two or three minutes are the most effective with a blair witch style camcorder section. These last minutes give a confusing snap shot of the groups progress after the mall ending with a....well i won't spoil it but let's just say those last shots stayed with me long after the film ended.In conclusion this film does exactly what it says on the tin, scares the bejeezus out of you for about two hours. If you want ironic post modernism humour go rent scream or something, if you want your horror with a dash of social and political statement then rent the original. If you want to soil yourself with terror in a cinema along with the rest of the audience and see a chainsaw make a welcome return to the genre then go see this.

The Matrix Revolutions," Everything that has a beginning has an end (thankfully)
","Warning ** SPOILERS ** Warning **SPOILERS ** Warning ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** DIRECTLY BELOW AND THROUGHOUT WHOLE REVIEW ** SPOILERSI've just seen this film within the last hour or so. Wow! At the end of reloaded i was left thinking...how did neo stop the sentinels? How did agent smith escape to the 'real' world? I thought of many possible answers, a matrix within a matrix, the humans actually keeping the machines in control...this film excelled and came up with an explanation that i hadn't even thought of, Neo is magic. What a twist! I never saw that one coming, and to top it off so is agent Smith. I almost choked on my cheese covered nachos! How did they come up with that, this beats all films as best...twist...ever. I was on the edge of my seat during the fight in the city, thankfully none of the main characters were in much peril (they were out pod racing) so i was spared some grief but i'd grown fond of 'the kid' and the 'shouty guy' and the 'skinhead lady' during the 30 seconds or so screen time they'd had prior to the battle and i really really cared if they lived or died.And at the end there was a rainbow thing in the sky and i was like...that's totally cool dude...cos rainbows are like my favourite refraction of light through a dense medium weather effect (next to mirages) but also it showed me that everything was going to be alright (just like real rainbows). And like i can't wait for matrix four cos like the war's only a truce and neo isn't dead (maybe) so like he could come back and do kung foo and smith could come back again, it would so awesome, he could fight like 100000000000000000 agent smiths at once!I'm sorry, this film has actually lowered my IQ significantly, only time will tell if this is permanent, in short a turgid piece of cinema. It also steals all its good ideas from early Brian De Palma films, Brian first came up with the idea of silly clothing, unrealistic dialogue and sexy dancing being watched through a telescope from across the valley",1,1,1,5 November 2003
