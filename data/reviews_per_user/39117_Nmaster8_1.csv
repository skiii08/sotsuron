Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't believe the hype
","I can't believe how many people like this movie. Seems to me like Sacha Baron Cohen just compiled a bunch of Jackass skits in an attempt to get real people to give entertaining responses. That's why this man is getting sued.The film has the most basic premise as Borat's motivation: traveling cross country to hunt down his Baywatch beauty, Pamela Anderson. I think I saw a similar plot in Britney Spears's Crossroads movie (also not good).Borat makes a fool of himself in several social situations including dinner parties, feminist meetings, rodeos, church gatherings, mortgage meetings, etc. I don't find his brand of humor funny. Most of his antics would cause real people to get arrested and punished.***SPOILER*** There is also a scene with Borat and his large friend Azamat running naked through a hotel. It's perhaps the nastiest depiction of naked male anatomy I have ever seen. That's not a good thing and just another reason that this movie scores an abysmal 1.0.",1,281,567,24 November 2006
