Airlift," Don't expect too much. It's not a Baby or Argo!!
","The plot had so much to offer but the makers were not able to capitalize on it. They just narrated how Indians were evacuated from Kuwait when it was invaded by Iraq. Performances, sets and camera work is first grade but the screenplay doesn't hold your attention. You never get tensed about the whole situation, can't remember if there were any edge of the seat moments. The movie was just not as intense as you expect when you go to watch a movie that deals with the backdrop of crisis during a war. But still I would say it's good effort overall and deserves a watch. It will make you feel good about the country when there is so much negativity going around.",5,2,12,23 January 2016
Uri: The Surgical Strike," I am really concerned about our Defence if what was shown is true
","To start with 16th December was a much better movie if you compare the intelligence of that film with URI, border was much more patroitic and baby had more thrilling edge of the seats moments. When watching a film like URI, you expect it to have three key elements: Intelligence, Patroitism and Thrill. But URI is a average film in all three departments. People are just blindly giving amazing reviews just because I guess its a different film.Two spoilers:
We painted our helicopters in Pakistani colors to enter in Pakistan without getting noticed..isn't that funny. And even pakistan who is always show to have a weaker intelligence than India gets to know about this funny plan.DRDO chief was shown running stupidly for flying a eagle like looking drone which an intern created and this drone help us to win the war. Although the drone didn't work flawlessly and almost captured the attentions of enemies. But the point is drones these are used to attack and we are still struggling with creating a drone and our DRDO head doesn't even realize its importance.Well if these two things are truely depicted then I am seriously concerned about our defence and intelligence. Otherwise you understand why I am calling URI an average film.",5,6,18,27 January 2019
