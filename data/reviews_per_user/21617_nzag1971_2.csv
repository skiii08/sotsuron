10 Cloverfield Lane," Very predictable
","From the very first moment, the plot is very predictable and full of holes. Even though the acting is good you don't really care for the characters as you can pretty much tell what is going to happen to happen to them.The acting is very good and it makes the movie less boring.Some people complain about the ending. Well, you can't control a person's heart or mind especially during such events.If you haven't seen 'The Divide', go watch it. It is a much better movie.You won't regret it.",7,0,2,10 April 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Plain vanilla but still enjoyable.
","Before viewing this movie you should understand two things and answer a question for yourself.1) You are going to see a *science fiction* movie. 2) Science fiction: noun <u> (INFORMAL sci-fi, ALSO SF) books, films or cartoons about an imagined futureQuestion: Are you going to view this movie because you like sci-fi or because it is just another blockbuster?The film's plot is somewhat predictable. The acting is mediocre but the actors don't have much to work with. The dialogs are what you'd expect them to be for this type of movie with all the phrases that you can now recite by heart. The computer generated graphics are very good but unfortunately a little overused.Still it is an enjoyable movie as long as you like sci-fi or mass destruction movies.If you don't like these types of movies then avoid it at all costs.</u>",7,0,0,8 June 2004
