The King's Speech," All the Qualities You Hope For in a Great Film
","This is an excellent film about one thing: a man who overcomes a problem that has plagued him all his life and that interferes with his ability to function as the King of England. There is no romance, no action, no mystery, no sub-plot. But despite its limited focus, the movie works beautifully. It is moving, funny, sad, triumphant,historically accurate, and lovely to look at. The screen-play, acting, photography, etc. are about perfect.The 'R' rating is for two brief scenes with coarse language; the rest of it is squeaky clean. My husband reluctantly agreed to take me but agreed it was an excellent movie (a 7 out of 10) and was glad he went.",8,0,0,1 January 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," Romance or Bi-polar disorder--Movie with an Identity crisis
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment. The plot is unsure of itself, the acting adequate but not great, and the Philadelphia Eagles angle is poorly executed.We meet Pat right off the bat when his mother shows up at the mental hospital to take him home, where we then meet his father (Robert DeNiro). Within ten minutes their characters are easily discernible-- mom is the peacemaker; dad is OCD, a huge Eagles fan, and prone to get in a fight or two. Pat is bi-polar, refuses to take any medication, and is living in a constant state of anxiety.The mental illness at the heart of the first half of the film disappears about the time Pat agrees to take medication, at which point it becomes a romance. (supposedly it's a comedy too, but until the closing scenes there was little that was laugh-worthy). Pat begins a relationship(refreshingly chaste) with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), agreeing to be her dance partner in an upcoming competition in exchange for her doing him a favor regarding his ex-wife.The second half of the movie is dominated by a combination of Eagles football, which Pat's father worships, and the growing friendship between Pat and Tiffany. Unfortunately, none of the Eagles drama rings true if you live in the Philly area, as I do. Philadelphians have a distinct accent which goes undetected in DeNiro's portrayal.Sadly the schizophrenic plot, the stilted and rough execution of lines, and the lack of a genuine Philly feel outweigh the the satisfactory ending. Overall, this film was not horrible, but not very good either. I can only guess that the Academy smiled upon Silver Linings Playbook because of the mental health angle. Wish that had been more fully explored within the context of the second half of the film.The 'R' rating is for a conversation in the diner between Pat and Tiffany regarding a sexual experience she had, for partial nudity in a flashback scene, and for numerous uses of the f-word.",5,2,5,6 May 2013
Mamma Mia!," Are you kidding me?
","I absolutely loved Abba when I was a teenager in the late 70's. With the big names in this movie, I assumed it would be at least average and maybe even good.Sadly, this movie is a huge disappointment. I'm searching for the right words without being too critical, but frankly, they don't exist. No plot, no (singing) talent, and no satisfactory ending. Hard to believe Meryl Street, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth stooped to this level. Without them the movie would have been laughed out of Hollywood.Please don't waste your $$. Buy an old Abba CD instead and enjoy the real thing.Unbelievable.",2,9,14,20 March 2009
Inception," A Smart Sci-Fi/Action Movie without Much Warmth
","Inception is one of those movies that allows the story to develop and build. In the first 20 or 30 minutes I had absolutely no idea what was going on or where the movie was heading, but part of the movie's appeal is to try to figure those things out. And after 30 minutes you have enough of an idea to want to stick around for the rest. Unlike some, my husband and I didn't have any trouble discerning the dream sequences from reality once the movie got going.There are two things that are appealing about this movie: 1: The complicated and unique storyline and 2. The acting chops of every single person--not just DiCaprio. I think these things are driving the high ratings. However, the movie has flaws: 1. Lacks any depth of personal relationship of the characters to one another. 2. One of the main characters (Saito) speaks with an accent that is very difficult to understand. 3. There are a LOT of things in the last 1/3 of the movie that don't really make sense once you think them through. 4. Poor sound quality and way too much shooting and car chasing.It was worth seeing once, but don't expect anything more than a sci-fi/action film because it doesn't deliver anything beyond that.",6,3,7,31 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Save Your Money--boring, boring, boring
","What's wrong with this film? The plot line is dull and fragmented. Way too much screen time is spent on various ridiculous fight scenes. The lighting is very dark in the film, with lots of dull colors used in scene after scene. Rachel McAdams, who has a relatively small part, is the only character who offers any kind of visual color. The accents used by the actors can be hard to understand.The ending is a set-up for a second movie, but I don't expect this one will generate enough of a following to warrant a part two.Wish I could say something positive, but honestly, it's dull and not worth the time or money. Then again, as a forty-something mom maybe I'm just not the demographic at whom the movie was aimed.",3,28,55,25 December 2009
Atonement," A good movie but not great
","With all the rave reviews of Atonement, I was surprised to be only mildly impressed. After viewing the movie I re-read the comments of others, and it seems that those who read the book prior to seeing the film have the highest praise. For those who haven't read the book, like myself, the story became confusing at times.The first third of the movie, which takes place in a beautiful English house, is definitely a perfect 10--the sets, the acting, the characters, etc.--all contribute to a sense of anticipation about what's to come.Possible spoiler: After one of the main characters is falsely accused and taken to jail, the movie breaks down. The sets and acting continue to be amazing, but the story doesn't hold together. There is one scene which is so confusing and non-sensical (Ce, Robbi, and Briony in Ce's apartment) as to be distracting. This scene is later explained by an older version of Briony toward the very end of the movie, but to be honest, I was so distracted trying to figure out the scene that I couldn't get back into the story.I suspect the book is amazing, because the concept of the story is brilliant--the actions we take can have devastating effects on others. But the limited character development early on prevents a viewer from feeling complete sympathy with them as they move through their lives and through the consequences of Briony's lie. For example, the relationship between Ce and Robbi is (spoiler) given to us as a sexual relationship with mere hints that it's more than that, yet the rest of the story requires us to believe they had a deep, deep love for each other. And we're never sure why Briony (spoiler) tells the lie that she does--what is her motivation? Was she jealous of her sister? Of Robbi? Better character development and less confusion would have made this movie a 10 in my opinion.Read the book first and then you'll probably love it.",6,0,1,3 January 2008
