Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not without its flaws, but certainly an ENJOYABLE ride.
","I went into this movie fully aware of some of the criticisms that have been posted.  There are some awkward dialog moments for sure.  However, those are quickly erased from your mind as you taken in the lush and rich visual and audio effects.There are enough interesting lines that could link into the future story to keep you pondering on what will be next in the Star Wars Universe. Undoubtly, it will be another great film.  Just remember, we only know about 4/6 of the story.  I suspect we are in for a good ride.",9,0,0,25 May 1999
