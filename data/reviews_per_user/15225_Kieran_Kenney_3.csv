Scarface," atrocious garbage
","beware: spoilersI'm probably going to get hate mail for this, but I just had to say that I thought this was one of the single most atrocious wastes of celluloid ever screened for a paying audience. And I'm willing to defend that statement. Between it's poor direction, sloppy editing, tacky music and gag-inducing acting, it's incomprehensible to my why this movie is loved so rabidly by so many people. I don't get it.This has to be the worst entry in the genre. A 1907 Mutoscope two-reeler has got to be more intelligent and convincing than this.This movie stands as a perfect example of how bad the 1970's were in terms of clothes, hair, music and nightclubs. The whole thing is an exercise in poor taste. Pacino, in particular, is disgustingly bad as the main character. Even if your not supposed to like him, why the f*** are you supposed to care about him in any way? That goes for just about any other character in the film.I guess people are shocked by this movie. I thought the torture-by-chainsaw scene was one of the funniest things ever. And I almost never laugh at violence. The final battle fails to be even remotely interesting or effective. If anything it's exploitative.And then I must come back to the fact that you can never, ever, ever understand at all anything that comes out of Al Pacino's mouth. And why is he constantly breaking out in a sweat? How is it he seems to age some twenty or so years, but his buddy (who he later shoots) doesn't age a day?Everything in the film falls flat. The action scenes are particularly embarrassing to watch. There's one scene, set during a riot in a slum, that reeks of TV-movie syndrome.For a good movie about organized crime, I recommend: The Public Enemy, Road to Perdition, Little Caesar, Angels with Dirty Faces, Miller's Crossing, and, for sure, the original Scarface, with Paul Muni in the title role. This was one film that didn't need to get extended, updated, modernized or remade. Thank you.",Null,1,3,24 February 2004
Battleship Potemkin," Outstanding but overrated work. Eisenstein's other work is much more interesting.
","The first time I saw Potemkin, I must have been around 12, and Ibet it was the first silent drama I'd seen, after Metropolis. I hated it.I saw it recently again, along with a couple of other Eisensteinpictures. While I felt that Strike and October were both superiorfilms, I really liked Potemkin a lot more.Now, also I understand more some of the things Eisenstein wasdoing with editing and camera work. I would like to point out, tothose who say Eisenstein invented 'montage', that D.W. Griffithwas doing the same thing ten years earlier. Extreme close-upscame around in 1903, with films like The Gay Shoe Clerk. Tracking shots are in a huge number of films predating this film byalmost a decade (Intolerance, Cabiria). No, Eisenstein did notinvent these visual tools. Nor did he really perfect them (I doubtanyone has truly done that). What he did was try to utilize them tocreate a stirring and powerful cinematic experience, which hecertainly did.One thing I love about Eisenstein's films is his use of 'types',really distinctive-looking actors. The citizens of Odessa lookfascinating, especially the wealthy-looking woman with the veiledhat. The ship's creepy-looking, bearded and mustachioed doctorwas very effective as an evil presence just asking to be overthrown.Eisenstein also provides us with plenty of beefy, sexy sailors,which you really can't complain about. Those opening scenes arepretty hot, if you ask me.So, overall, this is a good film. I like the acting, the camerawork,the editing. However, I wish film professors would stop showingthe Odessa steps sequence in their classes. Young students withno understanding of Soviet cinema will watch that and promptlygive up on the genre. The scene feels clumsy and disconnectedtoday, and plays on the common misperception that all silent filmwas overstated gesturing and unrealistic character decisions. Atleast they're not showing them Earth (I hope).",Null,17,34,2 January 2004
Pride & Prejudice," an example to it's genre
","One can feel daunted by the task of taking in a two hour chamber dramedy of manners, where the focus of excitement tends to fall not on a character's chance of heart but on their next chance of wardrobe. It's common enough to see such a project with lots of entrances and exits with bowing and curtsying, giggling girls and stiff men with overgrown sideburns, a lead actress who's obviously too old, and a night interior which the light coming from the fireplace illuminates the room a little too evenly.With that in mind I was consistently surprised by this version of the Jane Austen novel. The dialog-reliant tale of romantic misunderstanding and class relations has been made into a film that is faithful at least in spirit, but is refreshing in it's presentation.Casting is key. The Bennett family, at the center of the story, is a wonderful example in itself of ensemble acting when it works. A mix of seasoned professionals and new faces (though mostly the former), there is wonderful chemistry between them.Kiera Knightly's portrayal of Lizzie, the central character, is marvelous. Knightly, a talented and achingly gorgeous creature, has everything it takes to place herself in both the character and the time period, while remaining a real, identifiable point of reference for the character. Some of her mannerisms seem a bit modern and unusual for this type of film. When she meets a handsome male character for the first time, she sneaks a peak at his bottom. It may not sound very significant, but moments such as that, and there are many, give her character the truth, the timelessness, it needs. This skill extends to many of her fellow performers. True to the time, accessible to modern eyes, timeless. Many scenes have the breeze and honestly of a superior teen comedy.The camera-work, by Roman Osin, is equally exemplary. The camera moves quite frequently, more than one would expect. The colors register beautifully, particularly in outdoor scenes. And perhaps the most inventive scene of all would be the one with the swing at the gate. (If you want to see what I mean, you'll just have to go and see it. I can't do it justice with a description)Don't forget, of course, that this is still a period film, and it does still feature many of the hallmarks (some might say pitfalls) of the genre. Personally I enjoy such films even if they do consist mostly of medium shots of Emma Thompson in a corset, suffering by the window. There is the presence of Dame Judi. Nothing against her, she is a predictable presence, though a welcome enough one. The men in the film are also stock character types, but this may be something to accept. After all, it's women's film.I would not suggest this film to a casual viewer, but I do advise seeing the film to anyone with a decent attention span and an open mind. In some small but enchanting ways, it's a fresh take on a classic story and a genre known for being predictable. Hopefully we will be seeing more from it's director, Joe Wright, very soon.",9,3,7,6 June 2006
