The Avengers," Ten out of Ten
","Ten out of TenI along with my friend went to watch this movie on the basis of IMDb reviews. And boy !! The reviews didn't disappoint us. Why I was not having too much expectations on this movie  1. 6 Heroes !! Its very difficult to give enough screen time to all of them and at the same time keep the pace of the movie as well. (Spider Man 3 was a classic example of this goof up) 2. Was concerned about the Mega Villain. 3.Bad reactions on the casting of Mark Ruffalo as HULK. 4. Lately, a lot of Super hero movies were flops or average. (Green Lantern & Iron Man)But now, I would definitely ask you all to watch this movie.. coz . 1. The movie has cleverly given the screen time to everybody. 2.Loki made a tough Villain to beat alone. 3. Everybody loved Mark and as well as the HULK. 4. Timing of the funny moments were spot on. 5.Technologically good as par with Avatar and Transformer 3. 6. The best Super Hero Movie out now with Batman series. 7. Avengers will be enjoyed by a 10 year old kid to a 60 year old man. (I am 30 and my friend is 38) 8. Can be enjoyed in 2D as well.Waiting for Avengers 2 .",8,5,11,30 April 2012
Source Code," Best in 2011 till date.
","Source Code is a must watch, not that it is the best in 2011 so far, but for its originality and its a movie to keep in your Library. By the initial trailer, i was not so impressed and was not so keen to watch it after watching Jake's 'Prince of Persia' :P. But just felt watching it after its fantastic reviews. And this time the reviews were bang ON. Review cant explain the brilliance of this flick.Now i feel, its better or equal to 'Inception' (for its brain work). Everything had an honesty in it.. be it the Director, Actor, Story, Special Effects.The good part of the movie is that, its not an over the top movie (Inception).. everything shown is very simple, which indirectly made it more realistic ,rather than a Sci-Fi fantasy. Full marks to the:Director: for keeping the movie more believable, fast paced, maintain the suspense and slowly revealing it, and all without using Million dollar VFX.Actors & Jake: All the Actors (Jake, Michelle, Jeffry,Vera ) were top notch in their performances and added the emotion touch to it. Special thanks to Jake, as he was the one who made us believable and we got more attached to his feelings n emotions.Story: very original. it had suspense, thriller, emotion/drama, action.. all at fast pace.People who loved The Matrix & Inception will definitely enjoy this. I did.",9,0,1,27 June 2011
The Hangover," You cant get out of the Hangover's Hangover .
","Why did I went to watch this movie –I never noticed when it was released , but slowly it started building at the Box office .. just like a Stanley Kubrik film and then it was just every where news papers, talk shows, and the marketing of this film in India was really good. So that's how I was interested in this movie, but again, I felt that it would be another brainless Hollywood sex comedy.Highlighting point of the movie – Though it was a comedy , it had more suspense as the film moved ahead that is the key point of this movie it is not a predictable story..no  not at all.. It was like Idiana Jones  solving the puzzle and moving ahead for the next clue.. and this continued till the last frame with rib tickling humor.About the director –He has done a fine job in maintain the pace and suspense.Performances – 1. Zack is the star of this movie 2. Ed Helms is the second in the performance 3. Ashley is the stylish and sexy 4. Mike Tyson and his Tiger were awesome 5. The gay Gangsta  Keng Jeong  superb .. look out for his entry 6. The MusicSummary – I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good. So , sorry . No clues .Just get Hangovered after watching The Hangover",8,1,2,14 May 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Best in 3D movies, till Date.
","Yes, its the best 3D movie till date (better than Avatar). It could have been the best Zombie movie, but the zombiness was missing. Ha ! but who cares, its still the best action movie of this year. The Resident Evil series is getting better and better.This is Paul Anderson's best work till date.The timing of the 3D effects is perfect (this what we expect from a 3D movie, rather than watching birds flying and Blue men running in a 2 and a half hour Avatar, just like another Discovery channel Bird show)Why you should watch this movie ?1. Best in the Resident Evil series.2. Top class use of 3D, stylish,great music, awesome slow mo actions and scary. 3. One of the best Zombie movie. 4. No boring zone.After Angelina Jolie , its Mila Jovovich .",7,29,60,11 September 2010
Gravity," Best 3D IMAX movie till date
","Gravity (2013) Ohh Yesss  ! Finally we have an OUTSTANDING movie here.Best of this year and one of the best movie set on the Space + Astronaut Theme. From Kids to Oldies, every loved this movie. (It was not the same case with '2001: A Space Odyssey' / 'Apollo 13') For me,it's as groundbreaking as 'Jurassic Park' in terms of special effects and technology.'James Cameroon ! SUCK IT!!' It's a Paradise for Chris Nolan & Stanley Kubrik fans. This movie is 100% 3D, can't be enjoyed anywhere. I highly recommend everybody to watch this movie only in 3D IMAX Theatre. Pros: 1. Camera work 2. Visual Effects & Cinematography 3. Breathtaking Action sequence 4. Awesome 3D work. You really feel connected to the movie. 'Ahem! The 3D effects in the action sequence were so real, that we defended ourselves from the falling space station debris. Yaayeekss!' 5. Casting: Best after a long time. Sandra Bullock gave a Superb performance & she looked so beautiful. -- <3 -> George Clooney was as cool as he is, made us believed that he is a matured astronaut.6. Movie run time is only 93 minutes. 7. Each and every frame of the movie has something in it. Need to watch it carefully. 8. The movie flows like a poetry. Art at its best. Cons: 1. It will make us addictive to watch again & again. 2. You will always want this movie to be in your library & will definitely buy a Blue Ray copy of this one. 3. It's the best 3D IMAX movie till date Oscar Nomination from my side for the below category: 1. Best Visual Effects 2. Best Cinematography 3. Best Director (Surely)4. Best Actress NominationIn short, its an Art movie with blockbuster features & sales. \m/",9,4,14,4 October 2013
Iron Man 2," Definitely Thumps Up, But...........
","Yes, Yes the movie was awesome..... but the 1st part was the better one. As an Iron man fan, the reason for the success of the 1st part was its story.... there was a smooth flow , from creating Tony's new weapons to the US military,then getting captured, building the Iron Man Suit for his escape, feeling the importance of Iron man for the safety of the people(and then kicking the butt of those terrorist), the suspense of Jeff Bridges and the final show down. But the 2nd part had too much talking and less action. Only Quentin Tarantino has the art of making a movie on the subject of talking ..for e.g. Pulp Fiction ,Inglourious Basterds. Anyways ...the point is that its a summer action blockbuster..so we expect a lot of fire works.. Mickey Rourke is excellent in this movie, he had that villain's attitude, and the fight between him and Tony at the Monaco Track is worth your ticket. In fact he is the best villain after Heath Ledger of The Dark Knight. All in all a must watch movie, have a blast.",5,1,3,10 May 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A very good Spidy Movie
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [2014] Rating: 7/10 Review: Its a HIT from my end. First of all, i was disappointed with the negative reviews which gave just 50% scores. Guys! Every movie is not 'Inception' or 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Would request everybody to appreciate the hard work & efforts put in to make an entertaining movie & this one was entertaining ! Nobody left the theater till the Credit rolled. Females & Kids had a blast. What else do u want in a movie when your entire family is entertained ! Positives: 1. Crisp & Clear action scenes between the Hero & Villain. Top notch A-Level (Avengers level) VFX.2. Thank God, this movie didn't had any scenes of saving the American President or a flying Passenger Plane.3. Good Senti Love story 4. Good, True 3D Movie Negative: 1. The story is simple & typical. A new Villain comes to destroy the city & the Hero saves them. Serious story seekers can watch the Bourne Series again ! :P2. The run time",7,0,4,3 May 2014

Inception," Inception is an Exception
","Movie – InceptionTo watch and feel the Inception movie . Here's my tip - Watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u'll definitely wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob in the movie) . Sorry guys, but that is the hangover u take with u after watching the movie.OK ! Let's start the review. Why did I went to watch this movie – 1. It's written by C. Nolan and guess what, he also is the director of this movie. 2. The story of dream invasion,it's not easy to make a film on this subject. 3. The cast made it more appeal-able. 4. New (fresh new) special effect scenes.Highlighting point of the movie – 1.It is a story about dream invasion, where the characters goes into the dream of Jr. Fischer and wants to implant a new IDEA , which is not easy ,as the new IDEA will not be accepted by Jr. Fischer (or any person) because its somebody Else's thought or an IDEA. 2. So, to make it possible, they have a plan. And it is the execution of this plan which is shown in the movie. 3. To be very honest, it's not a fairy tale story or a fantasy kind of movie/story. 4. The technical aspects of this movie are immaculate, because every action had its true reaction. The use of Science (Physics) used in this movie is awesome.5. The story is very real in its hypothesis, For e.g. – a) If the Van is falling from a bridge into the water in 1 min (in the 1st dream), then it will wake up the guys in 10 mins in the 2nd layer of their dream and 30 mins for the guys in the 3nd layer of the dream  and many more examples which is kept very realistic. About the director –Standing ovation for Mr. Christopher Nolan. 1. For writing this movie/story. 2. To make or direct a movie exactly as it is written.3.Even though the story is very complicated, Nolan helped us to understand this movie. You can feel his efforts, and he did everything to make this movie understandable. In fact Inception is much easy to understand than Memento.4. He has done a fine job in maintain the pace and suspense. There isn't any dull moment in the movie. 5. Special effects were new. Look out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt fight.Performances – 1. Leonardo is the star of this movie2. Tom Hardy(Handsome Bob ) is the second in the performance3. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the stylish and sexy. Summary – I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good. So, sorry No clues Just watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u'll definitely wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob in the movie)",9,7,14,18 July 2010

Cloud Atlas," An Art-House Lovers Delight 
","An Art-House Lovers Delight Please note – I am using a lot of other movie's name in order to make us understand the level of quality/class, and not comparing with those movies.To be honest, after watching the wonderful Life of Pi, I had no interest in watching any other Art movie this year 2012. And Cloud Atlas!! It had 6 stories, 3hr run time, the failure of Speed Racer all made me stay away from CA (Cloud Atlas). But after reading the reviews, I was amazed nobody has given a poor review. Hence, I watched it and WOW !! What a powerful come back by the Wachowski Brothers. It needs a strong heart, will, courage, support, belief and balls of steel to make this epic movie. It is as epic as the LOTR woven in just yes just 3hrs. Even the review cannot be summarized in a short paragraph. But, I will try to keep it simple.High points – 1. Superb acting by Jim Broadbent followed by Hugh Grant, Tom Hanks, Ben Whishaw. 2. Cinematography was grand .. like Life of Pi 3. Story – Story telling initially u will feel like lost, but slowly everything comes to place; good pace & was gripping like the Inception. 4. Art movie / Indie movie at its best. 5. Music – Background score, Original musicA must watch movie guys. If this is an ART movie, then I want more.",8,2,5,5 January 2013
