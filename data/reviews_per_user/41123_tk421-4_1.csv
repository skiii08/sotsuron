Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," people are complaining about THIS??!!
","the visual medium of communication had the bar raised again with this movie-  I'm dumbfounded that the same people who have praised movies only for their look have rallied behind a bash wagon when so much was there to drink in is beyond me.  This is fun, and the best eye candy ever.  On a geek level, the set-up for the next two(and 4,5,6) was a laugh out loud treat. To see the emperor in complete command of all scenerios was more than I hoped for.  Skip it at your loss.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
