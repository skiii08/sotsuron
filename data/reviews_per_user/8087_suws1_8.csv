Insidious: Chapter 2," Good, but not as good
","Insidious chapter 2 picks up were Insidious ended. No spoilers here, but if you want to enjoy this one, you must watch the first Insidious or you won't be able to keep up with the story. This second chapter is a watchable movie, but it's more about the mystery than about scares, frights or horror... Insidious was suspenful, but it also delivered as an horror movie, this chapter is more science fiction with a pinch of horror. Storywise, this movie does it's job, (and personally I think that, if it is a sequel it should continue the previous movie story, and this one picks up exactlly where the first one ended, so, kudos), but it isn't as interesting as the first, and a little more predictable. As for the acting, very good, but honestly, who watches these films for the acting? If it ain't bad it isn't going to be Oscar worthy anyway... Insidious Chapter 2 is watchable and entertaining, but it isn't going to be on your memories for long.",6,0,0,13 December 2013
Gravity," Great CGI...that's it...
","Gravity is possibly the most overrated movie I've watched in recent years. Yes it has great CGI, the visuals are stunning, but I think I payed for a movie...This has absolutely no plot, no character development, no story...And an Oscar nomination for Sandra Bullock to look scared and breath heavily...are you serious?! The above is fair warning to those, like me, who think that are going to watch a movie...You're going to watch something that would be a great space documentary. If you wanna be blow away with stunning visuals this is for you. The best CGI I've seen to this day, the attention to detail in every little thing and it really takes you somewhere if you watch it in 3D it looks like you're in the middle of the action. That being said, it is an experience, but not a movie experience. It would be something to try in Disneyland or some amusement park, because it is a ride...It's just not a movie. It is impossible for me to spoil it, because it has no plot to spoil, I can't tell you anything you don't already know going in. I give it a 6/10, because I kinda enjoyed the ride, and it deserves credit for its visuals, but this is, by far, 2013 most overrated movie.",6,7,13,20 January 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Too pretentious and boring....
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is written and directed by Wes Anderson,starring Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder. This is the premise for the movie, but to watch it was boring. The movie is filmed as if you are watching a play inside a dollhouse, if that makes any sense. The so-called comedy is just pretentious and snob. Of course some people find that funny, but for me it didn't do it. The entire movie didn't do it... It could have been a wonderful adventure, but I found the manner and style it was conceived to be too boring and pointless. The acting is excellent and that saved the movie from being a complete waste of time. This definitely isn't a movie for the masses, and that being said, isn't a movie that an average movie goer will enjoy. For some that's a good thing maybe, but for me this wasn't entertaining. Be your own judge.",5,57,107,29 July 2014
It Follows," It follows...until it bores!
","It follows tells us the story of Jay, a nineteen year old girl that after a sexual encounter, finds herself plagued by strange visions and the sense that something is following her. The movie has a creepy atmosphere, but the story and execution doesn't give you that sense of terror or claustrophobia that has been anounced by the numerous reviewers. The rating is indeed high and you may be tempted to see it, but don't go in with high expectations, and don't watch the trailer. Maybe if you watch it with little knowledge you can at least enjoy it. Overall the movie has some great details, the acting is decent, but that's it. The plot is weak, pointless, the movie is slow-paced and you will probably be bored 30 minutes in.",6,4,26,14 July 2015
Evil Dead," One of the best horror movies in years
","Evil dead is quite simply one of the best horror movies in years. It's scary, gory and fast-paced. You won't be bored. As a remake, it only borrows some factors from the original movie, as it stands on it's own as Evil Dead. The reason why these people are in a remote cabin, and why they stay in it after weird stuff stars to happen is much better in this movie than in the original. This movie reminds of the 80's horror movies with its atmosphere, the visual scares and the gore. The visual effects are top notch and although the acting isn't great, they deliver, considering it's a horror movie. It is a breath of fresh air to all horror fans, and a must watch if you want to spend 90 minutes of classic horror movie-making.",8,3,16,2 July 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," Ahead of its time but...
","I felt the need to review this movie after reading some reviews from other users, simply because I agreed with all. Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it 'art' or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.",7,116,164,24 June 2013
Elysium," Entertaining
","Not much to say about Elysium. If you watch the trailer, you'll be expecting a decent and entertaining sci-fi movie, and Elysium is just that. Nothing new in terms of story,(although the first 30-40 min let you think you're in for something more), good special effects, good acting(considering the genre), overall good movie. I would like to praise Sharlto Copley on his performance on this one, a very pleasant surprise portraying the villain. To sum up, Elysium isn't a mind blowing movie, but its very entertaining, you will get your money's worth on this one if you go to the movies to be entertained, if not, Elysium is still preety decent, but don't expect big twists and turns, its all very predictable. Still, a solid 7/10.",7,3,5,18 December 2013
Wonder Woman," Honest Wonder Woman review -superhero movie by numbers-
","Wonder Woman, the DCU movie that finally convinces critics and get's an 8,1 IMDb rating to date. Everyone seems to board the hype train, but honestly...it's not that great. Don't get me wrong, Wonder Woman is an interesting movie. Has all the known elements of superhero-origins type movies: the secret back story, the loving parent, the loving trainer, the discovery of the powers, the finding of the truth, the love interest, the super-villain, the comic relief, etecetera, etecetera...and that's it! The only 'novelty' here is that the superhero is a woman, the rest is same old, same old. The acting is decent, as per expected in a superhero movie, nothing real special, no Oscars here. Gal Gadot does a wonderful job as Wonder Woman, as she portrays beauty and a bad ass perfectly, personally I liked it very much, the rest of the cast are there to support the hero, so no one shines brighter than Gadot, and maybe no one should, so, as I said before: decent acting, nothing big here. The Special effects are decent, but also, nothing real special...probably they could and should have done better. Sound effects and soundtrack are good, perhaps the best thing about the movie. The Wonder Woman theme is very adequate, and gives the right mood, but even that was created in Batman VS Superman...so, once again, no novelty... The directing and production are also as expected for a superhero movie: Good wardrobe, beautiful locations, action scenes, superpowers and explosions. So, where does Wonder Woman excel? What does it do differently than the other 5 or 6 superhero movies that comes out every year? What makes it so special? In my opinion: Nothing! Not a single thing. It's superhero movie by the numbers. Entertainment at it's best, but not a special movie, not something we will talk about in 2 or 3 years, not a game changer. My best guess is, it's polical correctness at it's prime once again. A superhero movie, with a female superhero and a woman directing, it can't be anything short of great. But, really, it isn't. It's on the same level as 'Captain America', 'BatmanVSSuperman' and most of the superhero movies: Great entertainment popcorn movies to spend a good 2 hours. Don't expect to be mind blown...",6,1,6,26 June 2017
