Gravity," Amazing
","The hype machine has been working overtime on Alfonso Cuarón's 'Gravity,' with the phrases 'game changer' and 'all time greatest' being bandied about like candy on Halloween. Critics that viewed the film early became its de facto publicists, while the internet only fanned the flames of sky-high expectations. But hype has a funny way of snuffing itself out. Once a film (or any pop culture landmark) hits, reality sets in. Consumers realize that the passage of time is vitally important in determining whether or not something is a classic, and, of course, detractors come out of the woodwork.",7,1,1,6 April 2020

Inglourious Basterds," A pretty good war movie that is audacious, occasionally fun and too in love with its own voice.

Brokeback Mountain," Love is love
","There is a moment also let a person mistook for young impulse. As a friend after reading the comment said, wild land, except men are sheep, either men, or sheep. In the end, if you don't choose sheep, you can only choose men. Everyone laughed, want to end a love is so deconstructed by you. I don't think so. If on the spur of the moment, can be in a year after the relaxed farewell, go their way. Will not have to break up when the intense vomiting, like the same; Will not have a long time to remember, and become the only insist on life.I think we should be thankful for the taboo. The taboo of their identity makes love last forever. The big obstacle made the love. People have an innate resistance to prohibition and obstruction. 'Any warm reality of calm, contentment, any rock-solid image of happiness, will be destroyed by the hand of time; The forbidden and damaged love lives forever by the one who exerts power and the one who endures pressure.' Together so difficult, will be particularly cherish; Don't know when goodbye, people will know how to miss. What we see around us too much is the feeling that there is no resistance but no way to end, self-pendulum own goal. In other words, we are in turn putting on such a bad show.As soon as Jack appeared, people could smell the smell of homosexuality, and his appearance was indescribably provocative. He was also more active and honest in his subsequent entanglements. Ennis was silent, restrained and even repressed. Always feel guilty about your feelings. Despite their differences in personality, the two men were really beefy cowboys. Fighting and falling in love. This is where ang lee's brilliance and intention lies. I don't remember his exact words, to the effect that I meant to express love. Pure love. A universal feeling. Love in a broad sense should not be confined to men or women.",8,1,1,16 April 2020

","Marvel films have always tried to combine superheroes with genres, and so has the deadpool franchise, which began as a romance and is now billed as a family drama.

Crash," Psychology
","In 'crash', decades of accumulated series writer got perfect performances, many of the group of play, and time limit within 24 hours, but in an orderly way, under control, every clue is explained clearly, emotion, don't let a person feel forced to promote supplications, the most rare is, the rhythm of the movie is also a relaxation, the mood and force to push again, slowly under coincidence, weave a perfect circle, in the end, as the music sounded, a documentary style society, he will let like epic or love who have psychological comfortable, as in most characters, It was a perfect catharsis to see that life was still full of promise. Such a complete story, such a sophisticated language, such a strong control, in recent Hollywood films, it is difficult to find a rival.Just because the story is too round, it makes me feel unreal. I'm not interested in the social problems of the American people. What makes me like and touch me about this movie is the universal dilemma of human nature contained in it. I don't think it's a sociological phenomenon or problem dissection. It's not the job of a film director, and Paul haggis can't afford it. He showed me the everyone face the dilemma of life and their effect on his life and the impact of the mind, the dilemma and anxiety and lead to anger and emotion everywhere around us, let people ignore the meaning of their psychology. Social problems cannot be solved by these coincidences one by one, nor can a single act of kindness cause a chain of improvements, and mental disorders are more difficult to heal overnight. A white cop who molested a woman of color could save the same woman with his life the next day, but at night he still had to face his old father, who was ill and unable to communicate, and the next day he would want to kill the black secretary. And it was the young cop, no matter how kind and objective, who ended up running away from the car after shooting down an innocent black man out of fear. Good and evil are not so easy to judge. The pressure of life, the loss of family affection, the insecurity, the humiliation of personality, how can you expect them to be at peace with each other? If you don't find a way to vent, I'm afraid everyone in the show would already have a nervous breakdown. Just a few more coincidences, their usual post-crash bickering and name-calling is suddenly elevated, pushed by fate to endure a greater test, allowing the power of reason to spin out of control.",8,0,0,16 April 2020

Life of Pi," Life like a dream
","The visual pleasures delivered by Ang Lee's Life of Pi are so immense that it is difficult to believe the source material was a 2001 blockbuster novel of the same name, by author Yann Martel. In an era of filmmaking where big event films seem to be released almost once a week Life of Pi stands out for delivering genuine spectacle and awe. Digital, 3D and CGI technologies may have once impressed audiences simply by being present in a film, but now it takes true mastery of cinematic style to dazzle keen cinema enthusiasts rather than just placating the casual cinema goers who are looking to pass the time.",7,0,0,7 April 2020
Interstellar," Cherish everything
","At its core, the film is a family drama about love and commitment between a father and daughter. The film let the most real and warm feelings and waiting for the human nature into the space migration such a huge and full of tragic human epic. In a grand narrative that encapsulates sincere emotion, which is what Nolan is good at, the manipulation and expression is no doubt superb. In this film, the sense of mission to save the children and the future of mankind, and the deep feeling between father and daughter to wait for each other, constitute a classical dramatic conflict in opposition, and almost always as the protagonist's motivation to advance the story.",10,0,0,27 March 2020

Cast Away," The true meaning of life
","I think one of the good things about this movie is that it sets up a suspense story, in which the man who opens the door to receive the email betrits his wife, who is the last person destined to be with Chuck. The wings of the angels run all the way through. You have to pay attention to detail. Why had he left the mail with the angel's wings on the desert island and insisted on sending it back? Why a pair of wings painted on a door made to be a sail? He also wrote 'It saved my life' on the note. The angel wings on the car of the girl he was destined to be with made him smile as he looked at the direction of her house, because he had found his final home and was doomed to never be with Kelly. Perhaps this is life, sometimes desperately want to get something after many years has changed, leaving only endless imagination and desolate. But you gotta live, like Chuck said, 'I gotta keep breathing.' who wouldn't admire that spirit? After watching it, I cried, for the lover was not married, for the fate of his injustice, more strong hero",9,0,0,7 May 2020

","It was the first Indian film I saw, when I was 15 years old, and it opened up a new world of films for me. It taught me a lot and made me feel that life wasn't that hard. Although the film is ultimately an idealistic dream, it touches on a number of very thought-provoking social issues, including India's high suicide rate, brain drain, rote learning in schools and the lack of a single division of labor and employment options.

It Chapter Two," In fact, it is an artsy film that is a metaphor for the family of origin
","Whether it's 1 or 2, 'back to the clown' is all about overcoming the fear that maybe something you're afraid of, maybe your family, maybe a painful memory you don't want to face.
When the members of the loser grew up and left the town, their memory of what had happened became more and more dim and even began to forget. It's just like in reality, we use avoidance to face the fear and responsibility we don't want to take on, and we use forgetfulness to hide the past we don't want to look back on, but in this way, we also lose the happiness we feel.
As the movie shows, when they come back to the town, their fear and pain in the town all come back, but more importantly, their happy time in the town, their unforgettable friendship, all come back.
Life is bound to go through all kinds of experiences and sufferings that you don't want to face, but if you don't want to admit that this is part of your life shadow, then how can life be complete?
By the way, the clown ended up being scolded to death. You heard me right, being scolded to death...",7,1,5,9 May 2020

They surf the Internet, live in basements, and do whatever it takes to get a job.
Just when you think they're bad enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they're not the worst, there's worse.

The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into groups.

Amélie," Angel
","The people amelie helps, even herself, are marginalized with a variety of mental and physical problems. What makes this movie so good is not only the unexpected plots, but also the combination of suspense and magic. In this film, the daily experience of the mainstream crowd is greatly diluted, but the touch of experience goes deep into the hearts of the marginalized people, touching their pain, viewing their lives equally, and giving them deep sympathy and sincere help through the hand of love and beauty. Because of this, the film is very warm.",9,0,0,23 March 2020
The Matrix," Years later
","I saw this movie because the boy I like is a big fan of it. Now I have a different idea to watch it again. I think this movie is not about the struggle between human beings and machines, but about the evolution and upgrading of machine civilization",9,0,0,28 March 2020
Footloose," mould
","Well, I gave it a low because I was going for the vaudeville, but there wasn't a lot of dancing in this movie, and it was all about the characters trying to get a chance to dance. There wasn't a decent dance at the end",5,0,1,15 May 2020
Green Book," Green book
","Two men of vastly different skin color, class, personality and sexual orientation, who met through music and became lifelong friends through road trips. Sometimes talent is not enough, but also need to be brave, tear down the wall in the heart to come to the point. The movie is like a green pebble, throwing itself into American society and creating a light and beautiful ripple. Although there is a deliberate sense of warmth, but I am willing to pay the bill ~!",9,0,0,19 March 2020
Her," Love her
","A man currently going through a bitter divorce falls in love with his operating system and the film follows their love story unfold. Does that sound exciting? Not really if you are really honest, however, put aside all preconceptions and go and watch this gem of a futuristic love story.",10,0,0,6 April 2020
Goodfellas," disillusionment
","World history: the film is based on a true story, tells the New York Mafia bloody jianghu grievances, the so-called jianghu moral reduction for the ugliness of human nature and greed, a New York nuanced performances Italian gangsters from small to large, life appear to be realistic Mafia characters unique lifestyle and different values. The film seems to be a gangster film in the traditional sense, but it is actually intended to express a kind of disillusionment of the American dream.",9,0,0,27 March 2020
The Godfather," My love
","I had nothing to do on Sundays, and I found the godfather to pass the time.
And then still marveled. If it's true that there's one of the greatest movie openings of all time, this is the one.
Epic films like the godfather, with their huge story structure, their complicated relationships, and their many plot points, all need to be built up in the first act to lay a solid foundation for the rest of the narrative; In this limited time in the pursuit of infinite space, I think, as long as the relevant content can be put in all not bloated, is quite a realm; Can also be in a paragraph, comb the vein clear, simple and complex, only the great master can do.
Why did coppola keep so many relevant details in his hands?
After all, I thought he was telling a story.
To tell a story, to get rid of unnecessary technology, to tell a story in a down-to-earth way,
This kind of unpretentious, should also be one of the temperament that the epic pursues.",9,0,0,16 March 2020
