Requiem for a Dream," Message is very clear: use=lose.
","I would like to send my condolences to the person(s) who thought this movie condoned the use of drugs.  Please try watching the movie again and see the reality portion, as opposed to the fantasy portion. I can't imagine how much more obvious the director of this movie could have been.  I'm not a genius, but I caught the messages each time they were sent:  everyone who used or sold drugs ended up losing.  Losing a girlfriend and an arm, or losing sanity, or dignity.  Degradation, humiliation, pain, suffering, loss, loss, loss.  Does it have to reach out and smack you in the face?  How could anyone miss the message of this movie--- or misinterpret the message? Best wishes, my friend--- but you really missed the entire point of this movie: those who use, or sell, lose- period. The movie, and it's message, rate 10 out of 10.  Wake up America.",Null,0,0,8 January 2003
