Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THERE ARE NO CHARACTERS!
","ok, IT'S BEAUTIFUL; IT LOOKS FABULOUS. The Art Director is a genius. BUT. . . I was SHOCKED at the lack of character development (esp of Obi-Wan) and all the time spent on Anakin's race. We didn't really feel for these characters. As for Jar Jar Binks, I didn't really mind him; I actually smiled a few times. I couldn't stand that bloated mosquito!",6,1,2,23 July 1999
Minority Report," Derivative, but COMPELLING and DAMN GOOD
","I'll keep this quick and to the point.8 out of 10 - a damn good and compelling film that went by quickly.Problems? Some.There were so many characters it was difficult to develop any; it was like a revolving door of cast members. Max von Sydow stands out and has been doing this kind of character for a long time, he also looks younger than when he made 'The Exorcist' years ago. Peter Stormare was good in a small role as the fellow who replaces Cruise's eyes (that's right) and would have been interesting in the von Sydow role.Another problem is that the movie is derivative in many ways of various sci fi and police dramas too many to list.The end scenes are rather saccharine, too upbeat, and slightly contrived.The entire plot becomes somewhat contrived and slightly illogical towards the end when the von Sydow character faces his dilemma of how to preserve the concept of Pre-Crime, which is using Pre-Cognatives to in effect see into the future: you get arrested for what you WILL do.Nonetheless, despite those problems, 'Minority Report' is excellent from direction to scenery to effects. I have no problems with Cruise's style, as some do. The plot was surprisingly compelling with twists and turns. I never squirmed in my seat and the entire 2 1/2 or so hours went by quickly. It was thought-provoking on a number of levels.I might even see it again. Eight out of ten.",8,0,0,27 June 2002
Star Trek," Great, BUT beware the PARADOXES of Time Travel and Alternate Realities!
","I've always had issues with time travel and the inherent paradoxes. Beyond that, alternate realities/alternate time lines is another issue for me, and there were very many of them in all the ST TV series.One time in 'Yoyager' it became so obvious a crewmen asked Captain Janeway about the paradoxes, and she replied quizzically, 'the best thing to do is just not think about them'. Usually, broken time lines end up back to normal, but in this film nothing ends up as it was.Remember the infamous episode of 'Dallas' when an entire season of shows was wiped out as they were depicted merely as a dream? That is what this 'Star Trek'movie just did on a gigantic scale - wiped out EVERYTHING we saw and know and accept as a given as part of the 'canon'. No Federation-Klingon Alliance, perhaps no Borg, and on and on.In the movie, in the future, Spock fails to reach Romulus in time to create a singularity to save that world from a supernova. How exactly that was Spock's fault I failed to discern.But Nero's Romulan ship, a mining ship, went with Spock's vessel through a singularity (created too late), and somehow went back through time instead of being scattered to the subatomic level or turned into pure energy, or whatever happens in a Black Hole. Romulus was destroyed by the supernova.Nero blamed Spock, and somehow every planet in the Federation. This is not logical, and if Nero is merely insane, well, that detracts from his validity as a villain. Khan was not insane, certainly not to that degree.Nero manages to drill a hole into a defenseless Vulcan, insert some 'red matter', that can create a singularity, and this all of Vulcan and six billion people are destroyed, while Spock watches! Off next to Earth, which was also equally defenseless, except for their relatively few star ships. The excuse for that was they were off elsewhere on another assignment.Well, after some heroics, Nero and his ship get sucked into another singularity and they vanish. To reappear in the sequel, in the present, past or future?? Who knows.So Vulcan is gone in the film. Romulus is still there as it got destroyed only in the future. Kirk, while still a cadet at the academy, get command of the Enterprise and, at the film's end, permanent promotion from the Federation from mere cadet to captain! Puhleeze.Why can't Spock go back through another singularity and change the time line?? How one can determine where in the past or future you will end up in going through one of those I can not figure out.So, there is no single reality. There is any number of time lines depending on who changes what in the past. as I said, I always had issues with this. And also as I said, even Spock made a reference at the end to 'cheating'. It does make it easier for the screenwriters to just blow up everything that happened in the Star Trek world and 'canon'.Weirdest paradox, at the end. Young Spock meets old Spock, and they have a conversation!! Think about that. It should be impossible. So, you can see the paradoxes. Right captain Janeway? What's that, captain? 'Just don't think about them'?? Isn't that 'cheating', as Spock said? Guess so. As with so many shows, be it '24' or whatever, suspension of disbelief is required.So turn off your scientific logic and just enjoy the fun. But remember, like Vulcan, everything you knew about the Star Trek universe is now gone - at least until someone goes back and corrects the time line! The movie is PG-13, and almost a PG. I would have preferred an R with some real gore.Superb special effects, sound effects, score, set design, costumes, etc. Well acted, and many touches that are reminiscent of episodes, scenes or events from the original series. The interior of the Enterprise looked nothing like that on the cheesy set of the first TV series, thankfully.When did Romulans become giant super-powerful bald guys covered in what looked like Maori facial tattoos?? Or was that supposed to be only typical to that crew? Of course, the Federation first saw Romulans quite late, in 'The Balance of Terror' episode.Major Plot Hole: apparently both Vulcan and Earth were totally defenseless without so much as a phaser bank available. Even Star Fleet headquarters in California, a population center, had no defense, neither shields, nor phasers, and certainly not photon torpedoes. Nothing. That big 'drill' in the film was easily knocked out with light hand-held weapons.Minor Plot Hole: The Romulan vessel was not originally some all-powerful doomsday machine from another race; it was a working mining vessel. Even though from the not too distant future, it all too easily handled not only Federation but Klingon warships.Winona Ryder played Spock's mother! Who dies. Ben Cross played his father Sarek, now that Mark Lenard is dead. And Leonard Nimoy played one of the Spocks. Speaking of Spock, a much thinner and less stacked version of Uhura makes out with Spock in the film. And when did they become an item??",9,3,9,13 May 2009
The Birth of a Nation," DON'T FORGET YOUR SHEETS!
","It's curious and disturbing to read the warped reviews by Confederate-sympathizers who defend this tripe. 'Birth of a Nation' was a well-done movie - technically. But even in 1915 it was very controversial and often picketed. By the 1930's it's overt racism and lies was not acceptable at all; compare 'Birth' to 'Gone with the Wind' - which was bad enough!The Confederate Mythology is of a 'brutal Northern occupation', and the 'poor South at the mercy of black-run state governments'.  And 'Birth' glorifies the subsequent rise of, believe it or not, the Ku Klux Klan. (The movie was based on an older pot-boiler novel called 'The Clansman').
The reality is only for a brief period did blacks control the South Carolina (where they were a clear majority) statehouse; they never did anywhere else. The reality is for two years after the Civil War the South was recalcitrant, unrepentant, and brutal to former slaves. It wasn't until 1867, two years after the war, that Reconstruction began. And the only thing that was 'brutal' was the how the racist ex-Confederate veterans resisted it at the behest of the Southern oligarchs and the Democratic Party that used the Klan as their Terror Arm to control the ballot box (read 'White Terror').The scene in 'Birth' of the white-sheeted Ku Klux Klan riding to the rescue against a horde of sex-crazed black soldiers (actually whites in blackface) intent on raping some white women was especially sickening. But to the lovers of the Confederacy, THIS is 'history'. And it was 'Birth' that directly led to the rise of the KKK to major power in the 1920's. Of note is that their power collapsed after it was revealed that their leader had kidnapped a young, white, unmarried librarian, and for days tortured and raped her on a train and a hotel room. She committed suicide, and he was convicted of murder. THAT was the reality of the Ku Klux Klan. And 'Birth' is one of the most insidious propaganda deceits ever filmed. But see it - only if you know it is a LIE from top to bottom.",3,19,45,20 September 1999
The Mummy," I Am Not a Brendan Frazier Fan!
","This movie was most entertaining and had great art direction and special effects. My problem with it is that it went more for camp than horror; this is not a very scary film. We marvel at the effects and 'look' of The Mummy, but scared or horrified I was not. See Christopher Lee's The Mummy from 1959 for fright. Also, Brendan Frazier I am not a fan of. He has no subtlety or nuance whatsoever and is like a living cartoon. And that adds to the lack of real terror. I do wish there was more on ancient Egypt; the first scenes dealt with the betryal of Pharoah by his high priest Imhotep - and the art direction and 'look', as said, were marvelous. Maybe more in a Part II, if ever? And please, more horror and less camp.",7,0,0,30 September 1999
Insomnia," Movie is GOOD; PACINO IS GREAT
","Al Pacino is clearly now the front runner for Best Actor Award. He is simply marvelous in this film as a tortured detective.In Alaska there was a murder, and two detectives from Los Angeles are sent to assist. (I was never sure why!). The problem is that there has been an Internal Affairs Investigation and the younger member of this team is likely to testify against the Pacino character. So when while chasing the killer that detective is shot (accidentally?) by Pacino we and he are left to wonder about the motivation.Pacino, who previously falsified evidence to convict a known killer (why the IA investigation) now falsifies more evidence to coverup his shooting of the younger detective - the twist is that the killer knows this and begins to blackmail Pacino, who can't sleep either due to the lack of sunsets at the that high a latitude (this is Alaska) or his guilty conscience. We are never sure of which, and neither is he.Pacino is marvelous. Hilary Swank good. Robin Williams is creepy as the killer who it turns out is just as much a tortured ambiguous soul as the Pacino one is. This is not a film with black and white borders regarding morality and right and wrong, although at the climax Pacino makes an attempt to clarify that issue in his own mind.The plot works. The setting in Alaska does a good job in giving the feeling of isolation Pacino feels, and he is simply wonderful.Almost certainly 'Insomnia' will be regarded as a Film Noir classic.",8,0,0,4 July 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Tremendous fun and great atmosphere.
","Director Tim Burton has added to his excellent and stylish body of work with a captivating adaption of Washington Irving's classic story. This film is marvelous; if there is any fault with 'Sleepy Hollow' it is that it requires a viewer to pay attention to the plot - which is all the better for thinking adults. Movie-goers of any age will find something to love here, although be sure to keep the kiddies far away unless you want wet beds and sleepless nights: 'Sleepy Hollow' gets off to a rousing start with two decapitations within the first few minutes.Instead of a timid skinny schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane is a New York City policeman in 1799 specializing in scientific 'detecting' of crimes; he is soon sent to distant upstate New York in the heart of an isolated mostly old Dutch community - Sleepy Hollow - where murders by decapitation are occurring with distressing frequency. Crane, rather officious and slightly diffident in his own way, goes to the town that rises out of the misty smokey air in a hollow reminiscent of Brigadoon in the Scottish highlands.Crane soon discerns the conspiratorial nature of the leading townsmen, and that the Headless Horseman is indeed continuing his nighttime rides in search of heads. He is the incarnation of a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier from the Revolution killed by Americans in the woods that no one dares set foot in twenty years after he and his cut off head were buried there. The very logical Crane needed to see the town magistrate killed in front of him before he'd believe in the Headless Horseman.Soon Crane is striking up a bit of a romance with the daughter of a leading (and suspicious) citizen, Katrina. But there is more here than at first seems - much more. Clues of witchcraft use keep appearing and they point to her. A mystery begins to develop with many of the pieces discernible for the truly observant. The link between the conspiracy and the Horseman eventually gets pieced together, but only partially as a final twist leads to the climactic and heart-pounding conclusion.The plot holds together and develops very well. Fascinating clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout the film; disjointed plot bits also all fuse together by the end with great effectiveness.  The art design and scenery is superlative and Burton knows masterfully how to create the right mood with his cinematography. The special effects are first rate, but Burton uses them judiciously merely to enhance the plot and emotion of the moment; this is thankfully not an 'effects' movie. Depp is appropriately rather dazed and sometimes befuddled as Crane, although he rises to the occasion at the end. Ricci is vulnerable when needed, and the rest of the cast is effective too. Noteworthy is Christopher Walken in a non-speaking role as the Horseman and horror vet Michael Gough as a doomed notary.The movie ends with a beautiful snowy shot on Wall Street in January of 1800, and it is so accurate the original Federal Hall is on the right and the second Trinity Church is in the distance just across Broadway. The look of old New York is splendid. 'Sleepy Hollow' is wonderful in every way, including such details that make one want to see it again.",9,0,0,19 November 1999
We Were Soldiers," SUPERB WAR FILM - But Beware of Madeleine Stowe's Giant Lips!
","'We Were Soldiers' is rather different from the majority of American Vietnam war films. Instead of the drug-taking, baby-killing, officer-fragging draftees that arrived later in the war, here we have the confident professional U.S. Army in its first major battle with North Vietnamese regulars in 1965. This is the famous slugfest in the Ia Drang Valley, recounted in the book the movie was based on, 'We Were Soldiers Once. . . and Young'. Mel Gibson does a generically heroic job as the gung-ho Colonel Moore leading his 7th Air Cavalry battalion into this new 'valley of death'. Unlike the nonetheless fine 'Black Hawk Down', this film does a better job with the individual personalities, the human element of the soldiers under terrible fire.The combat scenes are first-rate as are the effects. Battles are realistic and bloody enough for anyone. The effects of napalm are depicted graphically on an American mistakenly hit by some. The final American fixed-bayonet charge reminded me of the famous charge by the 20th Maine regiment in the movie 'Gettysburg' - although they did not have massive air support. American air power was the reason the Vietnamese were stopped, and, eventually, it hardly seemed fair.The wives of the fighters are shown at length as oak-like pillars of strength, even despite the Army's callousness in delivering death notices by telegrams via yellow cab drivers. Entirely distracting, however, was Madeleine Stowe - a formerly gorgeous lady who now has surpassed even Melanie Griffith for the worst collagen lip-job in Hollywood. Stowe's puffed-up lips made her almost unrecognizable, and clown-like. Too bad.Especially good in this movie was the sensitive way politics and the Vietnamese were handled. Lyndon Johnson's dark, deceitful shadow hangs over all these needless deaths; in fact, if the movie has a fault it does not adequately show how good men were foolishly used by Johnson and the Pentagon. The Vietnamese Army was depicted as heroic and as human beings; the final comments at the end of the movie by their colonel about how the battle would change nothing in the long run except the number of casualties was thoroughly appropriate.  I recommend people also see/rent 'Go Tell the Spartans' with Burt Lancaster. It was a fine and somewhat neglected film of this same period. 'Go tell the Spartans we die here obedient to their word' was the last message sent by King Leonidas at Thermopolae against the Persians. And is ironic in the Vietnam context.For those interested in historical anomalies, Gibson as Col Moore was spotted early in the movie carrying the book 'Great Battlefields of the World', that in 1965. Unfortunately, it wasn't published until 1984.A well-done war movie definitely worth seeing.",9,0,1,9 March 2002
The Bourne Identity," ENJOYABLE and DIVERTING
","I haven't read the book, but the movie stands up well on its own, and is much better than that PC potboiler 'Sum of All Fears'.The plot was intriguing and kept me interested throughout. Damon and Potente are well matched and do a fine job. She is a German actress who seems to have managed to speak well unaccented American English. The mystery of who the Damon character really is, and how he discovers his special talents, was effective. The fight scenes and supporting cast all were good.I didn't buy two scenes: Damon's Human Fly act outside the U.S. Embassy, and the Ride the Corpse Down Five Stories (and walk away??) act. The last one was a bit much to take straining credulity.But all in all it was a fun movie and I'm glad I saw it. Seven out of ten. Maybe seven and a half!",7,0,1,3 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," MAGICAL and FABULOUS. A great film!!
","I just want to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this great film. It is clearly the best movie of the year, and if 'A Beautiful Mind' wins the Oscar it will be due to internal Hollywood politics - how Miramax's 'Shakespeare in Love' beat out the superior 'Saving Private Ryan'.In all aspects of movie-making, 'Lord of the Rings' stands out: direction, special effects, sets, acting, and even the script. Parts of the Tolkien classic have been very nicely compressed, or expanded - such as the fight with the cave troll (barely in the book). As for FX, it doesn't get better than the jaw-dropping fight against ther Balrog on the bridge at Khazad-Dum.There was no performance that was not at least good, and the dialogue between Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee I thought especially effective. Cate Blanchett was luminous as Galadriel. The musical score deserves special note. It added extremely well to the drama and mood of the film, along with taking us into a magical realm.The entire film was magical. And I can't wait for the sequels!",10,1,1,8 March 2002
Pearl Harbor," Disney's PC WHITEWASH of HISTORY, and Schmaltzy Romance
","'Pearl Harbor', the biggest, most expensive, most hyped, and most anticipated, of all the Summer season's films, has finally arrived. Like a bomb flung from a Japanese warplane it has crashed into theaters with a resounding noise. Yes, for what this film could have been it is, in fact, a Big Bomb; for what it is, overall, it can be considered a mediocre let down.The film has a running time of just over three hours, half of which is devoted to a schmaltzy love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago. That includes the 'lost lover back from the dead' routine, which was old even when it was done well, as in the classic 'Waterloo Bridge' from 1941. We also received a noxious dose of an equally labored love triangle involving two lifetime friends. Beyond that, we get History so white-washed it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two.Some Disney apologists have claimed that there had to be a story wrapped around the history, 'or else we'd be left with just a documentary'. Not so. Out on DVD is 1970's excellent 'Tora, Tora, Tora', a Japanese-American production on the attack, and it was factual and compelling without the need for a none too convincing romance. For those who do want romance, done well in the context of the attack and America's entrance into World War Two, I suggest they rent 'From Here to Eternity' from 1954.Disney is telling us the actual attack sequence on the U.S.  Naval base at Pearl Harbor lasted over 40 minutes in this movie. By my watch it was 30, tops, only about half of which involved attacks on American warships. The rest was much less spectacular aerial heroics by the two heroes.Be it noted that in 1970, 'Tora, Tora, Tora' did not have the benefit of digital special effects. In 2001, 'Pearl Harbor' does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD to be able to savor each frame of the attack. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism and verisimilitude is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. 'Pearl Harbor' bears no resemblance to the real horrors of the opening sequences of 'Saving Private Ryan'.Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, white-washing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war. The movie states that America cut off Japan's oil supply, thus all but forcing them into war, and into launching their infamous sneak attack on the U.S. Navy on December 7th, 1941. But at no time did 'Pearl Harbor' ever mention why the U.S. cut off Japan's oil supply, which was due to years of Japanese aggression, war crimes, and atrocities in China, and an ever increasing Japanese totalitarian society dominated by militarists.To Disney, there was no need to 'offend' the Japanese by mentioning their invasion of China, or the fact that Japan had allied itself, long before their sneak attack, as part of the despised Fascist Axis that included Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from 'Pearl Harbor'.Historical events themselves are depicted in various ways ranging from complete distortion, to convenient omission, to fabrication, to absolute accuracy. Some of the more irritating examples follow.Jon Voight, doing a not very convincing interpretation of President Roosevelt, supposedly stood up on his own at a staff meeting to dramatize the need to strike back at Japan. Not so.Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent raid on Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of his planes was named 'The Ruptured Duck' - accurate and a tribute to the great war film 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo', which should be rented and seen by all.The film made various historical alterations such as eliminating from Roosevelt's classic Declaration of War speech before Congress his last emphatic words after resolving to achieve the final victory: 'So help us God'. Perhaps God is not PC.The absence of the U.S. aircraft carriers during the bombing - so fortuitous for America's fortunes - was not referred to.Despite growing evidence that Roosevelt knew beforehand about the coming Japanese attack and wanted it as the only way to get America into the war against Hitler, the film ignores that issue totally and presents FDR as surprised by it.American Admiral Kimmell, commanding at Pearl, was somewhat overly scapegoated in 1941 for the disaster; here, he is shown much too favorably and as a victim of Naval leaders too obtuse to perceive the coming Japanese sneak attack, which is itself a specious over-simplification.The attack began with Japanese midget submarines infiltrating the harbor and being engaged by a U.S. destroyer. Ignored in the film.Doolittle's raid on Japan, and other cities besides Tokyo, actually resulted not in the Japanese moving back, as the end of movie narration claimed, but launching their biggest naval attack of the war. It, unfortunately for them, ended in defeat at the Battle of Midway, which was also not mentioned despite it being the true Turning Point of the war.Curiously, despite such historical issues distorted or dismissed, the movie was careful enough to show, accurately, details such as the famous flag of Admiral Togo, who defeated the Russians in 1904, flying over the Japanese flagship carrier, the Akagi.The performances of the three stars were adequate in the face of the banal dialogue they were forced to say. Ben Affleck and John Hartnett as the friends, and rivals over the same girl, did as well as could be expected. The glamorous nurse of their interests was played by Kate Beckinsale, looking lovely despite too much makeup even for 1941 - and apparently fighting anorexia during the filming.Big stars Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ted Sizemore, also appear and do well, despite roles that are little more than cameos. Gooding, playing the hero navy steward, and first black man to receive the Navy Cross, made us wish we could have seen a little more of his life in a segregated Navy, and a little less of the romance, although another film just dealt with that topic. Dan Aykroyd as a fictionalized Navy cryptographer, and Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, do little more than look ever more serious and dour scene to scene.Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done what they usually do with films - great action hanging together on a threadbare plot. For $140 million it is amazing they couldn't have found a better script. If they simply remade 'Tora, Tora, Tora' word for word but with the new special effects it would have been better.So we have a banal romance mixed together with white-washed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make 'Pearl Harbor' worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts.",1,1,1,25 May 2001

Not so.Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent raid on Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of his planes was named 'The Ruptured Duck' - accurate and a tribute to the great war film 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo', which should be rented and seen by all. Baldwin. I thought that putz was 'leaving the country if Bush gets elected'. Figures Kim Bassinger dumped him. As the B-25's bombed Japan Americans in the Phillipines - and Filipinos - were being subjected to Japanese atrocities and murders. Ignored by Disney, of course.The film made various historical alterations such as eliminating from Roosevelt's classic Declaration of War speech before Congress his last emphatic words after resolving to achieve the final victory: 'So help us God'. Perhaps God is not PC.The absence of the U.S. aircraft carriers during the bombing - so fortuitous for America's fortunes - was not referred to.Despite growing evidence that Roosevelt knew beforehand about the coming Japanese attack and wanted it as the only way to get America into the war against Hitler, the film ignores that issue totally and presents FDR as surprised by it.American Admiral Kimmell, commanding at Pearl, was somewhat overly scapegoated in 1941 for the disaster; here, he is shown much too favorably and as a victim of Naval leaders too obtuse to perceive the coming Japanese sneak attack, which is itself a specious over-simplification.The attack began with Japanese midget submarines infiltrating the harbor and being engaged by a U.S. destroyer. Ignored in the film.Doolittle's raid on Japan, and other cities besides Tokyo, actually resulted not in the Japanese moving back, as the end of movie narration claimed, but launching their biggest naval attack of the war. It, unfortunately for them, ended in defeat at the Battle of Midway, which was also not mentioned despite it being the true Turning Point of the war.Curiously, despite such historical issues distorted or dismissed, the movie was careful enough to show, accurately, details such as the famous flag of Admiral Togo, who defeated the Russians in 1904, flying over the Japanese flagship carrier, the Akagi.The performances of the three stars were adequate in the face of the banal dialogue they were forced to say. Ben Affleck and John Hartnett as the friends, and rivals over the same girl, did as well as could be expected. The glamorous nurse of their interests was played by Kate Beckinsale, looking lovely despite too much makeup even for 1941 - and apparently fighting anorexia during the filming.Big stars Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ted Sizemore, also appear and do well, despite roles that are little more than cameos. Gooding, playing the hero navy steward, and first black man to receive the Navy Cross, made us wish we could have seen a little more of his life in a segregated Navy, and a little less of the romance, although another film just dealt with that topic. Dan Aykroyd as a fictionalized Navy cryptographer, and Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, do little more than look ever more serious and dour scene to scene.Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done what they usually do with films - great action hanging together on a threadbare plot. For $140 million it is amazing they couldn't have found a better script. If they simply remade 'Tora, Tora, Tora' word for word but with the new special effects it would have been better.So we have a banal romance mixed together with whitewashed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make 'Pearl Harbor' worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts.Hopefully though, the film will introduce WW II to the hoi poloi and to those ignorant unwashed masses so ignorant of History thanks to public education failures.",1,0,0,25 May 2001

Gone with the Wind," A 'Woman's Picture' and a Dated Curio
","We know that much of GWTW was great: sets; performances; music; the epic scope; etc. But I will not say the plot was a standout, and here's why.After the war was over, GWTW devolved into a tedious over-drawn soap; I really squirmed with some of those scenes in the mansion. It had been a 'woman's picture' all along, and the last half of the movie was really a drag. Besides that, the appeal of Scarlett for Ashley - and Rhett for Scarlett - has long been a mystery to me. Scarlett herself was a conniving, selfish, self-centered, manipulative little witch with no discernible redeeming values. And Melanie and Ashley were bores, while Rhett was a smug egomaniac. No, I did not like the characters! Hattie McDaniel's 'Mammy' did deserve the Oscar she got, though.Besides the problems with the plot, 'GWTW' is historically a tired old curio rife with distortions, although nowhere near as bad as the vicious 'Birth of a Nation'. The stereotypical scenes were all there: the 'happy darkies' so pleased to be slaves; the malicious 'Yankee overlord'; the 'evil Carpetbaggers' after the war; the 'poor oppresed South' during Reconstruction; and so on. It was all a lie. The slaves were not happy to be slaves; the overlords were either Southerners or often slaves themselves; and Reconstruction was too easy on the racist South with it's Ku Klux Klan and other white racist gangs working to restore the status quo ante-bellum by terrorism.If you like women's movies and know the History presented is nonsense, you can surely enjoy the grandeur of 'GWTW' and the great performances of its huge stars.",7,1,5,20 September 1999
K-19: The Widowmaker," SUPERB STUDY IN COMMAND - Not Just another 'Submarine Movie'.
","Any reviewer who sees this fine film - and great character study - as merely 'another submarine movie' is braindead. The location happens to be on a submarine, but 'K-19' is in fact a marvelous study of the problems of command, its responsibilities, and the ongoing struggle between the new captain's methods and those of the former captain whom he replaced. It is their battle of styles and personalities that makes this movie a great success.This film depicts (and dramatizes) an historic event, for decades kept secret until the end of the Soviet Union. So I don't believe there are SPOILERS BELOW, but there might be.The date is 1961 - the height of the Cold War - and the Soviet Union has launched its first nuclear-powered submarine complete with an unarmed ICBM. The purpose is to show the Americans the Soviet's nuclear capability by launching the test missile from the Arctic ice cap, thus making a first strike on 'The Motherland' less likely. It is another step in the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction.Captain Polenin (Liam Neeson) of this new K-19 submarine is pushed down a notch in the chain of command when an electric circuit fails during a test firing and he is rather arrogant with the resident admiral observing. Polenin becomes Executive Officer and Captain Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is appointed to command the boat - a vessel already plagued with bad luck and construction deaths; hence, the nickname 'The Widowmaker'.Vostrikov is under strict orders to complete his mission (the test firing) on schedule which the Soviet high command is pushing to have completed as soon as possible. The problem with this, a fatal flaw. is that hurrying the mission has resulted in shoddy workmanship on various ship components; they don't even have radiation suits in case of a nuclear accident the ship carrying only useless chemical suits.Vostrikov (Ford) takes over the boat to some resentment by the crew, especially the officers, who favored Polenin (Neeson). The drills that Vostrikov immediately begins clearly shows the crew is unready, with some of the drills looking highly inept and chaotic - a bad reflection on Polenin. Vostrikov continues to push the crew despite injuries and even more resentment, a near-crisis comes when K-19 is ordered to dive to 300 meters (near crush depth) and then it emergency surfaces crashing right through the Arctic ice, at which point Vostrikov immediately, and successfully, launches the missile.Throughout all of this Polenin advised against what Vostrikov was doing, even to the point of leaving his post in a huff and later berating Vostrikov for endangering the crew. Accurately, the captain tells his XO the men had to be pushed to the limit not only to see what they could do but to, in effect, mold them into a stronger crew ready to die as needed in the future. Their camaraderie while playing on the polar ice is indication of this.Vostrikov, whom someone I read stupidly compared to 'Capt. Bligh', was right, and Polenin, whose crew was so sloppy in drills, was mostly wrong. But there is more to this.Vostrikov's father was both a Soviet hero - and a prisoner in the GULAG. Perhaps as such, he has always made special efforts to be totally loyal to his country and the Party. That blind loyalty will eventually be tested by the disaster about to befall K-19, a situation where the humanity and flexibility of Polenin will be found to be more than appropriate.The boat's nuclear reactor's coolant suddenly develops a leak and fails. Despite what we heard in the film there was no real danger of 'a thermonuclear explosion'; there WAS a danger of the core melting right through the hull and likely exploding as it hit the cold water. The movie's attempts to suggest that there would a nuclear explosion and possible war between the U.S. and Soviet Union were strained. Polenin's emotionalism hits bottom when he foolishly blames Vostrikov for this disaster for having ordered the former reactor officer off the ship for being drunk on duty.Vostrikov now is confronted by the horrid reality: there is no way to save the submarine and crew and avoid nuclear core meltdown without repairing the reactor coolant - and to do this sailors have to enter the radiation-filled chamber wearing nothing more than useless chemical suits. Heroically, they do, and more heroically others also do even after seeing the first repair crew leave the reactor deathly sick and vomiting. Only the new young reactor officer balks at entering this chamber of death, although he redeems himself later with great bravery. We fairly well knew he would succumb having seen him earlier kiss his fiance good-by.K-19, the reactor in no immediate danger of meltdown but now filled with radiation, is forced to surface, and Vostrikov initially resists all suggestions from Polenin and others to evacuate the boat, or request assistance from the Americans who have seen the submarine. At this point, one of Polenin's officers, and even the commissar (political officer) stage mutiny and seize the vessel from Vostrikov at gunpoint. That is the same commissar who ironically earlier indoctrinated the crew with anti-American propaganda.Polenin refuses to take command and puts down the mutiny. There seems little doubt now that he now understood better the loyalty and devotion to duty of Vostrikov, and how effective and cool in the crisis the captain was. Vostrikov, on the other hand, better recognizes the need to appeal to the humanity of the crew, and shows his own humanity by seeing to it K-19's sick crew is evacuated to another Soviet sub despite orders to the contrary.Vostrikov and Polenin have finally reached a mutual understanding as they finally recognize and respect each other's views and methods.Together they were better than either could have been individually. The final scene twenty-eight years later at the graves of those sailors who died saving the sub and their crewmates was moving indeed.Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson were excellent both separately and in their chemistry. Comments by some about their accents not being adequate are trivial, although Sean Connery's was better 'Hunt for Red October'. The rest of the cast, though no-name, was also fine. Kathryn Bigelow's direction is quite suitable and good, although it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to use moving cameras, quick cuts, and dramatic closeups aboard a submarine to great effect; there are enough submarine films out there already to supply examples.One of those films, 'Crimson Tide', depicts a different sort of power struggle between the senior captain and the new XO over nuclear launch protocol. That is entirely different than the more subtle struggle in 'K-19' which I found fascinating.The sets are suitably grimy and dark to depict a Soviet sub in 1961 that does not even appear to be very well made or especially advanced technologically. The danger of something going wrong on K-19 always seems probable.'K-19' is an intelligent film and I found it absorbing. It is not a puerile exercise in special effects. The relationship between Vostrikov and Polenin was simply compelling. A wonderful movie.",9,2,3,19 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," AN WILD EXPERIENCE! ORIGINAL and EYE-CATCHING, but not for everyone.
","Anyone expecting anything even remotely like the 1952 'Moulin Rouge' with Jose Ferrer (see reviews) will be blown away by this. I was. This was closer to something like the Ferrer version meets 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', less the sexual identity confusion so popular with some.First of all, the cinematography and general camera work were daring and effective. Kudos to the director. The art direction was utterly fabulous and almost certain to get an Oscar nomination; the sets, costumes, and general 'look' of the film were original, beautiful, and brilliant.
The music was jolting in that much of it was from popular and rock music of the past generation - that in Paris in 1900! Offenbach's 'Can-Can' was set to words and sung, but not on the floor of the Moulin Rouge club; for that we had 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' done by Nicole Kidman as Satine the club's sensuous star. After the initial surprise at the anachronistic music we learn to adjust to it and 'go with the flow'. The same with the wild, often frenetic direction with over-the-top lighting. The story and characterizations are none too deep: young writer falls in love with the gorgeous star but she is coveted by the rich duke who owns the lease on the club. True love triumphs over obstacles, but eventually tragedy results. (Anyone see 'La Traviata'?). But the plot isn't the point. You want deep character studies rent the 1952 version with Jose Ferrer as Henri Toulose-Lautrec, here played by John Leguizamo, but without even an allusion to his painting prowess.The plot might have ben more interesting had Satine and Henri (called 'Toulose' in the film, just as in the 1952 version!) the undersized artist had some relationship. The rest of the acting was quite good with Jim Broadbent (see 'Topsy Turvy') particularly unctious as the club's manager.Definitely RECOMMENDED. Although I know well it is NOT for everyone and there are those who may hate it for the frenzied pace, the music, and an almost surreal feel at time - a singing moon, for instance! But I liked it; I thought it cool!One warning/complaint. I saw this in a Cineplex Odeon theater in NYC. And the second and last reels (total of thirty minutes) were noticeable BLURRY. Bad job, Cineplex Odeon. If anyone else has a complaint just go to their web site and forward it along.",7,0,1,4 June 2001
Men in Black II," OK, but A DISAPPOINTING COMMERCIAL
","You know the plot - if you can call it a 'plot'. What MIB II really is is a big excuse for the latest digital FX, and shameless product placement commercials. Was it bad? No. But besides being surprisingly SHORT in length, there is really nothing original here nor anything that tries to surpass the first MIB. It is just bigger explosions and weirder aliens, with absolutely nothing of a real plot nor characters we care about.Lara Flynn Boyle - the ultra-skinny Lara Flynn Boyle - is one of those digital creations: she actually has a computer-enhanced body here. She's fine as the cartoonish villain.Will Smith is always good, but the attempts to give him a romantic relationship with a human female are strained and go nowhere. If the movie was a little longer they could have done something with this, but I assume the film is aimed at ten-year-olds with a short attention span.Rip Torn and Tommy Lee Jones, also fine actors like Smith, but are limited by the script which doesn't give them much to work with. We've seen all these same expressions with MIB I.The most memorable 'actor' is the talking dog. Which tells you everything you need to know about how lame the script is and how shallow the characters are.MIB II also goes right into shameless product placement with ads for actual products and brand names all over the place. They even got in a plug (or cameo) for Michael Jackson - who looks like more of a freak than the two-headed alien. And I wasn't impressed that much by the digital FX either on him. The alien, not Jackson. Michael always looks very weird and scary.Anyway, it was a passable ninety with lots of effects. I saw it at a half price matinee and even then it was hardly worth it.",4,0,0,4 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," GOOD REALISTIC WAR FILM. Blame Bill Clinton for this fight.
","When I saw 'We Were Soldiers' I immediately compared it to this film. The most obvious difference is that 'Black Hawk Down' was more of a straight action film depicting the hell of war, while 'We Were Soldiers' made more of an effort to depict the human element - of the Americans, their wives, and even of the Vietnamese. Ridley Scott's purpose in making 'Black Hawk Down' was clearly to show the utter chaos of the combat in Mogadishu, and in that he succeeded.Although we may not know the human beings quite as well as we'd like, the audience can grasp the turmoil into which they were thrown - and that is a vivid though unstated indictment of Americasn leadership, and especially the pusillanimous Clinton administration that left them hanging without adequate backup, armor, or air support, even though these were requested.Although Bill Clinton, and his then Sec. of Defense, Les Aspin, deserve much of the blame, the commander on the scene, Gen. Garrison, must accept some culpability also. He was depicted as having not bothered to even tell other Allied troops on the scene of the planned incursion into Mogadishu: the U.S. 10th Mountain Division, the Pakistanis, and others. No excuse for that. Clinton later bugged out while scape-goating Les Aspin. It is now revealed Osama Bin Laden was much encouraged by Clinton's cutting and running out of Somalia. A good, realistic war film. And I give it credit for not opening up the can of worms that would be the politics of it all. Although perhaps an unstated message would be for the U.S. to be far more circumspect in where it goes in efforts to 'help' those who neither want nor deserve help.",8,0,0,10 March 2002
The Mummy Returns," MORE PATRICIA VELASQUEZ!!
","'The Mummy' was a fun, enjoyable action film with great special effects. 'The Mummy Returns' is pretty much the same. If you liked the first there is no way you could not like this.Instead of Imhotep's face in a giant sandstorm he is there in a giant wall of water. Still cool. There are generally a little more digital FX's, which is neither good nor bad; that is the way it is. There are some DIFFERENCES. The bad ones are that there is a bit less character development and more mindless fun. Some scenes and things seem aimed at a slightly younger audience, such as the flying dirigible, which I did not need. Wrestling star, The Rock, was not entirely convincing as a giant digital scorpion.On the other hand, the film makes GREAT use of the two hot brunette babes, Rachel Weisz, and PATRICIA VELASQUEZ who played Ank-Su Namun, the mummy's main squeeze. Both are used much better and feistier than in the first film. Velasquez had little more than a cameo then, but fit in nicely here in a major role. Velasquez is a former Miss Venezuela and top model, and is gorgeous, and does a very nice job acting, too. If there is a third 'Mummy' I sure want to see more of her.Very good popcorn entertainment. Fun. Go see it, or rent it when available.",7,0,0,2 June 2001

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," GOOD FUN!! But is Harry is going to Hell?!
","Unlike so many who have posted here, I have not only never read a single Harry Potter book, I have never seen nor touched one, nor barely heard of the children's book character until this film came out. So I am in fine position to evaluate the movie on its own merits without any invidious comparisons to published books and the events therein.Having gone to the theater on the recommendation of a friend, I had no idea what to expect, or whether, as an adult, I would like it, be bored - or be sickened. I was pleasantly surprised.It has all the elements children love: empowerment especially over adults; secret passageways; cryptic messages and meanings; camaraderie with close friends (especially as a surrogate family); and the occasional monster. But besides all that, I found it to be enjoyable magical fun, and I too got swept up in the adventure, and in the whimsy of such as a secret street for wizards and magicians.Of course, the school villains are two-dimensional at best, and we've seen their like going back to 'Tom Brown's Schooldays'. This is the weakest element of the script.I do have to wonder about all the wizardry and witchcraft in a world devoid of God resulting in one way tickets to Hell for all of them. But it hardly matters in such a world of the imagination - a place divorced from reality. And thankfully so.",7,0,1,9 March 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Good, but the HUMAN ELEMENT IS WEAK and unconvincing
","Saw 'Enemy at the Gates'. Huge production and realistic, and it's well worth seeing. But there are some flaws, and a Khruschev who looks way too old for 1942 isn't a major one (Bob Hoskins is great in the role, though).This very good film has two significant flaws, and the intrusive cockney English accents, especially of Jude Law, is one. It is most distracting. It was very foolish of the director to permit this, or maybe it was his dumb idea. Russians speaking with cockney accents! Jeez. Maybe it'll go over well in the East End of London.The other flaw is that one cannot get emotionally involved with any character, or at least I did not. I didn't care about the love story either. Also, the winner of the sniper duel used trickery courtesy of the suicide of his cohort, and I didn't care much for that either. (No names! No spoilers!).Having read the book long ago I know the denouement of that duel, but even those who didn't know may not get emotionally involved in the human element of the film. Perhaps it had something to do with both sides being despicable totalitarian regimes. I'm supposed to really care that one minor cog of a murderous despotism run by a madman killed a minor cog of a different murderous despotism run by a second madman? Also, somehow the acting didn't do the job nor transmit the right emotion, vulnerability, and desperation. 
The attempts to humanize, and then demonize, Major Koenig towards the end of the film seemed forced and didn't work for me. Ed Harris is a fine actor, but even his character was not fully realized and somewhat two-dimensional.But nonetheless, a very good film, but it won't be entering my DVD collection unless I see it in the 'under $14' bin. Go see it, but you may not come away really empathetic with the characters.",7,0,0,19 March 2001
A Beautiful Mind," One of the most OVERRATED corny films of the year!
","'A Beautiful Mind' may not be the most overrated film of the year ('The Royal Tenenbaums' is), but it is close - which is not to say it isn't good; it is. But just because Russell Crowe is superb and it is a feel-good cloying tearjerker does not make it great.You bet it is a tearjerker, and overhyped. The two final syrupy scenes - the presentation of the pens, and the Nobel Prize ceremony - nearly gave me diabetes. The entire movie revolves around two concepts: Modern Psychiatry is brutal and ineffective, and all a disturbed man needs is the love of a good woman. So simplistic and specious.Nevertheless, it is a good well-made, though manipulative, film taking us into the psychotic world of the famous mathematician. It is loosely based on his life, but conveniently ignores such as his delving into homosexuality which got him arrested and fired from his job. In Left-wing Hollywood I'm surprised they didn't push this abnormality. The performances, especially by Crowe, are first-rate; I being especially impressed by Christopher Plummer.
No way on this planet is 'A Beautiful Mind' in the same league as 'Lord of the Rings' - which IS truly great. If the former wins the Academy Award it will be due only to internal Hollywood politics, which is why 'Shakespeare in Love' beat up the great 'Saving Private Ryan''A Beautiful Mind'. Good. See it for the performances. But I had no trouble thinking of better movies from this past year.",5,0,2,10 March 2002

Signs," MANIPULATIVE, EMPTY, PRETENTIOUS. In otherwords, IT STINKS.
","I for one am very tired of being manipulated by M. Night Shyamalan, and offered movies with pretentious messages and warped little twists. 'Signs' is similar to 'Unbreakable' in that style, and this is a real disappointment.In the trailers and ads we are shamelessly deceived into thinking this is about aliens and will be real scary. It is really about some corny internal spiritual journey the main character (Gibson) takes after his wife's death in a car crash. What the message is remains unclear; supposedly it is about 'faith', those who have it and those who don't. But the dopey end seems to mock Christian beliefs, leaving us with an entirely empty message with no point or reolution.Shyamalan uses film school tricks and ideas lifted from various other movies to build the tension, while trying to get us to emotionally 'bond' with the farm family being visited by aliens. This direction is so obvious I sat there analyzing it more than feeling it. At the end what have we? A dead alien who is more than a mere alien, a baseball bat, water phobia, and no discernible resolution on the matter of faith and The Great Beyond. What the alien really is up to struck me as ridiculous for various reasons. WAIT FOR THE DVD.",3,2,3,2 August 2002
Windtalkers," EXCELLENT - and GORY - Blood and Guts War Film!!
","Intense fighting, and blood and gore, highlight this excellent depiction of one man's personal crisis amidst the chaos of America's invasion of Japanese-held Saipan in 1944. The movie does indeed rock, and Cage is very effective without being over-dramatic.True it is that the U.S. Marines used Navaho-speaking soldiers to keep secret their messages in the Pacific in World War Two. The Japanese could never decypher them. But it is not true that Marines, such as Nicolas Cage's character, were assigned to not only be bodyguards but to assassinate them in case of imminent capture during combat. That is the premise of the film.Cage meanwhile is haunted with the horror, and guilt, of having had all his men killed in an earlier battle; besides that, he is plagued with hearing loss and lack of balance from his injuries. Entering the scene is the very upbeat Navaho code-talker played by Adam Beach. Due to his own demons, Cage is unfriendly and standoffish to the newcomer whom he has to guard - and maybe kill.As the gruesome and gory combat progresses Cage becomes more and more psychologically and physically tortured, although he does show signs of humanity. The Beach character stands up for his Navaho heritage against one prejudiced Marine. It is only after the terrible death of his best friend, the other Navaho code-talker, that Beach finally gets the killer instinct he was so lacking. It might seem a little pat, but is entirely logical. This all results in a final crisis for him and Cage in the last battle of the film.There are plenty of fights throughout the movie; you do not wait ninety minutes for something to happen like with that bomb 'Pearl Harbor'. Don't go out for popcorn.Swedish actor Peter Stormare (Steve Buscemi's crazy partner from 'Fargo') plays the Gunnery Sergeant in charge of the platoon; there seemed to be no officers around except to hand out medals. Stormare's accent is a little off, but he's good and intense, and lean and mean.My biggest complaint about the film is the absurd way Cage can fire a burst from his Thompson sub-machinegun, or several rounds from his .45 pistol, and half a dozen Japs instantly are hit and come tumbling down the nearest hill. Cage never misses; the Japs are terrible shots, and none too good at hand-to-hand combat either. Man, they get bayoneted easy!But those are minor complaints. Overall, this is one good war film, and in many wats reminiscent of the 1967 Cornell Wilde/Rip Torn film 'Beach Red', or the original 'Thin Red Line' from 1964, both of which deserve to be rented. Same applies to Buddy Ebsen's 'between Heaven and Hell' from 1956, and 1950's 'Halls of Montezuma' with Richard Widmark. Fine films all, and all better than the introspective and moody 'Thin Red Line' remake.NINE OUT OF TEN!!",9,1,3,15 June 2002
