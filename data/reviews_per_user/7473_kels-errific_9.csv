Resident Evil: Afterlife," Pretty, yet bad. Pretty bad.
","Yes its a movie about fighting zombies. Yes gravity in this movie is like a yo yo and can be manipulated. Yes its fanciful, but the minute a movie's main hero is able to survive an explosive plane crash, and not really indicate how it was accomplished, you lost me. Alice after being made human through the beginning of the first act, is sent careening, in bullet B U L L E T b - u - l - l - e - t time through an exploding window, and is able to walk away from the debris. Boo, Hollywood, boo. I figured I was in trouble after that, and for the most part I was right. The action was OK, but far from the things I thought I was in store for. The script, horrible. Really bad. I sense the actors care about this movie, and it sucks that they are some of the most two dimensional characters I've seen in a movie, ever. The 3-d was pretty, but it was not enough for me. The movie was poorly conceived. Every now and then, they'd throw things at the resident evil gamers, like a clumsy wink: look gamers, Claire is back! Note her red hair, and vest, you remember her from the games? And Chris! That's her brother, wink wink. But then the movie doesn't really do anything with it. It's like, OK I've got your attention, now get ready for them to act completely opposite of their characters. Chris is kinda creepy, and Claire is actually kind of a b*tch in the movie. The only one who was spot on was the executioner. Alice sees some growth but the rest of the cast is pretty painful, as nothing happens to them. Wesker was all right, but he is basically left to be chewed up and spat out by the horrible lines he has to say. Sometimes, like when the survivors are making their way through burrowed caves, I felt immersed in the film and claustrophobic. Could this train wreck be turned around? Nope, false call. Just potential for something better. The best part of the movie, was the ending cameo from Jill Valentine. She delivered acting that didn't make me cringe, looked hot doing it, and kind of saved the film from getting a three from me, not joking. I feel Paul the writer and director has lost what grip he had on the franchise from the first film. Flirting with a fan boy with greatness to deliver crap is pretty dangerous. This film felt rushed, unpolished and just ugh. Yup, ugh. There will be a fifth film, so I feel more weary of that idea than ever. 5/10",5,12,26,12 September 2010
Coraline," WONDERFULLY... ARGGH! SO AWESOME, loss of words
","OK, we're gonna take a stab ( or well woven needle hand) at this movie. I hearted it. I hearted it for the movie's heroine, for the eerie, tangible dark balance of the movie ( for every fluffy cotton candy canon, there was a dark rodent or spooky part to even the movie out) for the beautiful animation and artistry, and for a quipy script. I've read people's review saying the movie had no heart, and that is a lie. This movie has a strong message about family, and even had a scene that made me teary eyed, and I'm like 25 ! lol Another high point was the soundtrack and 3-d vision. Both were pulled to such high quality, it just enhances the experience. Henry Selick, you are a genius and Neil Gaiman must be proud to have this film on screen. 10/10 * see you soon ...;)",10,7,12,7 February 2009
500 Days of Summer," One of my favourite movies!!
","Some movies, I enjoy thoroughly but would be hard pressed to watch them again. Every now and then a rare thing will happen where a movie has this irresistible charm and can be viewed repeatedly. 500 Days of summer is such a movie. From the first frame, I knew this movie was for me. I love quirky characters and indie soundtracks, so it not be an exaggeration to say the movie won me over at the beginning. The story is something anyone can relate too. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl is indifferent and despite seeming like the one, further scrutiny would tell a different story. I thought the two man actors, Joseph and Zooey had amazing chemistry. Their uncomfortable moments made me uncomfortable, their tender moments put a smile on my face, etc. I just felt the portrayal of a relationship was spot on, warts and all, without coming off as cheesy or smoothed over. Plus, the smith nods? :) I love this movie!! There are no villains, and I think this is the sign of a great work when instead of finger pointing, it relates that sometimes things do not work out and it is nobody's fault. I know a lot of people will hate Summer and her character, but by the end, I felt happy to know she was happy and saw Joseph's character accept her resolve, and say that he wants her to be happy. Beautiful. Saying to someone you've loved you wish them happiness outside of your embrace, that takes immeasurable strength. The moment had me in tears, because it is rare you are able to see such poignant grace. 10/10PS The Regina Spektor song at the beginning owns my life, I love the soundtrack to this movie. :) x5",10,0,1,8 July 2010
Silent Hill," Welcome to Silent Hill...
","Silent Hill in all it's violent glory, has done something video game movies have been attempting to do for years. It somewhat successfully merges cinema with gaming, in an almost digestible fashion.... almost. But perceptive readers will re-read the above sentence and feel the underlying emphasis on possibilities, and sadly, the movie is not the epic I was hoping for. First off, for a horror movie, there were seldom scares, if any. Sure when the siren in the town of Silent Hill went off, your blood ran cold as you knew Hell was about to carve the town a new hole, but there were no moments of sheer fright. However, what the movie lacked in the scare department, it more than compensated with striking imagery and gore. Good god, this movie has images that will haunt you long after your viewing. When the town's walls begin to bleed and peel, it's imagery that is worth noting. But we all know pretty images ( or in this case, a bloody table of carnage delights) does not a good film make. Oddly enough, my biggest gripe with the movie wasn't the movie itself but the idiots who decided to see the movie on the opening night with me. But, this is a review, read my blog for further pissiness on the issue. This movie is... in a word... LONG! And not just a little, it's huge, and I am of the mind had some bits been cut, it would have sat more favorably with me. I loved the actors in this movie though, especially some hefty fright-work compliments of Rhada Mitchell, who not only strikes a compelling mix of the fright of her character in Silent Hill, but the overpowering strength of mother hood that imbues her character to move on even with Hell itself at her heels. Woot for credibility for a game film! This is not a film for everybody though. It charges at you with electric scenes of thrills, than comes to an almost screeching halt with story exposition. If it sounds like the architecture of a roller coaster, it's because it is. Sure the slow climb of a roller-coaster cart is needed to get to the top of a drop for the right speed to send you careening in loops that provide the real thrills, but in Silent Hill, the moments outside of the town just aren't that interesting. When the darkness invades the town, it throws so much at you, and then it's over. < blinks> Kinda anti-climatic. But that's the nature of this movie. If you want to be scared, this movie is not for you. This is more of a thriller as opposed to the straight advertised horror moniker. I, however, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Because for once, I felt the director and people involved truly brought something legitimate to the table. This is definitely a good step in the right direction. Sadly though, Silent Hill evades greatness and sits above average, but below spectacular...",7,0,2,22 April 2006
Salt," First great movie of the summer!
","I loved this movie! I caught a DVD of one of Angelina's first movies, cyborg 2, and saw her do some brief action pieces. You see in Cyborg 2 a shimmer of the force of nature we have now. What a difference time makes! She is a veteran action star, and I can't think of another actor who has as much ability and talent and Ms. Jolie does. Within 25 minutes of the movie, we see her blow up a room full of guards, shimmy around a high story building, escape on a freeway by jumping onto motor vehicles, its breathtaking! The pace continues to a fever pitch, and you as a viewer can not help but feel a rush when Salt gets down to business. The plot involves a tale involving Russian sleeper agents, and had a few twists that took me and my guy by surprise. I really enjoyed the story and found myself gripping the seat for the next scene. Salt is a force to be reckoned with: she is resourceful and an intimidating threat, her fight scenes are just brutal. To think that Tom Cruise once was set to star in this movie is just unfathomable. For action fans, you can't do any better. Angelina delivers and proves that the action era once populated by men has come to a close. I gave this movie a healthy nine because I can't remember the last time I had that much fun at the movies! A definite recommend!",9,1,4,14 August 2010
Ghost Rider," wow this movie sucked
","The only thing that saved this train wreck from being a complete calamity was Nick Cage offering charisma in this horribly scripted movie. The quipy one liners do nothing for me. In fact, several scenes became unintentionally funny because whoever penned the script, needs help... and fast! The best example would have to be Johnny's heart to heart with his fist... trying to lure out his dormant powers. This movie had potential. I have come to terms that Marvel movies do nothing for cinema. I hope this movie flops after word of mouth. There were scenes that were so uncomfortable for me to watch, just because the dialog was that bad. ' I'm going to fight fire.... with fire ...' Wow. The fight scenes were abysmal. They introduce these menacing baddies who die rather quickly, rather pathetically. Johnny Blaze's younger self looks nothing like Nick Cage. Eva M can not act, and you know why she's there. Her cleavage can only carry a scene so far though. This makes me sad that such drek can be made. This ... movie... SUCKED! Boo",2,0,3,18 February 2007
The Dark Knight," Pretty impressive
","Best movie ever. Best comic book movie ever. Best performance of an actor playing a crazed clown.... ever. Before I got cuffed upside the head with a bat-a-rang, this is my humble opinion. So if your a frothing fan boy who is going to spam me and b*tch about my opinion, (hey at least I know I am having an audience!) than just dl the script and make little script babies with it till your hearts content. First off the .. BAD! ha you thought I was going to start with the good. OK, what is up with Batman's Batman voice? I thought about it, and was like, maybe he has to smoke like 12 cigars and go clubbing in a nicotine infested dance floor while shouting out the lyrics to ACDC's thunderstruck in order to ' hide' his Bruce Wayne voice, but every time Christian Bale used this tactic, I cringed in my seat. Umm, uncool. Secondly, Rachel Dawes (sp?) Her character is so out of place in this mythology, its painful. The movie is filled with nods to the comic's characters, I don't ever recall a Rachel from the books ( I could be wrong). Maggie G. is a fantastic actress, and I understand why her character is in place to motivate another character's actions but her character was the weakest link. I had as much emotional attachment to her as I did my 8th grade teacher. ( that was a slam btw) Thirdly, the tragedy. This one can not be helped, but Heath owns this movie. Every scene he is in, you can't take your eyes off the screen. The Joker here is Batman's ultimate nemesis, as he should be. It sucks realizing that his character can not be continued, and it sucks that an amazing actor left, but what a legacy. I doubt his performance will be topped. Now the good. ( and you thought I was a meanie :P) Heath obviously. The script is well paced, and though the movie is epic long ( 2 and a half hours me thinks) your so involved with the screen shenanigans, time just flies by. Nolan addressed his action faults from the first movie, and the action is filmed more clearly and with more heroic gusto. Now the main draw. This movie pushes an moral ambiguity through the film. I have to emphasize this especially through Harvey Dent. When you see this movie, it will bring up questions. Not stupid questions like when you watched Batman & Robin, but questions that burn a hole in the entire perception of duality in man. Wow. All and all, a great movie. Perfect? Far from it, but dangerously close. I can't wait, because of Nolan's achievement has changed the landscape of what to expect from a comic movie. It's still not the best comic book movie I've seen, but damn, what a ride. The days of crappy comic cop outs may be coming to end. ( see, I wasn't too malicious ;)",8,2,8,1 September 2008
Alice in Wonderland," :(
","So gauging by my summary, being a small unhappy face, you can probably tell I was not a fan of this movie. Sure, before I saw it, I was on-board. Clips and art, it looked so promising. How an hour and a half does change things. I really want to hear from Tim Burton that he is absolutely thrilled with the cut of this film. Because I am not buying it. It wreaks of studio chopping, this film is a pretentious mess. But Disney knows two things: Alice is a marketable brand, and Tim Burton is a marketable man. So, this movie will do well, but its revenue is hardly deserved. This story is not clever, tries to add a sturdy narrative to the story, fails in every regard and destroys the tone of the movie by having the most mind boggling, out of place dance in a movie, PERIOD. That better win an accolade, as it is soo ballsy and uncomfortable, it feels more like it was done on a dare rather than creative vision. The cast is here, with some great performances even, the effects are OK, but we never get to explore Wonderland because Tim's Alice is running all the time. (I should note that I saw the 2D version) But even then, I went in expecting cleverness, and found the script believes we are all idiots. Underland? Ummm no, that was the poorest name correction I've seen in film, and utterly unnecessary. It reads like this: Oh I really like that idea, but I want to put my own spin on it! Lewis Carroll had it all wrong, I should do him the favour of correcting his spelling blunder! ...This all of course spins on the needle end of a feminist undertone, that while I applaud the notion, is executed horribly. This is Tim's first true failure to me, and even with the intimidating cast he has assembled, it seems fitting the last scene of the movie is on a ship, as the whole production should go down with it. Cruel words? Maybe. But a remake, or sequel should only be attempted should a) the new material add something fresh to the property or b) be necessary to resolve any unturned circumstances in the original. Alice had neither, the original story remains the best. Very disappointed.",4,2,5,18 March 2010
X-Men: First Class," Classy affair!
","I loved this movie! X-men movies as of late have not been the best, but I saw this one and within the first 45 minutes knew that this movie was a step in the right direction. Its no secret to those who know me of my love for Mystique and Magneto, so to have two amazing actors breath life into my favourite duo was an amazing affirmation from the movie telling me the franchise was in more than good hands. I will go on the record and say Wolverine is the most overrated X-men in my opinion, and revelled in the fact that he was not the primary focus in this film. The movie lends itself very well to a 60's vibe, and the story is an origins story of how Xavier and co created the xmen. Watching the film unravel, you realize that Matthew Vaughn the director understands that action itself is not enough, that to create characters you really care for stands as the proper motivation for gluing you to the screen. I really cared for all of the characters, and the payoff was the best xmen movie so far! Xcellent film :P",10,1,3,23 June 2011
