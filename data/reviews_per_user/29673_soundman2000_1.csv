Sucker Punch," What is wrong with Hollywood these days?
","Sorta hot girls, Guns, swords, dragons, steam powered nazi zombies, robots, samurais, whore house, insane asylum, evil step father, that ugly high school musical chick. Yup all these things are in SuckerPunch. Now do any of things have anything to do with anything? Nope these are all things just thrown in to show look what I can do with cg! That's all this movie is. The acting sucks, the story is undefined, the main character is defeated and lobotomized in the end and a chunk of this movie has stolen scenes from other movies and video games. The cgi scene where they have to steal a bomb codenamed 'knife' from a train I honestly thought what the bloody hell...... none of that scene was original. They board a train which rides on floating railways. This being the exact same train from the video game Final Fantasy 13 in the opening sequence. Once inside they have to defeat the robots from I-Robot. When trying to steal the bomb the character rocket bends down on one knee and reaches behind her back and pulls out one of those orange and black explosives the black gaurds use in Tron legacy and then blah blah blah. Don't WATCH THIS FILM!",1,35,76,26 March 2011
