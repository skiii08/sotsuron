Blade Runner 2049," An absolutely mind blowing experience! (Don't be fooled by the trailers)
","To say that I wasn't disappointed watching this film for the first time on the big screen would be a huge understatement. The fact that it 'didn't do so well' at the box office should give you a great idea of how this film steered away from the usual dribble that has been coming out these past couple of years to appeal to the masses and didn't pull a Ghost in the Shell.The trailers gave so much of a wrong impression to how the film actually is, and honestly when I watched them I was severely disappointed and sceptical, boy I was wrong.The film should be exactly what Blade Runner fans have been looking for all these years! I say should because you obviously can't please everyone, but nearly everyone ;)Some people complained about 3 hours being too long, I would have sat through for twice that amount easily and loved every second.An easy 10/10",8,2,9,17 October 2017

I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews..
