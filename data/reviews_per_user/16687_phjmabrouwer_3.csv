First Man," Impressive and compelling
",Beautiful and convincing tale about the path of Neil Armstrong and his family towards his first steps on the moon. The movie not only focuses on the hard science but also on the impact Neil's ambitions had on his wife and children. Modest and yet also extravagant and compelling in the visuals. A movie worthy to the legacy of Neil Armstrong: the first man ... on the moon',8,1,3,20 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A very good Ending (Surrounded by Hatred)
","I saw my first Star Wars movie in 1977 and I was a fan ever since. The second one, Episode V, was even better and has become my personal benchmark. No Star Wars movie, made after Empire, was better! But that's my humble opinion. Episode III came close, as did Epsiode VII. And here's the thing. We like to compare the movies. And we shouldn't. Because it is not fair. Every movie is a movie on its own.The Rise Of Skywalker is a damn good movie with an incredible pace, humor and a solid story. Does it leave questions unanswered? Yes, in a way. Especially the return of Palpatine made me wonder 'how on earth dit he survive the destruction of the Death Star above the Endor moon?' But guess what? If you want logic, go see Star Trek. This is Star Wars where things happen that defy... well... things. Let's be real: who can explain the Force? But yet, it's the most important element of the Star Wars myth.So, again, the Rise Of Skywalker is a damn good movie and I enjoyed it through and through. And if you don't like it, So Be It (Jedi)...And to all those who gave it 1s, 2s and 3s: you call your selves fans? Shame on you! You don't have to like it, I don't care. All you do is spread hatred and confusion and to speak in Star Wars terminology: 'that's the Dark Side'. Many of you blame Disney for bad Star Wars Movies. All I sense is frustration, deep frustration. As far as I am concerned, Disney is not to blame (thanks to them we will have more Star Wars), but you are to blame. For poisoning the atmosphere around the best movie series ever made. Again, shame on you.And to all others I say: go see the movie and enjoy it. I did and will do again!",9,21,48,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars VIII: What With All That Negativity?
","I was 13 years old when I was totally blown away by 'Star Wars'. Just 'Star Wars'. Not Episode IV, Not V... No just 'Star Wars'. And boy, what a load of negativity when George Lucas came up with Episode V. Five? Are you for real? That couldn't be right. Or could it? And we all know that 'Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' was and still is the best movie in the whole franchise.When I read a lot of criticism about Episodes VII and VIII, there is this thing that echoes in a certain way throughout all the negativity: 'Star Wars isn't Star Wars anymore. Disney killed it.'Excuses me? Nonsense!Things change. Time changes. The world changes. We change. When you see 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' you see the seventies! The hairdo, the set, the costumes, the technology. It's the seventies! We are now 40 years later and that means you get a movie that's 40 years further in time. It's now. And in ten years it will be ten years old. It's that simple.If you go into a cinema and expect 'Star Wars', like episodes IV, V or even VI, don't bother. Don't even think about it! Yes, then you will be disappointed. Of course you will. Because you can never expect something to be 'identical', 'similar' or close to the original 40 years later. No way. Impossible.If you go to the cinema to expect a spectacular and highly entertaining movie, a movie that will keep you glued to your seats, then 'Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi' will give you that. Two hours and 30 minutes of fantastic entertainment. There were moments when I was watching, so fascinated that I forgot I was holding an empty coffee cup for more than ten minutes.No it wasn't 'Star Wars', duh, but it was certainly in the spirit of Star Wars. As far as I can say, as a lifelong fan: this movie honours Star Wars. It has a high pace, great humour, incredible action, probably the best lightsabre duel ever, the Force light and (very) dark, a wonderful Carrie Fisher, an impressive Mark Hamill, interesting twists and mind-blowing special effects. I wanted to be entertained, and I was. And will be, because I will go back to the cinema to see it again, and probably again. And wondering where the saga will go to in Episode IX...So to all the critics who bashed the movie: let go! 'Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi' is a Star Wars movie, it isn't 'Star Wars'! It's just great fun.'Thank the Maker'.",9,1,2,19 December 2017
