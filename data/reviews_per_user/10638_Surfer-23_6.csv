The Blair Witch Project," Responses to criticism
","The Blair Witch Project may not be the scariest ever made, but it happens to be the scariest movie I myself have ever seen. It is a truly original work that awakens frightening memories most of us have about being lost and disoriented, while at the same time resurrecting our childhood fears that supernatural forces out there in the wilderness can destroy us if we are not more careful.Though the film's many strengths lend themselves well to praise and discussion, I would prefer instead to address some criticisms of 'The Blair Witch Project' that have appeared in these very pages.Dialogue: The film has 'bad' dialogue because the dialogue here is a representation of the way people actually talk, which is not always clever or made up of well-formed sentences. Indeed, since there was no script as such, the dialogue in 'The Blair Witch Project' *was* the way people actually talked. The exchanges among the players were almost always exactly what you would hear from people of their age group and background. Sense of reality: Even in a film like The Blair Witch Project, which tried for as much realism as possible, some compromises must still be made. Those who think it is silly that the characters keep filming each other even in desperate situations, or during heated arguments, are probably missing some fundamental characteristics of the world of film, namely, that during each scene someone must be around to hold the camera. If this had not happened in The Blair Witch Project, that is, if no one had filmed any of the dramatic parts, we probably would not have witnessed the various scenes which make up the movie. As it stands, the air of 'naturalness' of the actors while in front of the camera is impressive indeed.Critics on this point, incidentally, are advised to view the Monty Python sketch in which a small group of explorers is fated to die in the jungle. They note pathetically how, at the end of their lives, they have only each other and a bit of film that will record the last minutes of their existence. They then suddenly realize that if they are on film, there must be a crew filming them, and that they are therefore not alone. The crew, which has been a few feet away the whole time, is then shown onscreen, and the explorers rejoice at seeing friendly faces in such a remote location. But then it occurs to them: if this is the crew that was filming them before, who's filming them now?Kicking the map into the river:This disturbed me too, at first, but you can easily take a map, get angry at it, crumple it up into a ball, and kick it into the river.The things the filmmakers find:As frustrating as it is to accidentally return to a place from which you started out, the element of fear quickly enters into it when you have no suggestions at all on how to proceed and it is also becoming dark. In such a situation, where one is already disoriented and feels the power of nature closing in, the finding of strange objects hanging from trees or of piles of rocks which seem to have appeared out of nowhere (indicating that someone is tracking you!) would be utterly terrifying.  I would wager that most people have in their lives been scared by far less.Hype:It's true, this film was hyped practically to death. On the other hand, since it was made for about $30,000, hype was what was needed to sell the movie. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to avoid most of the hype, but even for those who were exposed to so much of it, I think it must have been gratifying to know that the film delivered.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well, at least you won't fall asleep
","Must we continually suffer the well-meaning enthusiasm for the Star Wars saga in the praise we hear of The Phantom Menace? An entertaining movie, to be sure, but it is not too much more than that. Terrific special effects (especially in the scenes showing the completely urbanized planet and the one involving the speeder race with young Anikan) and the great fight scene with Darth Maul are the highlights of this not-bad motion picture. You will probably stay alert right to the end, which is definitely saying something, but there's a lot to be endured: the interesting characters of the first series are not there, the acting generally ranges from flat to poor, and the story is more or less forgettable. The very talented Samuel L. Jackson will probably be happy to tell his grandchildren about the seven lines he spoke in Star Wars, but many of us in the present would have liked to see more of him. And, of course, Jar-Jar Binks is just plain irritating and won't go away no matter how hard you wish. Computer nerds may continually marvel at how he was created, but the viewing audience, I would assume, is made up of a broader spectrum of the public at large.Despite all this, I will still look forward to the next Star Wars epic.",Null,0,1,26 December 1999
Erin Brockovich," Just a note . . .
","I certainly understand the appeal of this film, but I find elements of it, well, puzzling. It might be unfair to comment on a now-common Hollywood convention, but does it really make sense to have a novice (e.g. a woman like the character Erin Brokovich) come into a job and be rewarded not only for telling her employer how to do his job properly but also to show repeated disrespect to her co-workers? Early in the film, Brokovich disappears from her boring job for a couple of weeks to do investigative work, which she finds more diverting, and which means that the 'unimportant' people in the office have to take up the slack. She is then shocked when she finds out she has been fired and yells incessantly until she gets her job back. Her boss, played by Albert Finney, has been an attorney for years and has made a living fighting uphill battles on contingency, but he seems unable to deal with people or build a case or even conduct a meeting without the help of ignorant-yet-spunky Erin Brokovich. Yes, it's a Hollywood film and certain shortcuts have to be made, but . . .",Null,4,9,30 September 2006
MASH," A definite must-see with an unusual sense of group dynamics
","Several vignettes concerning wartime shenanigans at a Mobile Army Hospital in Korea are related in this magnificently crafted film by Robert Altman. Donald Sutherland is wonderful as Capt. Pierce, Tom Skerritt equally fine as Duke Forrest. Though all of the major roles are played extremely well, a great many minor roles and even bit parts prove to be gems for a host of fine actors. If you see this film on video, you may want to watch it two or three times to catch some of the background dialogue you may have missed on the first viewing.Be warned, however: MASH is a film with almost no sympathetic characters. No one is especially likeable, and indeed, the behavior of the 'heroes' often seems repellent. But, in real life as in film, running into such a collection of people is always a possibility.Strangely enough, the film, though certainly bloodier than the movie, does not seek to indicate that the often irrational and childish behavior of the medical staff is brought on by the horrors of war, as the later television series often tried to demonstrate. The doctors and nurses all seem to have been brought to Korea just as they are.A tour de force of editing and direction.",Null,0,1,26 December 1999
Titanic," Don't be too hard on a film that should have been great
","The search for a missing diamond is the excuse for this film to tell you a love story, and the love story is its excuse to tell you the story of Titanic. If you can let yourself be amazed by James Cameron's vision of both the boat and its sinking, and ignore most of what else the film is supposed to be about, you are in for a treat. Of course, the movie isn't what it could have been, and should have been. For the first half, we see how a fair damsel (Rose, played by Kate Winslet) is rescued from a life of misery by another fair damsel (Jack, played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Rose is a child of the Upper Class and is being forced to marry Cal, perhaps the most evil film character since Darth Vader and the most one-dimensional creature dreamed up since Euclid defined the line in geometry. Now, as we all know, rich people, like Rose and Cal, are repressed and have no sense of fun, while poor people, like Jack, are jolly and streetwise and like to dance, dance, dance. Jack must save Rose from her snobbish fiance and show her what life is really about. And if she falls in love with him in the meantime, well, all the better.This is not to say that the part of the film up until the disaster is wasted. It is here that we see Titanic in its glory, a sumptuous recreation of the most luxurious ship ever built. And we get to see a lot of it, too, from the bridge to the deck to first class to steerage to the engine room, mostly brought to us by means of Rose and Jack's merry frolicking.Then Titanic runs into an iceberg. This, of course, is what we came to see: How will the sinking be depicted? And, by the way, what DOES one do when one is on a doomed vessel surrounded by freezing water and there is not a hope of being rescued? By now Rose is trying to save Jack (now locked in the brig for a crime he did not commit), but they often seem more intent on saving their love than their lives. Which is more important is a matter of taste.Yet surrounding them are 'normal' people, people who are terrified of drowning but who nevertheless have to think of something to do to save themselves and their families. There are moments of panic, bravery, cowardice, regret, disappointment, and selfishness, and even ones of extreme warmth and nobility. And, as you watch, you are constantly asking yourself, deep down, how you would fare under similar circumstances.
It is these glimpses of human behavior under the most dire circumstances, combined with Cameron's amazing technical work, that make this film more than worthwhile. It should have been much better, but it's still fine the way it is.",Null,2,3,26 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A fun film...but take it eeeasy.
","Star Wars is a very good movie.This is often a dangerous thing to say, as there are very few admirers of Star Wars who -- well, I suppose it must be said -- do not go off the deep end with respect to this film. And so I will proceed with caution, but also with honesty.For those three people who have been lost on an Antarctic expedition since 1977, Star Wars is the story of how young Luke Skywalker is recruited to help fight the evil Galactic Empire and its humanoid incarnation of evil, Darth Vader.The excitement begins within the first few seconds of the movie and almost never lets up. The characters are fun and easily accessible: a naive young boy with a talent for flying speeders and shooting, a princess, a smuggler, a friendly giant from a strange planet, a wise old man, an evil knight, and a couple of robots thrown in for comic relief. There are spaceships and shoot-outs and gigantic space stations and even a Tarzan-like move or two. The plot is clearly laid out and the ending leaves little room for confusion.Yet, despite my admiration, I can still think of a couple dozen movies I would rather see. Many people have been lost to the brainwashing that Star Wars is the greatest film ever made and that its 'mythology' is unsurpassed in all of world literature. Neither is true. Star Wars is a good fantasy and a fine film, but somehow celebrating that, for many, isn't enough. It does what it is supposed to do and does it very well, but a tremendous burden has been placed on George Lucas's shoulders by salivating fans. I will admit that I am not as well-read as I'd like to be, but I can still boldly state that, for great mythology, thousands of other works (including films) are at fans' disposal which are more intriguing, yet just as much fun as Star Wars.
