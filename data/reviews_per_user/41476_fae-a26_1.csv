Hereditary," So long and so bad....
","I'm sorry but no, you can't be 2 hours long, have Toni Colette as your main actress and be this bad. You know the problem with these kind of horror movies is that they try to be so deep, so deep that no one gets it. Whatever happened to a nice structured plot ? It's good too when the audience understand the point of the film. This movie actually has a plot, in the first 10 minutes and the last 20. The rest is just useless drama. Sure the acting is good, the photography is gorgeous, it's just meaningless for the storytelling.",2,1,3,28 September 2018
