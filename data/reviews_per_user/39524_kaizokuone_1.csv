Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," My first review of IMDb , regarding the movie Pirated of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides! There will be no spoilers in this review so don't worry :)
","So last night around 1 a.m. me and a couple of friends got the spontaneus idea to go and watch P.O.T.C. 4 (Premiere night). Withing twenty minutes i booked the tickets , we hoped into my car and were on time for the 1:20 a.m. play ! It couldn't have been a better night :)Firstly , if any of you were worried that the fact that Bloom(Will Turner) and Keira Knightley(Elizabeth Swann)not playing would somehow make the movie worse.. then just don't ! The movie was perfect without them ! They were good in the previous three but they just didn't belong in this one and i can guarantee that you won't miss them at all!The cast was well picked and everyone's performance was superb..Also many 'big names' appear in this movie, but i will mainly talk about Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica(Penelope Cruz). When i first saw Penelope in the trailer i, for no particular reason got the idea that i will not like her in the movie .. but she totally proved me wrong. She fitted her character perfectly and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing her role. Blackbeard was also 'awesome'. He brings out the ' I am the pirate that all pirates should fear' kinda vibe with his deadly black humor and beastfull actions ,without falling into the ' I AM SO EVIL HAR HAR ' trap. Really quick here.. i personally loved and couldn't take my eyes of the mermaid and the the little romance embed in the plot (Watch what people say so that you don't fall into wrong conclusions).The movie was also more action packed than the previous movies i believe , with Jack once again showing us how creative , funny and plot twisting he can be by multitasking a thousand things at once !The VFX (Visual effects) were there , taking my breath away every know and then (but mainly because i am into that stuff) but i am pretty sure they will get you jumping on your seat as well !Soundtrack was similar to the previous movies but remade and as always fitted the scenes perfectly , making everyone in the theater wanting to draw their non existing sword :DPlot was OK , nothing complicated( and by that i mean it wasn't Inception... but it also wasn't F&F ) but still had a lot of twists and turns that will make you go AaaaaAaaa! As for the 3D.. it depends on how you think of it. If you are one of those guys that take their glasses off , don't see a big difference and then decide that 3D is awful then got watch it in normal ^^ If like that little difference that only strikes the back of your mind then i guess the 3D was OK-ish.So !!! You liked the previous 3? GO watch it ! You are not a big fan of the series? STILL.. GO WATCH IT ! 9/10 will leave the Theater with a huge smile on their face.. and if they wait till the credits end.. an even bigger smile! (o.O) P.S. The mermaid's beauty will bring tears in your eyes!",9,1,2,20 May 2011
