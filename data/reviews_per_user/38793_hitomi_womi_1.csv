The Ring," Why, oh why?...
","What can be said about The Ring without bursting into fits of hysterics? Being a person who is easily scared, I was surprised when The Ring didn't frighten me at all. It's problem was that it tried to make every scene spine-tinglingly scaring, which actually gave the impression that misty looking forests and spooky hidden islands are the norm, and therefore became less frightening. The effects and the music were the best things about this film, as the acting was relatively poor and the plot became more of a predictable cliche as the film went on. If you're into horror flicks, though, you'll have a field day with this one. If not, go see it, it'll give you a laugh!",Null,0,1,11 March 2003
