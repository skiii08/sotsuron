Walk the Line," Surprisingly entertaining.
","Usually I don't like a movie unless It has action and sci-fi in it, I also don't like romantic movies either, but this movie was an exception. Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job playing a country girl, and who would of thought she could sing country music. Joaquin Poenix's performance was quite impressive as well. There is one thing I did not like about this movie though. No matter how they try and sugar it up, Johnny Cash was still cheating on his wife and that is just flat out wrong. His wife was a good woman, she was not like that hag you saw in the movie. Anyway, besides that one downfall, I thought this movie was pretty good. I highly recommend this film.",8,0,0,5 June 2006
Grease," Gotta love the classics
","I saw this movie a few weeks before writing this review and I have to say, I thought I was about to watch something embarrassing and childish. I was wrong. This movie was fun in a way appropriate not just for kids, but for adults too. Back then, movies just put a smile on your face, this movie is a great example. I have loved musicals my whole life and this has got to be my favorite one ever. Annie was my favorite musical before Grease came along. Think about it, a musical better than Annie, it's got to be pretty good to beat a masterpiece like that. Ever since I saw this movie I have been a huge fan of John Travolta. I am also a fan of Olivia Newton-John because I have always loved Australia and I also know what it is like to be taller than your average girl.",10,1,3,14 May 2006
"I, Robot"," 20th Century Fox has done it again.
","I have seen many movies with pretty mind blowing special effects, but this film has some of the best ones I have ever seen. Will Smith's performance was perfect. Bridget Moynahan's performance was excellent. The plot was pretty good. The people who helped make the set did an excellent job on making it look so futuristic. 20th Century Fox is known for some of the best films. I later realized fox also made another classic called 'Walk the Line', but you can catch my post on that film later. Anyway, like I was saying this is a movie you got to see. It has everything it takes to make a movie perfect. I'm not only the kind of girl who loves a good action flick, but I am also a big fan of sci-fi. You don't have to be into sci-fi to love this movie though. Buy it, love it.",10,1,3,14 May 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Performances were great. Plot was perfect. Tons of action. I love it.
","I was fairly young when I saw this film. It was my favorite movie then, and it still is now. I just love a good action flick. Anybody who does as well, will also love this masterpiece. I am a huge fan of both Robert Patrick(T 1000)and Arnold Schwarzennegger. James Cameron put so much effort into making this movie, it all paid off too. I admire all of his work. If this movie had not been made, they would have never been able to make Jurrasic Park. They made so many breakthroughs while doing this movie. If you can catch it, in some clips Robert Patrick had to put a suit on that looked like liquid metal. This sequel was much better than the original one it also ran on a much higher budget as you can see. By the way, if you want more info on Robert Patrick you can go under his website www.Robert-Patrick.com.",10,2,3,2 June 2006
