Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino is back... great as always
","Quentin Tarantino is back with the second part of the his latest work, Kill Bill. The first part of Kill Bill can be compared with the work of 'Naturel Born Killers'. In the second part of Kill Bill Tarantino has really captured the brilliant work of Pulp Fiction. All of the individuals are as original as one can get. The short and sharp/witty dialogs truly shows the mark of Tarantinos incredible work that can easily be compared to Pulp Fiction. To sum up. Kill Bill is a true masterpiece with the great screenplay of Naturel Born Killers, the flashbacks of Reservoir Dogs and the dialogs of Pulp Fiction. If you haven't seen it - see it. If you have seen it... see it again",8,1,2,16 May 2004
