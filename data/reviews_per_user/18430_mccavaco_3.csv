It," I have seen better...
","We always need to be careful before seeing a movie because of the publicity created around it. In this particular case, I think that all the hype creates high expectations in the audience and sometimes that could ruin a possibly good movie. It was the horror movie most watched in several countries, and even dubbed 'one of the best horror movies ever'. The reviews were almost all nice and the public extremely soft and good when criticizing it. But come on! I have seen better. For me, all the expectations created ruined my opinion of it. The story is not that original and exciting. I think that it is predictable, not well explained, and fragmented. The clown, which is the main star of the movie, does not appear that much and all the good scenes can be watched in the trailers. I can even say that the best scene of the entire movie took part at the beginning of the movie. It was intense and enlightening. From that, disappointment Horror scenes were meager and not even enough scary jumps were included. One of the good things is the messages behind the movie. I believe that they were one of the best parts. For me, they are two. 1. Do not let your fears rule your life! Face them, or they will kill you and eat you. 2. One person alone does not seem much, but a group of people can do almost everything. Overall, it is an OK movie, but not the best horror movie ever. Not even close! Perhaps the hype around It killed the movie for me, but I think that it lacks some good stuff.",6,0,1,6 November 2017
Spotlight," Who have the guts to swim in the catholic filthy waters?
","The world is filled with secrets. Everybody have their own, but usually they are quite small and do not interfere with others. However, this can only be applicable to ordinary mortals. When an important man or even a big institution are involved, things get ugly before they get beautiful. Nowadays we have plenty examples to support that, and when a well intention guy or group try to dive into this deep waters, things usually become disagreeable.Spotlight is one of these cases. The story here is about a true story of how a research journalist group named Spotlight, working for the Boston Globe, uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core, the Vatican. Although the majority of the young people are not well familiar with this scandal, it really shacked and shocked everyone and had repercussions beyond the expectations. Therefore, some courage is needed to direct a story of this magnitude. So, and thinking that the film was extremely well produced, I would like to underline the amazing job of the Director Tom McCarthy. He really did it! This incredible and complex true story is properly treated in this movie, with all the sequence making sense, guiding us throw the complexity of the research made by these brave guys. Complex in every matters, because it involved pure journalism, intricate laws, important people, huge institutions. And Tom McCarthy presented all in a very simple way that make us understand everything from the beginning until the end without missing a bit. This movie is really about the story and everything is there!Regarding the actors' performance not much can be said, once the brilliance of the movie relies on the story itself, so all the credits should be attributed to the team who have written and directed the movie. However, if someone must be mentioned, Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes) is that guy. He is one of the journalists involved in the research for the Boston Globe and slowly get into the subject and began to be slightly affected about it. Actually, all the team, began to demonstrate signs of disturbed behavior as the research proceeds, which is quite normal regarding the atrocity that they were exposing. He is one of the main stones of the group and is responsible for a few interesting scenes. His character evolves in the movie and Mark really manages to convey all the interior pain that he is feeling.With all that said I have scored this brilliant movie with a 9/10 because it really captured one of the most controversial scandals of all time. Besides all the time passed, this could be a story of today once a lot of speculation still exists. Incredible job for everyone but as I have said, this is a movie that depends exclusively of the story without any shining performance. However, it will capture all your attention during the entire time. I truly recommended it.",9,5,10,6 January 2016
The Revenant," What a monstrous movie!
","I could not ask for a better way of beginning 2016 that is for sure. So, my review will begin by quoting an expression of my own, which was said when the screenplay turned black and the lights tuned off: 'What a monstrous movie!' Monstrous in every sense, since the story, the action, the scenarios, the actors' interpretation, until the directing. The story about The Revenant is quite simple to tell, once all the juices rely on the scenarios and even more on the Actors' performance. It is about an American, named Hugh Glass, that was on an expedition throughout Native American territory searching for fur when he was attacked by a bear. This animal almost killed him, so the group where Glass was inserted considered him only a burden and left him behind to face his own fate. What happens next is something amazing that show us what the human being is capable of surviving whether the energy that propel you is love or revenge. The scenario that serves The Revenant is absolutely astonishing and creates in the spectator the desire of being there. The snow, the rivers, the falls, even the storms are incredibly beautiful. All their beauty is well capture in the screen and only raised the magnificence of the movie. On top of that, all the scenes with the animals are also incredible. Even if you know that they might be virtual, because some scenes tend to be brutal and violent.But what transforms The Revenant in something of another level are the actors. By seeing the cast we understand that this could be a good movie, however, sometimes good casts generated poor movies, so I usually do not deposit all my hopes on that. Of course that when you have in the same movie Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, only good things could happen. And let me tell you that in this movie only incredible things happened! The performance of Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass) was absolutely incredible. I have already heard that 2015 could be the year for DiCaprio, and I have to beef up that idea because he has a role that is out of this world. The evolution in the screen is incredible since he passes from a relatively calm guy with a dark past to a vengeful man with fire in his eyes. And the spectator will share with him all the anger and desire for blood. But in the end we learned a lesson, and in my opinion that is all what matters when you see a movie: what you take home. There are particular scenes that enhance the spectacular performance of DiCaprio but in the end I have to say that all the picture is set to finally Leonardo DiCaprio become an Oscar winner. And what could I say about Tom Hardy? Oh my god! If Hugh Glass become only alive because of an incredible Leonardo DiCaprio, John Fitzgerald only make sense with Tom Hardy. If you will love Glass, you will hate Fitzgerald. And all the love and hate are only possible because not just DiCaprio is astonishing, Tom Hardy blew up in this movie and features one of the best performances that I have already seen from him. At the beginning Fitzgerald is only a mere pawn but as the action developed, you understand is role on the movie that culminates with an astonishing class with Glass. Therefore, I truly recommend The Revenant and I have scored it with an 8/10. You will not regret the 180 minutes of the movie, because it has the ability of capturing your attention the entire time. It is an awesome movie, incredibly directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Is beauty relies in every aspect, every detail, so do not detour your attention from the big or small screen.",8,3,10,3 January 2016
