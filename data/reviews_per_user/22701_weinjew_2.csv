Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The most fun you'll have at a movie all year
","Script: eh... Acting: who cares... Visuals:THE MOST AMAZING EFFECTS, EVER!!! Go for what you know will be great. It's fun, love it.",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Life is Beautiful is . . . well, beautiful!
","The first half of this movie is a raffish, highly effective and very funny romantic comedy-farce. The second half is one of the most beautiful stories recorded in any form, let alone put on film.",Null,1,2,14 May 1999
