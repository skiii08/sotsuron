Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not with a bang...
","Tarantino left himself with a hell of a problem by dividing this story in two.For one thing, he had left almost all the rest of the back story for the second movie. Oh yeah, and a lot of the character touches.So that leaves Part 2 at a disadvantage as far as pacing is concerned. Admittedly, few movies could keep up the pacing of the first part without completely leaving any pretense of plot behind.So we get to alternate between current time and flashbacks... so much so that, at first, I got a little tired of it. But unlike Part 1, the flashbacks made more direct sense.And we finally get to meet characters that were waiting offstage in Part 1, like Bill and his brother, Budd.There's a lot of good stuff here. The film is about 2 and a half hours long, but it didn't make me real antsy and The Bride was riding off into the sunset almost before I knew it.A lot of fun.",9,1,2,16 April 2004
Chicken Run," The 'Great Escape' -- with chickens
","That's how the creators of this film described it when pitching the idea to the production company. And there are some references to the classic movie, most of them in the first ten minutes or so.But they don't keep that up for the whole movie, fortunately.  For one thing, this is a much funnier movie.  And,even though you see Ginger in doing some stuff like Steve McQueen did in the original, she doesn't ride a motorcycle.The stakes are higher in this one, too.  The worst the prisoners in TGE could expect if they stuck around was really bad food.  But when Mrs. Tweedy found that there was more money to be made in chicken pot pies than eggs, Ginger knows that they have to get out. She's told that it's a million-to-one shot.  'Then we've still got a chance', she replies.When Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson) drops in on them, Ginger feels that they have a chance.  If Rocky can just teach them to fly, they might have a chance.To reveal anymore would be spoiling the fun.  This is indeed 'fun for the whole family', with funny characters and scenes from beginning to end.  My favorite characters were the two packrats, but the dim-witted chicken was a hoot as well.Two clucks up. Uncle Steve says check it out. And take the kids.",9,0,0,24 June 2000
X-Men," A comic book movie with depth
","One of the things that made the Marvel comics special back in the 60s was their quirkiness.  Spider-man agonized about the same stuff that other teenagers did.  Maybe not acne, but problems with fitting in to the adult world. Superheroes with problems.The X-men have problems, too. They may have some phenomenal powers, but they're outsiders.  They look human, but their powers put them on the outside.  Feared and misunderstood, they are targets.Targeted by a Senator as a threat to humanity, they face the sort of persecution that supposed 'Reds' did at the hands of Senator Joseph McCarthy and HUAC.They are also the targets of the super-villain, Magneto (Ian McKellan).  He feels that there will be a war between humanity and mutantkind.  But he has a plan to swing the tide.  All he needs is one special mutant.Magneto is aided by a trio of mutants: Sabertooth, Toad ('Episode I's Darth Maul: Ray Park) and Mystique.Opposing them are, of course, the X-men. The main group this time are Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops and Dr. Jean Grey. Others make cameos this time around, like Iceman.But what makes this movie more than just a special effects romp is the subtext.  That has to do with fear and prejudice. Magneto feels that the mutants will be treated in the same way that his Jewish mother was during WWII: despised, imprisoned and killed. (Explaining to my six-year-old nephew about concentration camps was one of the toughest and most frustrating things I've ever done)Great performances from Patrick Stewart (Prof. X) and Ian McKellan (Magneto) also lift the film above the usual comic book movie fare.Some of the scenes might be a little intense for youngsters. My nephew had his eyes covered during some of the scenes (like the Senator's final scene), but very little overt bloodshed.Good stuff.  Looking forward to the sequel which they left ample room for.Eight stars.  Uncle Steve says check it out.",8,0,0,15 July 2000
The Italian Job," Just another (remake) caper movie
","Contains Spoiler!! A couple of weeks ago I got a pass to see a screening of this movie.The title sounded familiar, so I checked the imdb and found that it was a remake of a movie Michael Caine had done in 1969. I went down to my favorite mom-and-pop video store to check it out.What I found was a so-so caper movie about a robbery of a vanload of gold on the streets of Turin (hence The Italian Job). Caine was the leader who was using the plan of one man (killed in the opening minutes of the movie) and the money and material provided by a criminal boss (Noel Coward) who doesn't let being in prison interfere with his activities.The central set-piece was the robbery, followed by a crazy chase scene through the streets, walkways and stairs (!) of Turin. The plan called for using the city's computerized traffic control system to tie up traffic (and the police) while they use the only unjammed corridor to escape with the loot.This is the central part of the new movie as well. The twist is that they steal the gold and then have it stolen from them. It is only in the stealing it back that they return to the original.This time Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the Michael Caine part and the computer expert (a hacker, of course) is played by Seth Green (Benny Hill in the original). Seth plays a computer whiz who claims to have created the Napster software, but it was stolen from him while he was dozing (while napping, get it!).I can imagine what you're saying: 'Benny Hill! The original version must've been a real funny one'. Sorry. Benny and Seth both are left with little to do. Seth has a couple of good scenes but that's it.What you're left with is unsatisfying. It's not a split-second gosh-wow caper movie like the remake of 'Ocean's Eleven' nor is it a comedy of errors like the classic 'The Hot Rock' (AKA 'The Four Masterminds'). The best part, as in the original, is the big chase scene: three small cars darting in and out of traffic and generally driving where you shouldn't. (The chase scene in the original is IMHO one of the best I've ever seen)This is one to wait for it to get to the video store. Meanwhile, visit your local mom-and-pop video store and rent 'The Hot Rock'. You'll be glad you did.",6,0,0,7 May 2003
Spider-Man," Does whatever a spider can!
","I was anxiously waiting for this movie. The 'buzz' seemed to be awesome, but apparently they didn't allow screenings very far in advance. (Ebert and Roeper won't do their TV reviews until opening weekend) This usually does not bode well. Very likely, it was to be full of gosh-wow FX but nothing much in the way of a script.I was not disappointed. All the characters were just right and the actors wonderfully chosen. Some liberties were taken with the original stories to make it into a movie. Mary Jane Watson becomes the girl next door that Peter Parker has had a thing for since he was six. (In the comic, he doesn't meet MJ until after he's been Spidey awhile and had a short-lived relationship with J Jonah Jameson's secretary Betty Brant). The bit with having the webbing come out of him instead of being a brilliant off the top of his head invention was neat. It sped up the plot and set up some amusing scenes as he tried to learn how to use this ability.Danny Elfman's music is, as always, a great counterpoint to the super-heroics.As far as younger kids are concerned, there's no sex or bad language, but lots of action {read: violence) and the Green Goblin may be a bit scary.Cool stuff. Eight stars.",8,0,0,4 May 2002
The Princess Bride," The perfect movie
","I read 'The Princess Bride' for the first time when the paperback first came out. By the time the movie version was due to come out I read it again. I no longer had my old copy, so I bought a new one (The cover had been attached upside down, which I thought was cool).There are very few books that I have read twice, let alone bought twice. I loved this book. It's a great fantasy love story, told with style and wit. And, like all great fantasies, the characters are bigger than life -- and sometimes, just a bit corny.It's just enjoyable, first to last. Part romance, part adventure, part revenge story ('My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die') and all fun.",10,2,4,18 April 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The most intense movie experience in...
","...now long? I'd say at least ten years.QT has given us another gem. He combines a classic revenge story with a pastiche of the kung fu movies he grew up on.The only weakness is in the backstory. With the exception of Lucy Liu's character, we know nothing of the other character's past.
Tarantino wisely pushes such things to the back burner. We know that Bill and his assassins killed nine innocents and nearly killed The Bride.There it is. She has no name. The only time she mentions her name in Part 1, it is bleeped. (And again an moment later when Viveca A Fox says the name) She doesn't need a name. She isn't a person so much as a force of nature.There are two main set-pieces: the Bride's fight with Vernita Green (Viveca A Fox)and the big battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Both are intense and will leave you limp.Not enough goodies on the DVD, though. <sigh>Nine stars. Watch the DVD, then go watch Part 2.",9,1,2,16 April 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Better than the original, but not by much
","I was a serious MI fan, back in the 60s. The intricate plots and the cool gadgets.  Not to mention split-second timing.The first MI movie dropped all of that for a weird post Cold War story.  It was not an MI story.This one was, closer to the spirit of the original. And John Woo certainly wowed me with the choreography of some of the action set pieces.
But the characters remain flat.  Upon checking the Internet Movie DB, I found that Ving Rhames had played the same character in the first MI movie. I don't remember any characters from the first movie other than Ethan Hawke (Cruise) and Jim Phelps (Jon Voigt). And I only remember Voigt's character because that was the only one from the series.I always figured that Robert Towne's name on the first movie was basically as a script doctor. His uncredited listings in the IMDB seem to indicate he's done a bit of this. 'Script doctor, heal thyself!'",Null,0,0,26 May 2000
World Trade Center," All drama, no conspiracy
","During World War II, there were many movies purporting to tell the story of what happened at Anzio or on Normandy beach. But what you ended up getting were a few fictional characters dropped in the middle of this or that battle.And now we have Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center', which focuses on two real-life heroes of the 9/11 tragedy.After the conspiracy-laden 'JFK', I keep expecting Stone to have an agenda behind all his films. When I heard that he had done a film about 9/11, I wondered what kind of film it would be. How much conspiracy theory or jingoism would be injected in with the drama? What I saw on the screen was a very human drama. Two Port Authority cops go in to the WTC to help free the trapped victims only to be trapped themselves.The action switches back and forth between the trapped cops and their families. I appreciated this because it would otherwise have left me hopelessly claustrophobic. The family scenes also helped to round out the characters of the two heroes. The tension is also eased by a few instances of humor (Not jokes) which broke the tension a little.Any politics in the film are kept to a minimum. Despite it's subject matter, this is not a political movie. This is a story about survival and hope. I recommend it highly.",9,2,9,13 August 2006
Groundhog Day," It's that day... again.
","Bill Murray plays a complete jerk. That's okay because you know that it's going to come out all right in the end.The fun in this movie is seeing the character arc of Phil Conners. We're never told in so many words just why he's condemned to live the same day over and over. It seems that it does have something to do with how very nasty Phil is at the start of things.He hates his job, doesn't care for his co-workers and really doesn't want to be covering Groundhog Day again. So fate steps in and stops time for Phil. He's not going to get past that day until he reforms.It doesn't happen overnight. He spends dozens, if not hundreds of Groundhog Days in Punxatawney. At first he just acts worse, taking advantage of the simple people of the town. But then he realizes that he's in love with his producer (Andie McDowall).So he's got this same day to run over and over again to convince her that he's not a total jerk. And, in order to do that, he needs to reform himself. At first it's just superficial stuff, like remembering her favorite ice cream. But then he has to go beyond that and truly become the man of her dreams. And do it in the few hours that he's got until the whole thing resets again.Bill Murray works wonderfully in this role. His low-key style of humor fits in well with his road to rehabilitation.This film is one of the 'few' I have in my collection. I only buy titles that I'm likely to play over and over. And, about once a month, I do watch it over again.A wonderful movie. I recommend it highly.",8,1,3,5 May 2007
The Producers," Brooks at his best
","A Mel Brooks film. That identification alone makes a film worth checking out. He made his biggest reputation as a parodist: 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Blazing Saddles' are classics that the current crop of pretenders should study.In one, he deftly parodied the scenes and situations of a specific series: the Universal Frankenstein movies. And in the other, he takes on the cliches of a particular genre.It occurs to me that 'The Producers' comes to us as a parody of a form as well: all those backstage story movies. Richard O'brien said that this would be the setting of the third of his 'Rocky Horror' movies.
Mel Brooks got there first, Richard.",10,0,1,27 May 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A Comedy Classic
","A few weeks ago I went to see the re-release of 'Holy Grail'.
I had, of course, seen the film countless times. I saw it originally at a sneak preview where they handed out coconuts to the first 200 in attendance. They also had a scale model of the Trojan Rabbit in the lobby.From the subtitled opening credits to the abrupt 'film break' which closes out the film I was in stitches. More than that, it holds up. Some comedies you can watch once or twice and you're done. Not this film.A couple of words about the new Deluxe Edition DVD: buy it. It is packed with extra features which will keep you busy for some time. I like the option which provides Shakespearean subtitles 'for those who don't like the film'.",10,0,0,3 November 2001
