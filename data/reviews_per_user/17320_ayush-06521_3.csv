Casablanca," The most crisp dialogues ever.
",This film has the most interesting dialogues- shirt and insightful and dramatic.,8,2,3,22 August 2019
Gone Girl," It's the kind of films you start disbelieving in the idea of marriage from.
","The film is absolutely gripping from the first scene. The raw and chilling look of the wife makes us want to see the layers of her character. And the husband is also very well sketched in his flawed relationship to his twin. Interestingly confusing at first whether or not he is the murderer, but soon resolves that question and takes the story forward. The transformations of look of the wife is spectacular. Acting- A grade. Plotting of murder-amazing. Characters- believable, even the wife is relateable inspite her actions. What she wanted is what people want from each other in today's relationships. Marriage is compromising self to get the love of the partner, and wanting the other to be as they like, it's this relateable theme which grabs the attention on a deeper level.
No matter the compromises, things do get beneficial at the end. Oh! What a sarcasm on the face of people from the fine storyteller!",8,1,1,17 December 2018
Raging Bull," Just adding
