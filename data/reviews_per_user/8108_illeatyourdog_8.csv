Kill Bill: Vol. 2," good becuase of Vol. 1
","First, I must say that When Quentin Tarantino edits together the complete film, he will have a masterpiece.  However, in Kill Bill's current form, Vol. 1 feels more complete and is more entertaining then vol. 2 (which is ironic considering that Vol. 2 is really the conclusion to vol. 1).  What also doesnt help Vol. 2 is the drastic change of pace.  When the critics write that there is less action and more talking they 'ain't kidden'.  A good portion of the movie is pretty much all set up to what already has been set up in Vol. 1 which makes it somewhat repetative.  Even though it tevhincally goes into greater detail of what happened at the wedding chapel, you dont really feel it since when the killing begins you dont see any of it and it cuts away to a new chapter (which is why Vol. 1 is almost a prerequisite for Vol. 2 since it goes into greater detail of what exactly was done to the bride by the deadly vipers).  We also get to know Budd a little bit more, again all through talking and his life seems rather depressing and its hard to beleive that he was once a deadly assassin.Although, the training scene with Pei Mei is entertaining and finally brings martial arts back into the film, the real action doesnt start until Elle arrives.  The bout between her and the Bride (SPOILER now Beatrix Kiddo) reminds us of why we wanted to see Kill Bill in the first place, the kick-ass fighting.  That being said, the fight scene was a bit overhyped and really is the only prolonged action scene in the movie (although I feel that the fight was at most only 4 minutes long but thats being generous and including the liuttle diologue they have that brings the fight to dead halt).  However, this fight has one of the best conclusions a fight scene will ever have. Considering that the Elle vs The Bride fight is the onyl real action scene, the movie relies heavily on its main villian, Bill, and he does not dissappoint.  David Carradine played the role perfectly.  Bill was always calm, never lost his cool, even when his emotions ran high.  When the Bride finally came face to face with him, is when more layers of their history are revealed which does kinda turn the tables around and make you question the Brides actions. Other than the Elle fight scene, my favorite scene in the movie has to be with Pei Mei.  Mainly becuase where Vol. 1 was pretty much all Japanese based (even Yuen Woo Ping did chorepgraph the Blue lleaves battle), this scene is all chinese in insperation.  The fighting that takes place is very reminiscent of the old chinese wuxia movies of the 70s.  UNfortunately the scene does not really go too much in depth and it appears that the only thing The Bride actually learned and utilized was the 3 inch punch (well she did utiloize another move thats wil ruin the movie if I tell you what it is).  It would have been nice to see the crane or eagle style present in the Elle Driver fight but, even though both were taught by Pei Mei, we dont see any of it.  I hope that it was originally alonger scene and he cut it dow fro some reason onyl he would understand. Again, what makes Vol. 2 good is Vol. 1.  As a whole movie it would have been magnificabt becuase the first half would be all about kicking ass and the second half would be taking a break and thinking about why she is kicking ass.  With the split, Vol. 2 starts off with us taking a break from the action but, unless you have seen Vol. 1 you dont know what we are taking a break from and if you have seen it, you took a big enough break to want more kicking ass whcih you dont get for what seems to be an enternity.",Null,0,1,16 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," interesting
","It is difficult to determine whether or not this is indeed a better moive then the first one. In that sense, and a slew of others, it is similar to Superman 2. Like Superman 2, one of the major plot elements is the loss of superpowers. Although it is an interesting idea to play around with, it is also one, once finally seen, that you don't really want to see done. However, the key difference in the way it is handled in SPiderman 2 is that there is not a how or a why to the superpower loss whereas in Superman 2 both were covered (he gave them up for lois Lane and he used a contraption in his Fortress of solitude). Being that it is perfectly understandable as to why no explanation would be given (there is no logical reason why he all of sudden lose them and then gain them back and it would have only created another subplot that would have merely been a distraction from everything else) it just makes it all the more obvious that they really used it as plot contrivance then any real story element. Luckily, his loss of powers leads to some of the film's most humorous moments which could make it forgivable. Now what separates Spiderman 2 from pretty much 95% of all the cmoic book movies, it actually tells a story instead of merely trying to. This is also both good and bad. Its good because it is showing that the life of a superhero is not as enticing as people would assume it is. He does not live in a huge mansion or larger than large apartment with the latest in entertainment technology. He lives in a single room apartment maybe with a TV in a really run down hotel. His good deeds make it difficult for him to hold a job and keep up in school. Those are the good points of the story since it does deal treat the idea of a superhuman concealing his identity realistically. However, it does get incredibly serious and really brings the emotional level down since it does get pretty depressing. It also appears that Sam Raime tried a little bit too much to enforce the idea that Peter Parker's life turned to sh!t. One such contrivance used to emphasize it is him never paying his rent. In the beginning of the movie, it does provide an explanation as to how he makes money but he also fired in the beginning of the film too. He also not getting sufficient income from his photjournalist job either (his paycheck does not even cover an advance he was previously given). SO it is kinda a huge mystery as to why he is able to keep his living quarters since he is clearly not paying it. This accompanied with the incredibly intense scene between Petger Parker and Harry Osborne, it really is a bit too much. Another character that is a bit much is Peter's Aunt May. There is no way in hell this person could exist in the real world and, even with Spidey's CG aided rubbery special effects, she is the most cartoonish and gives a a full fledged speech to answer a simple question (I am referring to her 'theres a hero in all of us' speech which is given as an answer as to why a little kid wants to be SPiderman). With all the screentime devoted to showing wjhy a person like Spiderman is needed, the speech is tacked on and kinda pointless. Speaking of tacked on, the character of Doc Ock is also kinda tacked on. This character suffers from the same disease as pretty much every other scientist with good intentions who turns evil suffers from. Hes not cool or interesting until he is consumed by evil and then hes likable (it reall is ironic. This is not really a good thing since we are supposed to care for the good side of Docter Octavious but you don't really and just want him to turn evil so he could use his mechanical arms to start throwing cars and people at SPiderman. Which is in direct contrast to Harry Osbrne's Green Goblin. You actually sympathies with him and side with him. The Green Goblins original approach is also altogether different since he was trying to show Spiderman an incredibly big picture as well as presenting the reality of people ('the only thing want more than a hero is to see the hero fail'). Doc Ock, on the other hand, has a very miniscule and trivial endeavor to create this thing that does nothing but absorbe all sorts of energy (mostly metal). What makes it even more interesting (as well as confusing) is that the meechanical arms are what want this thing to be made. It really boggles the mind as to why machines would want want to make this thing since it would do nothing but destroy their creator and source of power (in essence the machines would be destroying themselves). Luckily, all the other characters act like real people and the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane is done rather well (except for the end which is overly romantic and gay). All in all, it is an entertaining movie (and possibly a great date movie) but it does get way too serious at times and it is filled with contrivances that tend to drag on a bit long.",Null,0,0,30 June 2004
The Italian Job," The Italion Job in L.A.? Mark for Michael? Surprisingly it WORKED!!!
","I have not seen the classic version from 1969 with Micheal Caine so I had no preconceptions of how it should be but what I saw was very enjoyable.  It is very similer to Ocean's Eleven in the sense that the two most important factors to a Heist is teamwork and an unlimited budget.  Both feature heists that are very convincing in explanation and execution but as far as the heists being a plausible reality (in terms of real thieives actually seriously going about a heist in such a way and then executing it flawlessly), is a whole other story.  However, just like Ocean's Eleven, this implausablility only makes the movie that much more fun.  What also makes it a fun movie is that all of the actors go about their characters in a very enjoyable fashion.  They seem to know that this type of Heist is very unlikely but still go about it as if it is such a heist could be done and pay attention to little details (like the cars having the proper power and suspension for transporting gold) which, in most cases goes ignored. That is not to say that the movie had no fun or funny scenes, in fact, it is quite the opposite.  The majority of scenes were light hearted and only got real serious when it called for such seriousness (like mourning the death of a character).  Ironically though, given the incredable chase sequence at the end, the best part about it is the mutual respect that every character has for one another and not resulting to the compitition of genders (Charlize Theron plays a very important part in the Heist) which usually leads to scenes that are nothing more then showing the woman having the advantage or the man having the advantage which really amount to nothing (unless you are either a male shovonists or a femonist).Moving onto the action, there are actually only two action scenes both of which are chase scenes.  Again, these chase scenes are executed very convincingly but are very unlikely in terms of practicality but still 100% fun.  The rest of the movie is comprised of heist preporation scenes which are as interesting as they are fun.",Null,1,1,26 May 2003
Hero," Kicks Crouching Tiger's ASS!!!
","First off, I am an action person as in I see romance as a disstraction rather then an useful plot device.  Dont get me wrong though, I did enjoy Crouching Tiger and the fight scenes were impressive but, their was too much romance and/ or story in between (the only reason why i was able to sit through the entire thing was becuase of the three leads, two of which are gorgeuos and graceful and one is just Bad Ass even in a romance).  That is not to say that Hero has no story and is merely action scene upon action scene with no actual point though.  However, what makes hero so radically different then Crouching Tiger, storywise, is that the romance is secondary (but still very important) to the main story of the deaths of the 3 top assasins.  Another key difference is that there are three different versions (one version even including another story that explains the romance) of the same story all of which are entertaining in their own right.  In fact, the only simularities between Hero and Crouching Tiger is Zhang Ziyi and that there is romance and martial arts involved (of course you could easily relate many action movies to crouching tiger except for the absence of Zhang Ziyi).  As much as I would like to go into the different stories, that could possibly ruin the movie so instead I will focus on the various action scenes.  Of course, the high lite of the movie is the fight between Donnie Yen and Jet Li in the beginning which is crazy fast and fluid, in fact it has to be the most fluid fight scene that involves wire-work and weapons. Even the use of CGI (which is used very well) flows nicely with the fight becuase they use it to stress how fast Jet Li is moving rather then to merely look cool (the CGI was so impressive that it took me like 10 minutes to figure out why they used it).  Some may say that following fights are sub par when compared to the Donnie Yen/ Jet Li fight, but so does every other fight scene in existence, except for the final fight in Fist of Legend and the final fight in Legend of Drunken Master.  That is to say that even with the following fight scenes not equaling the intensity of the first, they are still a step above the ones in Crouching Tiger as well as many other movies. However, what might turn some people off to some of the fight scenes is their innovativeness like the first bout between ZHang Ziyi and Maggie Chung in the forest where Maggie fights mainly with leaves and the fight scene that takes place over water.  Both are expertly choreographed as well as performed by the actors but its just too much of a change ( to American audiances anyway, unless they have viewed Duel to the Death as I have heh). Now what really sets Hero apart from Crouching Tiger though is the use of the biggest army I have yet to see included in a martial arts movie, requiring an ungodly amount of extras (think the Two Towers but with actual people heh).  Which brings me to the next action scene that might also turn off viewers, mainly American viewers, which is Jet Li and Maggie Chung fending off hundreds arrows, many that are CGI arrows (very well done CGI arrows but CGI arrows nonetheless).  Now, to focus on the wire-work, the people dont float like on Crouching Tiger, they fly and it looks more controlled then Crouching Tiger becuase of it (the fight over water is the perfect example of what Im talking about).",Null,0,0,28 March 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill people who compare this to The Matrix
","First off, critics write this off as a movie with little story and all action.  Not that this is a bad thing but but they are wrong.  It is not action all and throughout like all the critics say.  There is almost too much story being told for there to be comments about their being no story. they have seemed to forgotten that this Quentin Tarantino and his big movie was Pulp Fiction in which it was not really one large story but a lot of little stories all connected through characters.  Kill Bill is made in a similer fashion but a little modified.  He makes it very clear that he is only telling you what is essential for every CHAPTER.  And each chapter has an incredible amount of story to tell considering that they are mere parts of the entire story.  Also, the chapters progress with the amount of signifigance that it holds and clearly, the killings weren't done in order of signifigance.  As for the stories being told, the route story of The Bride's revenge is pretty much left at face value, she is p*ssed and people will pay for it;however, the side stories being told have an incredible amount of depth, mainly Cottonmouth's.  Obviously, the focus at the start of the Kill Bill is not really The Bride but her enemies which adds further layers to the overall film because now she is not simply killing faceless killing machines, the Bride is killing living and breathing human beings who have their set of beliefs and fears (especially Vernitta Green).  If anything, this really hints at the brutality of the attempt at the Bride's death (in fact, The Bride actually describes to Vernitta Green what it would actually take for her to get even and it is not pleasant).  Speaking of Vernitta Green, that sequence is pretty much is metaphoric of how the movie will move after that point (only in reverse).  Now the scene literally kicks off (or more accurately punches off) and they are fighting no holds barred and then they are interrupted and it returns to the slow Tarantino pace with his snappy diolgue and slow movement.  Again, that pretty much summurises the rest of the movie's movements (again in reverse) because after that, the movie slows down and we can really see the pain, both physical and emotional, that the Bride is going through has well as her preperations for her next (or actually first) kill.  The action picks up a little bit with the anime sequence explaining Cottonmouths history and then it returns to the slow pace once again.  Remember, this is Quentin Tarantino so the slow pace is not really a bad thing at all and allows him to simply show the humanity of these characters (mainly the Bride).  And since he pretty much knows that we know what will happen, he worries more about showing us what is happening in the moment then what will happen eventually. Now, the performances were superb, especially Uma's because it was more physical then vocal and why would she really want to talk when she has 5 people that need to be killed. Everyone else plays their roles equally well but not really as physical (only exception being maybe Vivica A. Fox becuase she doesnt have anytime to say anything and starts off defending).  i would say the big suprise, to me at least, was Sonny Chiba.  Now i have all his Street Fighter Films and think of him as that crazy assassin who pokes out eyes, and rips off people's nuts.  in Kill Bill, he has a more homely type role and it is more hummorous then anything else.  And he plays the part very well, it was hard to believe that this was the same guy who brutally and slowly broke a guys arm bone by bone in the Street Fighter.  However, the standout performance (in this first part) would have to be Lucy Liu's. She is almost the Polar opposite of her character in Charlie's Angels.  In Kill Bill, her character is no one to mess with (which she makes very apperent in the film) but at the sametime, does not freak out or get overemotional.  She is really cold and calculating and every action she does is planned out in her head before she does it. Now to talk about the action (and to refer to the one line summary). Without a doubt, simply becuase this movie has martial arts, wire-stunts, and Yuen woo-ping as the choreographer, it will be compared to The Matrix. the big problem with this comparison is, well, they have absolutely nothing in common with each other.  Now enough abot the Matrix.  Yuen Woo-ping is known for his fantasy-like  choreography that  makes fight scenes more like dances then actual fights.  In Kill Bill, this is not neccessarily true. It looks more like an actual fight then a dance.  he has been known to say that when choroegraphing a fight scene 'keep the swords banging to keep people interested'.  in kill Bill this is a bit modified (in the final 200 man battle at least).  It is now, apprently, keep blood gushing and and slashes deadly and the people will stay interested.  there are only brief moments that are genuine Yuen Woo-ping but the majority of the fight scene is almost entirely different then what we (at least me) are used to seeing from him.As for the climantic Duel between Cottonmouth and the Bride, it is somewhat apparent that this is where Sonny Chiba made is other contribution to the film.  It is rather slowly paced when compared to the fight scene preceding it but it is no less entertaining.sidenote: everybody seems to assume that the fight scenes are anything but realistic.  this is because of the blood special effects and the way the fight scenes are shot at certain moments.  However, it is far more realistic then past american efforts at martial arts (again like the Matrix).  there is very little so called 'flying' and when people get punched or kicked, they feel it.  When some gets slashed by the samurai sword, they either die or bleed profusely.  The wound is not passed over like a simple scrape.",Null,0,0,11 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," fights and car chases, it cant get any better
","First this movie surpasses the first in every way.  There are more and longer action scenes, there is more story, and more flesh.  First the action scenes.  All the fight scenes are well-choreographed and performed.  Of course many people would consider the 100 agent smiths vs Neo scene the highlight fight scene which has some validity.  Not so much so for the fighting (which is great dont get me wrong) but more for the special effects.  only on very few occassions is it obvious that Neo or agent smiths were all CGI but the majority of the time it is very difficult to tell. In my opinion though, the best fight scene would be in the mansion.  I believe this becuase, there is little to no CGI, it is mainly wire work.  Also Keanu Reeves uses an assortment of weapons including: a long sword, sais, twin sticks, and a staff.  Now on to the chase sequence towards the end.  One of the people is quoted, 'The best car chases ever.' while making the scenes. This is not a lie.  The Washowski bros. set up some of the most extravagant car crashes and captued them on film in ways crashes has yet to filmed. In many cases you would want to tell yourself that it is CGI but it just looks too good to be CGI.  About the only times they used CGI was when people were invilved (the agent jumping on the car, people turning into agents) and it seemed that there was only one crash in which it was heavily aided by computer effects ( a crash invilving two semis and there two people flying off of one of the semis). As for the story, I will just say it goe more in depth about all the major characters as wel as introducing some new ones.One thing to keep in mind is that this movie does not end, it stops. However, the last 10 or fifteen minutes or so has some of the most bizzare explanations and a couple of strange events (one of them being a real sappy one but stil a little weird).",Null,0,0,15 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," a true sequal
","This has to be the best sequal in a long while (of course there are countless other sequals on the way, about 3 or 4 or so, but this could be an omen of things to come).  There are more characters, more story, and much more action. Whats even more amazing is how the director and writer managed to pay close attention to almost every character (many of which that were already glimsped at in the first one) without it being tiresome  or slowing the pace of the film.  Ironically, even with a longer running time then the first, it moves at a quicker pace, mainly due to the action scenes. Speaking of which, the action scenes are incredible with the high lites, I beleive, to be the beginning with Nightcrawler taking on the secret sservice agents, and then the end fight scene between Wolverine and Deathstrike (played by Kelly hu who has seemed to have mastered the hot chick silent killer role).  That is not to say that the action scenes in between are mediocre.  In fact, its quite the opposite.  They are expertly done in every sense as well as unique.  There is a raid on the school in which you get a glimpse at other mutant powers, a jet chase where tornadoes are used as a defense, and a brief but well choreograhped and shot fight scene with Mystique and military guards.  There is a whole lot that I am leaving out, special effectwise and storywise, but then I will give out too much of the movie's story and which could in turn ruin the experience.",Null,0,0,2 May 2003
Windtalkers," GREAT!!! . . . when viewed as an action movie
","Windtalkers is almost a paradox.  When viewed as an action movie, it is spectacular but as a war movie, it leans towards the mediocre side of things.  The reason why this is is because well, other then introducing the small but signifigant part that the navajo indians played in the war, Windtalkers really offers nothing new in terms of how to view war or how the soldiers viewed the war.  Also, when there is an attempt at a message of any kind or some ironic conversations among the characters, it seems forced and only in the film becuase it is trying to be a war movie and all war movies must have them.  Another thing that war movies have is confusion and an uneasy flow of the battle scenes which works for a war movie. Windtalkers has a more comfortable and natural flow with the battle scenes which are great in terms of action scenes but not really in terms of a war movie. Saving Private Ryan, and We Were Soldiers are great examples of how a war movie battle scene should be because the actions of the characters and such are disjointed and has an uneven pace. However, the battle scenes in Windtalkers are by far the best, amd most brutal, that I have ever seen.  In fact I would go as far to say that they are more brutal then Saving Private Ryans (We Were Soldiers is a toss up). The reason being is that tyhe characters, mainly Nicolas Cage's and the Ben Yahzee, get down and dirty with the enemy.  Nicolas Cage takes out 6 guys at ppoint blank range with a pistol and Ben Yahzee swings a knife wildly at enemy soldiers slashing throats, legs, arms, or whatever is in the way of the knife. Basically, it is a great action movie masqurading as a war movie.  If you watch it for the battle scenes, you wont be dissappointed.  If you wacth it and expecting something like We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you will be dissappointed.sidenote:  What also seperates Windtalkers from SPR ans WWS, is the use of slow motion.  SPR and WWS had very little slow motion withyin their battle scenes and when they did it was the clunky, unpolished kind that fits them well.  Windtalkers has the smooth slow motion from high speed camaras which looks very impressive but makes the battle scenes very stylistic which is great for a action movie but seems out of place in a war movie.",Null,0,1,29 May 2003
