United 93," Everyone in America should see this film.
","I usually do not do reviews of any kind, but after seeing United 93, I felt compelled to say my peace. Being from Seattle I was not affected as deeply as some of my fellow Americans were, but this film did bring back some of the feelings I felt on 9/11 and in the weeks afterward. During the film and after I left the theater, I was filled with a large array of emotions. Sadness, empathy, anger, and vengeance come mostly to mind. This film can be summed up in one word, powerful.Everyone in America should see this film. We should not forget that we live in a world where envious, hateful, brainwashed, closed-minded extremists will go to great lengths to commit murder in the name of God.More than that, this film puts a human face on some of those who lost their lives nearly five years ago. They were our Fathers, our Mothers, our Sons, our Daughters, our Friends, our Neighbors, and even the guy that sits in the cube next to you at work. We should never forget 9/11 nor our bother and sisters who lost their lives on that day.",10,1,3,25 May 2006
