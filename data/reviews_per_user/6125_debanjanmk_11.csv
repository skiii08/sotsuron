Men in Black 3," Men in Black Welcome back
","A fantastic movie with a fabulous plot and perfectly believable characters. Will Smith is the real entertainer and an incredibly talented actor while Tommy Lee Jones projects the best of subtle aging character of the MIB. The concept is amazing, the connectivity is thoughtful and some comic punches are really rib tickling while some make you laugh. MIB3 is such surreal that it actually succeeds in inducing a thought in the viewers' minds that Aliens do exist and MIB exists too.The special effects are good. A must see for all age groups.Not forgot to mention Josh Brolin as young K was perfect.Director Barry sonnenfeld has done a good job too.",7,2,4,7 September 2012
Lone Survivor," Solely Touching & Bombastic Movie
","Lone Survivor a Breathtaking, often unbearably brutal account of a June 2005 military mission that claimed the lives of 19 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's Kunar province.The movie is absolutely filled to the brim with action, emotion, and decent acting.Watching each of them falls is heartbreaking, with some breathtaking camera work and stunts, we see, hear, and feel every bullet zoom by, every burst of fire, and every bone shatter.The gun fights are very good, again you get the feeling of been there with them and having the fear of danger.The real acting came from Ben Foster and the others. Foster was excellent! Eric Bana strong support.Wahlberg was very good, He does injury and pain well, but not so much when he need to be vulnerable.Lastly a truly well made brilliant movie that is an extremely satisfying watch.",9,2,7,31 January 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Awesome thriller
",The Bourne Ultimatum' is arguably the best of the Bourne Trilogies. The story is superbly structured where the stunts and action scenes are well co-ordinated to ensure you stay at adrenaline through out the movie. The sheer thrill of story line in which Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) finally traces his roots to David Webb is spell binding and the desperation to find out his identity brings a class to Matt Damon's performance.Superb action sequences... cool shaky camera moves.This third film in the Bourne trilogy is a relentless action stunner which doesn't let you sit back for a moment.Excellent screenplay powered with some breathtaking stunts. A winner all the way!,9,1,2,15 March 2012
Man of Steel," This time Superman really returns
","With the beginning itself the movie is engrossing. The Krypton is a visual delight. Screenplay by David S. Goyer is fantastic & direction by Zack Snyder is superb. Background Score by Hans Zimmer is fantastic & perfectly blends with the scenes. Kevin Costner & Diane Lane proved to be good parents to Cavill as Jonathan & Martha Kent.The 3-D effects were nice and CGI were fantastic.A wonderful scripted movie beautifully executed by great actors. A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay.",9,1,5,20 July 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A solid action Thriller
","I went to theaters to see M:I 4 but i was not disappointed.Action has always been the high point of the Mission Impossible series. But this kind of action: Wow! The new film is essentially a relentless roller-coaster ride that doesn't give you a moment to sit back and keeps the adrenalin pumping to dizzy heights as Tom Cruise gets on his regular mission of saving the world, one more time.Paula Patton, Jeremy Renner & Simon Pegg are good but Tom Cruise steals the show.The technology is new which gives a good support to the movie. Cruise's ability to perform the most death- defying stunts and an abundance of sheer luck which redefines the word 'impossible' as 'possible'. the director managed to keep the stunts scenes pouring in at regular intervals so there is no boredom.All and all a great movie which is a must watch for everyone.",8,2,5,29 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Spectacular Gripping tale
","I saw this movie without much expectation but was thrilled to see what came my way.it is the fact that this must be one of the warmest and most humane sci fie fantasies of late that makes Rise of the Planet of the Apes such a gripping saga.James Franco always manages to add that special touch to his roles, makes his character even more appealing. Freida Pinto stays mostly in the background but does have a piquant charm of her own. But the revelation was Andy Serkis in the role of caesar, he was outstanding.Watch the apes storm across the Golden Gate bridge, chase cars, smash them down, jump into helicopters, tear them apart and send the super human species reeling for cover and you have relentless moments of high drama on screen. Equally enthralling is the secret uprising in the animal facility where Caesar infuses a sense of dignity in the rest of the apes who are used to being maltreated by the cruel handlers.This one's both a mass entertainer and a film with a high intelligent quotient.",9,1,2,29 December 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Cover was amazing but not the Book
",As a Spidey fan and I am really disappointed by the film.The amazing spiderman 2 is probably the worst movie in spiderman series. The movie is so predictable that 'the beginning was its end'.The storyline of the film felt very weak with tons of characters clustered in the whole movie. I did not like how they still continued with the whole thing about what happened to peter's parents they died get over it. I did not think it was a good move or the right moment to kill off a major character that makes the movie work so well with their presence. The film was still entertaining and it had good fighting action sequences. I thought the special and visual effects were totally amazing. I still felt the script and dialogue was very lazy and it had no character development.Here's some flaws:How electro got the power of invisiblity.How harry got to electro with just 2 guards knockout.The opening scene where spiderman jokes with this 'villain' is absurd. Risking lives to joke with him as he drives a van of radioactive material through the town.Lastly The Amazing Spiderman 2 may have its moments but it fails to prove as 'Amazing' as promised by the title.,5,0,4,21 May 2014
Dark Shadows," Its good but.......
","I went on to see Dark Shadows with much expectation but it did not deliver 100%.Firstly the acting by Johnny Depp was very good as always,Eva Green also acted well as the cunning witch,rest of the cast performed accordingly.Story was also good but it lacked depth,the movie did not know whether it is a comedy or a horror movie.Dark Shadows is undeniably entertaining and nothing else. There are things that could have been better.Dir. by Tim Burton was not up to the mark,he needed to make the movie more compact.The horror aside - there's nothing to make you bite your nails - Dark Shadows clearly works on three fronts. First, is the picturesque setting then the acting and visual effect.",6,0,0,7 September 2012
The Conjuring," Scare at its best
","The problem with most modern horror films is that they've stopped trying to scare you; they want to gross you out instead with elaborate and explicit torture and killings.The Conjuring gives an adrenaline rush to your body with few scary scenes and spooky moments.It is Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are the soul of the film especially Farmiga. She is fill of expression and gives in a great performance as Lorraine.It's the subtle and steady build-up of suspense and psychological tension, coupled with sudden spine-chilling scares and dramatic silences that make you go numb with fear.Much to our satisfaction, filmmaker James Wan's (Saw, Insidious) direction defies the done-to-death horror movie clich√©s that have so far caused most people to disregard the genre.",9,0,2,9 August 2013
The Woman in Black," A Chilling movie
","The Woman in Black is a well written well acted horror movie,Radcliffe is amazing as Arthur Kipps subtle and restrained.The haunted house in the middle of nowhere is enough to send chills down your spine. And if that's not all, there is a lot of eeriness to choose from: the bad omen (black crow), creaking of an empty armchair.Dir. James Watkins has done a clever job by giving fright in regular intervals, so there's no boring part.Dan is superb,so mature it is difficult to believe he is only 22,although i would not have expected any less from him.the element of surprise is used very wisely,and the building up of tension makes you wish you could step up to Arthur and say--'Please leave this horrible place and go back!'.",7,0,1,4 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," An epic end of Magnificent Saga
","I was Quite thrilled to watch the the series end.The three musketeers have grown and given their best in this final film.while Alan Rikman perfectly portrayed the character of Severus Snape, his memories is the heart of the film.special effects are rocking.The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. Neville cutting the head of Nagina is the show stealer.Dir. David Yates shows his brilliance in this film after a bit let down in Half Blood Prince.Sure it is the end of an era and even i clapped when the movie ended and happy with the winning of good over evil.",9,1,3,17 July 2011
