Marie Antoinette," the music?
","In general a nice flick. It gives a balanced view of the royal situation before the french revolution and the scenery and clothing is excellent. The acting is so so, but i don't know if that was because of the way Coppola wanted to present the situation or because she just didn't wanted to deepen the characters whatsoever. Well basically, if it stayed like this it was an OK movie. But the music! WHo came up with the idea to mix classical music and rock?? Worst thing to do ever, even if it was just a tryout. I mean the editor must have had the same feeling that sometimes the modern music did absolutely not contributed to the scene or the movie as a whole. Just so you know before you watch the movie, do not let the music bother you, it's an OK flick to watch overall.",6,1,2,25 January 2007
Jarhead," average movie about the war life of a US Marine Sniper with better camera work
","The movie about a man who joins the US Marine Corps and 'becomes' assigned to be a scout / sniper joins the Gulf.My main comment on this movie is that the story was rather empty. Low character development and no true depth. In contrast i would recommend Full Metal Jacket. Some scenes used in Jarhead even come directly from of this movie! If you want to see a movie about the war-life of the American soldier that movie is way better (not considering i know what that life is of course).A plus on off the movie was the way it was shot and the excellent settings! beautifully done. Anyways, an average movie that you do not need to see, but is a nice way to use up some of your otherwise useless time.",7,0,1,24 January 2006
I Am Legend," is it just me?
","is it just me or does anyone else see the similarity? Anyone seen the 2 movies '28 days later' and '28 weeks later'? I dunno but the whole concept seems to be rather the same? Nevertheless, this movie is rather nice to watch. Enough exciting moments, good music (if you like raggae), OK acting and nice special effects...thought the story of above mentioned English movies was better i must say ;) ... better stay tuned for the sequel (cause of course the English version had a sequel and thus Hollywood must make an effort ;)).Anyways, seeing this movie on a Friday night wont hurt you. Cool to watch with some buddies, or even when you're bored stiff and dun have anything else to do ;). Anyways, have fun watching it and don't expect too much of it, then you'll be happily surprised!",Null,0,1,3 January 2008
