The Monuments Men," Classic in the WWII genre
","If you're not used to or don't enjoy WWII slow moving dramas, skip this one. If that's your style, you'll love this flick. Steady pace throughout, great war time set recreations, I just loved it. The story revolves around a small unit of beyond the normal draft age art experts thrown into the war to salvage the great masterpieces being stolen by the Nazi's. If you enjoyed the Big Red 1, The Great Escape or even Shining Through, give this film a shot.There's very little shooting. Right and wrong are clear cut here. No attempt has been made to show another side to the story. It's how all the old classic WWII films were made.",8,1,2,3 May 2014
