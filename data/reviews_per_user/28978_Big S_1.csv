Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas is a Genius
","Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is the greatest movie of the Star Wars Saga when it comes to the visual world that is created.  The original is still the best of the saga, but this movie proves better than the Return of the Jedi.  The story of young Anakin Skywalker has been 16 years in the waiting.  This movie does live up to the hype, but remember it is still a kids movie.  There are a bunch of little things that Lucas adds to this movie that stay in the tradition of the original movies.  Hands down the best movie of the decade.",7,0,0,30 May 1999
