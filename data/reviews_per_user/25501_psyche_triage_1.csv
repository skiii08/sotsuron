United 93," Good movie, bad viewing.
","Although the script and acting were believable and well done, the camera movement destroys the experience. The director may have thought that the first-person point of view would help viewers feel as if they were in the middle of the action, all it seemed to do for this viewer is upset my stomach.Constant shaking and shifting of focal points make it impossible to know what one is looking at while watching 'United 93.' Besides a perpetual vibration that gives the impression the viewer is always panting, the focus jumps from one corner of the picture to another. The only movie that does this 'confused bystander' point of view worse is 'Blair Witch.' I have tried to see 'United 93' twice. Although I managed to actually sit through my second viewing, I left the theater feeling as if I had been spinning in circles the whole time.Again, I have to admit I was a little impressed with the script and the acting. I can also say that, in moderation, the first-person POV would work well for this movie, but overall, a bad headache and an upset stomach ruined 'United 93.' It might be a good watch when it comes out on DVD, but until then, I would suggest avoiding this movie unless you have a strong stomach.",4,3,15,1 May 2006
