The New World," Terrible movie
","Listen people. I am a very big fan of IMDb.com and use it's site on a consistent basis to view movie ranking, etc.. This movie was ranked a 7.5, so I decided to check it out. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The entire movie contains an internal dialogue and expresses no emotion what so ever. Colin Ferrell hasn't made a good movie since Phonebooth, wait never mind... I was very disappointed in this movie and the ending was even worse. Take my advise, don't even consider seeing this movie. As for IMDb.com, I still love you and forgive you, but you blew it big this time. It is my goal in life now to find these IMDb mistakes and inform it's users (all of you) before it is too late. Just call me the IMDb assassin.",2,1,5,30 January 2006
