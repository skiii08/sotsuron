Ghost," Death can be hard to handle...
","Ghosts and supernatural beings are hard subjects; 'Beetlejuice' and 'Field of Dreams' were great, while 'Manos: The Hands of Fate'...well, take a look at the top 100 worst and see for yourself. 'Ghost' wouldn't be caught dead anywhere on that list, in my mind. Everyone, even Patrick Swayze (Whose facial expressions are perfect in this film), did as great a job as the crew behind the scenes making special effects that were great for their time and some of which are still good today. I'll bet that puts to shame a LOT of modern movies. Of everything I've seen here, though, the plot is magnificently original. Guy loves girl, girl loves guy, guy gets killed, becomes a ghost with a bunch of others, tries to help wife, wife stops believing, etc. What's guy to do?I give this film my rating now.5 out of 5-*****",Null,1,2,6 July 2004
