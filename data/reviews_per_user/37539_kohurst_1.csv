Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wow
","This movie was totally not what I expected, but believe me, it's definitely THE movie to hit up this month. There were a couple of scenes that I absolutely could not believe including a graphic nudity scene (this is included in the R rating warning though) but all in all, this is seriously one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! Sacha Baren Cohen truly depicts America and its people...maybe not at its finest, but it definitely is accurate. This is a great movie to go and see with a bunch of people and will most likely become a cult classic due to the popularity of Da Ali G show. This movie is one that has already been built up so much that it will become immensely popular. As stated by the rating (R) this is a movie that parents should be careful letting their children see - when I went, I saw a mother and her young child (probably 12 or so) sitting near me in the theater. This is definitely not a kid's movie, due to graphic nudity, strong language, and certain scenes.",8,2,8,5 November 2006
