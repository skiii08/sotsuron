The Hangover," Review of The Hangover
","The Hangover is a bumpy, raucous, raunchy road trip.It's also pretty forgettable.A couple of Bufferins and you'll be ready for the next comedy. Why do movies about overindulgence have to be overindulgent? I get a kick in the comic solar plexus from reviewers who call The Hangover and its ilk, 'instant classics.' They must have seen only one or two movies in their meager critical careers. They certainly don't know what 'classic' is, and they don't seem to know comedy. If something is supposed to be humorous, they laugh, like reflexive audience members, but intention is not execution.Read the complete review: http://tonymacklin.net/content.php?cID=240Tony Macklin http://tonymacklin.net",4,6,18,11 June 2009
Star Trek," Review of Star Trek (2009)
","Star Trek is one slick, Enterprising movie.In making yet another Star Trek, the great challenge the filmmakers -- J.J. Abrams, et al. -- faced was to be contemporary while also respecting the past.The Trekkie franchise goes back to the beginning of Gene Roddenberry's TV series in 1966 -- 45 years ago. Maybe that's a blip in galaxy time, but it's two generations in human time.Star Trek (2009) passes its obstacles with dazzling, time-warping colors. It's frisky fun yet has the ballast of essential quality.Read the full review: http://tonymacklin.net/content.php?cID=233Tony Macklinhttp://tonymacklin.net",8,0,7,12 May 2009
Public Enemies," Review of Public Enemies (2009)
","When contemporary songstress Diana Krall sings 'Bye Bye Blackbird' -- as Johnny Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) have their first dance -- it becomes the theme song for Public Enemies. It's a bolt from the blues.Michael Mann's brilliant and deceptive new film is full of such themes lurking in its shadows. That's what makes it provocative, challenging, and rewarding.Mann takes a well-recognized historical figure in a well-known time in a well-worn genre and gives them revitalized life. But one has to be alert to see beyond the past.Mann is sly, inventive, and sometimes subtle amidst the familiar goings-on. He remints the fabled career of John Dillinger in the 1930s.One expects Mann to make some pungent social criticism in his mise en scene and plot machinations. And he does, with panache.One especially provocative sequence in Public Enemies is a torture scene in which the brutality only gains misinformation. It is a compelling mirror of today's interrogation techniques.Mann also introduces the concept of burgeoning surveillance which is a telling harbinger of what is to come.But Mann doesn't state the obvious; he lets the actions speak louder than words. Mann lets history -- and its meaning -- speak for itself.A revelatory example is the infamous 'lady in red,' whom many people know as the woman who betrayed and who was with Dillinger at the Biograph theater in Chicago.In actuality the woman was not in red. In Mann's movie, as in actuality, she wore an orange skirt, which some people mistook as red. And so the legend. Mann doesn't explain that he's bringing actuality to myth. It's there for us to discover.John Dillinger as portrayed by Mann and Johnny Depp (another JD) is a glamorized figure, who seems nearly flawless His fundamental attribute is loyalty. He is charming, cool, and smart. He's Robin Hoodlum.Besides Depp, another fortuitous casting is Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette, the coat check girl who becomes the soul mate of Dillinger. Cotillard won an Oscar as another bird -- Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007).Public Enemies is very much a romance.Christian Bale gives humanity to the stolid but earnest agent Melvin Purvis, whom J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) picks to head his special force to catch Dillinger. Hoover is in the process of developing the FBI and names Dillinger as the first Public Enemy #1.Stephen Lang is memorable as the Texas lawman who assists Purvis. He adds substance to the luminous, fictional denouement.Mann and writers Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman have created a canny script. Public Enemies may remind one of the scope and vision of Altman's Thieves Like Us (1974).Mann has created an evocative, beautiful movie in Public Enemies. Cinematographer Dante Spinotti -- in their fifth collaboration -- creates breathtaking tableaux from a palette with strokes of mesmerizing light.Mann employs scenes and shots that remind us of Hitchcock. There's suspense at a stoplight. There's a shot in a movie theater that reminds us of the tennis match in Strangers on a Train (1951).Mann also uses techniques that may remind us of graphic novels -- flashes of light from tommy guns. There's a surrealistic night scene in the woods around Little Bohemia lodge in Wisconsin.But perhaps the most effective use of past movies is the sequence in the Biograph theater before Dillinger meets his fate. Mann uses clips from Manhattan Melodrama (1934) starring Clark Gable as Blackie (more fortuity), which actually was playing at the Biograph.One of the fundamental themes in Mann's work is about men who hold to their personal codes against society and institutions. It's in all Mann's movies -- Thief (1981), The Insider (1999).Blackie in Manhattan Melodrama has a code; he refuses the governor's (William Powell) offer of commutation and accepts death. In Manhattan Melodrama he says, 'If I can't live the way I want, at least let me die when I want.' Blackie is true to his principles and character -- like Mann's Dillinger.Dillinger watches the movie and obviously relates to what is on screen. Talk about irony.Movies make strange bedfellows -- Gable and Dillinger. Life is image.Mann espouses individuality, but realizes it comes with a heavy price. The individual always winds up the target of the group Business wins out.In Public Enemies Mann has several shots of the group. One of his early shots is of prisoners trudging in a line in a gray-walled prison.Another is a group of pasty-faced feds.Another is a roomful of men sitting before phones taking bets. Dillinger's exploits threaten the crime mob because they bring attention to them. One mobster tells Dillinger he is 'bad for business.' The group is out to destroy the outsider.Mann's Dillinger is a descendant of the cowboy. He sings, 'Get along little doggies.' He lies in bed beneath a picture of a man riding a bucking bronco.Clocks and watches punctuate Public Enemies. Time is running out.But what a countdown! Public Enemies is a delicious feast for an interpretive viewer.Blackbird under glass. A rare treat.Tony Macklinhttp://tonymacklin.net/",8,18,36,2 July 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," What's wrong with movies
","Universal Pictures should be ashamed of themselves. In the ad for The Bourne Ultimatum, they have the total hack Pete Hammond raving about the movie.Hammond goes in the tank for everything. Whenever a studio needs pulp they go to him for mindless praise no matter how mediocre the movie. And he always delivers a gusher. The Bourne Ultimatum deserves praise from legitimate critics -- not a puny hireling. The movie is much better than that. It demeans Bourne to have this leech hanging on.The Bourne Ultimatum is one of those few movies that one can recommend to almost everyone. It will wind up on the best ten lists of most critics -- legitimate critics. The Bourne Ultimatum has integrity. It deserves integrity.",8,23,77,29 July 2007
The Hurt Locker," Review of The Hurt Locker
","Watching The Hurt Locker is a stunning ordeal.It takes the viewer by the scruff of the neck -- that's why the hairs on one's neck stand up. And it embeds him or her in the middle of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad in Baghdad.We're in an environment that is as alienating as being in outer space. When a member of the squad approaches a potentially-cataclysmic bomb, we're with him lumbering, breathing heavily, in a weighty Kevlar suit, like a man on the moon.Or we're in the desert on foot under fire, trying to return it against an enemy we have trouble seeing.Or we're in a jouncing vehicle, with a toy stuffed camel and a cross dangling from the mirror, in a joyless ride through hell.Read the complete review: http://tonymacklin.net/content.php?cID=251Tony Macklinhttp://tonymacklin.net",9,1,4,15 July 2009
Up," Review of Up
","The previews for Up were not enticing.They showed a grumpy old man and a dumpy little boy. This seemed a very pedestrian odd couple. They inspired little or no anticipation.Up is Pixar Animated Studio's latest and 10th effort. I loved Finding Nemo (2003) and, especially, Ratatouille (2007).I thought Up probably would follow in WALL-E's (2008) intermittently clunky footsteps.Fortunately my preconceptions about Up were wrong. Way wrong. It shouldn't work, but it does. Buoyantly.Up is an engaging, exciting, warm-hearted trip at the movies. Up starts slowly, but picks up helium and soars.Read the complete review: http://tonymacklin.net/content.php?cID=238Tony Macklinhttp://tonymacklin.net",8,0,2,6 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Review of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a popular mixture of absorbing adventure and clattering claptrap. Unfortunately, the latter dominates way too much.It's machines on Viagra. I'm happy for the machines -- less so for the humans.Director Micahel Bay is the master pimp for the machines. He brings them together in violent coitus never-interruptus.I'm not outraged or offended by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen as are many of my peers; in fact, I enjoyed some of it.But where Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen falters and fails is obvious. It turns action into clich√© -- as stylistic and vibrant as the special effects are, they are made redundant and dulled by the ham-footed pedal-to-the-metal direction.Read the full review: http://tonymacklin.net/content.php?cID=247Tony Macklinhttp://tonymacklin.net/",4,3,9,1 July 2009
