Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A brilliant, original movie
","This is one of the best, most original comedies I have seen. Yes.. it is rather offensive to the Jews.. but who cares??? I do have respect for the Jews and all other races on the planet.. but seriously, people need to get a life and stop complaining about everything. I'm Welsh.. if this movie said things like 'through a Welshman down the well' or something like that.. I wouldn't cry about.. I'd be laughing my a$$ off twice as much! This movie isn't made to offend.. it's made to shock and entertain.. and that's one thing it definitely does, it's hilarious and so is the main character! If you think this movie is racist.. it's because you were looking for racism. Movies like this will only be offensive if you make them offensive. But enough about that.. it's a fact that this is a quality comedy. Borat is a brilliant character.. he's silly, crazy and very funny. There will never be a similar movie that can match the hilariousness of this movie, so please see it.. even if you are Jewish! I'm really shocked it's banned in most countries in the East. You guys need to be a bit laid back about this sort of thing.. it's just a movie after all! :)",10,9,15,1 December 2007
