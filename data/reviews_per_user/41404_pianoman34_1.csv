10 Cloverfield Lane," disappointed! contains spoilers!!
","It started out OK then it died for about 75 minutes! Boring dialog and script and when it finally got outside it was worse! Blowing up a ginormous alien with a bottle of alcohol?? AND...why didn't she go back and save John Goodman who saved her!!?? LAME all around!! I don't understand what the high rating viewers saw in this movie??? In a previous review, someone said, 'Spend the money. See the movie. Find out for yourself. It's worth it.' What's worth it?? Maybe John Goodman's performance, but the whole build up was such a let down! Would have been better if John Goodman turned out to really be a psycho. But he wasn't and she bailed on him! NOT COOL!",2,0,2,21 March 2016
