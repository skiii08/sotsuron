Sucker Punch," Great movie, bad ending
","Acting: 4.5/5 Effects: 5/5 Music: 4/5 Plot: 4.5/5 Ending: 2.5/5Total: 20/25 Rating: 80%This movie was better than expected. The plot was interesting and imaginative, albeit full of adult themes. The actors and actresses were all very well cast for their roles, and the special effects were stunning. There were 2-3 times when the music seemed to detract from the overall feel of the movie, most notably when a pop song played during an action sequence. The ending, however, was disappointing. It seemed like the whole movie led toward one happy (even if clichÃ©) ending, and then suddenly turns around for no real reason. On the plus side, I now know why the movie is called 'Sucker Punch:' the ending feels like a sucker punch to the gut.",8,2,3,17 August 2011
