50 First Dates," Good movie, but a little flawed - spoiler here.
","Although I enjoyed this movie, I did find parts of it to be somewhat implausible. Contrary to what some people might think, I did not find the basic premise of the movie implausible, since I know that the kind of short-term memory impairment that Barrymore's character exhibits during the course of the movie is not only well-documented, but actually quite common as well.No, the problem I had was with the idea that such a person might get married and even have children.I know, somewhere someone is going to jump out of the woodwork and tell me that there are documented cases of such people marrying and having children.All I can say is - wow. That poor husband. Not only would he have to introduce his wife to their daughter every morning, but he would also have to deal with someone every morning who thought she had gone to bed a young carefree spirit and woken up three months... six months... nine months pregnant. Can you imagine walking up one morning and realizing that you were about to go into labour, and not only could you not remember conceiving this child, but you have no memory of the entire pregnancy?!? I think it would be a cruel and unusual thing to inflict on someone you claimed to be in love with, and I can't conceive of the man who would do it.But, hey, that's just me.steve",Null,1,2,19 June 2004
