The Ring," The Horror Genre is still alive and kicking!!
","At the current point in time of todays society and movies, one might say the horror genre has taken a turn for the worse and is a dieing breed.  I would agree with you up until tonight when I went to see 'The Ring' with my friends; one word, wow!  This movie was amazing from start to finish.  I don't remember the last time I left a movie complex so pleased.  The only complaint I have heard about this movie, is the fact that is a remake. To that, I say who gives a damn.  This movie is saving the horror genre and if more directors and people in Hollywood followed this film as a model, we would have much more to look forward too.  This was a movie that tied up all ends of the story perfectly without leaving you wondering how is that possible and what happened to that person, etc.  The ending, is just so amazing and well done, you really need to see it instead of me trying to explain it here (one of the scariest parts of the movie too).  With all those dumb cheap teen horror flicks out there, its good to see there are some people who can still make great movies that will make you THINK and who don't have to lower themselves to cheap thrills with lots of blood or killings. If you want to see an amazing (rare) scary movie with a great twisted ending and story, 'The Ring' is for you.  I promise you will love it.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
Minority Report," An Amazing Film.
","I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but I just want to some up a few things.  Minority Report was a great movie with an amazing story, special effects, and everything else a movie needs to be great.  With hollywood putting out these cheap movies just to make a quick buck like 'Scooby Doo' and so on, its great to know some people still have a clue about movies.  Some say that this was gory and not right for anyone or it was too long and blah blah blah.  These are the same people who are going to end up seeing that horrible Disney Movie about the Bears coming out soon and rave how it was the greatest movie of the summer.  Minority Report was perfect and could not have been better done.  Tom Cruise and the others played each ones characters perfectly.  This is a great movie for anyone who wants to see a good summer movie, a fan of sci-fi, and if you want a movie thats not after a cheap dollar, then this is your movie.  Everything needed to make this movie great was there.[Go see this movie, you really will like it!]",Null,0,0,4 July 2002
