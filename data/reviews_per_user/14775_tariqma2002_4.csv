Hereditary," An overrated film with a naive content
",I was shocked by the exaggerated positive ratings of the film ... and I was even more shocked by the income it earned in the cinemas .. Why does one pay his money and time to watch such a film .. boring slow events and strange ending which is unclear or very naive .. Before I add my comment on it I asked One of the friends for watching the film and giving me his opinion because I imagined that I did not understand it .. but we was similar in opinion .. The beginning was good and excellent But with the escalation of events it turned out to be a very trivial film with naive content .. I waited for there to have a great value By the end of the film but I was only imaginative ...,1,2,5,28 April 2019
Captain Marvel," Very illogic
","The film is very illogical ... I realize that the films of the Avengers are based on illogic .. But not to this limit .. A person who flies in the air and destroys everything in a second and breathes with no oxygen and overcome the gravity without protection and without a vehicle .If she can destroy anything easily in a second , why she not finish everything at the beginning of the first minute of the film without the need for all this effort .. Also, the dramatic line is very naive and weak, similar to what is done in cheap films .. Added to the element of dazzling film is very weak .. If it achieved success in the box office, This is due to the propaganda made by the film The Avengers of the Infinity War",5,2,3,1 May 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," great movie
","it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.",10,1,1,19 February 2013
Marriage Story," Nothing
","Movie ending to nothing, boring, extended dialogue, not interesting or funny or comedy or mysterious. The drama is slow , I saw it on Netflix with the remote control in my hand pressing the key of fasten forward . If it was an interesting movie I was not going to do that. Of course scarlett Johansson is beautiful and lovely, but that does not means, that any movies she acts is superior. May be someone who faced a such problem of divorce and holding of children , specially women overrated that movie.",4,2,10,3 January 2020
