The Hangover," Too hyped up
","OK, let me start off by saying that I'm not bashing this movie.The Hangover I will admit was funny, but for me it was just like very other comedy. A chuckle here and there, and a few scenes that are really funny. This definitely isn't the 'funniest movie I've ever seen'.The Good: The movie had a few good moments, like when they open a door and hit the baby, when Mike Tyson punches one of the guys, or when the guy jumps out of the trunk on the guys head. Also had a few good lines like 'paging Dr. Faggot' I thought that was hilarious.The Bad: This movie was too hyped up, that was it's downfall. I heard people saying it hilarious, and that your laughing hard the whole time. I didn't laugh hard until they hit the baby with the door.I'm giving it to this movie it was new, fresh, and kinda funny but too hyped up. I'm giving it a 7/10, but I think it deserves more of a 6.5/10.",7,0,0,6 January 2010
