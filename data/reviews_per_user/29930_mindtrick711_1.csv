Mission: Impossible III," Great action that ramps up
","Has foot stomping edginess, very fast, some moments out paces the viewer with tight and awesome action. Little time to digest details but don't worry, discreet details are forgiving. The movie just grabs you and off you go. Story plot is easy to follow, scene to scene has plenty of clever edges and smart angles that won't let you think. Kind of like jumping off a cliff and watching the bottom come at you. The only thing you know is, the fall has to last the length of the movie. Good acting and directing. Timing won't let you sit around to accumulate boring facts. The cast is great, Tom Cruise is relentless, Phil Seymour Hoffman is a cunning and diabolical villain. The scenes sweep by with seamless flowing interaction between characters. Some impossible cinematography scenes look so entirely possible it makes you think, 'Is it really possible?' Seen it twice. May have to see it again. A really good movie to watch and entertain friends with. The end feels good as all Mission Impossible movies do. Love this.",9,1,1,12 December 2015
