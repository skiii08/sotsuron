Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 ... 4/10
","I had low expectations and I was let down, I still recommend seeing it so you can see for yourself. The film looks like it was directed by two different people, constantly switching from a mature dark tone to occasionally funny, but invariably annoying one liners. The worst part (without spoiling anything) is a ridiculous plot twist which not only made the first act completely pointless but also encouraged me to give up with the rest of the movie. As a stand alone film, its rubbish...as the finale to a multi-million dollar trilogy: BIG FAIL. Sorry Marvel fans, this one falls flat.But superhero fans, don't worry Man of Steel is just around the corner.",4,2,5,6 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek: Into Darkness ... 8/10
","I never thought I'd be saying this, but the new Star Trek installment is truly a cinematic experience. I did not enjoy Star Trek (2009) nor do I have any strong feelings about the originals. I was very worried about Star Wars Episode 7 when I went into this movie, simply because I felt Abrams was the wrong choice. I breathed a huge sigh of relief as the end credits rolled; he has done it, he has proved himself. That is not to say it is perfect, the film contains several sex jokes/references that I felt were unnecessary given this films genre. Aside from that though, everything I didn't like about the first installment has been almost completely eradicated, one being the love story. The controversial decision to make Spock and Uhura an item made fans angry, its still in the film however the writing has been improved dramatically and Uhura is once again a secondary character with far less screen time, the way she should stay. The most important change is that of the villain, if a film like this has a weak villain then its a weak movie. Abrams has replaced a bland and loud Eric Bana with a composed, focused and most importantly menacing Benedict Cumberbatch. His scenes are by far the most compelling however the film does stand on its own two feet without him, the relationship between Spock and Kirk is now the focal point and its executed with skilled writing and honest performances. I saw the film in 2D so I'm not able to comment on the 3D however from what I could gather it isn't worth the extra money, the film looked great in 2D and I didn't need to worry about brightness reduction. Abrams even reduced the amount of lens flares, say what you want but he clearly listens to criticism. What can I say, I was pleasantly surprised by Into Darkness and would highly recommend you see it in the cinema...this is not a DVD movie. Also, for the record I thought Spielberg would have been a good choice for Episode 7.",8,2,4,6 June 2013
Public Enemies," masterpiece
","i saw the trailer for this film long before it came out and was blown away by the trailer alone. but what the trailer did was, it gave me the impression that it was a good, exciting action film with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, two of my favourite actors. so i went in with high hopes, but as soon as it started i got the sense that this film was so much more then an action with good acting. it was a film that as i say 'knew what it was doing'. The film was shot on many different locations so to move fast they used a small HD camera to film. this for many people almost ruined the film for them, but for me it only added to the realism in the direction and performances. you are in 1933 with John Dillinger and Melvin Pervis...you aren't in a cinema watching a film. i would give this movie a solid ten as it is a landmark and a break through in the world of film. I hope i'm not alone in my opinion. thanks for reading.",10,2,8,14 August 2009
Life of Pi," Life of Pi ... 8/10
","Certainly a spectacle of jaw dropping visuals however this film offers so much more than that. Life of Pi is a great example of how skillful direction can allow a film to include many larger than life themes and yet stay focused on the story its telling. The film never once goes over board on its use of CGI, in fact it only demonstrates that when a director actually understands visual effects they can actually become another storytelling tool, like when a bunch of Iron Man suits are hitting each other. Having never seen a HFR (high frame rate) 3D feature I am still not a believer in the format, having said that, this film uses the tool very interestingly but I still don't think it adds anything to any of the emotional elements of the film. Life of Pi has a lot of soul and immediately gets personal with its audience and with the exception of an ever so slightly rushed ending, the film never lets you down. I highly recommend that you see Life of Pi. I also feel that this film should have won best picture over Argo, as good as that movie was, in my opinion there is no comparison.",8,0,2,6 June 2013
Evil Dead," Evil Dead ... 5/10
","'Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons...' Yeah we've heard it all before, but does this movie bring anything new to the table? Evil Dead is a re-make of the 1981 horror classic 'The Evil Dead' Directed by Sam Raimi. The original had shocks, screams, blood and most importantly humour. This new version has done away with the comedy and charm of the original and gone for the darker and the bleaker, as most re-makes tend to do. This poses a few problems regarding the films tone, the original had scary dark segments but balanced them with splatter comedy and hokey effects. This made the movie varied in tone and kept the audience engaged, this movie though only 90 minutes long felt like it was lasting an eternity. This was due to the relentless gore, which I don't have a problem with, especially for a movie like this, however it seemed to be the only card the film had up it's sleeve and it just became tedious after a while. The film was trying so hard to be gross and shocking that it forgot to be scary, I get frightened very easily by horror films, in fact I go out of my way to avoid them and this film failed to scare me, trust me that's saying something. Having said that, the film-makers deserve a lot of credit for the technical aspects of the film; almost every effect is done practically which is fantastic to see in a main stream horror movie again. I hope that this movie will encourage other Directors to take more risks with their horror films, the genre has just about run its course due to complacency in the industry; though this film had some crazy 'old school' horror elements to it....its still just another re-make. Give us something new Hollywood!The film is extremely violent, but not scary, in other words its more 'Yuck' than 'Yikes' so I recommend you see it with your friends and just have fun with the gore.",5,2,7,6 June 2013
The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby ... 7.5/10
","Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of the classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is certainly a loud, colourful and epic experience, its even in 3D. But does that style necessarily work for a story as delicate as The Great Gatsby? Oddly enough the answer is yes. This radical vision for the story is very much intended for this generation, a good example would be the modern soundtrack. This helped to make the story feel more relevant as you are listening to music that is current today, the way jazz would have been for the characters in 1922. You can take any frame of this film and you would have something worth hanging on the wall, it is stunning. Having said that, the most engaging part of the film is the performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. He is truly on the top of his game here; giving us a confused, vulnerable, loving and at times deranged Jay Gatsby. That is not to take away from the other actors, I was very skeptical of Tobey Maguire playing such a central character but he too pulls it out of the bag. Maguire manages to give us a compelling performance but also is able to step aside when Gatsby becomes the focal point, pulling off a shift of the spotlight that is impossible to do without dynamic and believable chemistry, which they do have. We are also treated to a good performance form Carey Mulligan and the best performance I've ever seen from Joel Edgerton. I was also surprised to be laughing as often as I was, the film has a lot of genuine humour and charm to offer including a hilarious intro for the character, Tom. The problems in the film lye in some of the visuals, as you can imagine some of the transitions are rather lavish and occasionally Luhrmann will go one too far with the effects. There are also numerous sound editing mistakes, which I found unusual for a film as big as this one. There is a dialogue scene which takes place in a moving car, some of the dubbing is laughably bad as you can see his mouth isn't even moving. The film also includes a lot of green screen and CGI which I don't have a problem with as long as it looks perfect. Anything short of that and you've lost the audience for that shot, this happened a few times during a lot of the fast car scenes which were shot with a lot of 3D-tastic camera moves. The car looked fine when it was actually a real car, it was when they inter cut with the CGI car that it looked terribly clunky and awkward. Putting those gripes aside the film is a magnificent work and a commendable effort to give this generation a new way in to this incredible story, a lot of young people will go see the film and come out wanting to read the book. I saw the film in 2D so I can't comment on the 3D but from what I could gather this looked to be another interesting use of the tool, much like Life of Pi. I will certainly be seeing this again and I highly recommend it to you old sport.",8,1,9,6 June 2013
