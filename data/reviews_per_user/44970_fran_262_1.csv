Skyfall," Fantastic- the best effort of Daniel Craig yet
","Having seen this film today, I was extremely impressed, I found the film to trump Quantum of Solace and even Casino Royale. Daniel Craig really fits into the role well as Bond, he is a slightly rougher, less slick version, but he is intense, emotional and powerful. The opening credits were excellent and very mesmerising. Having previously heard the song by Adele, I found it to be an excellent fit for the credits. The opening scene was typically fast, intense and chaotic, with very impressive action scenes, which were very well-directed. The story, which revolves largely around M, was not difficult to follow nor uninteresting, and it was enjoyable to see her play such an important role in this film. As for the character of Severine, I found that it was maybe even a stretch to call her a Bond girl, as her role in the film was rather limited and not entirely key to the story as a whole, compared to the previous two. I also enjoyed the character played by Javier Bardem; he brought a quirky element, and performed well in the action scenes. The cinematography as usual was excellent, with impressive shots of London, and also a contrast with scenes taking place in the Highlands. The ending was dramatic and saddening, bringing M to an end. Overall, the film was retro and also modern, with an interesting plot, and one which is very visually pleasing. I would wholly recommend it!",8,4,12,30 October 2012
