Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," not good
","An average rating of 8? Are you kidding me? Phantom Menace has some of the worst dialogue ever..I don't understand how the actors kept straight faces saying some of the things they did.  Even with the prodigious acting talent of Neeson and McGregor, the lines still came off sounding completely ridiculous.  And the character of Jar Jar...just that alone ruined the movie for me.  I was even a little insulted by the stereotype the character seemed to portray. not only does Jar Jar stereotype black people, the viceroys were a nasty stereotype of asians, and Anakin's owner, the shop-keeper, was an offensive characterization of latin people.  George Lucas' style of directing and his falir for screenwriting is completely dated, and so is Star Wars.  I will say the special effects were amazing, which saves the movie from being a complete waste of money.",4,0,1,30 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," what do people see in this movie?
","Why people like this movie so much, I have no idea. Granted, there was good acting and a few likable characters. However, to me, the story lacked depth. I didn't see much passion or energy between the two lovers.  Yes, I could tell that they were in love, but it didn't say anything more than that.  I wasn't nearly as affected by the fate of their relationship as I was in, for instance, Life is Beautiful.  I understand that Shakespeare in Love isn't supposed to be a deep movie, but if it really is a comedy, how come I didn't laugh? The Shakespeare references in the dialogue were too gimiky and way over-used.  Other attempts at humor were equally ineffective, predictable, and dry.  What else is there to this movie?",6,1,2,5 April 1999
Good Will Hunting," What An Arrogant...
","This movie reeks of one thing....pure arrogance. The film communicates a very immature view on intelligence and success. Are we supposed to accept that since Ben Affleck's character isn't as smart as Matt Damon's, he should be satisfied with his lot in life where as Mr. Smarty Pants should claim his rightful place in the heirarchy of society? So, when some dumb kid sees this movie, he's suppost to say to himself, 'You know, I'm not as smart as Will. I'm more like his friend. So, I really shouldn't worry about succeeding in life. Like Ben Affleck's character, I should be happy working construction while my smart friend needs to get motivated and succeed.' Granted, the movie does not focus on this, but this theme is definitely present, and extractable. By the way, the math that genius Will does is quite simple. Matrices? MacLaurin series? come on. I learned that in high school and I'm no genius.",2,24,48,1 December 1998
Eyes Wide Shut," another great one from SK
",Every time I see a Kubrick film I am blown away. EWS is a beautiful and stimulating movie. No American director comes close to Kubrick.,10,0,0,21 July 1999
