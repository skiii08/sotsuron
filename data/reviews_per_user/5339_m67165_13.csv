Love and Death," Fight for you right to be a coward
","As I remember this movie, the French were invading Imperial Russia, and our hero wanted nothing to do with this crazy war. He did not think Mother Russia was worth the trouble. As this is a comedy, Trouble did think he was worth the effort. And staying up late to watch this one was certainly worth the good times.",Null,1,2,19 December 2003
Catch Me If You Can," thatÂ´s entertainment!
","This one could use a faster pace at the start. But It was well worth waiting a few minutes to see the story really getting started. As soon as the high schooler gets to apply his talents as an actor, off we go! If you want warm feelings with your fun, go for it!",Null,0,1,2 March 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," one more time
","This is delirious! This is fun! Let's do it again! I simply have got to see again a movie about a world like this one! A place where a rabbit and a woman can be married! I guess the universe is evolving in a good direction, after all!",Null,1,1,17 May 2003
MASH," So crazy it must be true
","OK, maybe the mad antics of these front line doctors and nurses are a little exaggerated. But I believe they can't be far from the true insanity that must be to do surgery in a war. This is brutal comedy in great style.",Null,0,1,15 December 2003
Forrest Gump," That was great, thank you!
","I've seen this one eleven times. No, it is not my record: I've seen Scooby-Doo fourteen times. But this one was different because it really hit me deep at the very first viewing. And I cried every single time I saw it, which is very unusual of me. I also had a laugh and wondered at the images and the food for thought that is scattered through it. Some people say its message is very conservative, but I believe it manages to be a different movie to every viewer. It is more like a mirror: the way you see it is the way you see yourself. Maybe all films are like that in a way, but this here is a true fable about beliefs. Beyond the tears and laughter, you get to see how chance helps a lot, but mostly it is the way he sees the world that gets the guy the world he gets to live in. I do believe this movie says we should try to be true to our sense of what's good, and that's about all we can do in this crazy wonderful world. I'm just grateful for this film, for it did me good.",Null,1,2,7 March 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Yes, I like it like that!
","First of all, let me say that I loved Shrek so much I saw it three times, but see no point in comparing it with this one. Shrek was a movie for adults that children might also enjoy. Monsters, Inc. is for kids, no doubt about it. But that won't stop you from having a great time, unless you simply hate cute little movies made for children that might have another level of humor in them for us adults to savor. I don't like sugar, but I do like movies like this one!",Null,0,1,6 February 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Brit humor
","I must confess Brit Humor leaves me puzzled sometimes. This movie is one of those occasions. A couple of times I just stared in amusement at some scene that was obviously supposed to be very funny, for some other person, that is. But don't be mistaken: I really liked this one. The boys and the girls look great, and most of the jokes are quite hilarious.",Null,0,0,1 October 2001
Duck Soup," Basic training for war
","Before you go to war, watch this one. It is really funny, and makes you think twice about politicians and the reasons they give for war. If you decide to go on and fight, at least you gave it a little thought, and probably had a little laugh. God knows this movie made me laugh a lot, and for that I'm very grateful.",Null,0,2,29 March 2003
Moulin Rouge!," It may hurt you
","Well, I'm glad we're on our way to completely legalize prostitution and multi-partnered marriage. I'm not against monogamy, but if you think it is the only option, and have been feeling sad and lonesome lately, watching this movie may not be a good idea. I had some fun, a few laughs (even at some scenes that were supposed to be sad), and felt bored a couple of times. Some parts of it could be faster, really. All in all, it was OK.",Null,0,0,1 September 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I have not read the whole book
","I read the book up until the train is about to arrive, and Harry is about to enter school. It was fun, but I wasn't too crazy about it. Now, after enjoying the film, I guess I'll go back and finish the book. The movie was surely nice, but I guess the book is even better, with more humor to it. If you like the book, I suppose you'll feel the movie is a good  shorter version of it in images.",Null,0,0,2 December 2001
Love Actually," Funny, actually
","As this film started, I realized something that should have probably been obvious from the trailer: It's a Christmas Movie! Oh, my God, what am I doing here? But It turned out alright. Yes, it was a good movie! Some Christmas movies are just too full of sentimentalism, in my humble opinion, and that's why I tend to avoid them. This here was good warm fun! Thank you, Santa Claus! And a happy 2004 to all!",Null,0,1,21 December 2003
Shrek," I saw it 3 times!
","This is great! Kids will love it, and so will everybody else, as it has jokes for everyone. If you think fairy tales are sacred, you might be in for a little shock, but if, like me, you just love animation with a sense of humor, go for it!",Null,0,0,2 November 2001
Bruce Almighty," Laughing out loud
","Maybe this one will not be considered a classic anytime soon. I would not say it is the best this funny guy ever did. Corny, yes. But it does have some funny moments. And the part where the anchor goes wild had me crying and shaking as I laughed out loud. It was certainly worth the ticket.",Null,0,1,17 June 2003
