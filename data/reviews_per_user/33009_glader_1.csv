Vertigo," A beautifully structured film.
","After reading through many of these comments, I was surprised that I hadn't seen anyone mention the importance of the film's most evocative image - the spiral. More specifically, a double spiral.This image first catches our eye on the poster art. We are shown it again during the beautiful opening sequence. Most apparently seem to view this as a symbol of Jimmy Stewart's fear of heights, however every detail of the film reflects this shape.It appears in Carlotta's hair in the painting and again in Madeline's hair. Even the bouquet of flowers suggests the pattern.(possible spoilers ahead) The movie's real brilliance is using the pattern to structure the story. The movie repeats itself twice. Scottie's visit to the restaurant where he first lays eyes on Madeline. The visit to Carlotta's grave. The art gallery. The shopping spree. Spying Kim Novak enter a hotel and open a window. The scenes at the mission. Almost every event that happens in the first half of the film is repeated in the second. Even the geographic locations of the movie seem to follow this pattern, twice spiraling outward from the heart of San Francisco.An amazing film, and part of the fun of multiple viewing is being able to pick up on these subtleties.",10,4,4,31 July 2000
