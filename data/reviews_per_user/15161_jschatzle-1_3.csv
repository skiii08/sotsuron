Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Brilliant, a wonderful sequel
","The 2nd in the Sherlock series starring the dynamic duo of Law & Downey Jr. does not disappoint. What was disappointing was that I took Tomato Meter's advice and chose to pay and see MI4 at the theater over Sherlock. MI4 couldn't hold a candle to this one. The plot is brilliant; the script is brilliant; the action scenes, better than the first installment; and the overall work engaging and enjoyable up to literally the last second of the film. Compare that to MI4; which stunk, let's face it. Terrible script and screenplay, lousy acting, cheesy delivery of lines, so contrived to say the least.But I digress. I think Guy Richie has done a fantastic job with these films and I'm looking so forward to the next. The only thing that detracts from the overall euphoria of just having watched this is the reality dawning that it'll be at least two years before that next one arrives in theaters. Until then, Sherlock lives on!",8,0,0,28 July 2012
The Book Thief," Bloody Awful: Painfully Cheesy
","I can't quite recall how this film found its way into my queue, but what a shame it did. From the opening line of the narrator's--and the narrator is Death--we knew it was a stinker. I understand it's based on a novel, and I hear the novel is good. Given the nature of the film I have a hard time believing that; but if that is the case, this may well be the mostly poorly adapted screenplay ever. But speaking from the strictly filmic vantage point it's bloody awful too; the story is set in Holocaust Germany (as if that hasn't been overdone) but none of the characters speak German; they all speak English, affecting German accents, while throwing in the occasional German word (e.g., nein) for effect. It's embarrassing; you're embarrassed for the actors. But the story is terribly contrived, the acting melodramatic, and the lines are horrific, the stuff of high school drama, obvious & patronizing. But above all those things, the story's just plain lame, for too many reasons to count. For starters, the narrator (Death) turns out also to be the main character. Aside from the fact that he's given the worst lines in the film, what's more offensive to the viewer's sensibilities is that Death upstages the Holocaust & WWII; it reduces them to supporting cast. A literary faux pas to say the least. Nevertheless, we sat through this stinker of a film and were rewarded appropriately: the closing lines of the film belong to the narrator's and they're equally if not more embarrassing than the opening ones. We were laughing out loud precisely where we weren't supposed to. Seriously, do yourself a favor; skip this movie. It's 2+ hrs of your life you'll never recover.",2,4,7,18 November 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," MI continues to devolve
","I once heard someone say the American presidency peaked at Washington and devolved from there, considerably and steadily. The same could be said of the MI films. The writing is lousy, the direction sophomoric, and the screenplay contrived and cheesy. The DePalma directed 1st film was so far superior to this anything that has emerged since. And as I recall, the decision to depart from DePalma and head in the direction the films have gone is all Cruise's. The Tomato Meter gave MI4 a high rating; for what reason I do not know. They must have seen another film. There are so many better quality action films out there. Save yourself the 3 buck rental or Netflix spot on the queue; get the new Sherlock Holmes or Knight and Day, a far better Cruise movie; or I don't know, randomly select one; anything but MI4. In the words of Adrian Monk, the famous detective; 'you'll thank me later.'",5,1,4,28 July 2012
