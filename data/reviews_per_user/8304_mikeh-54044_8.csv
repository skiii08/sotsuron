Blade Runner 2049," Incomprehensible Collection of Murder, Violence, & Mumbles, Lacking Any Storyline or Characters to Care About
","How so many excellent actors can be assembled in one place and produce a result akin to fingernails on a chalkboard lasting an agonizing length of time just short of an ice age is bewildering! The artists who produced the effects get what little credit can be given to this cinematic disaster. I am amazed that anyone willingly identified themselves for this effort as: 'writer'. I would urge them to change their names, relocate to Patagonia, and hope to avoid the terrible vengeance of those who paid to see this mess. Ridley Scott clearly loaned only his name but none of his considerable talent to this project. How an aggregated score of more than '8' was awarded to this film requires explanation by IMDB. Enough said.",1,5,7,3 June 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Well Outside Mainstream for Star Wars
",These folks did not just miss the Star Wars boat... the whole fleet sailed without them. The Death Star again! There is nothing left to learn on this subject except why Stormtroopers always move at the trot. IMDb suggests a budget of $200mm. Clearly less than 1% spent on a script that makes any sense at all. Seems to consist of bits and pieces badly stapled together...with little plot or continuity from scene to scene. This is a shame...as...some of the characters had great promise. The director and producers need to remember for the future --script first! And ... you can steal a bit of money for that script from special effects,1,8,18,10 April 2017
Ready Player One," Imagination & Trivia ARE What Makes This Huge Fun!
","Why so much whining over trivia and nostalgia?. Why watch a movie if it is not fun, unexpected, and/or strange and wonderful? Most current movies show as much imagination as a box of rocks, and, are about as interesting. Just waiting for the references to old pop culture was great! For example, Merlin's spell from Excalilbur! Well Done Mr. Spielberg!",8,0,1,5 January 2019
The Favourite," Self Indulgence Replaces Telling the Audience a Story
","Most of the actual history is gotten right. VERY pretty. OK, that is the good news!Now the bad. It appears that for directors, writers, and producers that demonstrating 'artistry ', and how 'different ' THEIR picture is, trumps telling the audience a story that is interesting about people you can care about. I shudder to think what the result would be if this bunch got theeir hands on Homer's story of tthe Odyssey!",3,8,14,19 February 2019
1917," Much Overrated With An Unbelievable Story
","Cinematography very well done, and evocative of the Great War. The plot is, militarily pitiful. Time and again, choices and events - even for officers and men of the 'New Army' - are idiotic. Several times there are escapes from catastrophe that strain belief. The German landsers couldn't all be such terrible shots! Having paid to see it, we held on to the end.....not sure why.",4,0,2,3 April 2020
Jaws," Was This Movie EVER Good?
","OMG - truly dreadful, unlikely, and boring, even including the wind-up shark",2,1,17,16 May 2019
The Greatest Showman," Another Zombie Musical- All The Music & All The Songs In One Note
","Whatever happened to the great American art form - the musical? Is it that contemporary actors can't sing? Are songwriters simply devoid of imagination? How many songs of one note can be strung together until the audience begs for the end. One bright note: the dancing and choreography is ......... wonderful! That said, It isn't Rogers & Hammerstein.",3,3,4,5 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Cut To Pieces in the Commercial Release
","If you know and love the story, treat yourself to the Director's Cut. This presents the story as written - rather than the chopped-up mess released in theaters",10,1,3,24 March 2019
