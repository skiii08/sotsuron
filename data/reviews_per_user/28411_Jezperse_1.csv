The Benchwarmers," Silly but great
","Like with all Happy Madison productions (especially with Schneider in the lead), you know pretty much what you're up against. This movie is silly, its beyond silly. And thats also pretty much the charm of it. Its so absurdly silly that you cannot dislike the crude humor and the likable characters. Instead you will end up laughing out loud at all the weird, absurd and surreal things they've managed to squeeze into this movie. I'm not usually a big fan of the Sandler/Schneider-kind of comedies, so this would rank as the best one yet for me.This will never enter top 250 of IMDb of course, but with a current rating at 5.3 for a silly comedy of this kind, you gotta admit its quite above average.",9,0,0,12 July 2006
