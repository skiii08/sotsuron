Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An excellent table setter to the saga.
","Most critics miss this one. It is a well done adventure. The main players being identified and establishing a presence. The plot holes spoken of are understandable, Lucas knows he will be making two more parts to this trilogy and the gaps will be filled as it moves along. It is a tribute to a vision here that this is an effects driven story. It is a fantasy after all.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
