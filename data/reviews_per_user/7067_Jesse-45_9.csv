The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest flicks ever made!
","For me, this is one of the scariest films ever made. I've seen just about every horror film, and been scared by select fews, like Poltergeist, but this one ranks up there with Poltergeist, Jacob's Ladder and a few others. The fact there's no witch in sight is very clever, and also, the children sounds and such create genuinely spooky moments. The realism amazed me, the acting and cam-corder idea were incredibly real. This movie doesn't capture my love, like similar horror flicks like The Evil Dead series or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it has an often genuine horror feel, rarely like those, but its genuine horror all right, and in my opinion, it was one of the best horror films of the '90s.",Null,0,1,23 June 2000
Apocalypse Now," I love the smell of a great movie in the morning
","Martin Sheen on a mission to take out Kernel Kurtz played by Marlon Brando takes us down a very psychological and dark road . Or shall I say river threw the Vietnam war. Some great performances, great direction, great scenes, all add up to a great film. This film took three years to make including several problems in the making such as, Martin Sheen suffering from a heart attack, Francis Ford Coppola almost going insane himself losing 100 lbs. and filming not far from actual battles taking place. We all are greatfull to Francis Ford Coppola to delivering one hell of a film.",Null,0,0,11 January 2000
The Evil Dead," Horror Classic!
","Army Of Darkness was the first movie, I saw in the Evil Deadseries. I did not have any knowledge of it being a sequel at all. Until, I found out about the predecessors in Blockbuster's Guide To Movies & Videos. And I had to see thefilms that came out before one of my favorite comedies. Thefirst one I saw was Evil Dead 2. Funny as hell. And it's avery entertaining horror ride. Then I saw the original. I ownboth of the first, and I have the third one recorded. AndI watch them a lot. Especially the first two. This, the first one is now my favorite entry into the series. This is a horror classic that ranks very high, in my favorite horror movies list. I know so many people say it's one of they're favorites. But it's in no way, overrated. It contains some very, very gory scenes, that entertain the audience, very well. Sam Raimialso gave the his series, very entertaining and original cameraangles. If these camera angles were absent, the movie with be less a horror classic. Sam Raimi deserves all of the credit he's been receiving, for delivering his audience a horror classic. With a truly treaty plot for horror fans, like me!",Null,0,0,3 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Best movie of 1999!!
","In 1999, where commercial films were often disappointing and bad, Eyes Wide Shut brought so much more to the big-screen. The trailer was great. It didn't reveal very much at all. We watched the film, not knowing very many things at all. And that's the problem with movie previews now-a-days. They show way too much. Eyes Wide Shut didn't. And that's one of the things I loved about the movie.This was a very captivating movie. I felt like I was inside a film after viewing it. It was spectacular. The lighting and everything was masterful. Stanley Kubrick has made so many great movies...2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, The Shining and this flick is definitely no exception what so ever. He died as a filmmaker who made movies that were infamous.To continue the subject on Eyes Wide Shut alone, it was a masterpiece...his last great masterpiece. Tom Cruise's character just pulls the audience right in, and on the way, we move around in our seats to get comfortable and to feel safe, when we see him go off into these bizarre, creepy and mysterious incidents. We feel poignant for these characters, after what we've seen them go threw, in their real-life and dream-life adventures. I think one controversial element of the film is the fact in may be found extremely un-comfortable for some married couples.But one very thing that I find very disturbing about Kubrick's world. It's the lack of respect he has recieved. Through life. And even through death.",10,0,1,26 July 2000
Scream 2," Better than the first
","A lot of people think the first film is superior to this slasher sequel. But I think this one is better. The sophisticated-talking teens are back in Scream 2. Sidney and Randy, survivors from the original, are now in college, where we meet new characters. There's a new killer or killers out there, knocking off sophisticated-talking teen bye sophisticated-talking teen. There's more shocks in this entry, including Randy's death sequence and a sequence where a pipe goes right threw a cop's head. With scenes like these, I place it over it's original. But, we're use to non-sophisticated-talking teens in horror films, and I like those classics better. They were the standard slasher films.",Null,0,0,17 January 2000
Scream," A film that has spawned painful followers
","When I first saw this film, I loved it. But over the past 3 years I've become a more respectable horror fan, and I look at this movie as an extremely overrated horror flick, that has spawned silly rip-offs, including a Scream take on the Halloween franchise. Which I liked it first, with the return of Michael Myers, but it was one of the silly rip-offs of Scream, that should've gone it's own way. The Halloween series had a great image. But now it's looked at as Scream-like entity by many who love it. I respect Scream for it's reigniting the series. It's just unfortunate, filmmakers like Moustapha Akkad aren't taking advantage of the reignition, in their own highly respectable styles. Instead, their drowning the horror genre with the Scream-likeness. God give gifts to Chucky creator, Don Mancini for taking ' Bride Of Chucky ' in it's respectable style. Hopefully, the Scream followers will end soon, so we can have our Freddy, Jason and others back! Perhaps, Halloween : H2K will deliver a more respectable return for Michael Myers. We really need Michael back, the way he was!",3,1,4,5 January 2000
Halloween," Still the best of the series!
","In 1978, John Carpenter had brought to the horror world...Halloween. Which was actually supposed to be a sequel to the 1974 horror flick Black Christmas. But Halloween became a stand-alone film and often a film hailed as the best slasher film ever. Despite what some say, Psycho is actually, the film that probably started the whole slasher film craze. And then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kick-started it even more. So I wouldn't necessarily say Halloween started the slasher genre. But still, it's certainly often called the best.In my opinion the best slasher is Freddy, and the best slasher movie, A Nightmare On Elm Street. But Michael Myers is always a haunting image and his series a very infamous one.In Halloween, little Mikey, as well all know, slaughters his sis and ends up in a mental hospital. But he breaks out and heads for Haddonfield, Illinois to track down his second sister, Laurie Strode (who would later change her name to Kerie Tate.) Anyway, he picks up some victims on the way to stalking his second sis, and in the process, creating infamous horror moments, that will be zapped in our mines for our entire life.John Carpenter, who has created other great cinema spectacles, created a film with strong atmosphere, mood and of course, music. And the cast members do a great job. Jamie Lee Curtis really deserves the SCREAM QUEEN title. And all the Michael Myers performers did excellent. My ratings of the Halloween series  *****",10,0,0,9 June 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Slasher Classic!
","This film and it's greatly entertaining sequels have brought to horror movies, one of the most well-known and best titles around! When BLACK CHRISTMAS came out the same year as another great horror title, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, there was a following including such slasher opus' as JOHN CARPENTER'S HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH. A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET was quite a different slasher flick, not dealing with the common-slasher stalking about-concept. Wes Craven broke out incredibly effective chills, gore and an infamous slasher, Freddy, one of the greatest cinema villains of all time! The humor in the film is splendid. The special effects are magnificent and ofcourse they helped Freddy become what he is today. The ending is a curious one to many, but it's masterful! Bring on FREDDY VS. JASON!",Null,0,0,25 July 1999
Jurassic Park," Still my favorite film!
","In 1993, when Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' came out, it had become my favorite film of all time. And it remains that way. For me the film is still the best movie ever made. It captures the imagination alike 'Star Wars', '2001.' As well as grasping hold of the thrills of 'Jaws' and 'Alien.' The characters are such spectacular ones, filled with ENOUGH LIFE FOR ME AT LEAST, by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sir Richard Attenborough and Bob Peck. As well as the others in the cast. Its really a toss up for all the dino-action scenes in the film. Steven Spielberg grips our imaginations and takes us through a wild ride! For me any way, there are some very classic scenes. Many will agree, even though its unfortunate it seems so forgotten. Its CGI is still some of the best and for me AT LEAST, the CGI creates real, living creatures, just like in Jaws and Alien, not just dis-respectable names many people give it. Though the disappointment of the sequel, is the large quanity of missing cast members, it too is a classic wild ride through the very real dinosaurs of the world of Jurassic Park.",10,2,4,23 June 2000
