Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Give Lake Lloyd a break, already!
","I was not annoyed by Jake Lloyd's childish portrayal of Anikan. you know why? because that is exactly what I expected! He's a kid! of coarse he's not going to do it perfectly or to everyone's personal specifications. People Bad-mouthing Children actors have prevented really great movies Like The Mummy Returns and Star Wars: Episode One from getting the ratings they deserve. How would you feel if you did something you really put your heart into and somebody Bad-mouthed you and called you terrible just because it wasn't done the way they like it?This Movie was O.K. I liked it because it was the set up for the Starwars trilogy. I liked all the action, The lightsaber duels, and It was fun pointing out the similarities and plot holes which would undouptebly be explained later. I did not let Anikan or 'Jar Jar Binks' keep me from enjoying this movie. after all. if you don't like it, you can do something else: read a book, plant a tree, take a walk...",Null,0,1,13 June 2002
The Mummy," the sequel is Much Better.
","On the audio commentary by Stephen summers, he remarks that they're halfway into the movie and they have yet to re-introduce the title character, and he isn't even revived for another 20 minutes. A good chunk of this movie deals with them digging around an ancient city and discovering things. therefore, this movie gets a little boring, and actually, having seen the Mummy Returns FIRST, I was dissapointed on how Evelyn's character was portrayed in this Movie. In the Mummy Returns, she's a strong, sword-wielding Kick-ass who's able to take care of herself. in the Mummy, she's portrayed as a clumsy cliched damsel in distress. And with the Mummy Returns, the ending had me cheering in my seat, The Mummy left me saying 'oh WOW.' (heavy sarcasm here) There's even one line in this movie that sums it all up: 'rescue the Damsel in distress, Kill the Bad Guy, Save the world.'",Null,1,2,8 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Very heavy on the irony...I loved it!
","some of the lines in this film were laugh out loud funny! Obi-wan Kenobi: Anikan, why do I get the feeling you'll be the death of me?' Everyone in the theater laughed at that line. I enjoyed this Movie alot. Corusont was a lot like a futuristic Los Angeles, complete with a 50's style diner and cocktail waitresses! the car chase was very impressive, one of the most breathtakingly beautiful sequences in the whole saga. excitement started to grow in me, watching Anikan and Padme's romance blossom, because we were witnessing the begaining of the Skywalker Family, and hearing the imperial march again was a real treat. and it's just been confirmed that James Earl Jones will return in episode three as Darth Vader! I'm looking forward to it. I think that they should bring the original trilogy back to theaters when that happens, as well as release it on DVD. starwars deserves to be appreciated by a whole new generation",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," All right, I'll admit it...
","...The Romance between Anikan and Padme was Laughable. 'Sand if rough, unlike you.' and 'being around her is intoxicating'. the dialog IS horrible, but hey, the romance had to happen sometime. otherwise, where would Luke and Leia Come From?",Null,0,1,1 January 2003
