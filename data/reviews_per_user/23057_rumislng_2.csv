Ford v Ferrari," I feel it in every detail
","Absolutely wonderful, 'speedy' and heart touching movie.
I feel a race in every detail: from beautiful shots to the amazing sound of cars and the rest.
My palms are sweating on the turns.
Good acting, good characters and good story.
Yeah. I feel it. I feel this in every turn.",10,8,11,9 February 2020
Spider-Man 2," One of the best superhero movies ever
","When i was kid, i rewatched Sam Raimi's Spider-man so many times. I love all three movies, maybe third movie not so good like first two, but it doesnt matter.
The second my favourite.
15 years later and it's still best movie about spider-man. And absolutely and criminally low rating.
Good storyline, not only about a hero, but about Human. Alfred Molina so perfect like Doc Ock. Just amazing and beautiful soundtrack by Danny Elfman.
I love Toby. He is my Spider-Man.
And i like others movies about spider-man, but this movie.. Masterpiece. That's all.",10,2,2,6 February 2020
