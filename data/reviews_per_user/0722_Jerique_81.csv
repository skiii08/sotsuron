The King's Speech," The King's Speech ...Impediment?
","I'd had been told about The King's Speech for months on end. I was told by friends and people on the message boards of The Social Network, Inception and Black Swan that The King's Speech was a front runner for the Oscars...so finally, I saw the film.I'm going to say that this movie doesn't deserve the praise it gets. I mean, yeah, it's a good movie. It's not even one of the best ten on the year. But, it's not the best screenplay, it's not the best actor, it's not the best director and above all, it's not the best picture of the year.Tom Hooper's direction is average. Any director could have been at the helm and done this movie justice. Comparing this film to Inception, Inception was a director's movie. It deserved the best directing Oscar, but wasn't even nominated. David Fincher's directing of The Social Network was way better than Tom's.Colin Firth doesn't convince me as a) King George VI, and b) that he has a difficult time speaking. It seemed a bit too forced throughout the movie and it didn't look like he had a stutter, but was more so a mute trying to speak at times. Sean Penn in I Am Sam (2001) was more deserving of an Oscar. He convinced me that he was mentally challenged. Colin Firth wasn't convincing.I don't see how the screenplay for this was better than Inception. Both are original works, but I see Inception's screenplay better for the simple fact that anyone can relate to it. It's about dreams. The King's Speech will not appeal to everyone. Not all of the young generations are into a movie about history or the Royal family.Finally, I don't understand how this film took the Oscar as the best film of the year. I fully and truly believe Inception is the greatest film ever made and the best of the year. I don't think The King's Speech is better than The Social Network, Black Swan or even Scott Pilgrim vs the World. It didn't have as splendid cinematography, it's visual effects weren't as good, it's story relied solely on Colin's performance (which was under-handed) and the direction wasn't anything special. As a movie, it's great, but not the best.This is the classic film to show you just how awful the Academy is at picking their winners. It's an example of a film overpraised and overrated. It is not deserving of the awards it received. But, here we are, it won the four biggest awards.I enjoyed the comedy in the film provided by Geoffrey Rush and I certainly enjoyed Helena's performance. I was a bit annoyed at Colin's performance throughout the film, though.I think the worst part about this film is the audience it brings. My theatre was filled with people 30 and over, and a majority were well over 50 years of age. It was sad that a movie with seniors had two cell phones go off during the showing. The King's Speech is one more movie, much like Avatar, or The Godfather, that should (and will probably) be forgotten in years to come.",7,1,3,2 March 2011
Black Swan," A masterpiece for 2010...
","I will say this, Natalie Portman deserves her Golden Globe and (if she gets it) an Oscar too for her performance. I've been watching Natalie for years. I first came to notice her in Star Wars: A Phantom Menace, and have seen her become a serious actress with V for Vandetta and The Other Boleyn Girl.However, I wasn't inclined to see Black Swan because I thought she was a sure-fire candidate for a Golden Globe or Oscar. The fact she won surprised me, and thus with all the hype, I had to see the movie.Black Swan is an adaptation of the story 'Swan Lake.' Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers and her female opposite is Mila Kunis (from Family Guy and That 70's Show fame). They chose two actresses that look devastatingly alike and at times it's very hard to tell them apart. Nina gets the role of Swan Queen in the new Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) ballet of Swan Lake.Winona Ryder has a small cameo as the retired ballet lead Beth Macintyre, but takes a backseat to the plot of Kunis and Portman's rivalry. As far as cinematography goes, it's not the greatest of films...but it's not the worst. I sincerely hope it doesn't win Best Picture nor Best Cinematography at the Oscars. It's not that it doesn't deserve awards...it's just not the best of 2010 in my eyes.I did enjoy it a lot more than expected. I think the score is unbelievably great and the lighting does a great job of building a suspense in a few key scenes, but basically this is a showing of Portman's acting skills.It's got a lot of thrilling parts, almost like a horror, but it plays out as more of a drama. There is a sex scene that may not be suitable for anyone under 14. But, overall, it's quite an amazing film. Definitely a top five film for me for 2010. It's going to be one of the best films of all-time for me. Don't miss it.",9,2,5,25 January 2011
Source Code," Not the best of the year...so far...
","As my first film of 2011, Source Code ended up being as good as expected. It is not supposed to be a time-travel film. But, it plays like it at first. However, the difference between this movie and Back to the Future is that this movie has rules to explain whereas Back to the Future doesn't really.It opens already into the story which seems placed in present time, where Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on a train to Chicago as passenger Sean Fentress. He soon after dies after a bomb on the train kills everyone on board, and wakes up in a capsule looking at a screen of Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). She tells him what is supposed to do during his time using the program Source Code which is to find the bomber before the next destructive plan goes through.I liked the film's somewhat repetitive style that reminds me of Vantage Point, and although I've never seen Quantum Leap, I have a feeling this film was using a similar storyline from another film. It's a fresh thriller and I liked the way the story gradually plays out. It's not very hard to guess the predictable culprit in the small cast.My one problem with the film is how they establish rules and tell the audience (and Colter Stevens) that it's a program that uses memory and doesn't have the ability to alter reality nor time-travel, but then Colter Stevens figures out how to do exactly that in the end. It annoys me to know end if you establish rules for your movie, and then break them. It doesn't necessarily ruin the movie, but it makes it lose credibility.It won't be the best film of the year, but it might be one of the top ten for me when the year is over.",8,1,3,6 April 2011
Deja Vu," Denzel's most driven performance?
","I've seen countless Denzel movies. I've seen Training Day, Bone Collector, Fallen, etc. You take his best action flick and pit it against his best dramatic flick. It doesn't matter the genre, Denzel can't make a bad film. It doesn't matter the demand, Denzel's emotion exceeds your expectations.From most of his films, I've seen, Denzel plays some form of a federal agent or police officer. In this film, while Denzel shines with the rays of the sun, Adam Goldberg, Val Kilmer, James Caviezel, and Elden Henson also perform vigorously in supporting cast.I especially enjoy the fact that Denzel can go from antagonist Alonzo Harris (Training Day) to protagonist Detective John Hobbs (Fallen) to protagonist-antagonist John Archibald in John Q to this powerful performance of protagonist Doug Carlin. Then you have James Caviezel who can play a protagonist in Frequency (2000) to this antagonist.It's plot is something to behold, most of all. When it comes to time travel it's one of the top things to discuss about movies. When you finish (and even during in some cases) you can't help but talk about the dilemma of going back and changing something for better or worse.I know that it's fictional, but it's fantasy and I allow for it because at least the screenwriters have tried to connect realism to their storytelling. With the actors showcased, you can't help but be grabbed and dragged into this spellbinding tale about a hero.It's been four years since my first viewing of Deja Vu and yet this second viewing is better. After watching over two hundred films or more between the first and second viewing, I think it's hard to remember every little detail about the great masterpiece of cinema that it is.While it's rating is PG-13, I think that children should avoid this simply because it's disturbing and this is a type of film where you have to think while watching.",7,2,3,6 August 2010
Fight Club," You can watch this movie over and over and not get sick of it.
","The movie starts off with Edward Norton describing Tyler Durden's controlled demolition while he has a gun in his mouth. We flashback to find out how the film started off as it did.In the first thirty minutes of the film, I actually turned it off. I couldn't continue the movie and keep hearing Edward narrate so often, but it grew on me once I turned it back on.The Narrator (Edward Norton)'s apartment is mysteriously blown up, so he opts to stay with Tyler (Brad Pitt). This causes Tyler to meet Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a 'big tourist' who annoys The Narrator by existing. Tyler and Marla's relationship puts a strain on Edward's character. Tyler and The Narrator, who starts to refer to himself as Jack, begin a Fight Club, called 'Fight Club.' After it gets out of hand and becomes 'Project Mayhem,' the Narrator attempts to put an end to it all, but fails to do so, and finds out that Tyler is more clever than he initially thought. Tyler has involved city police and has them in his pocket. 'Jack' has no escape and is forced to go through with Tyler's plan.The casting is well-done. Helena has great chemistry with both Pitt and Norton. Norton and Pitt seem like best friends. The story itself grips you and leaves you shocked. The cameos and special effects are wonderful too. Altogether, the movie is amazing and I've over watched it but it still sends chills up my spine and I still can't seem to place it in a specific genre.If you like the movie, you'll love the novel it is based on. The movie will keep you interested until the last frame. I recommend this one to everyone mature enough.",9,1,3,10 January 2009
Iron Man 2," Goes Beyond the Original
","What can I say? Jon Favreau can never disappoint. Whether he's funny as an actor or artistic as a director. He's a master of his craft and definitely found his niche. He's an amazing director, with an uncanny ability to cameo in his own movies as a great comic relief.Robert Downey Jr., is an actor I've been watching for years. From being sweet and hilarious in Heart and Souls, to sarcastic and witty with an edge of drama in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to perfecting his ability in playing Tony Stark. Robert is versatile and can go beyond some of the other great actors.Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect female to play Pepper Potts, as seen in the first film. She's funny, she's brainy, and she's sexy. She's got a beautiful face to look at and a sweet voice to hear. Her character, Pepper, takes a backseat for screen time to make room for others, but she still plays a prominent role in Iron Man's future.Samuel L. Jackson, gets a small cameo and Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as a really sexy, seductive, ass-kicking seductress who bounds to keep both Tony Stark and audiences on their toes. Don Cheadle comes along as well to play sidekick and Mickey Rourke is chilling and terrifying as villain Ivan Vanko.There's mind blowing special effects, triple the intense action sequences and give just the perfect amount of comic relief and you've got a sequel that does ten times better than the original. It's not surprising. Iron Man, wasn't bad by any means, but it just feels inferior to this. I can't imagine how it will seem when the third chapter is unveiled.Strap yourself in for a roller coaster ride of a lifetime. It's fun, it's dark, it's full of surprise and it's action packed. It's a great film for everyone. Grab grandma, grab your friends and let's go see Iron Man 2!",9,7,14,12 May 2010
Argo," Another Affleck Masterpiece...
","It's not a surprise to once again see Ben shine through his directing, acting and in his producing give his audience such attention to detail. Ben gives a performance of a lifetime in Argo, and he definitely is the best actor to see in the film.Ben's attention to detail and his casting director have made this film incredibly accurate. Despite the fact that portions of the film are dramatized for entertainment purposes, I find the film not only informative but brutally full of suspense. I say brutally because some points I was holding my girlfriend's hand very tight and I had white knuckles out of fear for what might happen to these characters.The film plays out a story about six American diplomats trapped in Tehran, and in hiding for 444 days. The U.S. comes up with plans to get them out, but Tony (Ben Affleck) doesn't have good feelings about any of them. Finally, he's inspired to pretend to make a Canadian movie in Tehran to get them out under the guise of them being film crew.I understand that there some inaccuracies and it's to be expected but I still stand by saying that it's a highly accurate film. Many films out there based on or inspired by true stories take liberty and dramatize things for entertainment purposes.I enjoyed the acting from everyone in the movie, not just Ben. But all of the American diplomats had great development and some scenes with them seemed genuine and not even as if they were acting. I really enjoyed both Goodman and Arkin, and they give a lot of star power with their acting. I wasn't surprised that Bryan Cranston had involvement but I was wondering why he wasn't offered a bigger role since he can definitely handle himself.Most of the time period stuff seems on par, and all the history seems to be top notch. I really enjoyed the flakes of comedy that showed here and there throughout the film such as the one-line catch phrase said by Ben, Alan and John.Met with so much drama, inspiration to many, and topping it off with strong suspense, Argo is a film that is a memorable one to be viewed for a long time because it's an instant classic. Argo depicts many people of different nationalities as saviors, and heroic. That's something everyone can enjoy while watching this movie.Argo is one of those films from 2012 that should be on everyone's 'do not miss it in theaters' list. It's truly one of the top movies of the year and certainly one of the best in that last few years. I'd go as far to say that objectively, this is Ben's best work acting and directing wise.",9,3,6,11 November 2012
Beauty and the Beast," Lovely Disney film!
","While The Little Mermaid takes my number one spot on favourite Disney animated films, Beauty and the Beast is a close second. Jodi Benson has a beautiful voice as Ariel and Page O'Hara is just as incredible as Belle.What makes me love Beauty and the Beast so much is not the musical aspect, although Howard Ashman's lyrics are genuine and Alan Menken's scores are some of my favourite, beside Danny Elfman, it's the plot of Beauty and the Beast that wins my heart.Beauty and the Beast is a typical story of the ugly duckling (Beast) winning the affections of the beauty (Belle). While in most cases back in the day, the roles were reversed and it would be Belle who was unattractive winning the heart of a handsome prince. In these modern times, it's so rare to see a beautiful girl with an average looking or under-average looking guy.Disney goes beyond the normal lengths of this basic premise and really touches our hearts. Belle comes to love the Beast's inner beauty. Sure, it's not realistic as a beast like a bear cannot speak, nor could a human fall in love with an animal. I put aside the realism need I have, and just enjoy the film for it's entertainment purposes.Musically, this is my top film from Disney. It's not Page O'Hara alone that wins me over, but it's the entire cast. Alan Menken is my second favourite composer and each one of his film scores are different. Aladdin and Mermaid aren't anything alike, but it's by him. Howard's lyrics are unforgettable. I think the great part of Beauty and the Beast, musically, is that out of ninety minutes of film, eighty-five minutes have some form of music in it.Aside from plot and music, Beauty and the Beast is well-crafted animation-wise. It's so perfect and gives me chills at certain moments. I love to listen to the soundtrack, but when I watch the film, I get all tingly. Angela Landsbury's performance is outstanding, my favourite scene has got to be the transformation. It's depressing and lovely. It's a hauntingly beautiful and tragic scene that lifts your spirits when the fireworks kick in.It's a great film for the family, especially the kids. It's not just for kids, though, because at the age of 21, I'm giving it an eight out of ten and I still love it to this day and I still listen to the soundtrack all the time. Disney is meant for everyone. Beauty and the Beast is a classic and will never be forgotten.",8,1,1,28 July 2010
The Girl Next Door," If only it could happen...
","Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is unable to come up with something that he'll remember when he graduates from high school. He unexpectedly meets a stunning girl named Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) who moves in next door. After a night on the town together, Danielle and Matt start to hang out. Matt begins to cut class for her. While at a party, Matt makes his move and they have their first kiss.Matt finds out from his friend Eli (Chris Marquette) that she is an ex-porn star. Eli advises him to take her to a motel and 'bang her like a beast.' Reluctantly, Matt does so and it all blows up in his face and she breaks up with him. Matt puts her before Georgetown, his parents, his friends and his future. Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) is not gonna lose her without a fight and Matt's friends aren't willing to give up either.The movie has raunchy comedy but teens and most adults will enjoy the film. The casting is well-done and the plot is interesting. The realism of the porn industry is done incredibly. The romance is a sub-plot on paper, but in the film it comes out as the most important aspect. The very inspiring characters take you for an awesome ride with fun and laughter and some tears mixed in too.",7,0,0,12 January 2009
"I Love You, Man"," I hated it, man.
","I'm a huge fan of Paul Rudd and I thought Jason Segel was going to anchor this film's comedy force, but honestly, I found myself hoping it would end sooner by time it marked sixty minutes.Comedy you see in the trailers is pretty much the only comedy in the movie. It seems Paul Rudd either improvised his lines in this, similar to his roles in Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin and the like. I couldn't stop cringing at how unfunny he was in this latest role.Jason Segel was the only person who had any sort of comedic lines, and there wasn't many, aside from the trailer shown clips. My biggest laugh was 'This is my nightmare' seen in the trailer(s). I can't even begin to describe how terrible Zooey Rice is. Zooey is perhaps the worst fiancée in history. She flips out on Peter (Rudd) multiple times because of Sydney (Segel) and how their friendship is building.I nearly turned off this movie at the mark when you think 'well maybe they won't get married.' It was very difficult for me to get to the credits and when I finally did, I was happy that it was over. The title of the film is not quoted till the very end and it doesn't give you any everlasting effect.I seriously hope Rudd's next film has a better comedic role for him because if it doesn't make me laugh, I will start losing faith in his comedies. Maybe he should stick to Judd Apatow.",4,2,4,25 November 2009
Orphan," Chilling to the Bone
","What if the child you adopted was trying to kill you, or your family? That's quite a big thing. This film brings that fear to life. When seemingly innocent Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is adopted by Kate (Farmiga) and John (Sarsgaard), things start to go wrong with the family. Kate doesn't buy into Esther's innocence, but everyone else turns on Kate when Esther dupes and silences the people around her.I've seen Vera Farmiga in numerous films before, specifically, The Departed and Running Scared. I'm not a huge fan of hers, but she was quite astounding in this as Kate. I've seen Peter Sarsgaard in a few films as well and was mesmerized by his performance in Shattered Glass and he definitely stands out to me now. I'd never seen Isabelle Fuhrman before either. I'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but I was surprised by Isabelle's portrayal.As it comes to the story, it's rather frightening, as is Esther's character. I kept feeling a lot of empathy towards Max (the daughter of Kate and John) and Daniel (the son). Max continuously gets duped into helping Esther do horrible things and keeps witnessing the evil that surrounds her. It really chills you to your bone and shivers your spine.I really felt for all the characters, regardless of not having children, and really grew to disdain Esther. I predicted her intentions early on, but in no way guessed correctly who she really was. It's a really suspenseful film and one that takes children to a whole new level of maturity (and I'm not just talking about Esther's actions in the film).I think what really stands out is the realism of the film and how far the writers pushed the boundaries. It goes over the top sometimes, but I think it's still realistic as far as how Esther is able to get away with things and solidify herself against Kate. I'm glad I was able to predict John's character at the end but was wrong about some things in the film. I like to be surprised once in awhile with some films. This one caught me off guard a few times. It was really great.Because of the sexuality, language, violence and mature themes of the film I cannot recommend this to anyone under 18. Even if you're a mature 16-year old, I'd advise you to ask your parents to watch it with you. It's quite enjoyable if you're mature enough. I only had a dislike for the Hollywood ending. Otherwise, you'll enjoy the film.",9,1,2,20 September 2010
Home Alone," Better than Ebert thinks...
","Home Alone is a nostalgic film for me, having watched it religiously when I was a young kid growing up. Roger Ebert gave this film a 2.5 out of 4. He calls the film unrealistic and says that it goes in another direction from the original premise.Home Alone plays on the scary scenario every kid fears at some point in their life. Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten at home in Chicago when his family rushes off to the airport for their trip to Paris. Soon after, Kevin is visited by home invaders Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) and it's up to him to stop them.Ebert complains that this film deviates from the main premise and simply brings in stunt doubles and fills the film with wacky traps that would otherwise cost the McCallister's tens of thousands of dollars to accomplish what Kevin does. While this is not far from the true, you're supposed to suspend some disbelief when watching this.I enjoy Home Alone because an 8-year old handles two grown up burglars. I don't enjoy watching people getting hurt, but I think in this case, there is an exception. The moral of the story is that even when you're young, you can still be responsible and handle your home from being invaded. It shows that it's wrong to rob people and that even children can be heroes.However, I find that the sequel is much better than this and it's due to the far superior story setup. Kevin being left home alone was a great initial start and opening up to the opportunity of a follow up story.To review this film without the mention of Macaulay's acting is a crime. Macaulay portrays Kevin with amazing talent and it's great for the simple fact that the 90s weren't really big for their child actors as far as I can remember. Macaulay is able to hit all ends of the acting spectrum showing being scared, showing emotion, and showing confidence and hilarious comedic relief, too. He was a great actor and I was sad to only see a few of his films before he retired.Another great point about Home Alone being a cult classic is the musical score provided by legendary John Williams. He gives the film the final emotional touch that allows us to forever remember Home Alone as being a classic film and never forget Macaulay's performance. Somewhere in My Memory has always been a favourite track of mine by Williams and it's just a great piece of music on top of a great film.This film is a classic for me, and I would never say that this isn't a wonderful film, despite being a tad bit unrealistic. But, the fact is, most films exaggerate and force you to suspend disbelief. Don't allow for this film not to be a favourite because you don't think this sort of thing could happen.",8,7,8,7 April 2011
Terminator Salvation," Finally a Terminator film showing the future.
","The year is 2018 and the war between machines and humans rages on. John Connor (Christian Bale) is not yet in full command of the resistance, but he is an invaluable part of it. It comes to Connor's knowledge that he is no longer the primary target, he is secondary. Skynet's chosen to terminate John's father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), before he can be sent back in time.Great casting, directing, action sequences, special effects and visual effects and make-up make this film everlasting. Sam Worthington and Helena Bonham Carter do an excellent job in their supporting roles. I especially like the music, provided by my favourite composer, Danny Elfman.It's full of action throughout and finally, for the die-hard fans, we get to see the future. Previously, Skynet has always sent Terminators back in time, but now we see the future and most importantly, the war itself. Hunter Killers, Terminator 600's, 800's, and more. The special effects are incredible and it's fun to watch.The mature themes make this movie suited to an older audience, however. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 14, for the language, the violence and the gore. Any Terminator fans, please check out this one! It's surely the second best of the series.",8,6,11,23 November 2009
Spider-Man 3," Awful adaptation, worse sequel!
","A truckload of insults will be thrust in this review toward Spider-Man 3. As an avid fan of the television show years ago, in the 90's, and as a big fan of the comic books, I can safely say this film failed on truly showing and grasping many aspects of Peter's rise and fall with relation to Venom.Topher Grace wasn't terrible as Eddie Brock/Venom, but he wasn't the right build. As far as the comic books, video games and TV shows go, Spider-man is agile and quick whereas Venom is violent and powerful. Eddie Brock in Spider-Man 3 is near the same size as Peter Parker. I'm not convinced he can overpower Spider-Man in his Venom form.Spider-Man 3 interweaves too much for the viewer to concentrate on. There's a love triangle between Mary Jane, Peter and Harry. There's another one between Peter, Eddie and Gwen. There's another one between Peter, Gwen and Mary Jane. Throw in The Sandman's story and then make Eddie Brock turn into Venom, unconvincingly, and now let's make Harry turn into the Green Goblin. It's too much story and only about 10 minutes of action.You can't make this movie into a tag-team match and hope everyone will love it. Venom being killed off so quickly and with such ease was a big reason for this movie being such a terrible piece of film. Venom is a principle character in the Spider-Man chronicles and Venom is the most popular villain for Spider-Man.Venom never spoke in the first person, singular. He spoke in first person, plural. Venom always spoke as himself saying, 'we know about you, Spider-Man.' In the film, he spoke in the singular first person, and he spoke without the symbiote on his face. I don't mind watching Topher's acting abilities of being 'the bad guy' but Venome always spoke with his true face.Kirsten Dunst has lost so much face with audiences and in this one, she feels more like a secondary character. As well, she should since we have four super heroes/villains taking up the majority of screen-time.It's really a shame that Sam Raimi couldn't repeat his amazing level of adaptation he did in the first two films for this one. It would have been wonderful to see him really put on a great show.Fans of the comic books and TV show (and even the video games) will not like this instalment of Spider-Man and I don't know the ones who haven't read the comic books or watched the show could enjoy this one.Peter spends too much time being a total ass, Mary Jane spends too much time pining over Harry while still 'loving' Peter, and the rest of the cast suck up the screen time pointlessly.I suggest you grab Spider-Man 1 or 2 and re-watch them because you're just wasting your time on Spider-Man 3. Skip it.",2,2,5,7 April 2010
The Terminator," Cameron's worst movie? Perhaps.
","Terminator is relatively slow for the first 20 minutes. We are quickly introduced to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She seems like a nobody (which she pretty much is for the most part - aside from birthing her son).The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) searches for her since there seems to be quite a few of Sarah Connor's. After finally finding the correct one, he goes on the chase and Sarah tries to hide figuring that she could be killed if found.Meanwhile, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) shows up from the future. He explains the Terminator is also from the future and is a cybernetic organism. He explains that Sarah's not-born-yet son John Connor is the leader of the rebel army to face the machines. Sarah and Kyle fall in love, somehow, quickly and show it by having sex. Sarah gets pregnant and survives the Terminator attack (this really isn't a spoiler since there is two sequels).Now, at this point you are probably wondering why I titled it as I did. Sure, it sounds interesting. But, Back To The Future makes sense. This is just ridiculous. A guy comes from the future and has a kid with a woman. Think about it. Doesn't that sound over the top? It will continue to happen the same way, thats how time traveling works.The story, however, is not the worst part of the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger says nearly zero lines. The make-up effects were just dreadful and then you have the special effects. I think for the most part the special effects were dormant. 1977, we saw some amazing special and visual effects from Star Wars. Seven years later, this trash comes out.It was tolerable up till the last 20 minutes. The skeleton was shown and instead of looking scary and realistic, it looked like stop frame animation from Nightmare Before Christmas. I laughed when I first saw this and I was thinking to myself: 'Linda must have hated this part.' It's like running away from air, and screaming at nothing. Must have been difficult to portray. The sequel definitely beats the original by a long shot. The good news about this movie is: James Cameron's career was not ruined by it, thankfully. Titanic, Terminator II, and Aliens all kept it alive.If you are a die-hard Terminator fan or Arnold fan, you'll watch this just for the fact of watching it. But if you're any fraction like me, you won't enjoy it and it will probably never grace your DVD/VCR ever again - unless you have a Terminator marathon.",1,15,112,30 October 2007
Cloverfield," Blair Witch Meets War of the Worlds!
","For many people this is an avoided movie for the fact that the style of filming can create motion sickness. The film is shot with a perspective view of one of the characters trying to do a documentary. You get a first-person view of Hud (T.J. Miller)'s seeing.The film starts off quite boring and remains so for approximately twenty minutes. You are introduced to Hud, Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), his brother Jason (Mike Vogel), Hud's love interest Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), and Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman), and very quickly you catch on there's something between Beth and Rob. After Beth leaves with her date, Rob, Jason and Hud talk on the balcony until something like an earthquake abruptly stops them.As everyone evacuates the building, the statue of liberty's head glides down the street right in front of the camera and Hud. Briefly seen is a monster -the monster- who caused it. As Rob tries to get to Beth to save her, tiny monsters attack multiple people, Hud continues to record the crazed journey and the roller coaster ride takes you for all you got.Overall the movie is well casted, regardless that the cast is primarily unknown actors. The special effects are wonderful and the filming makes you really feel apart of the flick. The romance and comedy are great blankets that keep you tucked from the horror of the monster(s) and everything else has you on the edge of your seat just wondering what will happen next. The end of the film will ultimately leave you breathless and confused, but you will still enjoy what you saw.With the monsters having a theme that fits War of the Worlds (2005) and the filming aspect being similar to Blair Witch Project (1999) the film gives you at least a little chunk of entertainment. You won't regret seeing the film if you can survive the possible nausea. If you did enjoy the film, hopefully you're on board for the sequel.",8,2,4,10 January 2009
The Expendables," Violent!
","I'm going to agree with Stallone when he told Jean-Claude Van Damme that this movie is violent. Smack Shoot Em' Up and Sin City's violence together and throw in a wacky storyline of save-the-girl campaign and you got The Expendables.I've never seen such a violent action film. You watch a movie like Salt or Knight and Day and you think, 'awesome action packed movie.' Not the case here. The Expendables has substance in the plot, and the action is off the charts...but quite honestly horrific in some aspects. Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) is a knife expert and he doesn't just kill people by stabbing them. When Christmas kills, he throws the knife into their neck and the blood gushes out and flows like a canal.Barney Ross (Stallone) has a violent streak too, sometimes he uses knives and it's grotesque. Sometimes he uses shotguns or his fists and pulverizes his opponents' face into nothingness. Or perhaps, he'll blow the dude's head off. It's extremely violent to say the least.I'm not complaining in any way, but perhaps people who are used to the kind of action similar to Mission Impossible, Bourne Identity, and the like, will find this movie's action to be a little too much gore. If you have a weak stomach and you don't like the Saw films gory stuff, I'd suggest stay away from The Expendables.I was quite disappointed that Schwarzenegger and Willis were only given approximately four minutes of screen time. I was hoping to see them in action, but I guess those days are gone, especially with Arnold being governor.As a plot, the movie has barely anything. It has enough to get the movie started and the action rolling and keep coming. However, basically the first fifteen minutes of the movie set the tone for how the movie will play out. Basically, you get twenty minutes of drama and story and an hour and twenty minutes of action.Special effects aren't bad either and it's quite an awesome flick if you can get passed the gore. All the characters are cool and all have a nice back story and development.I would recommend this to anyone who can sit through an insurmountable amounts of gore. If you can't, then you probably won't like this movie very much. I cannot wait for The Expendables II. Should be just as great.",8,3,10,24 August 2010
Megamind," 'You're fun.' - Hilarious movie!
","Megamind is probably the best animated movie of 2010.Will Farrell plays the villain, Megamind and tells the story from near the ending and flashes back to how the story begins. I was surprised at this movie because of the amount of comedy that genuinely made me laugh out loud a lot. This movie went beyond my expectations, which was also surprising since I had a feeling it would be like Due Date and be a letdown.I won't say it's predictable, because for the most part it's not. Jonah Hill is basically the opposite of Farrell for the most of the movie. Tina Fey does a great job allowing for romance and comedy to be put on the screen while Farrell brings out a lot of comedy. Minion (played by David Cross) is quite a funny character too. I immediately realized it was David Cross after a couple lines.It's a cute movie for all the romance and it's great for kids too. It's great for adults as well. I like the reference of Superman and Batman and I liked the premise of Megamind being Lex Luthor.It's got a lot of great animation and comedic timing. I really liked the way they animated Jonah Hill to look dangerous and scary at certain points of the film. I liked the movie a lot and I would rate it as being one of the best of the year.",9,7,7,3 April 2011
The Town," I'll see you again...
","I was wrong about Ben Affleck. I never believed that Affleck was ever a star. I never saw him as a director-type. I do admit I was wrong, though. Ben Affleck was truly incredible as Doug McCray, and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes, it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.Jeremy Renner is quite intimidating and Blake Lively is sexy, Ben Affleck is gripping and the supporting cast is incredibly powerful. I think the movie was powerful and not at all predictable. I couldn't wait to see what would happen and if Doug would get away. It's such a greatly crafted movie. From writing to acting this film is wickedly astounding.I thought that the sex scene was over too quickly, but it was made up with all the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the chase scenes. I thought the action sequences were well-drawn out. I loved the bank robbery scenes of the blue masks and the nun outfits. I especially liked Ben's scenes with the sledge hammer and the scene where he says, 'if I think anything might happen to her, I'm gonna kill both of you.' It's a clip from the trailer, but it's so much better when it happens in the film.It's driven as an action film with drama and romance on the side. There's a few chuckles along the way, but pretty much sparse. I thought the romance was done just enough and I felt the drama was perfectly done and drastically added to the plot, as well as the tone of the film.It's certainly the best heist movie I've ever seen. In comparison, if you called Inception a heist movie, this movie is a better heist movie. I really think this is the Heat of the decade. I truly believe that Affleck is in his peek of his career and this is his greatest performance, directing, writing and acting. I'm overjoyed and excited to see his next piece of work.",9,248,387,18 September 2010
Shutter Island," Leonardo shines!
","This is Leo's best performance on the year. I didn't see this movie when it came out but I saw Inception. I loved Inception and although, I thought he was tremendous in the film, he is far better here.Shutter Island takes you on a tale of two Federal Marshals who visit a Shutter Island because a woman escapes the mental institute. Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) and Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) go to investigate the area for the missing person.However, this movie plays a lot like A Beautiful Mind where a lot weird things start to happen and we as an audience and the main character start to believe this given world as ludicrous as it seems. Well, that's the genius in the movie, really. All these things happen and we believe them and in the climax of the film, they are all brought to us in a big connecting answer and we take that at face value too. It's the brilliance of the screen writing that does it.But, I'm not going to miss on giving credit where it's due. Ben Kingsley plays a prominent role in being the reliable source for the movie as the doctor on Shutter Island. He provides a good grounding for the film and he is the main audience character. Michelle Williams, although I've only seen her in Dawson's Creek, does a good job of making us ask during every scene she is in: 'what is going on?' Perhaps in his best role to date, Leonardo shines at all times. He plays the lead role and is mesmerizing from start to finish, and especially in the climax of the film, he truly seems like he is the character and not just simply acting.My only flaw with this film was the slow pacing of the first 25 minutes or so. It takes quite a bit for the two main leads to tell the audience why they are really there on Shutter Island. I was questioning what the movie was really about up to that point. Once it was said, the movie took off at a faster pacing and it didn't let up.It's definitely a disturbing film without being filled with gore like Saw, or profanity, or themes or scares like Nightmare on Elm Street, but it's disturbing in the sense that this gets under your skin. It eats at you and if you watch this at night in darkness, I guarantee you'll turn on all the lights afterward. It's one of those movies that you just feel the need to relax your mind after it is over.I'm happy I finally watched the movie because it is truly one of the best on the year. It was a great psychological thriller (without needing the thrilling aspect) and I'm glad that Martin and Leo collaborated again and I can't wait to see the next film of theirs. Leonardo is quickly becoming my favourite actor. He's getting better and better; he's like a fine wine.",9,0,2,24 March 2011
Tangled," Wonderfully Cute!
","In the last few days of 2010, I got to see one more final movie and seal the deal on what I think is the best year of movies in over a decade. It was Tangled! I'd see the trailer of the re-imaging of this particular fairytale and thought it'd be cute with the comedic 'she's been grounded...like... forever.' I was also drawn to Tangled for the reason of being a big Mandy Moore fan. However, I did not expect it to be a musical nor to have Alan Menken (a top favourite composer of mine) to be the film's composer.Beyond being a great score with a few catchy tunes, I did find myself getting annoyed whenever Rapunzel (Moore) would break into song. It was great at first and Donna Murphy's 'Mother Knows Best' song was great too. But after that, I was kinda hoping for just a regular movie. It was timed great and the animation worked really well to create the horse Maximus and the chameleon Pascal into comedic roles without speaking.Throughout the entire film, there was not one point where I was disappointed in it or felt that it was awful. I thought the rating of the film was perfect because although it's a kid's film, some of the romance is more aimed for teens and an older audience than a six year old. It's a great film for the year and I think it's one of the best animated films ever to be created. I highly recommend this one.",9,11,14,28 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An disastrous end to messed up trilogy.
","This film -- and trilogy, as a whole -- is really a giant mess. Abrams brought in new villains and hereos while basically trying to do a carbon copy of A New Hope with the Force Awakens. Questions about Rey continued to pile and Snoke as well, who was seemingly as powerful as Palpatine. After Johnson made his own film in the trilogy, in comes this film to say Return of the Jedi and what Vader did was all for nothing.Palpatine is alive and has amassed a giant fleet of star destroyers with capabilities of destroying planets. What feels illogical is that he's been around controlling everything from Snoke to Ren all the while building up a Sith army. What is worse is that no one is shocked by the discovery that he is still present. In this film, we follow Poe, Rey and Finn go on a journey of what feels like a video game mission of completing specific quests. C3PO holds information of the former-Emperor's whereabouts. But his programming forbids talking in Sith code. In order to do so, we gotta reset him but we gotta go to a specific system to find a up-and-coming toy Disney can merchandise to do that.After all the clues, battles, and badly done action sequences, Rey confronts Palpatine and it's very underwhelming. It has the feel that all this is doing is making Rey out to be the most powerful Jedi. Like more than Yoda or Anakin. But this whole saga was supposed to be about the Skywalker family. More specifically, the chosen one (Anakin) would bring balance to the force. A child who had a higher midichlorian count than Yoda. But forget all that. Rey can defeat Palpatine and it feels like Harry killing Voldemort and all Horcuxes have now been destroyed.There is no defining moment in Rise of Skywalker anyone will be able to bring up later 5,10, 30 years from now because this isn't the type of movie. Characters are thrownaway, reduced screen time, reduced dialogue and it all feels cluttered up still. There's no direction and no connecting story to follow. Light saber battles are at a premium and the film merely feels like one long marketing commercial for new toys and kitchen accessories.If I knew at the start of the decade that these three films were how they'd finish off the story of Skywalker, I would have skipped all of them. Hardcore fans and new young fans get a few seconds here and there for nostalgia peppered throughout the film(s). But this is not a good film in the saga. It leaves no lasting appeal to flock back to.",4,7,12,28 January 2020
Armageddon," You don't want to miss this one.
","Armageddon is one of the most acclaimed films of all time and not because of how great or entertaining it is. It's because it's a film premise that can be easily related to. You can feel and sympathize with each and every character.It's got a huge ensemble cast of A-list actors anchored by Bruce Willis. I know that Bruce Willis is the lead protagonist in the film and receives most screen time and thus, probably most praise. However, I believe, Billy Bob Thornton and William Fichtner really shine most of all. Thornton is not really known for dramatic roles and when it comes to this film, he knows what he's doing almost as good as Tom Hanks. William Fichtner is a favorite of mine because I've seen him in so many roles now and I still can't get passed this performance as it's so mesmerizing.It's not just those three top list actors either, though they powerfully show their intense passion for acting, but also there's the likes of Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Michael Clark Duncan, and many many more. It's a ensemble cast, I think, which only amplifies this movie's powerful inspirational premise.As the movie begins, Dan Truman (Thornton) and the rest of NASA find out they have 18 days before an asteroid the size of Texas will destroy Earth and all mankind. It's up to NASA to train Harry Stamper (Willis) and his crew along with Colonel Sharp (Fichtner) to drill a hole, drop a nuke and save the world.As the movie progresses, there's a friction between A.J. (Affleck) and Harry about Harry's daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler) and A.J.'s relationship. Bonds between Harry and Truman form, and all the while you begin to hate General Kimsey (Keith David) as he's not helping the already chaotic situation.At the time of the film's release, Armageddon was one of the highest grossing films and a very high budgeted film. It also boasts some of the most amazing special effects and visual effects to boot. As a tear jerking film, the only downfall to the film is all the factual, geographical and continuity errors. But if you're looking passed the errors to see the film for it's entertainment and not pedantic reasoning, you will enjoy Armageddon.It's known as one of the most epic disaster films of all time along with The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. It's no wonder why Michael Bay is known for his high-action, fast-paced blockbusters nowadays when you see Armageddon as basically his proving ground. It's a great film for all audiences and should not be missed.",9,0,2,10 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Well-crafted adaptation!
","As a fan of the books, first and foremost, I've been displeased with the film series of Harry Potter since 'Prisoner.' However, I believe David Yates and, more importantly, Steve Kloves have redeemed themselves on this one.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part I) follows the book closely. It is very well-crafted. It omits very little, and changes almost nothing. What does get changed or adjusted for time constraints is for the better. I disliked the omitting of Dudley's sentimental words to Harry as the Dursley's depart. However, a change I liked was the fast-paced editing and cutting of scenes. It doesn't feel as long as it does in the book. Much of the scenes that felt like they dragged on in the novel, went along very quickly and smoothly.A majority of the comedy really works well. My theatre was roaring for a lot of the film. I think that the film's got a lot of awkward comedy this time around. Perhaps the opening scene with the 'seven Potters' is what sets the tone for the comedic relief. It relieves a lot of the tension (which is a lot) throughout the film.Perhaps one of the greatest feats in this film is the use of special and visual effects. It really improves on the frequency and the level of use(s) seen in 'Order.' As far as the films are concerned, I believe this one is the best one in the effects departments. However, it's still not much to sneeze at in the grand scheme of things.Regardless of if you're a book or film fan, Harry Potter 7 (Part I) is a great film and it shouldn't be missed. In addition, Part II is going to be greatly anticipated.",8,1,2,20 November 2010
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," You are terminated! (The series? Definitely)
","Arnold Schwarzenegger comes back again as the good guy this time facing an even more powerful opponent, the T-X (Kristanna Loken).John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now an adult and its now the time of the machines beginning to take over. Judgment Day is just a day or two ahead when the movie starts.John Connor's second-in-command and wife, Kate Brewster (Claire Daines), is called into work early morning and meets John Connor (again) because he has stolen pills.Not very long after, the T-X shows up. More than just built to destroy, she is also very seductive and incredibly attractive. She is clever and adapts to her surroundings. It's hard to care about Kate, John or Arnold when Kristanna Loken is on screen.Linda Hamilton and James Cameron are both absent. Sarah has been killed off and Jonathan Mostow (U-571) has taken over directing. Generic writers have taken the writing over. Earl Boen is the only one who has returned aside from Arnold.The action was still great but the story was less interesting than the second film. It seemed they ran out of ideas. The special effects were phenomenal. It took upward ten months for a ten second shot to be captured. The stunts are stunning to watch and the CGI is hard to tell if it's real or fake.After watching behind the scenes you are shocked to find out what was real and what was fake. A few laughs here and there, some cool effects, great stunts, edge-of-your-seat action packed and a super attractive Terminatrix are the reason to not miss this one.Die-hard Terminator fans will be disappointed because it's not as great as part two but will still like it to an extent. Arnold fans, he's still funny and does another great job. But, I think that the series is mainly done. Even if they come out with a fourth part in 2009, I think this is over.",7,1,2,30 October 2007
U-571," Greatest War Cinema Experience!
","What is it that makes U-571 stand out amongst war movies such as Behind Enemy Lines, Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor? Is it perhaps, the ensemble cast of top names such as Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel? Is it the production design of the submarine ships themselves? Is it the lighting and cinematography? Or is it the gripping tale of the United States Navy securing the German Enigma? It's all of these things and none of them.U-571 is charged and driven in a powerhouse action thriller. It's nothing short of extraordinary. It's the most amazing war film I've ever been a part of. Yes, part of -not just watched. U-571 is so authentic, thanks to an retired Admiral of submarining on set, that you feel a part of every explosion when a depth charge shakes the foundation of the submarine.Production designer Wm Ladd Skinner should be commended for his ability to re-create the submarines and set design to make you feel claustrophobic as much as the actors in the scenes. Along with Oliver Wood's ability to capture the character of the film with a feeling of claustrophobic and unrelenting pressure for these characters.Let's not forget writer-director Jonathan Mostow, who is truly a marvel director in my mind. He was inspired to write this fictional tale about historical facts by visiting a submarine. He was so fascinated that he created this movie. It's a masterpiece of a tale and while it's not based on or created from a true story, it has a lot of historical accuracies to it.My most favourite part of this film is watching with the volume way up, the lights all off, and just experiencing the quietness of being in the submarine and just anticipating the characters actions. A ten second shot of Matthew McConaughey saying nothing and just looking simply terrified of those depth charges is amazing to watch. There is not one shot of this movie that is boring. It's paced so perfectly and each character is individually developed with perfection.While no movie is perfect, U-571 comes intensely close to being a movie that is perfect. Short from model shots and some CGI effects that are somewhat obvious after multiple viewings, this movie is a perfect movie all around.I can personally watch this movie over and over in a week's time and still not be bored nor sick of it. During it's action sequences, during it's quietness, during it's talking and development periods, this movie is an experience like no other film you've ever seen. If you like war movies, if you like being a part of a movie, you'll love U-571!",10,1,9,24 July 2010
The Shining," False Legend...
","I've recently gone back to look at films that terrified me in my youth, to see if they still have the effect on me. The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, The Shining, The Exorcist are all films that aren't any good once you get out of childhood.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence in Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's masterpiece The Shining. I can only think of one positive thing in this film, and that's the fact that it's still psychologically scary and disturbing to this day, even when I'm in my twenties.However, Kubrick changes way too much from the novel for this film and you can tell that he was re-writing the script during production. I re-watched a lot of Nicholson movies over the years and realized something... Nicholson is playing Nicholson. He's never playing The Joker, or Jack Torrence, or anyone else but himself.I am not convinced that Jack Torrence is a sane man at any point in this movie. In the car on the drive up to the Overlook Hotel, Danny (Danny Lloyd) says, 'it's okay mom, I know all about cannibalism, I saw it on TV.' Jack retorts this with a creepy, 'see, it's OK, he saw it on the television.' This just speaks out to me that the hotel didn't turn him insane, he was already insane.Stephen King's version in 1997 fixed everything that was incorrect in this film, which is basically 98%, I'd say.First, Jack's alcoholism is all wrong in this film. He didn't break Danny's arm in the past, he breaks it while at the Overlook. He was fired and not allowed to teach due to the assault incident at school.Secondly, Jack and Stuart Ullman in this film seem like old friends, but in the novel and Stephen King's miniseries, they loathe each other.Thirdly, in Kubrick's version, it takes about 20 minutes for Torrence family to be alone in the hotel. But, the pace in Stephen King's allows for it to come more gradually and this succeed in convincing you that Jack Torrence slowly turns evil.Fourth, in Kubrick's story-telling Jack kills Dick Holleran. But in the novel and King's version, Jack sacrifices himself to get Dick, Wendy and Danny safe.Fifth, Danny's imaginary friend Tony is not a, 'little boy who lives in his mouth.' Tony is actually Danny all grown up and just talks to Danny giving him advice.Sixth, in Kubrick's version, Jack Torrence's boiler responsibilities are basically omitted. Wendy (Shelly Duvall) is shown doing something with the boiler once just before Jack wakes up from a nightmare. In King's version, it's the boiler that ends up killing Jack.Seventh, there was no hedge maze, it was hedge animals. They attempt to attack Danny, but Wendy saves him by coming out to check on him.Eighth, Wendy in Kubrick's version has a rocky relationship (to say the least) with Jack. Jack seems to not be able to stand her presence. In one scene, he tells her to don't come into the room ever again, using profanity. Plus, in the book, it's mentioned Wendy is a blond bombshell (supermodel looks). In King's version, Rebecca DeMornay is a better Wendy, not just because she fits the profile in appearance...but her character seems stronger. In Kubrick's version, Wendy is described as a ghost and horror fanatic, yet, Shelly Duvall spends most of the film being terrified of everything and Jack, as well.Ninth and finally, Kubrick screws up the storyline of Delbert Grady. He is acknowledged at the beginning as a previous caretaker with his name being Charles who killed his family and committed suicide. Yet, when Jack meets him later on, he says his name is Delbert Grady and not Charles. In King's version, Grady storyline is correctly done and Watson is the one to explain it.It is all these problems with the changes or omitting of things, that allow me to dislike the film along with Jack Nicholson's horrible and unconvincing portrayal of Jack Torrence. It's horrible acting for Shelly Duvall and the overuse of her being scared and screaming about everything is also another reason. I will give it one point increase due to the fact that it's what caused me to be afraid of my bathtub or anyone's bathtub whenever I went over to someone's house.",2,13,27,14 August 2005
"I, Robot"," Good movie!
","Homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is given an apparent suicide case of his former doctor, Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who is also the father of robotics. Del begins to interrogate a robot, Sonny (Alan Tudyk) on the accusation that the suicide was actually Sonny's first murder victim. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) begins to work close with Del but disbelieves his theories that a robot could commit murder, stating that the three laws of robotics don't allow such a thing. As we hunt for the truth with Del and Susan, Sonny has a plan of action and so does Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who basically takes over the company when Alfred dies. Question is, who will blink first? Will Smith drives this movie with his amazing performance. Supporting cast do a good job to keep you on your heels and make you believe you're watching the not-so-distant future. The special effects are decent and the plot is compelling and the acting is magnetic. There are twists and turns to keep you on your toes and Bridget definitely supplies the male audience with some eye candy to gawk at.All the elements in this movie make it more than worthwhile to sit the allotted time with enjoyment and watch as the action and effects keep you amused to the very end.",8,0,1,17 January 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator original gets annihilated.
","We start off Judgment Day with John Connor (Edward Furlong) and his home life. He seems to be a rebellious kid (foreground for his future adulthood) and dislikes his foster parents. After Terminator I, his mom, Sarah has been institutionalized.The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) shows up and so does The T-1000 (Robert Patrick). For the ten minutes or so that you see them, you think who the hell is Robert Patrick? Is he another resistance member? Nope! This time Arnold is the good guy and Robert is the bad guy. The catch is Robert's type of Terminator is advanced. He's a liquid metal type which allows him to shape shift. Arnold becomes friends with John and tries to teach him things, but inevitably their relationship ends.Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor. There is basically no known supporting cast. But it isn't needed as the four main characters are enough.The special effects were increasing at an incredibly fast rate when the 1990's started so that's the reason why the special effects for the 1991 Terminator film are better than the 1984 Terminator film.The story was much more interesting and the action was a lot more exciting. The special effects were ten times better and the cast was great. Not to mention, Arnold had an actual role aside from walking and shooting. He spoke a lot.The dialogue was cheesy at times but the action makes up for all the flaws in this film. And, thank god, they didn't try to throw another stupid, unwanted love story in this one like they did with the first. Anyone with 1/3 of a brain can easily figure out that this movie easily surpasses the original Terminator for more than five reasons. There is not many sequels that beat the original but this one does.Don't get me wrong, I love Arnold and I love Terminator series but I hate the original. If you love Arnold and the Terminator movies are your favourite as well, give this one a look. I guarantee you'll watch this Terminator flick the most.",9,1,1,30 October 2007
Salt," Angelina's most impressive role!
","I'm not a big fan of Angelina. I was never convinced of her ability to be Lara Croft. I was supremely impressed by her antics as Jane Smith in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. However, when it came to Wanted, she dropped back a level at the idiocy of the movie's ability to follow the rules of physics on top of the terrible performance and unexciting action sequences.That's not the case here with Salt. It starts off with a quick introduction that kind of throws you off right away with Evelyn. As the movie comes back to present time and introduces Orlov and he accuses Salt, we now have a roller coaster approaching the first drop.Jolie is impressive in each stunt she performs and the action, once started, doesn't let up. It grows more and more intense and proves more incredible with each following stunt. I compare some of the action in this to The Bourne Identity. However, Bourne's action is outdated and Matt Damon's stunts were never as exciting as Jolie's.Aside from action, the story itself is beyond gripping. It plants you in your seat and glues your eyes to the screen, hanging on every piece of dialogue, you're mesmerized. I was thoroughly fascinated by every story twist that was thrown my way. I was still not ready for what would come next plot-wise even at the end of the film.Although, me telling you that there is a twist, you will not find it as you search for it. It comes from nowhere and surprises you. It's breathtaking and it makes the film that much better. As you walk out of the theater, you will discuss with your friends or whoever, your favourite scenes and how awesome the plot twist is.I thoroughly enjoyed Salt and while it is a great film, it's not the best of the year. I gave it a nine and I stand by it. I am not saying Inception, with a ten out of ten, is a perfect film -because no film is perfect- but Inception is the best film this year, thus far. Salt is the second best film this year. It's definitely a film, I will see more than once.",9,5,16,24 July 2010
Disturbia," Disturbia is shockingly great!
","Disturbia revolves around Kale (Shia LaBeouf; Holes, Even Stevens) who's put on house arrest for assaulting his teacher. The reasoning for assaulting his teacher was for the opening scene to the movie, where his father suffers a tragic death.After being put on house arrest, Kale looks to his neighborhood for entertainment. He begins spying on his new 'hot' neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and eventually begins to date her. When they begin dating it starts out as a joke to spy on Mr. Turner (David Morse; The Negotiator. The Green Mile) - who Kale, Ashley and Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) all believe he's a serial killer.As time goes on, Kale cries wolf twice and the cops don't believe him. His mom (Carrie-Anne Moss; The Matrix) can't stop blaming Kale and no one will believe him. When Ronnie accidentally leaves his phone in Turner's car, their lives turn for the worst and go into a spiral nightmare for which none of them were prepared for.I expected this movie to be freaking scary much like Dead Silence and once again, I wasn't scared in the least bit. If anything, the majority of this movie is centered around the romance of Kale and Ashley, and with a cover of suspense you'd walk out thinking you just saw a horror, but you didn't. The trailers also tricked you to thinking it would be scary and a horror film.Overall, the movie was shockingly great and there's a reason it was number one in its debut. The best performance was Shia, and it's noticed because he gets the most screen time. If he was a nominee for the 'Best Breakthrough Performance of the Year' I'd vote for him.If you wanted to see this movie, but were waiting for a review, then go see it, because my review is: 'great movie, shouldn't be missed.'",9,1,2,6 May 2007
Monsters vs. Aliens," A fun-filled comedy for the whole family!
","This wildly entertaining animated comedy has a long list of tremendous voice actors with a stomach-turning comedic timing to boot. Reese Witherspoon anchors the movie being a 50-foot woman and Seth Rogen is her opposite as B.O.B, an amoeba type monster who is so idiotic it comes off as heart-warming hilarious fun for everyone.Monsters vs Aliens is one of few comedies released in 2009 that can actually make you laugh during it's entire runtime. I failed to laugh at most comedies released in this year, but finally after watching this, I am happy to say I am not disappointed. It's quite honestly, probably, the funniest movie of the year. I'm not exaggerating.It's another Dreamworks masterpiece, and it's no secret why animation is able to beat out most comedies these days. An animated film doesn't have R ratings or 18A ratings for graphic content or profanities. It's family themed jokes and it's fantastic fantasy jokes that can be realistic but totally impossible.From start to credits, I was laughing my head off at the funny antics of B.O.B, the quips and quirks of Susan, the wild and insane Doctor Cockroach and last but not least, the Missing Link who is just funny because of his ego.Monsters vs Aliens is a delightful, funny comedy for everyone. Kids, teens, adults, toddlers, and even grandma will enjoy it. It's fun, it's comedic, and it's wildly entertaining. Don't miss Monsters vs Aliens! You'll regret it.",9,0,1,5 December 2009
Face_Off," Face/Off Review
","John Travolta and Nicholas Cage star in this action-filled drama about an obsessed government agent who needs to change his face to his greatest enemy if he is to shine like the hero he is. Sean Archer (Travolta) surgically puts his nemesis, Castor Troy (Cage)'s face on and infiltrates Troy's brother's prison to get information about a bomb that is about to blow up LA.While the acting is enticing -specifically on Cage's part, surprisingly- the majority of this film is filled with shooting and quick wit one-liners. Travolta plays a bad guy for 85% of the film, even at the beginning of the film he is still a bad person. Cage switches roles from clinically insane and nefarious to a sane, caring person and above all -- a hero.Special effects are great and the cinematography is superb. You get a bunch of laughs, mainly from Travolta, and there is a touch of romance. For the most part, they use up tons of bullets and create explosions as much as they can. It's mainly all they have for the two and a half hour run time.Aside from all that, it's really nothing special. It's another Travolta/Cage saves the day type movies with no lasting appeal.",6,0,5,4 November 2009
The Exorcist," False legend?
","It's not worth a view, nowadays, and everyone calls it's a legendary horror film, much like The Shining (1980). I'm sorry folks, the truth is, back in the 70s and 80s, a slow-paced movie was common. Nowadays, we need shock, scares and fast-moving horror films with tender moments now and then.This film goes very slow and while back in the day, I got scared psychologically, this movie doesn't give me the chills one bit. It's a false legend because it's nothing special. In fact, is builds no suspense as the cast is short-list and the best part is the end. It doesn't come quick enough and feels even longer with all the anticipation they try to build up.Doctors back in the time it's set seemed to be brain-dead and unbelievable. I can't believe I sat through this movie, once again, thinking it was terrifying when all it was, was a bunch of ADR's of someone doing dark and disturbing voice-overs to make the 'possessed' seem scary.No cheap tactics, no scares at all, just a bunch of profanities and some make-up and you got The Exorcist. I wonder how this movie is so praised when it took no talent to make it. Pass!",4,3,9,14 December 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Refreshing FUN Movie!
","I am not a fan of Michael Cera. I've never liked him after seeing Juno or Superbad. I felt his comedic timing and delivery was off. However, Cera has redeemed himself in my eyes with this movie.Scott Pilgrim (Cera), is dating a 17-year old named Knives (Ellen Wong) when he has a dream about Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). After meeting her, he asks her out. Shortly afterward, Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha) shows up and claims that in order to continue dating Ramona, Scott has to defeat him and the other six 'evil exes'.Right from the opening Universal studio logo shot this movie is just wicked fun. It's hilarious right from the start, it's like watching someone play a video game, and not to mention, the action is pro-kid! Bring an two-year old to this because when people are killed or damaged, they don't bleed, they burst into coins. It's romantic at times and the story is quite simple to follow.I simply loved the way that the text appeared on screen at certain times. I enjoyed all the comedy and it's nothing brilliant or deep about it which makes it all the more intelligent. The fact that Edgar wasn't trying to be a big blockbuster hit makes this movie that much greater! I find this movie to be a sleeper hit. It might not make as much as Inception or The Expendables, but in my eyes, this is a summer blockbuster.I think another great addition to Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is that the f-word is bleeped out and they work that fact into the storyline and make it even funnier. Michael Cera's delivery is spot-on and I love the look of Mary Winstead as Ramona. I remember Winstead from Final Destination 3, but she's never looked as hot as she does here, especially with the pink hair.Even parents who go with their kids to this film will have a good time. It's a fun movie, and shouldn't be viewed as anything else. I don't care about the physic errors or anything because that's not what the story is about. It's a fantasy movie mixed with comic book aspects and it plays out like a video game. It's great fun for everyone!",9,7,24,24 August 2010
Resident Evil," Paul's second best video game adaptation!
","Paul W.S. Anderson came into my radar in 1995 with Mortal Kombat becoming a film. A film in which I watched dozens of times throughout the year. I loved Mortal Kombat. Clearly, Paul has a knack for making video games into movies.Resident Evil as a film works on many levels. First, it doesn't specifically adapt one video game from the series. Second, it keeps loyal to the way the video game is shot and how the rules of Resident Evil games work. Third, it keeps the element of surprise and finally, it allows for an update and improvement in an already existent zombie movie genre.Milla Jovovich plays Alice, part of the Umbrella corporation. She's sexy, clever, funny, and bad-ass and kicks butt! Eric Mabius plays Matt, and there's just something about Eric's voice that attracts me to his characters. Michelle Rodriguez plays Rain, who kicks just as much butt as Milla.The special effects and make-up effects allow for some really gross and awesome scenes. You really feel apart of the movie throughout the film, and it gives the same vibe as when you're in the game and you're just waiting for the door to open and find out what's on the other side.It's a great adaptation, but the sequels don't follow the same pattern. I suggest skipping the sequels and playing the games after watching the first film. It's the only one worthwhile.",9,1,2,8 July 2010
Legends of the Fall," Spiral of Death
","It's an entertaining film, but it's so much about death, that's it ends up being quite depressing. This is a legendary film in the sense that it's a rare thing to see Brad Pitt, before he got famous and amazing at acting.Tristan Ludlow falls in love with his brother Samuel's (Henry Thomas) fiancÃ©e Susannah (Julia Ormond). After Samuel dies in the war, Susannah turns to Tristan for support and love, much to the dismay of Tristan's brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn). This causes friction between Alfred and his father, Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins).Eventually, Alfred ends up with Susannah anyways, because Tristan goes off to fight the war because of the guilt of not saving Samuel and she can't wait for him any longer.This movie revolves around death, as I lost count of the body count we see after around 15. It just continues to pile up. It's a complex love story, to say the least, and aside from Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, there's not much of a cast here. It falls short in the supporting cast because they don't have much acting talent, and the cringe-worthy crying scene from Brad Pitt (near the beginning of the film) is something I can't stomach very well. Susannah's stupidity and heartlessness makes me despise her character and storyline, so much so that I can't love this movie.It's a good movie, but it's not great. Because of all the flaws, it's not a great film. But, because of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, we get a decent film with some pretty good acting despite the first crying scene of Pitt. The rest of the movie is a depressing spiral of death. It has a great soundtrack, composed by legendary James Horner and it really gives the final touch of sadness for the film. It's one of those tear-jerking films that will stay with you for decades. It's a classic, but it's just not up there with the caliber of say Interview with the Vampire.",7,0,2,1 April 2011
Batman Begins," Inferior To the Sequel, But Better Than Original Franchise
","It took me five years to give Batman Begins a complete viewing. In 2005, I opted to not give it a chance when I was given the task to watch it in Media Arts and answer questions on the film. I believed at the time for Scarecrow to be a tame opponent for Batman and I suppose I didn't quite fully understand the character of Batman.After seeing The Dark Knight a great many times, I've come to understand Batman more carefully and now after viewing the way Batman comes to be, I can safely say that Christopher Nolan knows how to write the superhero the best. I believe The Dark Knight is far superior to Batman Begins on principles of acting, special effects, action, and characters.Don't get me wrong, Batman Begins is a great film. It took me five years to realize this. Christian Bale is quite simply the best Bruce Wayne and Batman portrayal. He astonishes me as each persona and plays them like no one else can. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow makes perfect sense as he's not a physical opponent but a psychological one. Liam Neeson is also a great actor and really shines in Batman Begins as a villain, which by my count is the first time I've seen him play an antagonist.It's really a investment type of film. You need to really take your time to like it. You might not like it the first few viewings but in the end you will come to see that this Batman film is where it should have began, hence the name. It has an enormous cast of A-list actors and that's not all the film has to offer. Immense amounts of actions, special effects and really great dialogue puts Batman Begins atop the list of comic book adaptations along with The Dark Knight.I can only assume Nolan will astound the audience once more with the final chapter of Batman with the third film upcoming. I won't be disappointed with the removal of Joker due to Heath Ledger's untimely death, and I won't have incredibly high expectations. But unlike Spider-man, X-Men and Fantastic Four, I don't think Batman can disappoint me.",9,0,0,23 April 2010
Twilight," I Don't Wanna Be Lumped As A General Hater...
","Sometimes you can't help but give a 1 rating because the movie is just simply that bad. I don't want to be lumped as a person who hates Twilight for simply being cool or as a general hater. I have reason for hating this thing...First, let's start with the acting. How on Earth can anyone take this acting seriously? Stewart's constant blinking sets off an all-caps-rage with me and she's not even the worst part of this movie, which says a lot, folks. Robert plays the worst vampire ever created. He looks like a pedophile in a few scenes and consider he's probably over 80, he technically is a pedophile. He acts like he's afraid to speak, when it should be Bella who's afraid to speak. Near the end of the film, the 'bad' vampires crouch in front of the Cullens (who also crouch) showing that they are hungry for Bella's blood. It's so laughably ridiculous that it's shameful to think anyone would find this as the most dramatic moment in the movie or call it the climax of the film.That being said, the plot never shows up. I never felt like there's a reason to watch this. I watched it so I could give a valid review having seen it, finally. But, I kept waiting for a reason for all this to be happening. It never came. It was just, 'stay away, I'm dangerous' and then nothing even happens to Bella.How about the 'visual effects'? For a movie with a substantial budget of nearly $40M, you'd expect better special and visual effects. Plus, I expected the vampire make-up effects to be better. I was very tamed and unimpressed about all three effects department. But, I guess it's not completely their fault since they had to build these concepts for the film off of poorly written material. Really...? A vampire sparkles in the daylight? That's their golden special effect? I feel sorry forMelissa Rosenberg, because most of the time (I know her as a writer for The O.C.) she is talented. Maybe it was the fact that she was not doing a teleplay but an actual screenplay. Maybe it was the fact that she had to stay true to Meyer's horrible story in the books and couldn't change anything. Whatever the reason, the script is filled with cringe worthy dialogue that makes anyone with half a brain roll their eyes in utter bewilderment. 'You're my own personal brand of heroine,' is such a romantic pick-up line, isn't it? It worked on the slut Bella, since Edward is like, so, totally the dreamiest of men in the world. Ahem, erm, uh, vampire, I mean. Seriously the dialogue is so cheesy and stolen from other movies, it's super-difficult to resist mocking it.In a 2-hour movie, (why??) the establishment to the audience that the Cullens are vampires takes too long (45 minutes invested movie time). For people who don't read the books, maybe it would have been better to come into the story later on or perhaps tone down the outside-of-school time. Maybe tone down the entire thing... oh wait...there's 4 more films of this trash.After years of refusing to watch this because of all the people I know who have intelligence and taste, I can safely say this is the worst movie ever made and I'd watch any other terrible movie (ie. Meet the Spartans, Blair Witch, Date Movie, Butterfly Effect 2, etc.) again and again before I ever gave this a second viewing.Stephanie Meyer's finger should have never clicked a mouse to view wikipedia nor touched a computer keyboard to type her ridiculous story. You want a real vampire movie? Check out Interview with a Vampire, or Blade, or even 30 Days of Night was better than this.",Null,7,9,26 August 2011
Liar Liar," Classic Comedy!
","Liar Liar is one of those comedies that make your stomach hurt no matter when it's watched. Whether you were a person who saw it in 1997 or if you're seeing it for the first time in 2010, this movie includes a whopper list of gut-wrenching jokes along with Jim's best performance.Fletcher (Jim Carrey) is a lawyer who's career currently hinges on a case that requires him to lie, but when his son Max gets upset for the last time (after Fletcher misses Max's birthday), Max puts a curse on his dad where he can't lie for 24 hours.On a wild adventure of watching Fletcher try to lie when he clearly can't, we're forced into watching the overacting of Carrey but it's needed for the comedic effect to be priceless. A long list of supporting actors help draw out the big laughs and make the film that much memorable.I really enjoy Liar Liar even thirteen years after it's release. I think that a comedy like this, it's jokes are timeless giving it the ability to make you laugh no matter it's release. It's not just a funny film, but inspiring and emotional. It's a film that touches your heart easily.Liar Liar is a family comedy and I think anyone can enjoy it. It can be enjoyed no matter when it's watched.",8,0,1,18 April 2010
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan - Review
","Lieutenant Colonel Anderson puts Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) on a search and rescue assignment to find Private Ryan and send him home to his mom. Along the way they stumble into Captain Hamill and Sergeant Hill. They take out a sniper, suffer losses when they battle some Germans, and they bond together in a church and along the way find out about Captain Miller's home life.Steven Spielberg directs this epic masterpiece and his amazing sidekick Michael Kaun edits. The story by Robert Rodat is realistic and an accurate representation of D-Day. The story is told in a flashback process of Private Ryan remembering back to when Captain Miller saved his life.The excellent casting, the special, visual effects are stunning, the acting at the top of it's game, the gripping story, and the realism of it all makes this one worthwhile of many, many viewings. It is one of the best movie of the 90's and it's possibly Hank's best performance of his career.To not watch this and enjoy would be a tragedy and I'd have to question that person as to why they didn't enjoy it. It's simply too great to not entertain you. Recommended.",9,2,4,10 August 2007
Get Out," Peele's debut is a homerun.
","Jordan Peele's Oscar winning original screenplay along with Daniel Kaluuya's powerful performance makes Get Out a true masterpiece of film. It speaks out as one of the best films of 2017 while it flew under the radar.I never saw the trailers for the film and so I never heard about the movie till 2019. I finally had the chance to catch the movie and the film is well-written but beyond that it's one of the best acted films I've seen in a long, long time. Daniel impresses most of all but it's also the supporting cast of Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel, LaKeith Stanfield and especially Allison Williams that bring the film to life.Chris Washington (Kaluuya) is the first black boyfriend for Rose Armitage (Williams) and she's bringing home to her parents to have them meet over the weekend. Rose forgets about a party that is held that weekend in honour of her grandfather and Chris feels uneasy as the party goes on and all the guests act strange.It doesn't take long for the film to delve into the horror aspect. When Chris goes to have a cigarette we are greeted to hypnotism from Missy (Catherine Keener, another great performance). Rose's mother makes you feel uncomfortable during the entire scene and you really feel Daniel's performance in the scene as well.Without giving anything away here, I'll say that the film itself impressed me very much as it was Jordan's first feature-length film and he's not known for the horror genre. I'll give a lot of credit to the film's success on the actors' performances but Peele I think is set for a future of success.",8,2,7,22 March 2019
Aladdin," A Worthy Live-Action Remake
","I wrongfully stood against this film and take back my initial thoughts that Disney ruined the original film. If nothing else, Disney has improved upon their original version of this classic timeless tale.After seeing the previews everywhere I had originally thought that Marwan Kenzari was objectively the better choice for Jasmine and that Will Smith's performance would be questionable at best. Count me surprised, and the secrecy surrounding Friend Like Me and Prince Ali musical numbers made for a truly memorable experience. Nothing, not even the original with Robin Williams, can touch the astounding effect that those two performances did in the film.Although the film plays out in a different sequence, and at times in the beginning of the film some of the lines feel phoned in, the film still has a classic feel with a modern atmosphere that any audience can relate too. Even though the time period is set to a time way back when, the dialogue is fun and easy to keep up with and makes for a fun experience for any age.It's only fitting that Frank Welker returns as the Cave of Wonders voice while Iago is voiced by the building legend Alan Tudyk, who is quickly becoming the voice of Disney. In a high budget, great visual effects team by Industrial Light & Magic (Star Wars team) and the wonderful costume design, Aladdin has set the bar for live-action remakes and has delivered with the perfect recipe. We will see what else Disney has up their sleeve.",9,3,6,13 June 2019
Insidious," One of the scariest movies of all time!
","Insidious comes from two of my all-time favourite filmmakers: James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Nevermind the fact that this film is on a $1 million budget and the cast is filled with no big names. This movie will blow your mind.Keep this all in mind as you watch this horror masterpiece. It takes you on an intense ride that will have you squirming in your seat. It is probably going to be the best horror film of 2011, and one of the top ten of the year, as well. It's just so damn good.It starts off showing a family unpacking boxes in their new home, when strange things start happening making me think of The Haunting in the Connecticut. It quickly dives into depression as the son Dalton falls into what the doctors deem as a coma...but not really. But the strange things don't stop but instead grow more intense. Even when the family changes environments by moving to another house, the family is plagued with the spirits in the house.It doesn't follow the same set-up-pay-off format as Paranormal Activity, and nor does it follow the disturbing nature of Dead Silence. Instead, it combines these two elements to give us the psychological aspect, but while also giving us jump scenes.I lept from my seat at one point because this movie is scary. It doesn't have any bloody scenes but it is not necessary here. It doesn't have any of those scenes like Paranormal Activity, but instead makes it's own scare scenes using lighting and effects. It is truly a freaky film by most of what happens in the the second half of the movie.Perhaps the creepiest thing in the movie is the song that is sung by Tiny Tim. It occurs briefly twice in the movie, but both times send some serious shivers down your spine. It chills me and although this movie freaked me out more than any movie has, I would love to see it again. Seriously, folks, if you haven't yet seen Insidious and want a good scare and want a good film to see for the early 2011, go see it.",9,8,15,12 April 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Third chapter almost always a let-down...
","It's a tad-bit better than Spider-Man 3's try at a third (and final chapter) in a comic-book franchise adaptation. But it's not very enjoyable to watch.Firstly, a large number of comic book fans and TV fans of X-Men will realize that this film characters are wrong in many ways. Wolverine never had a thing for Jean Grey, as far as I'm aware. Iceman and Rogue weren't involved in the comic books nor TV show and for the most part this film is just laced with the idea of 'let's kill off as many of the big names we can.' Magneto has become some insipid idiotic character in this film. He walks around with the presence of being a class 3 mutant but during the climax of the film sits back and doesn't deal out an offense where he should. Jean Grey's role seems nearly pointless and once again, the movie revolves around Wolverine.A great number of people have gone to see X-Men Origins: Wolverine but I must ask: what's the point? We've already seen the past three X-Men movies revolve around him. X-Men was supposed to be about a team battling the odds and battling the dangerous foe Magneto. These films turned all that potential into a romance trilogy with a bunch of lazy unfunny writing and cheesy one-liners that leave us baffled.X-Men was a great adaptation but before long, it became all about Wolverine while trying to trick you with being about Rogue or perhaps Magneto. Not long after, X2 came along and showed us that the writers only care about Logan. With more than a dozen great mutants at their fingertips in X-Men: The Last Stand, they still failed and once again focused on the cheesy love story between Wolverine and Jean Grey.Underneath the excess amounts of love, there's jealous brewing between Kitty/Rogue over the affections of Bobby (Iceman) and Mystique's roles has been reduced, while Pyro seemingly takes over as 'second-in-command.' Nothing against Pyro, but I don't find his character to be as outstanding as Mystique.I also didn't agree with the omitting of Night Crawler. He was a staple character in X2 and the main reason I enjoyed the film as much as I shouldn't have. Beast's addition was overshadowed, as was Angel's, by the too many additions of other mutants. There's simply too many mutants to try to show in this film and with the overwhelming story of Wolverine, it's all crammed up too much.Nonetheless, the special effects are still top-notch, and the make-up was the best of the year, I think. It just tried to do too much with too little time. Much like Spider-Man, not enough development, too many villains/mutants. A big, big let-down.",3,2,3,10 April 2010
The Lion King," Unimpressive, underwhelming, underachieving...
","It's great that we live in a time where the 1994 animated film can have the star role of Mufasa get his iconic voice actor to return. It's great to also be in an era where musicals like The Lion King and Aladdin can get musicians to fill roles with song numbers attached to them.That's where the greatness ends. The Lion King is an epic film and so should the remake be. However, everything about this film falls short. You can't expect a brand new experience really just some slightly altered scenes, maybe a few new ones and some adjusted dialogue. But when performances seem phoned in, songs fall flat and lack a big punch, the film itself lacks substance and the only thing viewers can walk away feeling is the bit of nostalgia that comes with this is still The Lion King.Song numbers of 'Just Can't Wait to Be King' and 'Circle of Life' have a feel of powerful and epic, especially half way through and then there's the build up at the end of each song in the original film. Here, the songs have no real power behind the vocals and the build up seems missing.Be Prepared is done in a capella and almost completely omitted. It was almost entirely skipped over. Although Chiwetel Ejiofor does a good job as Scar overall, his song is one of the worst that Disney has done. Even though I welcomed an expansion on Shenzi and Sarabi, it really felt that the only voice actor that had a passion for the character was the only one who returned: James Earl Jones.Overall, this one was a big disappointment. In contrast, I believed seeing the previews that Aladdin was going to be ruined and I was wrong. Will Smith made that film truly exciting and the song performances in that film were epic. It's a huge letdown that The Lion King couldn't deliver the same standard. Jon Fraveau may have put more of an effort in The Jungle Book remake and just maybe wasn't as passionate about this project. Whatever the case may be, this one didn't deliver the grand spectacle that audiences fell in love with in 1994.",4,4,7,22 July 2019
Amadeus," Best movie from the 1980's!
","Every decade punches out one movie that stands out from all the rest, it's no surprise that the 1990's had Titanic do just that with the 11 Oscars it took home. I believe Avatar will go down in history as the best movie to come out of the 2010 decade with The Dark Knight being the best 2000's movie. That being said, it's quite clear, at least to me, Amadeus is the best movie from the 1980's.What makes Amadeus so great? A great many things make this movie loved and incredible to watch. Fans of musicals will love this simply for all the music involved. During the 180 minutes of film, you hear some form of musical score. What's better is that the music is written and adapted from works of Mozart or Salieri. Quite exquisite music with such grace and elegance.Amadeus is such a masterpiece of fiction work and gives a memorable story-telling of Mozart's career and personal life while also briefly explaining the same of Salieri. Amongst the cast, F. Murray Abraham definitely steals the show away. Whether or not he's in his old-age makeup or he's playing his young self in flashbacks, Abraham penetrates your soul and touches the viewer's inner being.Every scene brings a warmth to my heart. Every piece of music in the film is something to behold and listened to for hours on end. Amadeus is the type of film to make you long for the old times and make you wish to go to an opera like 'Marriage of Figaro.' It's not just the music, acting and plot that can captivate you but the art direction, cinematography, makeup effects, direction, and visual effects are some of the best you'll ever see. Amadeus is one of few films that you can give a perfect ten and feel satisfied knowing that people will agree. I certainly know that it's one of five films for me that can achieve a perfect ten rating. Highly recommended.",10,1,3,1 March 2010
Kick-Ass," Wicked!
","This film is not for children. It's advertised for kids and it looks like children would watch it since the plot revolves around normal people trying to be superheroes. Well, it's definitely a film that shouldn't be seen by anyone younger than 18 years old. Chlöe Grace Moretz plays Hit-Girl, an 11 year-old Mindy who kills many, many people and uses very profane language.Nicholas Cage is in the cast and mainly plays the anchor, as Mindy's dad. I wasn't thrilled about watching a film with Cage attached to the title, but, I heard rave reviews from friends and read critics views of it and had to check it out myself. Mostly, I wanted to see Lyndsy Forseca in a sexier and more body-revealing role. I recognized her name from playing the future daughter of Ted in How I Met Your Mother.As far as the movie plot goes, it's quite interesting and engaging. It's a great premise because I've always thought that anyone could become a superhero, but no one ever does. It's something that's been on people's minds for years. It's quite realistic in the way of showing violence against these 'heroes.' It's great to see that the screenwriter and director can follow the comic book loyally while keeping realistic.No one becomes a superhero and has no consequences. Kick-Ass almost gets killed, Hit-Girl has trauma happen to her, and the realism piles up. I enjoyed the action sequences and found myself on the edge of my seat during the climatic battle. I also found myself cheering for Cage at a moment, which I've never really cared for his characters.I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Katie and Dave (Aaron Johnson). I thought it was quite romantic and I thought the tender moment in her bedroom was realistic while still being romantic and funny in a quirky way. It's great to see Chlöe kick major ass in all her scenes. I liked the character, regardless of all the killings and language she uses.Kick-Ass is great comic book movie that is different from all other comic book movies. It's also a very good movie on it's own. But I can only recommend this to audiences over 18 years old.",9,3,8,20 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Better Than the First!
","I hate the Twilight series. But, I'm not a hater simply because it's the cool thing to do. I don't hate the series because I'm outside of the demographic region being a 22-year old male. No, I hate it because the series is appalling. Yes, the premise of a female human and a male vampire (both adolescent) is a superb idea. But, the way that Meyer executed her idea was atrocious. Rosenberg stepped it up a notch for New Moon and it's probably a lot of credit to throw at the male director for making it better too.New Moon doesn't quite fail as much as its predecessor. In fact, it's a major improvement. Now, I'm not saying the special effects are better, which is sad because the movie got an approximate 140% budget increase. But actually what is better is the acting! Thankfully, Stewart's portrayal went from blinky, unemotional, boring girl to a girl with emotion in her lines and she conveyed love in her eyes. She became a bit interesting. Unfortunately, Robert's acting was still stiff as a bone, though.Jacob is probably my most hated character, however. I mean, yes Robert's acting is horrible and Taylor's is not bad...but Jacob is a usurper as Bella clearly belongs to Edward. In Edward's absence, Jacob takes to bonding with Bella and attempts too hard to hold her hand or kiss her. For some odd reason, Bella falls in love with him. I never saw anything between them emotional. I think Taylor's muscle has something to do with Bella's growing hormones and she just wants to jump his bones.In the finale of the film, Edward has a pointless fight with Volturi which is where a bunch of special effects come into play. It was very irritating to watch because of how pointless the fight was. I would have much preferred the fight between Edward and Jacob to happen. But the 'perfect' Bella has to get in between and tell them that it will hurt her. I would say that the werewolf effects are cool, but it's just simply not as good as the potential that it had. Jacob turns to a werewolf a little to quickly and it should hurt, in my opinion, when he does transform. But it looks like there is no downside at all to him being a werewolf, so what's the reason for keeping it a secret? I'm not saying that New Moon is good. I'm not saying I like it. But I will say, I don't hate it. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's not good either. It's down at the bottom of the barrel but I just can't decide where.",Null,5,7,29 August 2011
Transformers," Another spectacle by Michael Bay!
","This epic starts off by showing Sam (Shia LeBeouf) getting a new car from his dad (Kevin Dunn) as a present for getting good grades. Sam unknowingly chooses a transformer, Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). After a confrontation with Trent (Travis Van Winkle), Sam takes Mikaela (Megan Fox) home in his new car. Eventually, Sam discovers that his car is a transformer when it helps him escape Barricade's attack. Mikaela is there with Sam to witness the 'robot death match.' Later, they meet the other Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen). They must find the Allspark before the Decepticons lead by Megatron (Hugo Weaving) get it first.The transformers are stunning to look at. The action the movie is packed with rocks! The ensemble cast work hard to make you believe everything is real. Special and visual effects are once again amazing, and it seems like every Michael Bay film achieves this incredible feat. The comedy is very present and you get many laughs. Their is also a slight hint of romance between the two leads which will give all romantics a sigh of relief.Comedy and action in the movie take you for a great summer blockbuster ride and thrill you until the very last frame when 'What I've Done' hits the speakers. The climax of the film has a great action sequence filled with numerous shots of special effects that look intensely real. This one will be remembered for a long time to come. See it and see it often.",9,2,3,13 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Somewhere Between Revenge of the Sith and Empire Strikes Back
","It is unfortunate that The Last Jedi isn't quite up to par with Empire Strikes Back. However, it's just as good as Revenge of the Sith, which in my opinion is the best of the prequels.The Last Jedi features a lot of prime acting from Mark Hamill. He's doing his best work here, and it should be considering he has had more than 30 years to prepare his reprisal. I can certainly understand his frustrations on Luke's progression and why he would question the director's choices. Luke is not the same character from Return of the Jedi. His feeling of the Jedi to end is an odd one and feels completely out of character. 30 years ago, he was stone in the manipulation that Palpatine attempted to turn him but now suddenly Luke doesn't believe in the Jedi anymore.The subplots of Rey turning evil and Kylo turning good and the backstory of Snoke all fall to the way side and the supposed epic encounter of Snoke and Rey was actually mild and predictable. It's a disappointment to build up Snoke for one and a half movies and throw him away (so easily despite showing his immense power) without telling anything about him. Where did he come from? How did he seduce Kylo? It feels like he had no purpose other than bringing Rey and Kylo close together.Rey's reveal of her parents being nobodies was not what any Star Wars fan wanted. I think I speak for many in saying that we expected some kind of link to the previous films in relation to her story. Instead her backstory is uninteresting. The ending of the film is an underwhelming, predictable mess. Luke creates a force hologram of himself and confronts Kylo and asks him to kill him. After Kylo successfully does so, it is revealed that Luke is still on the island alive for the moment. So the encounter was fake. Luke passes on with the force from exhaustion but it leaves a burning question of why Luke only ever performed this feat. Yoda could have hologram fought the Emperor in Revenge of the Sith and then if he failed, he could have attempted to do it for real. I feel like the hologram is such a cheat for the writers and feels very lazy as well.I can still look forward to the next (final?) episode of Star Wars (in the Skywalker story saga) with the knowledge that this film along with The Force Awakens were both letdowns. Especially considering we waited 10 years after the prequels and nearly 40 after the original trilogy, this is subpar, to say the least.",7,1,4,25 January 2018
Clash of the Titans," Worst movie of 2010? So far, yes.
","I was really looking forward to Clash of the Titans, however, perhaps my expectations were too high or perhaps it is due to my following reasons as to why this movie failed so miserably. I have no idea how I'd feel about this movie having seen the original, but if the original is anything similar, I'm guessing I wouldn't like it.Let's start off with the cast. I loathe the casting director for this flick on the principles of miscasting nearly each and every character. Sam Worthington in Avatar and Terminator Salvation, both promising and career advancing roles, in Clash of the Titans, I didn't like him. As Perseus he brought nothing but Jake Sully (of Avatar) to the role and I just felt his character was tame. Liam Neeson, while an astonishing actor in most roles, fell flat on his face and I wasn't convinced he was Zeus. He just didn't mold into the character. Ralph Fiennes is well known as Voldermort, but as Hades he wasn't cunning, nefarious and he wasn't very intimidating.As a story, this film is utter trash. It comes off as a rip-off of 300 and is more so a march, similar to Pirates: At World's End, than a battle of humans and the gods. I felt the movie was very slow paced and very much so dragged on and was just hoping it was closer to the end than it was. I didn't like the idea of having to walk to the battle. It gave me the prolonged Lord of the Rings walking feeling. It just didn't seem to have a purpose or goal.There's a subplot, apparently, of a love story between Io and Perseus. I didn't see any chemistry nor romantic scenes until the very end when Io is killed. But apparently, I was blind because by that point he all of a sudden is in love with her and doesn't want to leave her side. I was originally intending to give the film a 6/10, but with the end of the film giving Io life (thanks to Zeus) I bumped it down to a 4/10. But it fell to 3/10 due to the fact I was looking forward to seeing Izabella Miko play Athena, but she wasn't even shown.Forget about the fact that Poseidon is mentioned at the beginning of the film. He is unseen and the entire film becomes about Zeus, Hades and Perseus. It's a showcase of who's the best actor. Ultimately Worthington is given more screen time, but unfortunately neither of the leads were anything special. Hades and Perseus is built up throughout the movie and unfortunately, Hades is defeated in less than 3 seconds. Medusa takes the longest to defeat and bares an ability much like the basilisk in Chamber of Secrets.Now, the clincher of the film's mediocrity is the amount of CGI. It's an overuse of CGI on nearly every scene with nearly every character. The over hype of the kraken and it's a simple battle and the creature itself is all CGI. The sword fighting choreography is the only decent part of the film but even that wasn't given much time and it's not frequent enough.I'd say this movie should be forgotten in the next ten years because it is surely one of the worst of this decade. Thus far, it's the worst film of the year, but I'm sure being so early...there are a number of 'worst movies of the year' potential still. I have a feeling Saw VII might get that label or perhaps Harry Potter or maybe Kick-Ass. We'll have to wait and see if Clash takes the cake. Happy viewing folks, skip Clash and see something worth your buck.",2,1,2,13 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," Misjudged!
","I definitely misjudged this film. In 2009, Paranormal Activity decimated Saw at the box-office. I was not on PA's side as I found out the budget was a mere $15,000 (sorta like Blair Witch) I was unimpressed with the thought that this was dubbed 'scariest movie of all time!' On a $15,000 budget, Paranormal Activity's gross was over 100,000x (in worldwide numbers) its original value. I figured, the special effects couldn't be anything to sneeze at.I finally saw this film and I'm pleased to say, on the budget and the lack of script writing this film is very good. Its cinematography is something to be hold. Lighting during the sleeping scenes are a very disturbing blue and really keep you drawn to the screen.Although the script wasn't complete and some scenes were given directions from Oren Peli to just 'talk about a certain subject' this is well-crafted. It works very well and gets you interested in the movie.Perhaps my only dislike of the film, really, is the representation that the film is more of a documentary. It is actually all staged and fake. It's only based on a personal experience, but the fact that there is an alternate ending means that it's not real. I dislike when it's falsified.I was pleased with the original ending and the silence in scenes and anticipation buildup really makes for an intriguing ending. However, I wouldn't say this is a scary film in the least. The premise and idea is disturbingly freaky, but overall I wasn't scared.I would recommend this film to people who enjoy horror elements and movies that touch on paranormal stuff. It's a good film and I'm excited for Paranormal Activity 2.",7,0,2,1 November 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," One of the best of 2011
","Well, I finally saw The Adjustment Bureau and I'm very happy to say it went above and beyond my high expectations. I was hoping it'd be really good, and it was better than great! Matt Damon stars as David Norris and is immediately a likable character simply because he has faults and flaws that he doesn't let ruin him. He picks himself back up and is honest and open to everyone. This is easily my favorite character and role of his.Emily Blunt is the love interest, and she makes for a very quirky, fun character that has great chemistry with Damon. I know the movie is written that way, but it's still great chemistry between Damon and Blunt that you almost forget that they're acting.Terence Stamp plays Thompson, a brief character, but is easily almost the star of the movie. Stamp is known to me for his Jor-El portrayal on Smallville. He is so good in his scenes with Damon, that you can dismiss his dialogue as being villainous and just being truthful.This film isn't great because of the acting, although it helps. However, the real golden piece of this film comes from the opening slingshot that is pulled back so hard the viewer is forced to leap into the story and not even care to understand everything going on. Instead, you just follow along and just wait for the next unexpected thing to happen.It has simply stunning visual and special effects that I was in utter awe. When the Bureau open doors to baseball stadiums, museums, downtown New York and more but when normal people do it, it's nothing extraordinary. It's quite a spectacle to see.Tack on some witty humor that hits your face so quickly with a splash, this movie has a profound lasting appeal. It will be with me for a long time and I can tell you that the wait was well-worth it. This movie rocks! It is one of the best of 2011.",Null,0,3,23 August 2011
The Dark Knight," Legacy left behind!
","A sequel to the uninteresting Batman Begins start of the reboot franchise is not only exceptionally better than the first, but may just be the best film in the last few decades and could be the best one of the next few.As an avid fan of the original series, minus Batman & Robin for obvious reasons, and an avid fan of Jack Nicholson's work, I was reluctant to let someone like Heath step into the spotlight and try and change the character and make everyone remember that character as Heath playing it. I was dragged to the film by a group of friends during opening weekend.The film starts out with Joker cleverly robbing a bank and outwitting his associates. A number of the actors from Batman Begins reprise their roles, spare Katie Holmes as lovable Rachel Dawes. In this film, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) has conquered Rachel's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) affections while Bruce (Christian Bale) conquers his future and present villains. The Joker plans to use the mafia as his aid to corrupt and destroy Bruce after attempting to make Batman reveal himself publicly. Harvey goes insane and inevitably becomes Two-Face. As Batman races against time to save the innocent, he battles two foes and his own demons. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine all reprise their roles.Although not initially wanting to see the film, I immediately fell in love with it. Heath beautifully played Joker and made his own interpretation of the character, and I'd say he did a better job than Nicholson. Aaron Eckhart overshadowed Tommy Lee Jones' work as Two-Face in the original series with his role here. Christian Bale grasps the character of Bruce Wayne while making Batman just as unique. Unlike other superhero movies, Batman and Bruce's voice are not at all similar.Overall, I praise Heath for a legendary job well done and hope that this film will be remembered for decades to come and people will still be talking about it 50 years from now. If Titanic and The Dark Knight were released at the same time, I am not sure Titanic would win financially. Superb job!",10,4,7,8 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Upsetting adaptation! Great special effects!
","You take all the great points of the book and you get this movie. It was easy to hate Umbridge as the actress made the character pure evil. A bunch of points are left out entirely (ie. the house elves; something that is vastly important to Hermione and Ron in Deathly Hallows).I did enjoy the film, but it seems the writers have gotten lazy with following the story since after Prizoner. Dumbledore's Army comes together quite differently in the book, and this is the book that shows how powerful Ginny is. It also shows her shining as one of the main characters and not some shy 'good luck' girl like we saw in the first film.In the climatic scene there is so much going on, the story is pretty much thrown out -- while you're dazzled by the special effects of Death Eaters versus the Order. Fred and George are reduced to a couple of one-liners for comic relief.Hermione is still the brainiac and Ron is still annoyed with her. Harry still hasn't come to terms with who he will become and Voldemort is pretty much absent from the movie.It's a good movie overall, and not a good adaptation, to say the least. But it's worth watching and entertaining with all the good special effects. It's not going to hold a candle to the book's imaginative story telling or the last effect it has on it's reader, but you'll enjoy watching the magic of Hogwarts.",5,0,0,3 January 2010
Taken," Liam Neeson in the role of his career!
","This film starts off to show that generic relationship between an ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and a loving father (Liam Neeson) who are unable to co-exist but share an interest -- their daughter. Bryan (Neeson) quits his career as a 'preventer' to be closer to his somewhat distant daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim plans to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy, who you'll recognize from 'Click') but needs permission from her father in order to go. When Kim is 'Taken' by an group of Albanians, Bryan goes on a mission to kill everyone involved in order to get back his daughter.I was literally on the edge of my seat from the moment of Kim being taken (which is what is shown in the trailers/spots) until the very last frame. The movie is action packed, and while it endorses a massively high body count, the kill scenes start to feel copied after it crosses the twenty mark. There are twists, there are some unknown actors and rising star actors in the feature, but for the most part it's an average action/thriller with a big name star.Liam (who people will recognize from 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' as the wicked cool 'Qui-Gon Jinn') drives the movie as the sole participant and basically only known actor. I'm going on a limb and saying this is his best performance of his career, thus far. The action is well done, the pace is at a great, quick speed and the ride is fun for everyone able to be admitted.There's 'eye candy' for all genders and all ages. There's some quick, clever, subtle, witty retorts that some will chuckle, some will laugh out loud and some will sit there confused. There's a missing element of romance, but this is as I've stated, an action movie. There are a few key scenes that will not be forgotten.Overall, I think it's a great film. The supporting cast could've been selected better. The kill scenes could've been varied instead of using the same MO for 20-30 men. It does just dip into the world of 'unrealistic' and has a 'Commando' vibe on how one man is able to take out 60 men without being much more than flesh wounded. For some, like me, that will infringe the film's rating and overall opinion.If you don't look at it in that aspect, you'll enjoy it very much. I'm sure I'll be picking up the DVD when it hits the shelves at my local department store and may just end up going to view it once or twice more at the theaters. Who knows? I do know that, anyone who enjoys action in the least will have a good time watching Taken.",8,0,2,2 February 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Burton's Disasterpiece.
","Very few movies by Tim Burton do I dislike. I am a huge fan of Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, James and the Giant Peach, and Edward Scissorhands. However, Alice In Wonderland was dreadful.Last year, I saw Alice In Wonderland, and I thought it was horrible. First of all, everything in this movie looks like CGI. It was like watching Avatar again, with different actors. I am amazed at the great computer graphics used and the good motion-capture, but even Johnny Depp said himself that it wasn't fun working on the film. It's a little distracting when you have to watch CGI in every scene of a movie. Did I say a little distracting? Every scene has CGI and it's beyond distracting.I have to say that aside from CGI, this movie is a failure because of the story. I prefer the Alice In Wonderland film from 1999, for the simple fact that it's not grounded. It's a movie full of random events and it's not clouded by a bunch of CGI. It is not trying to be anything special or realistic. This story in Burton's Wonderland is grounded. What I mean is, these things that happen in the novel aren't random, and Alice has already been here before. She just doesn't remember (sound familiar -- Hook?). What annoys me most of all, is the overall finale to the story is she has to kill this creature, the Jabberwocky, which would allow for the White Queen to rule Underland (huh?) again and banish the Red Queen.I couldn't stand the grounded story and due to the grounded story, this movie is not very comedic. I chuckled maybe twice? I remember laughing a lot at the 1999 film because of the rabbit and his teacup party friend. However, this movie is almost entirely a drama and due to the story it's very serious. It's not really a fun movie for anyone, least of all kids.If you want a fun Alice In Wonderland movie, I'd suggest buying or renting the 1999 version which stars Tina Majorino as Alice. It's a much more superior version because it allows for unlimited story and it doesn't get overrun with CGI. It's more of a kids movie, as well.",3,4,6,18 March 2011
Avatar," Titanic is still superior...
","Before Titanic was released, Cameron had the idea to do Avatar, but no studio would do the film because of the huge budget and Cameron doubted the special effects ability to show Hometree properly.However, more than a decade after Titanic, Cameron finally got Avatar done. This is not a tremendous film, because it is merely a special effects movie that takes away from what could have been an original imaginative story.Plus, I wasn't very much in favor of Sam Worthington being the lead actor. I enjoyed him as Marcus in Terminator 4, but I felt he was wooden and basically could have phoned in his performance with this movie. He seems like he's just reading his lines and not really a part of the film at any point.Perhaps the most surprising thing in the movie is Zoe Saldana as Neytir, since I've seen her in a few movies as a supporting or lesser-used character, but she has a breakout performance here. She is very unrecognizable due to her being digitally changed to look like a Na'vi.I was happy about Giovanni Ribisi being a villain-type in the film, but disappointed when he was barely on screen (as he's my favorite actor).Acting aside, this film is nothing really amazing in terms of special effects. It's all been seen before, and it really just looks like a live-action movie of World of Warcraft. I did originally enjoy the movie, but on repeat viewings I grow to detest it more and more just because the special effects hogs the whole 160 minutes. It takes away from the story and makes me careless about it all.I will probably only watch this movie due to someone else (a friend, girlfriend, etc.) asking me to watch it. However, I will not watch it on my own because I have no enjoyment watching it. I cannot wait for it to end.",4,3,7,24 March 2010
Saw," Worst Horror Franchise!
","I originally loved this series. Saw was original, and it was the biggest cinematic twist since The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. It was a horror without needing to be a cliché horror and follow all the rules.Saw contained a story about Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) who's given a test by an unknown person, to kill the other man in the room, Adam (Leigh Whannell). Adam's test is simply not allow himself to get killed. As the movie progresses, we learn that these two more about each other than they first let on.Every Halloween, Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures had a new Saw film come out, despite initially that director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell didn't have plans to make a sequel. It eventually grew to a substantial fan base.By 2005, people had been split into two groups, logical and Gordonites. This was due to the fact that people were displeased with Gordon's fate not being shown or referenced which made people come up with theories for the next five years. Eventually, Saw 3D writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan wrote the character back in, using basically every idiotic idea from the fans over the years.It ended up ruining my experience of the franchise that I had paid into for the last seven years. I feel cheated knowing I was lied to for the last six years and that Hoffman was the final accomplice to Jigsaw.It's simply the worst horror franchise to date, thanks to how the writers ruined the whole series by being lazy and using all the fan ideas. Gordon's fate ruined multiple characters including: himself, Jigsaw, Amanda, Hoffman, and Adam. Plus, his fate ruined the storyline of Hoffman and Amanda being an accomplice. It also ruined the history of Jigsaw's work and it ruined a lot of crucial elements such as the timeline and flashbacks.It could have been the best horror franchise of all time, but with the sloppiness and illogical conclusion it is now the worst.",1,3,4,29 October 2007
Super 8," Super 8 is super!
","It took me a year to see this and I'm glad that I waited till the hype died down and didn't have to listen to others' opinions of it and hear spoilers. But, when the train crash happens in the film, I already felt like I'd seen this before.But, that's not written how I mean it to sound. This is a great film on multiple levels. J.J Abrams is becoming predictable, but unlike Michael Bay's level of absurdity, Abrams makes his films work with the ridiculousness.Overall this is just another alien invasion film and has a similar feeling to it as Cloverfield. But, instead of an adult subplot that nearly dominated that film, this film has a surprising ensemble cast of kids. It has a feel of The Goonies mixed with Cloverfield.Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths proved that no experience doesn't mean that you can't be captivated by an unknown actor in this debut performance. My one gripe for them is Riley's overused 'mint' line during the film.However, perhaps the most amazing accomplishment is the acting performance of Elle Fanning. I'd seen her sister, Dakota, in many films before and thought she was decent, but I was blown away by Elle. Not just her acting, but her elegant beauty similar to Bonnie Wright and her innocence because of her age gives off this great next door girl vibe and makes the film much more spectacular.Combined with the astonishing acting by everyone involved -- including Noah Emmerich -- the special effects and sound effects make this movie complete gold cinema in my eyes. It's just got the feel of a instant classic and due to the homages to '70s films, it feels like an old '70s Super 8 film.I can't say anything bad about the film because quite honestly, I didn't see anything bad in the film. Steven Spielberg helped J.J Abrams craft a truly remarkable alien invasion movie that can't be forgotten in a couple years. Years -- perhaps decades -- to come, this movie will be a cult classic.",8,0,0,17 July 2012
Up," It's a fun movie...
","This movie isn't what I expected. There was a lot of talk about this movie and a lot of hype brought from it during its release year. It's a great kids film and it even holds a lot of comedy for adults.I had a lot of fun and enjoyed a lot of the great comedy throughout this movie, even though it's filled with a lot of sadness. It has a cliché montage in the first ten minutes to show a lot of time passing and allow for the main character of Carl to be old.Russel is quite a show-stealing character with his comedic relief and the dog Dug who is a hyper-active upbeat talking dog helps give some comedy too. It's really unlimited in terms of comedy.It's got a tad bit of romance, and it's filled with tragedy for more than one character. It's a fun movie full of heart. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sad I didn't take a look at it in 2009 when it came out. But I'm glad I finally saw it. It's one of the best Pixar has ever had to offer.",8,1,1,30 March 2011
Groundhog Day," Comedy or Drama?
","Groundhog Day is more than just a classic Bill Murray movie. It pretty much defined the 1990s for me. Harold Ramis is a comedic genius and Murray delivers comedy like no other actor before or after his prime. This is their masterpiece.I've seen Ghostbusters, and I still believe it is inferior to Groundhog Day. I've recently rewatched the film and read over some trivia to find that Murray and Ramis argued over the film's genre of being a comedy or a drama for years. I can't say which one for sure, but I certainly find it funny and it is a drama, for sure.Groundhog follows weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to Punxsutawney as he covers the groundhog festival. After his first report, Phil wakes up to February 2, again and finds that he is repeating the day over and over.It's beyond genius to make a movie about this. First of all, this is very easy to produce for the costume designer. It's the same clothes all the time! That is an easy cut of costs, and much like Back to the Future, the location remains the same essentially...so the production designer and location scouter needs not as much. It's also very interesting of an idea to actually make a movie about this sort of deja vu phenomenon.I think what makes me like this film most of all, is the amount of change that happens to Phil over the course of the film. This kind of 'hell' can shape a person from an unrelenting, unloving, uncaring, broken, incomplete shell of a man to a warm, kind-hearted, loving and peaceful soul. It's genuinely inspirational while being dramatic, funny, and romantic.There's not much mature themes or scenes that make this too unsuitable for children. But, maybe that's because I was young when I first saw this and I'd already been watching things like Seinfeld, Fraiser, Friends and horror movies like The Shining. It's still one of the greats, for me, and I think it's a classic that no one should miss.",9,1,3,20 February 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Astonishing cute tale about friendship!
","Jay Baruchel has a great voice for acting. It's a voice that sounds awkward and you just can throw a lot of jokes at him and continuously get a laugh. He's got a sound to him like no one I've ever heard before. As Hiccup, he plays an endearing and lovable character and you just can't help but feel him to be realistic and wish he were real.I knew right from the get-go that Stoick was the voice of Gerard Butler because I kept hearing his accent from 300 when he played King Leonidas. I'm not opposed to it, but it was weird to compare the Scottish accent from Craig Ferguson (as Gobber) to Gerard's. Mainly, they play vikings from the same town.After confronting Toothless, the dragon, with a fish to bond, this movie turns into a sweet, cute tale about friendship between a boy and a dragon. I can see some similarities between this and Dragonheart, but it's slightly different.It's touching at times and just right-out hilarious most of the time. As the chemistry between Toothless and Hiccup grows, Astrid, begins to take notice and she begins to like Hiccup. I enjoyed every part of the story and each scene, either full of drama, comedy or action, was incredibly exhilarating.I cried for a minute during one scene and couldn't help but falling in love with all the characters. They are all written so tremendously. It's a great family film for all and I recommend everyone see it.",9,1,3,12 May 2010
Titanic," Titanic sinks, but merchandise and movie floats.
","We start off this epic classic with Mr. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) in search of the Heart Of the Ocean necklace that would be found in the Titanic wreckage. After failing to find it and revealing so on television, Rose (Gloria Stuart), a survivor calls up Brock to go for visit.Rose quickly gets into the story of her experience on Titanic. We travel back in time to when Rose was young (Kate Winslet). Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aspiring artist who wins himself and his friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), tickets on Titanic. Almost instantly, Jack falls for Rose - regardless of her being with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).One night, Rose runs to the back of the boat. She leans off the rail ready to jump into the waters below - hopefully to her death. Jack sees her doing this and talks her out of it. Just as he is about to pull her in, she slips. He does bring her back over, but not before Cal has come to the rescue. Jack is seen as a hero and is invited to dinner the following night.Rose begins to have feelings for Jack and they also begin to see each other frequently. Rose poses nude for Jack, wearing only the Heart Of the Ocean. They are chased by Lovejoy (David Warner) but eventually get away and make love in a storage room, inside a vehicle.I am not one for movies that go over 180 minutes, but this one has always been an exception for the reasons of it not feeling like three hours and for it being a romance. Leonardo DiCaprio is not a favourite of mine. I hated him in almost anything else, so it's safe to say that I think this is his best performance.Kate Winslet was a no-name at this point and that was on purpose, but she was quickly noticed after this for such an amazing performance. It's no wonder why she was nominated for an Oscar. She is just so easy to fall in love with.James Cameron wrote and directed this masterpiece and does anyone wonder why it won 11 Oscars, and made $1.8 billion? It deserves all the praise it gets simply because it is an epic romance movie. The only epic romance I know. The score is just magnificent and it easily put James Horner on the map.It had a great supporting cast: Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Victor Garber, and Jonathan Hyde. The dialogue between Rose and Jack is sweet and warm-hearted. The action during the last hour is what really makes this so epic. The romance itself is fairy tale.The special effects are also stunning. I can't think of any flaws in this movie which is why I obviously give it a perfect score. Any romantic person will love this. Any couple should watch this together because it certainly speaks to you in that sense.I don't know if there is another movie out there in this genre that compares to Titanic. Which is why I recommend everyone to watch this.",10,6,12,29 October 2007
The Departed," Not even Nicholson saves this one.
","The storyline is quite confusing on paper, but when you watch you can catch on quickly. Basically Costigan (DiCaprio) is not cut out to be a cop so SIU decide to put him as undercover and follow around Costello (Nicholson). Costello's right hand man, Sullivan (Damon), is in SIU as well.Costello finds out that he's got a rat in his outfit (DiCaprio) and Costigan finds out that SIU has a rat too (Damon). Vera Farmiga plays the shrink that is dating Damon's character but having an affair with DiCaprio's.The acting - surprisingly good for the most part. They all try to play Boston accents but fail. I think DiCaprio is trying Irish accent but once again, DiCaprio forgets he sucks at accents.The first two hours of the movie, they build up the confrontation and reveal of the rats. Thirty minutes left and we are about to finally witness Damon and DiCaprio meeting. Oops, never mind! DiCaprio runs.Damon figures out Nicholson is an FBI Informant and kills him! Don't worry the body count continues. In fact, nearly everyone dies. This guy kills that guy, that guy kills the other guy and then the one last guy you haven't seen for thirty minutes kills the remaining guy.The last thirty minutes made me question: 'why did I watch this?' and 'what was the point of this movie?'.You don't write 10 characters and kill every single one of them off at the end. Anyone who said, 'yeah, looks good' doubt yourself now. Don't get hooked in by Nicholson's status. There is no comedy - none. The accents get very annoying early on and it tries to be a cop movie but it doesn't really feel like one. Not to mention F bombs average every sentence and it's more than annoying, its unbearable.Don't rent this, rent something else. I think you'll want your 150 minutes back if you watch this. Luckily, I got the DVD from my uncle so I didn't pay a cent to see this film. Pass on it.",5,3,5,30 October 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Revenge of the Fallen - Review
","Optimus Prime and the gang are back! Funnier than ever, with a bigger budget, Transformers 2 came through with the promise of being more about the robots. Well, almost. This time around Sam is attending college but a piece of the Allspark got caught on his shirt and the piece that was 'hidden' has been stolen.All the key people have returned to reprise their roles. The developing relationship between Mikaela and Sam is romantic and funny, with the ability for any couple to relate to what their going through - despite the alien robotic race.Action scenes are stuffed with loads of special effects and new robots are introduced. Story-wise it sticks to the comics/TV show and stays loyal to it's large fan base.Ending felt contrived and seemed to lack a certain feeling I can't pinpoint. I found myself kinda asking 'is this over yet?' few times and checking the time left.It's rare for me to find a sequel that is better than the original, but it can happen. This isn't one of those times, because the original is still better between the two films. However, it's not a bad film. Far from it. It's entertaining, it's fun and it's hilarious. But I won't be watching Revenge of the Fallen quite as much as I will watch the first film.",3,12,27,4 November 2009
Scream 2," A great sequel to a great horror franchise!
","Amongst the horror genre and slasher-type movies, Scream places at the top, for me. I believe with the addition of each sequel, Jason's value went further down. It's not the same when you speak about Kevin's writing. Scream 2 nearly out shines it's predecessor. Reprisals from the main actors really helped.There was still an incredible amount of suspense and mystery, and still gave the same vibe that Scream does about 'who killed who?' I enjoyed every minute of the film and I found the character development endearing. No cheating and cheap shots involved in this sequel. It's true and loyal to it's fans.Horror fans will still have their heart pounding and blood turned to ice as it's just as scary as the original. Hardly any comedy doesn't help with calming the mind after a big scare scene either. But, comedic relief is not necessary.It still remains a satire film in making fun of the genre and of itself. It's fun to watch and very re-watchable. It shouldn't be assumed that sequels are always inferior. I believe Scream 2 is on equal grounds as Scream.",8,0,1,6 February 2010
Inception," Greatest Film Ever!
","For thirteen years, Titanic has held my number one favourite movie spot. Even after seeing Avatar, it remained there. Inception, now holds the spot and Titanic has dropped to number two.Let's start off with Christopher Nolan. I wasn't Nolan's biggest fan five years ago. I was forced to watch Batman Begins during media arts class and skipped out two days in a row so I wouldn't have to. I was dragged to a viewing of The Dark Knight in 2008. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My opinion of Nolan began to turn around. I bought Batman Begins months ago, and watched it with delight and completely changed my opinion of Nolan.He has really begun to shine in his field. He's a true masterpiece director. He has a brilliance in writing and directing. His shots are substantial and significantly done. His writing is intelligent and goes beyond what normal movies can do. Nolan's work on Inception is phenomenal. A majority of movies, such as Jumper, have to be giving a lot of information to the audience in order for them to follow. Not Inception, you follow along because this type of thing happens to you every night while you sleep.DiCaprio is not my most favourite actor, but I've seen Catch Me If You Can and Titanic and Inception is truly his best work. He's certainly at the top of his game and pulls off a powerfully intense performance. Cobb is a complicated character and throughout the entire film of Inception, you're not quite sure if he's an antagonist or protagonist.Ellen Page hasn't had much work and truth be told, I'm not her biggest fan. I don't necessarily hate her or dislike her movies, but I don't believe I've enjoyed one thus far, aside from Inception. She is a great eye candy, and not your typical hottie. Most movies with a female eye candy, you're forced to watch Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel or Scarlett Johansson. Ellen Page, is a fresh change of pace and while she feels like a supporting cast, she plays it perfectly and sticks out at the exact moments she should.Perhaps the most amazing feat delivered in Inception is the lack of green-screens and CGI. Nolan hates to cheat the audience, much like I hate to look at the cheats. As you watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt, fly in the hallway corridor, you're not watching him on a studio set with a green-screen. Joseph is really there in that hallway floating around.Another astounding aspect of Inception is the dialogue and how truthful it is. Most movies have memorable quotes and have been written by screenwriters. Nolan's Inception dialogue is not just written for people who love to quote movies. It's truth. 'Dreams feel real when we're in them.' Yes, they do. 'You never remember the beginning of a dream, you always end up in the middle.' This is a quote we can all remember because it's a fact. I've never remembered my dreams beginning.Although, it's a thriller and not a comedy, there's a good amount of comedy throughout the film and it's well-paced. I think the screen-time is divided equally amongst it's genres and no one else could do this film better than this crew. I loved Inception and will be seeing it half a dozen times, before it leaves the theaters and I will be pre-ordering it on Blu-Ray, something which I've never done before. If you don't love Inception, you may need to see it a few more times to understand it.",10,5,11,17 July 2010
Scream," Best Horror Film!
","I'm gonna go out on a limb and say: best horror film.Yes, I said it. Combine gore of Friday the 13th, the disturbing phone calls from When A Stranger Calls and add in some comedy. The story is very exciting and it's fun to analyze the movie to see 'who killed who' since the killer is two people.I think this story is very original though it has some similarities to other films. Now add in a grand cast and you've got a great horror flick. The realism is good too, they don't make the killer invincible. He can be knocked down, and he can be killed.Neve Campbell is the star and plays Sidney Prescott. Her mother was murdered nearly a year earlier and she thought Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) was responsible. She still can't get over it as the new killer seems to be linked somehow since when he calls Sid he mentions her mother.Skeet Ulrich plays Billy, Sid's boyfriend. Sid gets him arrested thinking Billy is responsible for the calls to her and all the other victims but when the phone company's info comes back, Billy is clean.Matthew Lillard plays the friend of them all and is dating Tatum, Sid's best friend. Matthew provides the most comedy with his lines and his ad-libbed lines. Combined with Jamie Kennedy they are the perfect comic relief.Drew Barrymore has a 12 minute opening scene as the introduction to the killer's appearance and first kill. Matthew Lillard (Stu) is seemingly the first suspect as he dated her before, but Tatum says that Stu and her were together when it happened.David Arquette plays Dewey Riley. He's the brother to Tatum and friends with Sid. He is also Deputy of the town of Woodsboro. He does a good job but throughout the series his character changes the most, I think.Finally, last but not least, Courteney Cox-Arquette plays Gale Weathers, a small town local reporter who is writing a book on Sid's mother's murder story. She is actually quite a sweet character as the series goes on but she has her bitter sides as well.All of them are very important to the overall movie. Their performances are all some of the best I've ever seen. If the award Best Ensemble Cast Performance was available, I'd give it to this movie for 1997's award show.Just about every scene has excitement, drama and comedy.",9,0,1,23 January 2010
Despicable Me," Misleading Title...
","It has a slow start to get to the premise of why you're watching this. But after awhile, the cuteness kicks in along with the hilarity.I cannot understand the title for the life of me. I mean, really Gru reminds me of an Addams Family (Fester, anyone?) character but he's got such a warm heart and sweet wit about him that makes me question the writers for the odd title.So, basically Gru is a villain and he is outdone by another villain when the Egyptian pyramid is stolen and replaced with a balloon look-a-like. It brings Gru (Steve Carell) to the conclusion of him needing to steal the moon to give him back is nefarious reputation.Jason Segel (from How I Met Your Mother fame) co-stars as the true villain of the movie Vector. He assumes control of the shrink-ray that Gru needs early on to shrink the moon in order to steal it. Gru gets the clever idea to use the girls Edith, Margo and Agnes to sell Vector robotic-cookies in order to steal the shrink-ray back.This movie is full of touching moments as Gru grows as an adoptive father of the girls who eventually grow attached to him. This causes not only the adorable moments, but the laugh-out-loud moments that had my gut turning. I was incapable of suppressing my laughter for a majority of the movie.It's not just a kids movie, but a movie for adults too. I'm twenty-two years of age and living proof that I can still have a chuckle at some kid-targeted jokes, some flat-out slapstick humour, and great one-liners.Despicable Me has a misleading title, but that shouldn't stop you from watching this delightful little comedy that has its moments of adoration. It's a fun movie for all ages, and I definitely think anyone can laugh their butt off at this movie. It's a win-win.",9,0,0,22 April 2011
Speed," Speed is an incredible roller coaster!
","Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are called in when a terrorist bomber, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) threatens to kill 13 passengers in an express elevator. Jack volunteers himself and Harry to examine the bomb which leads to them eventually saving the passengers and finding the bomber. After a confrontation, Jack and Harry think the bomber exploded and are awarded medals. However this ride has only just begun.After the explosion elevator opening sequence - which lasts upwards 10 minutes - Jack is sent into another game of Howard's as he's rigged a city bus with a bomb. But this one has a different catch than just explosion upon a button press. This one is armed when the bus exceeds 50mph and explodes when it drops below 50mph thereafter.Jack quickly finds a way to get on the bus after having to jump from a civilians's car to the bus. The bus driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) must take over. But not aware of the bomb, she tries to slow down before Jack gives the reveal of the whole situation in front of all the passengers.Keanu Reeves gives probably the best performance of his career. Jeff Daniels supports really well, and Dennis Hopper is the classic bad guy. When it comes to the action, it is really amazing. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time because you don't know how in the hell they will keep the bus above 50.The score is wonderfully crafted and goes together very well. Joe Morton also supported really well and added depth to the plot when his big scene came up. He delivered all his lines with great emotion as well as mainly all the rest of the cast. Alan Ruck is a passenger providing comedic relief.The directing and a the script is all top notch and definitely dramatic when the action gets slow paced. No matter what, the tension is high and you can feel it throughout every character - except Annie.Three paragraphs and I still haven't discussed Sandra Bullock - I bet you wonder why. It should be fairly obvious that I despise her. Her acting is less than par level and her voice is dreadfully annoying. She is barely decent looking so it's hard to care for her at all. Her lines have no emotion as far as I can tell, which makes the Annie character pointless. The only reason why the driver was shot was to bring in this character. She quickly becomes romantically linked with Keanu's character. I just think the film would have done a lot better without her character. The only satisfaction I got from Sandra in this movie was her line: 'What you thought you needed another challenge or something?' Sandra is the reason I refuse to give this a perfect 10. It is unfortunate that Forrest Gump, Interview With the Vampire, and Pulp Fiction came out the same year because Speed could have gotten more awards.Overall, the a-list actors, the incredibly intense ride the movie gives, the few laughs you have, the superb acting, the amazing plot, the dazzling special effects and props and the Oscar-Winning sound are all wonderful reasons to watch Speed at least once.",9,0,1,28 October 2007
The Sixth Sense," I see...a great movie.
","The film starts off with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrating his achievement with his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams, who looks an awful lot like Liv Tyler in this picture). When they venture upstairs, they are met by a man who has broken into their home in the hopes that his former doctor will finally help him. Malcolm realizes too late that the man is Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) when Grey pulls out a gun and shoots Malcolm in the torso.The film flashes forward to show that Malcolm is trying to rectify his mistake with Vincent by helping Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole initially doesn't want help from Crowe, but reluctantly allows him to help. After Malcolm learns that Cole can see ghosts, Malcolm figures out that Cole needs to help them. Malcolm is clearly having issues with Anna, she seems to ignore Malcolm at every turn.When Cole helps a girl (Mischa Barton) tell her father that her mother killed her, Cole gains the courage to tell his mom of his gift - his curse. The confession brings them closer together and Malcolm realizes that he's done what he set out to do and doesn't need to stick around anymore.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, it's the first big blockbuster in a large list for him that ends up being one of the greatest films of all time. The choice of Haley and Bruce to star was an excellent choice and I can think of no two actors to replace them, even if there could be a remake in the future. Psychologically, the film gets under your skin and visually it chills you to the bone. I remember the first time I saw the movie, I was freaked out for days after viewing it.The visual and special effects are phenomenal and the thrills that the movie gives you are not in the same league as to what the scares and the chilling twist gives you. You'll watch it again after the first time just because it's that entertaining.In the first and second viewing, it's a totally different film each time, so it's a wonderfully crafted masterpiece which will be remembered for a long, long time.",9,0,0,10 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Rude Awakening
","I am not by any stretch trying to bash Star Wars, here, since it is a beloved franchise of mine. However, it falls very short of expectations and I'm not alone in that regard.I'm not saying this was a terrible addition to the saga. But this feels very familiar. It seems like I'm watching A New Hope told in a different way and with new characters. Finn, Rey and BB-8 are great new characters and the inclusion of Han Solo really helped the pacing of the film and pass the torch to the younger generation. Plot-wise, this movie is nearly a carbon copy of A New Hope and The Phantom Menace. It feels as though Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams, and Michael Arndt couldn't come up with an original idea. I'm hoping that the next film isn't a copy of Empire Strikes Back and/or Attack of the Clones.Acting was average but because I felt like I already saw the movie, it doesn't really engage me in any character, to be honest. Adam Driver was good as Kylo Ren, but the exposition of him was done much too quickly. Mystery behind a character, not seeing their face or not knowing their background makes the villain that much more intimidating. The writers exposed it all too soon in the film. It takes away from the development of the character during the film.All in all, it was an alright film. It doesn't feel like it was a must-see after you see it. I didn't leave the theater immediately wanting to return. Most viewers won't want to go back and see it right after. It doesn't leave a lasting impact where you continue to discuss the film, unless it's ways they could have made it better.I still look forward to episode VIII but I still dread that they will use plot elements from Empire or Attack.",7,2,15,24 June 2016
The Matrix," The Matrix Has You! - The Review
","In the dusk of the millennium, The Matrix was released to screens worldwide, dazzling audiences around with it's kung-fu martial arts, rapid-fast punches, impossible leaps, intense story and gripping heroes and villains.Keanu Reeves plays the protagonist Thomas A Anderson, a program writer for a software company, who also lives a double life hacking as 'Neo' while he searches for a man named Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne). Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a gravity-avoiding woman who has so much skill and precision who make anyone think she is a guy. You throw in the rest of the cast and you've got a pretty good crew of resistance against the machines.It sorta plays off as a Terminator-esquire type movie doesn't it? With fictitious Neo as the Connor -prophetic, we will win because of him- character. Even with that, I enjoy The Matrix for everything that it is. It's a science-fiction action movie with tons of laughs and heart-felt moments. I especially like the effects that were never used before.Actors that do the kungfu moves are actually doing the moves and not using stunt doubles. I hate when an actor is 'believed' to be doing the moves and they don't even know how even 'pretend' to know the moves. People will give grief for the romance subplot, but it's really not a subplot since it's hinted at during the entire movie, it's just that until the end, Trinity couldn't speak about it because she was afraid.I love how complex the plot gets near the end and I love the story itself because it makes you question yourself, the world, and wonder really - am I a program? It's one of the -- if not the -- greatest films ever created and that's something to say because it's science fiction fantasy. I am not alone in that statement, considering it won 4 Oscars, one in the category of special/visual effects. If you hate it, I'd really like to know why.",9,0,1,8 January 2008
Deadpool," Reynolds Plays It Well
","Ryan Reynolds finally plays a comic book character that we was meant for. After the disaster of Green Lantern, years ago, Ryan got his chance to play a role he was destined for.As an R-rated film, and highly discussed by many about how 'this is not a kid's movie' the film is kind of tame in its uses of adult subject matter. It's a good story, about the vigilante / anti-hero Deadpool. It has strong comedy elements, it plays out realistically, and it really works well as a romance too. It hardly even feels like a comic book movie. I'm hoping the atmosphere of Deadpool 2 is similar. Morena Baccarin was wonderful in the role and fits really well with Ryan. Supporting characters of Colossus and Negasonic seemed forced, however, due to limited budget of licensing for more X-Men characters. Most of the action sequences are fun but some people may not be able to handle them very well due to the gore. Humor is very active in the action scenes and the film's R-rated content keeps light hearted. Aside from some of the kills in the film, the laidback feeling makes me feel that the film is suitable for some kids (depending on age).This was definitely the first must-see of 2016. Deadpool is a great film all around and should be seen by everyone, even if you're not a comic book person.",7,1,5,26 June 2016
Easy A," For Teenage Audiences...But Still Funny
","Emma Stone delivers a hilarious performance as the sarcastic and lovable Olive, who pretends to lose her virginity to a school mate, Brandon, in order to help his reputation and dupe people into thinking he's not really homosexual.As far as the comedy goes, it's very teenager-in-high-school based. It's also very family orientated based comedy. Amanda Bynes plays a over-the-top Christian who helps start a rumor about Olive and is basically the film's antagonist.I found the comedy very endearing and not at all raunchy. It's mostly a clean comedy but there's actually quite a bit of romance in the film, surprisingly. The jokes came quick and at random, but very easy to understand. It's relatable to anyone who's attended or is attending high school. It's even easier to relate to when Olive begins to get some flak for the rumors being spread. I have been in her position of having a rumor spread about me.It's got a feel of an ensemble cast, regardless of the fact that Bynes and Stone are advertised as the main attractions. I feel that without all the subsequent characters that the movie wouldn't have had such a great progression and development. As the film progresses, the characters all develop very well and easily paced.I only found one really tiny problem with the movie. I felt the plot was a little bit tame and the 2 film paced a little too slow. I realize it's hard to write this type of movie and be original. I just felt that the movie moves very slow and a lot of the time, I kept wondering why I was still interested...or if I even was still interested. After about the first 30 minutes, the movie is no longer engaging.I still found it to be a decently entertaining movie and it's a funny teen romance movie. It's a good date movie, for sure. It's a fun movie for teens and maybe some adults. It's target audience is definitely for high school-ers. I'd recommend it to anyone in high school or just recently graduated.",7,0,3,29 September 2010
The Ugly Truth," There's nothing ugly about The Ugly Truth...
","Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl team up for this incredibly romantic and touching romantic comedy where two people, worlds apart, find a way to come together.Gerard Butler plays Mike Chadway, host of 'The Ugly Truth', who likes to tell people the harsh truth about relationships, men and ultimately, the flaws of women. Katherine counter acts as Abby, the award-winning producers of a news show, that hires Mike.Abby decides to use Mike as a date guru on the terms, if his advice helps her, they work together side-by-side, and if the advice doesn't work, he quits.I find myself even more so amazed that Gerard is able to play another versatile role and being unrecognizable. He is such like an amoeba changing his appearance with each movie and being something completely different from his last film.The chemistry between the two stars is quite incredible to watch. Unlike The Proposal, a similar themed movie, Katherine and Gerard have better chemistry than Bullock and Reynolds, and the comedy is not playing awkwardness. The comedy is sarcasm, witty banter and ultimately the hilarious truth.It's well cast, well written, well acted and everything goes perfectly together. It's an entertaining movie, but could have done without so much profanity. I'd recommend it to everyone over the age of 14.",8,1,5,23 November 2009
The Social Network," Aside from Inception, The Social Network is a movie not to be missed.
","Jesse Eisenberg is the actor of our generation! That's not an exaggeration.In The Social Network, Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed by Eisenberg and goes beyond the level of what is usually expected of him. What's been expected of the top names in the business, for that matter. From the first line from Zuckerberg in the film, you are glued—eyes and ears—to the screen. He grips you hard and doesn't let go. He's articulate and such a jerk of a character that you can't help to be fascinated and enticed by him.Behind the camera is David Fincher (who is well known for Fight Club) and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (famous for the stageplay and screenplay A Few Good Men) and they both do an incredible job to landscape this film. What speaks out, besides them is the score by Nine Inch Nails frontman, Trent Renzor. I've heard Charlie Clouser's music and they are both Nine Inch Nails but very different film composing. From that very first note from Renzor, it's chills up your spine.First scene sets the tone for the amazing story of the origins of Facebook. I really can't tell you that this film is about the origins of Facebook, because it's beyond that. I went into this movie expecting a lame, boring and slow paced biography of Mark Zuckerberg. This story is told through flashbacks during a deposition where Zuckerberg is being sued by his co-founding partner, Edwardo (Andrew Garfield).It's more than just the origins of Facebook. It's about the people behind it. It's got a lot more substance and endearing plot elements than I ever expected. It's got a great cinematography due to the fact of the ever-changing lighting. Acting is phenomenal and I definitely didn't expect it from Eisenberg nor Timberlake.When it comes to his previous roles, I enjoyed him to an extent, but this role I was ecstatic for each and every time he opened his mouth. I wasn't interested in the movie, but I saw it for the sake of seeing it. I'm very glad I did because if you need to see two movies from 2010, you need to see Inception and The Social Network. This is one of those don't miss it movies. Facebook is a $25 billion company...find out why.",10,2,4,11 October 2010
The Proposal," Funny, heart-warming movie -- surprisingly.
","I have no real reason, but I absolutely despise Sandra Bullock. I even despise initial choice of Julia Roberts to play the lead role as well. However, nearly a year ago, I saw a preview for this and I thought it looked wickedly funny. I thought, 'my gosh, this may be the first movie with Sandra Bullock that I want to watch.' Despite my passionate hatred for Bullock, the duo of her and Ryan Reynolds was unreal. Fantastic chemistry and the awkward faces and pauses from Sandra and Ryan nearly put me on the floor with laughter coming out of my gut.The premise of the film is Margarette (Bullock) is being deported to Canada and unless she can use her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) as an option to keep her in the USA, by marrying him, then Margarette is out of a job and so is Andrew.I found myself hoping and praying that at the end of the film there would be a happy ending of them magically falling in love. Believe it or not, there is some twists and turns to keep your suspense moist and to keep you on your edge.The comedy is outrageous, especially for an actress such as Sandra. Ryan's no newbie to comedy scene and once again, he dazzles me with his wit and timing. I couldn't stop laughing at his awkwardness during the scene with Margarette telling her boss they'd be getting married. Likewise, I couldn't stop laughing at Sandra's awkwardness --that occurs for nearly the entire film.It's a beautiful film that shows a lot of scenic views and has a lot of established cast as the support and secondary roles. I was very surprised at how much I didn't want the film to end and I was even more surprised that I enjoyed a film that had Sandra Bullock as the main attraction. That being said, I do love the film Speed, which stars Sandra, but I like it for other reasons and try to block her out.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's seen the previews. Even if you didn't think it would be good, give it a try. Any Bullock fans will love this. If you're a fan of both actors, this will be your Heaven.",7,0,1,22 November 2009
The Fighter," Knockout?
","The Fighter is an actor's film. It's a great story. It's not all about boxing and more so it is about going through an internal struggle and getting by things that hold you back.This is clearly Christian Bale's movie, and comparing the performance to Colin Firth's in The King's Speech, Bale is miles ahead. Bale astounds the audience playing the role of Dicky Eklund. He is not even acting, it seems. As you watch the real Dicky when the movie ends and credits roll, it looks as though it's the same person in the movie. Bale clearly deserved his praise and awards that he received.However, there are a lot of things I didn't like in the movie. For one thing, Amy Adams is shown as the ultimate woman in this film and she is consistently showing lots of flesh in the film. I also felt it could have been a little better choreographed for the fight scenes. It wasn't focused on the boxing, however, and perhaps that was one thing that they missed an opportunity at.If you don't have Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, this movie wouldn't be as good. They are the ones who make this movie genius, and that's why this is an actor's movie. Aside from actors, this film has passable cinematography and very subpar boxing choreography. But, the acting boosts it up and makes it one of the better films on the year.It's not quite on the level as Rocky (maybe Rocky V) but that's because it isn't a boxing movie, really. It's more of a movie about heart and overcoming obstacles and growing as a person. It's not for everyone, but if you like inspirational movies, this is a good one for the time.",8,0,2,23 March 2011
