The Incredible Hulk," The 'INCREDIBLE' Hulk
","All my previous experiences with HULK movies have been disappointing. No offense intended to the people who made the previous movies, but this is what I had been expecting to see in a HULK movie, not just because of the top notch CGI or the casting choices(William Hurt was perfect as General Ross and so was Liv Tyler as Betty Ross. I was a little skeptical about Edward Norton, but he made a good Bruce Banner) but because it was like watching the pages of comic book come alive, like watching all those animated shows of HULK. While the Ang Lee version was a more intellectual and emotional approach to the story, this movie is simple and true to the characters. The beauty and beast love story, which according to me is the essence of the incredible tale, is more prominent in this movie. Sure there are lot of differences from the original story by Stan Lee, but it hardly bothered me as I watched the big green hero smash up all in his path and clash with the mighty Abomination. As opposed to Hulk(2003), this one was befittingly titled The 'INCREDIBLE' Hulk.",7,0,0,16 July 2009
