Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Although Kazakhstan A Glorious Country, It Have A Problem, Too: Economic, Social, And Jew.' --- Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen)
","'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (2006) Directed By: Larry Charles Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen & Ken Davitian MPAA Rating: 'R' (for pervasive strong crude and sexual content including graphic nudity, and language) Sacha Baron Cohen is probably best known for his work on the hugely-popular 'Da Ali G Show'. One of the characters portrayed in the television series was Kazakhstani television reporter, Borat (played by Cohen). Borat was famous for being anti-Semitic and for being a nymphomaniac. There is not a person in this world of which this man has not made funbut, just to be safe, Cohen decided to expand his character to the silver screen and, thus, we have 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'. I had heard a variety of things about this movie. This movie is one of those that you will either love or you will hate. It's a crude, rude, and deeply shameless movie that takes aim at everyone, from President Bush to Jews. 'We support your war of terror,' Borat cries to a crowd at a rodeo. Nothing is left unscathed when Borat comes to America and, surprisingly enough, I enjoyed every minute of it. I adore movies that are politically incorrect (i.e. 'Thank You for Smoking' and 'American Dreamz') and 'Borat' is probably the most incorrect of them all.Kazakhstani TV personality Borat (Cohen) is sent by his country's government to give a report on 'the greatest country in the world'--yes, the United States of America. Heading to New York first, Borat and his documentary crew begin to interview various people and make friendsor, more appropriately, enemiesall over the city. But, when Borat happens upon a rerun of 'Baywatch', he falls head over heels in love with Pamela Anderson. Soon, Borat begins a road trip across the United States to California so that he may find Pamela and marry her. You have probably heard about the multiple lawsuits against Sacha Baron Cohen and this movie. That is because many (some say all, but I seriously doubt that) of the scenes were shot without a script and with unknowing individuals who fall prey to Cohen's performance. This means that this movie, aside from the actual character of Borat, is as real as possible. I understand why the people in the movie would be angry about being fooled, but I can't help but to assume that this is why the movie worked so well. The genuine reactions of these random people to Borat are priceless and provide more laughs than the title character himself.The performancesokay, performance is absolutely flawless. Having never seen 'Da Ali G Show', I wasn't sure about Sacha Baron Cohen and, in all honesty, from the previews, he just looked very annoying. I was prepared to hate him, but, once the movie started, I just couldn't help but love him. He's hilarious and immediately engaging. The only other performance is that of Ken Davitian who plays Borat's partner in crime Azamat Bagatov. He provided a stark contrast to Cohen's over-the-top performance and his inclusion was probably one of the smartest things the filmmakers did. If not for Davitian's more subdued character, Cohen's Borat would probably have irritated me more than he already did. The rest of the cast predominately included unwitting victims to Cohen's game and, though I am sure that some of them are probably staged actors and actresses, I won't waste time trying to differentiate between the actual actors and just regular people. Though, if they were actors and actresses, they did a good job.This movie is an open-and-shut case. It's a simple comedy, much like 'Jackass Number Two'. A grown man does stupid stuff and we laugh--this isn't rocket science and it certainly shouldn't be treated as such. On the negative side of things, the character of Borat really did get on my nerves from time to time. On top of that, some bits just didn't entertain me as much as they just disgusted me. For example, when Borat and Azamat are running through a hotel completely naked, it was just awkward and gross. But, when everything was said and done, 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' is easily one of the funniest movies of the year. It is crude, offensive, and just plain weird, but very effective. Sure, you may feel guilty for laughing at the end, but the important thing is that you will laughfor the entire time.Final Thought: 'Borat' will make you laugh and that is enough reason to watch.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",8,2,7,14 April 2007
Mission: Impossible III," 'I'm Part Of An AgencyCalled The IMF' --- Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)
","'Mission: Impossible III' (2006) Directed By: J.J. Abrams Starring: Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Monaghan, Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, Keri Russell, & Simon Pegg MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for intense sequences of frenetic violence and menace, disturbing images and some sensuality) 'Mission: Impossible III' was a sketchy project from the beginningso much so that I was beginning to doubt whether or not the movie would ever be made. David Fincher was first set to direct, but had to drop out to produce 'Lords of Dogtown' (not the best career move on Fincher's part, if I do say so myself). Joe Carnahan was then slated to direct, but left the project and J.J. Abrams came onboard. Abrams did some cutting of his ownwith Carrie-Anne Moss's character (yes, the entire character was tossed out and Moss, unfortunately, went with it). Kenneth Branagh was cast as the movie's villain, but, after a series of delays, left to direct 'As You Like It'. Oh, and let's do not forget the much-publicized role of Scarlett Johansson who left the project. Days after her departure, rumors begin to swirl that Johansson left because of Tom Cruise pressing Scientology on her. After Cruise damaged his credibility (and lost many of his fans) in 2005 over his obsession with the controversial religion (and his attack on Brooke Shields and Matt Lauer), this only hurt the already crippled movie. But, Johansson denied the rumors and was replaced by Keri Russell. 'Mission: Impossible III' gained praise from most critics, but was a disappointment at the box-officenot a disaster, but a disappointment. But, the question is: will 'Mission: Impossible III' disappoint people who actually see it? Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has settled into a typical lifetypical as far as IMF agents go, of course. He has turned to training agents rather than being one and has settled down with the woman of his dreams, Julia (Monaghan). The only problem is that she has no idea what he really does for a livingand, now, the kidnapping of a young agent, Lindsey Farris (Russell), is forcing him back into the business. When a mission to rescue her does not go as plan, Ethan and his gang of agents begin a mission to apprehend sadistic arms leader, Owen Davian (Hoffman). This mission goes perfectlyuntil a traitor leads to Davian's escape. Now, Davian knows who Ethan is and is willing to do anything for revenge. Usually, by the third installment in any given franchise, the plot line is getting rather thin. Surprisingly, 'Mission: Impossible III' has got the best plot out of all three films. I've seen the two previous installments countless times and I could definitely recount so many of the action scenesyet I cannot, for the life of me, remember any major plot details. They just were not that memorable for me. But, 'Mission: Impossible III' corrects this, giving us a coherent (though, simplistic) plot and blending it with plenty of action and computer-generated effects.'Mission: Impossible III' suffers from one huge problem and it only shows its ugly head at the very end. Throughout the movie, Ethan Hunt is searching for something called 'The Rabbit's Foot'. We know that it is very important and that it must be very dangerous (as the film's villain wants it so desperately), but, really, what is it? The movie never tells us and even has a scene that shrugs off the notion of giving us an explanation completely. Now, some people say that this is just the filmmakers wanting to leave a little mystery and some may even go as far as to say that it is supposed to represent Ethan not knowing what he was truly chasing afterbecause that it is how it really is for secret agents, but those explanations give the movie far too much credit. My assumption would be that the writer just couldn't come up with something to explain the Rabbit's Foot so they simply decided to ignore it altogether. This is a good example of lazy film-making. Fortunately for the filmmakers, they paid their dues in other places.'Mission: Impossible III' is a great action moviethe perfect movie to capture the audiences of the big-budget summer action movies (surprisingly enough, it didn't capture them, but most of that can be attributed to Cruise's fiasco from 2005). The action scenes are, of course, the highlight and there are plenty of them. It seems as though every ten minutes we are seeing another car explode or a plane crash. The pacing is brisk and done flawlessly. I never felt bored, but I also never felt like I was being rushed along either. The performances are good enoughno matter what Tom Cruise haters will say. Cruise is, and always has been, a competent leading man. Michelle Monaghan also does a nice job as the woman who finally won Ethan Hunt's heart for good. And who could forget Philip Seymour Hoffman? The winner of the Oscar for 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role' last year nails his role here, as well. Hoffman is constantly showing his versatility as an actor. I still remember him as the quirky Dusty from 'Twister'--good times, good times. I'll be honest, I had a blast with 'Mission: Impossible III'. Sure, it didn't explain one of its major plot points, but it just blew up another car a few seconds later to take our mind off of it.Final Thought: It isn't the brightest crayon in the box and doesn't explain everything it should, but it is paced perfectly and a lot of fun.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",8,0,0,15 January 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," 'My Name's Goodkat. You Can Call Me Mr. Goodkat.' --- Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis)
","'Lucky Number Slevin' (2006) Directed By: Paul McGuigan Starring: Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, & Stanley Tucci MPAA Rating: 'R' (for strong violence, sexuality and language) I must admit that this is the trickiest review I have had to write thus far. On one hand, 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a well-made film, well-acted with just the right amount of gleam and polish. On the other, I just didn't enjoy it. I could only care for one character, Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and she seemed to be a tad underused. The plot uses a few too many cheap twists to keep the audience going and the dialog is overly-intellectual in all the wrong places. I felt as if the entire movie was just an artificial, two-dimensional exercise in style over substance. It was convoluted and deeply pretentious. It was as though the entire movie was made to give the filmmakers an outlet for them to point and laugh at the audience with cheers of, 'Ha! We're smarter than you'. And, clearly, they are, as I was watching the movie and as I am writing this review right now. Still, I cannot dismiss this movie completely and I will tell you why.A case of mistaken identity leads Slevin (Hartnett) directly into the middle of a bitter battle between two of the world's most powerful crime bosses: The Rabbi (Kinglsey) and The Boss (Freeman). Detective Brikowski (Tucci) is on the case, constantly trying to decipher just who Slevin is and why he seems to be hanging around with the Boss so much. On top of this, a specialist assassin named Mister Goodkat (Willis) has also been brought in by both crime bosses. Throw in a talkative, but cute-as-a-button coroner named Lindsey (Liu) to act as a love interest for Slevin, a fixed horserace, and a tangled web of suspicion, lies, and deceit, and you have 'Lucky Number Slevin'. The plot seems as though it could be a fun ride and, to some extent, it is. The problem is that, because the characters, for the most part, are either dull or evil, there really is no one main character to relate to. Who is the bad guy? Well, everybody, except for the aforementioned Lindsey, is. We are meant to be rooting for Slevin, I suppose, but, as his character reveals a huge twist about himself near the end, it is very hard to get on solid ground with him. Everyone else is a crime lord, an assassin, or a mindless goon.The entire time I was watching this movie, I kept thinking about 'Brick'--a movie to which I awarded seven out of ten stars and a letter grade of a B+. If you have not yet read my review, then I suggest that you do, as these films both suffered from the some of the same problems. In both, I felt strangely detached from the characters. Who can care for people that are just hollow shelves of other characters? In 'Brick', the other characters were from an old-fashioned noir mystery (much like 'The Maltese Falcon', etc.). Here, the characters seem to have fashioned out of those made famous by Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' (a movie that, not surprisingly, is mentioned within the context of the movie). I still maintain my statement (that I made in my review of 'Brick') that I respect this technique. Unfortunately, neither of the films did it flawlessly. Both lacked the emotion and the heart of the characters. The end result was a dull, couldn't-care-less kind of feelingand I hate that feeling.When 'Lucky Number Slevin' was over, I was glad--not because it was a bad movie, but because I just didn't particularly care what happened. I had never developed any emotional connections with the characters, aside from Lindsey (I guess I should just say now that, when discussing the characters in a negative manner, I am always excluding her unless mentioned otherwise). All of the characters (please include that implied line here) could have been blown to smithereens by a rocket that could have been fired from Martians and, not only would I not have cared, I would have probably believed that this was highly-plausible--not because it is, but because this movie is good at what it is: a con. It cons you into thinking that this could all be true with its allusions to the film that obviously inspired it (i.e. 'North by Northwest') and its self-knowing attitude. It seems to acknowledge the fact that it is completely ridiculous and that seems to make it okay, much like 'Scream' did (except without the bitter satire, sarcasm, and the engaging characters). I have no idea what rating to give this movie and yet I know that I must to maintain the format that has been working so beautifully up until this point. If I went on my personal opinion, it would get a solid four. If I went on how effective the movie is, then I would give it a five. Because, it is effective enoughI just resented the effect that it did have. But, as this wasn't a bad movie, I will put aside my personal feelings and award it with an average five.Final Thought: 'Lucky Number Slevin' is an okay watch, even though it lacks engaging characters and has a self-indulgent attitude about itself.Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)",5,1,4,6 November 2006
United 93," 'We Have To Do Something. They Are Not Going To Land This Plane.' --- Thomas E. Burnett, Jr. (Christian Clemenson)
","'United 93' (2006) Directed By: Paul Greengrass Starring: Christian Clemenson, Trish Gates, David Alan Basche, Cheyenne Jackson, & Peter Hermann MPAA Rating: 'R' (for language, and some intense sequences of terror and violence) On September 11, 2001, four planes were hijacked by terrorists. Two crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center. One crashed into the Pentagon. The other did not reach its target. The courageous people onboard fought back, overthrowing the terrorists and, unfortunately, crashing the plane in the process. No one survived the impact. 'United 93' tells the story of this plane and the struggle endured by those people onboard--those people who sacrificed everything so that the terrorists would not fulfill their mission. And it tells their story with such a profound elegance and with such masterful storytelling. With almost completely unknown actors and actresses and shot with basic cameras (rather than the high-tech, digital ones usually used for such films), it tells its story with such utter realism and simplicity. This is not a film that delves into conspiracies, hidden meanings, and other such things. We know exactly what our characters know--very little else. The only difference is that we know how their day will end. This makes the movie all the more emotional and heart-wrenching to watch. From the very first scene and from the introduction of our characters, we know that the flight will not end well for them. It is a bleak, cheerless moviea movie that left me drained and very sad, but proud. I was proud of the heroes portrayed in the movie and I was proud of how this movie portrayed them. This is cinema at its best.Many people may argue that it is too soon for this movie to be made. I do not feel as though this is true. In fact, I think that this is a movie that should have been made. The story of what the people onboard Flight 93 endured is an important story--one that people should know about. How close to or how far from the truth this movie actually is, I cannot say, but it seems like a valid story. It does not appear fictionalized or glorified in any way. Unlike most movies that portray tragedies, we are not given one or two characters to follow and then the rest are simply placed there for fodder to various explosions, stabbings, beating, and other miserable deaths. Every character portrays a real person and we do not follow any one in particular. All are shown as part of a whole. It is as though we are merely onlookers, watching the people as they arrive, learning only what we can as they befriend each other or talk to loved ones on cellular telephones. Our story begins at the airport when they arrive and it ends just moments before they die. All exterior events shown are done so to enhance the events taking place onboard the plane. We are not shown any family members of the passengers and, even when they speak to their loved ones via the plane's phones (or their own personal cell phones), we do not hear their voices. This is done because it was not the loved ones' stories the movie was telling. We know the heartbreaking tragedy they will endure and we do not need to see it on screen. Through the tears of the passengers as they speak to their family members and friends, we are, in a way, seeing the story through everyone's eyes. We are hearing what the families heard and we know exactly what they know (as all events outside of those on Flight 93 are shown through CNN segments).This is an almost completely flawless film and any gripe I had with it are more like nitpicks on my behalf, rather than actual problems with the film. I did not understand much of the airline lingo used in the ground control centers, making many of the scenes set in these areas useless to me. Is this a complaint? Yes, a complaint against me for not understanding what I was seeing. The dialog in these scenes was not watered down for the sake of more uninformed audiences (like me). Much like if we stepped into one of these areas in real life, we would either understand what we were seeing or we would not. The employees would not use simpler terminology for us. This was bittersweet for me. On one hand, I was happy to see that the movie did not sacrifice any of its intelligence, but, on the other hand, the movie lost me in a few parts and I felt as though I was merely watching chaos. But, then again, maybe chaos was what I was supposed to be seeing. Maybe, these scenes were done this way so that we, like many people watching the news that day, could not truly comprehend what was happening around us. Or maybe it was merely done so to symbolize the confusion and the lack of planning and understanding that the people in these control centers were enduring at that very moment--when the world was going crazy and it seemed as though the tragedy would never end.Final Thought: 'United 93' is one of the year's best filmshaunting, realistic, and deeply heartbreaking.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,0,1,29 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'Is The Jar of Dirt Going To Help?' --- Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (2006) Directed By: Gore Verbinski Starring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Billy Nighy, & Jonathan Pryce MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for intense sequences of adventure violence, including frightening images)'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was one of the best movies of 2003. It sported amazing visuals, great performances (particularly from Johnny Depp), and an interesting and imaginative story. It was creative and colorful and completely engaging. Through this movie, we developed great bonds to the three leads and encountered countless supporting characters, all of whom were diverse and complex. It was a movie that changed the way we looked at Disney. The studio, which once only produced family-oriented animated films, had grown up and had done so amazingly. I have always felt that the second film in a series is a make or break deal. It will either continue the original's quality or will fail. There is only a small margin in between. We saw the original 'Star Wars' series flourish with 'The Empire Strikes Back' and we have seen other series fail miserably with their second installments. I was worried that 'Dead Man's Chest' would flounder horribly and then what could have been the 'Star Wars' of the new millennium would end up being a massive disappointment. But, I still had high hopes. So, did I get the second installment that 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' deservedor was this a sinking ship? Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), the flamboyant and unethical pirate that we all know and love, is backand, not surprisingly, he has made another enemy: Davy Jones (Nighy), himself. Facing eternal damnation, Jack must race to appease the most notorious sea villain ever devised with the help of Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom), both of whom have found themselves in a spot of trouble. Just before they were to be married, they were arrested for aiding a pirate and they will be hanged unless Will can track down Jack and return him and his magical compass to Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) who controls their fate. But, nothing can prepare these three adventurers for the wrath of the Kraken, the most terrifying sea creature that has ever lived.I must admit that 'Dead Man's Chest' is not quite as good as 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' and, despite amazing performances and special effects, there are a few flaws. However, when everything was said and done, 'Dead Man's Chest' is far better than most sequels are and actually manages to keep the original film's reputation in place. It is a funny, entertaining, and wondrous film that has one major problem that seems to plague everything else: it is far, far too long. Though only seven minutes longer than its predecessor, it feels far longer, because there are extended periods where nothing interesting happens and it feels as though the scenes are packed with mere fluff that do not add anything to the final product. Ultimately, it makes the movie far too heavy and cumbersome than it should have been. What should have been an easy, completely entertaining watch (as the original is) ended up leaving me squirming in my seat.Johnny Depp is one of the best actors of our generations. He always gives charismatic and deeply endearing performances that just always work. Captain Jack Sparrow is probably the best character he has ever filled and he plays the part beautifully. Keira Knightley is a surprisingly talented young actress in Hollywood who proves that holding a cute dog and prancing around in short skirts is not enough to earn respect from serious movie fans. Knightley always delivers solid performances (yes, even in 'Domino') and Elizabeth Swann is a part that could have been played by any actress with half the talent that Knightley hasand yet she manages to give it a certain spark that makes the part all the more fulfilling and fun to watch. Orlando Bloom always gives his best performances in these sweeping epics and here is no difference. He understands epics and, though his performances in more modern-themed films have been good, this is really his element. Despite being about thirty minutes too long, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' succeeds where most sequels fail in that it manages to recreate the beauty and the wonder of its predecessor. The world in which our pirates reside is expanded upon without being completely reinvented. I enjoyed this movie and had a very fun time watching it. It's the sequel I wanted.Final Thought: Creative and entertaining, 'Dead Man's Chest' manages to overcome its lengthy running time.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A)",8,0,1,1 March 2007
Ice Age: The Meltdown," 'Maybe We Could Rapidly Evolve Into Water Creatures!' --- Sid (John Leguizamo)
","'Ice Age: The Meltdown' (2006) Directed By: Carlos Saldanha Starring: Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Queen Latifah, Will Arnett, Chris Wedge, & Jay Leno MPAA Rating: 'PG' (for some mild language and innuendo) In 2002, an animated film premiered to pleasant reviews and an even nicer box-office. It told the story of a saber-toothed tiger, a mammoth, and a sloth who find a lost infant and try to return him to his tribe. This movie was called 'Ice Age' (titled according to the fact that the movie was set during the Ice Age). It is one of my favorite of my favorite animated movies of the past decade and was a genius blend of kid-friendly humor and parent-oriented humor (Notice: I said 'parent', not 'adult'). It was the type of movie that families could sit don and enjoy together without kids being bored or parents feeling guilty. I knew that it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made and I was awaiting a second installment with eager anticipation. That sequel is 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' and I simply could not wait to see it. But the question I am here to answer is: did 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' live up to the good name of its predecessoror did this movie follow the typical 'The Sequel Is Never As Good As The Original' formula? Manny (voiced by Romano), Diego (voiced by Leary), and Sid (voiced by Leguizamo) are back! They have all settled comfortably into their new, uneventful lives and everything is going very well for them. However, the Ice Age is coming to a close and the ice everywhere is starting to melt--an event that will spell certain doom for the valley in which they now reside. The friends must band together once again to escape the valley and make their way to a 'boat' on the complete opposite side that will carry them to safety. On their way, they encounter many friends and foes, including the very friendly mammoth, Ellie (voiced by Latifah), who thinks that she is a possum, and her actual possum 'brothers', Crash (voiced by Scott) and Eddie (voiced by Peck). But, there biggest enemy is not the coming wave of waterbut two vicious water creatures that will do anything to make our characters a new meal. All the time, the squirrel, Scrat (voiced by Wedge) tries to ineffectually regain his beloved acorn.'Ice Age: The Meltdown' was greeted with a lukewarm reception by critics. The majority of critics enjoyed it, but there were many that simply ignored it, banning it 'just another lame sequel'. How could this be? Could this be? Could this much-awaited sequel not be worth all of the anticipation? I, never being one to rely much on critics in general, still was looking forward to get the chance to see this. And I am glad that I did not listen to the critics who to skip this. 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is exactly what I expected when I thought of a sequel to 'Ice Age'. It doesn't surpass the original, but it doesn't fall below the original either. It is on the same level. 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is a worthy sequel, engaging and utterly delightful for all ages. This is a must-see for all fans of the original. If only all sequels could be this good.As much as I enjoyed 'Ice Age: The Meltdown', there were a few problems. First and foremost, I did not like the fact that the movie ignored the ending of the original. You know the ending that featured Scrat frozen solid on a tropical island thousands of years later only to thaw and again begin searching for his acorn. 'The Meltdown' just disregarded that scene altogether. I think it would have been very interesting to have the final scene in this movie somehow lead into that film--you know, seeing Scrat get frozen, etc. On top of that, I thought that some of the more sexually-oriented innuendos were a little too much. They could have been toned down just a tad. But, I still had a blast with 'Ice Age: The Meltdown'. It isn't the best animated movie of the year, but it definitely falls into my top five. If you haven't seen it yet, whether you are a fan of the original or not, then I suggest you check it out as soon as possible, especially if you have a family. This is a family movie that should not be missed.Final Thought: 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' met my expectation and is a very nice family movie.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",8,0,0,4 February 2007
Silent Hill," 'Honey, Sometimes When You Go To Sleep You Go On A Little Walk. And Sometimes You Talk About A PlaceCalled Silent Hill.' --- Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell)
","'Silent Hill' (2006) Directed By: Christophe Gans Starring: Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Jodelle Ferland, Deborah Kara Unger, & Alice Krige MPAA Rating: 'R' (for strong horror violence and gore, disturbing images, and some language) I'll be perfectly honest with you. I do not have that much experience with the 'Silent Hill' video games. I have played the third game and have beaten it twice, but I have yet to play the first two and probably never will. Fans of the game may, therefore, consider me unable to review the movie accuratelyor, at least, accurately for them. So, this review is specifically for those with limited or no experience with the video games. If you have played the games, then reading any further will probably prove to be useless to you. If you choose to continue reading, please do so with the knowledge that I did not go into this movie with the knowledge that you, no doubt, have. 'Silent Hill' is a strange movie. It is a grim, violent, and deeply disturbing horror movie that takes its viewers onto a roller-coaster ride into Hell and rarely lets them get up for breath. The problem is that 'Silent Hill' hardly ever gives its audience a chance to even understand what is going on, while they are taking this ride, making it all seem far less effective. How can we be terrified of something if we have know idea what it is, why it is there, or what its intentions are? This is the question posed by 'Silent Hill', concerning the dark creatures that lurk in the shadows of the town. What are they? Why are they evil and disgusting? In 'Silent Hill', they are because it makes them seem more terrifying.Rose Da Silva (Mitchell) is worried about her adopted daughter, Sharon (Ferland) who has begun to sleep walk and talk about a place called Silent Hill. Rose's husband, Christopher (Bean), feels that medication is the proper treatment, but Rose wants to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, in hopes that something inside of her will snap back into place or whatnot. Rose, of course, takes Sharon, but, on the way, is involved in a car accident that leaves her unconscious. When she wakes, Rose finds Sharon missing, the road behind her now divided by a huge, endless canyon and ashes falling from the sky like rain. Rose makes her way to Silent Hill, but, instead of help, she finds years of buried secrets, undead monsters, and an obsessed religious cult that will do anything to keep its past hidden from outsiders. The plot sounds simple enough: a woman and her daughter find themselves trapped within a hellish world and must find a way to escape. The problem is that the movie wants to make it seem more complex than necessary. Everyone has a back story and hundreds of secrets are exposed, but none of them do much in explaining what exactly should be explained. It relies on its audience to piece together the impossible to connect pieces of a puzzle, just when they think they have everything put together, the last three minutes swoop in and smashes the puzzle to pieces again.Do not get me wrong. I have no problem with movies that choose to make their audiences think. However, I do have a problem with movies that make their audiences think and then never give their audiences a basis on which to do so. Thus is the problem with 'Silent Hill'. The entire movie seems to be exposing pieces of the puzzle, but, in the end, you realize that you have two-hundred puzzle pieces, all from different puzzles and none from the puzzle you are trying to solve. However, 'Silent Hill' still won my approval for its technical prowess and its overall disturbing and terrifying mood. The movie looks wonderful and the special effects are absolutely amazing. The creatures are brought to life with stunning detail and the sets are hauntingly flawless. The movie, as I have said, is terrifying and kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I had no idea what was going on. The performances are good enough, with Radha Mitchell being the highlight. She practically carries the movie and does a nice job. Sean Bean, whose character was actually absent from the original script, has a minimal part but does with it what he can. Laurie Holden was also good, but I didn't buy her two-dimensional character that came off as artificial and laughably clichéd.If I had been a die-hard fan of the 'Silent Hill' video games before I watched this movie, I may have loved it. As it is, I simply liked it. It was scary, grim, and deeply violent, but I had no idea what was going on half of the time. Why do the creatures exist? I don't know. Why did the ending occur as it did? I have no idea. What exactly did the ending mean, concerning the fate of our characters? I haven't the faintest shred of a clue. It did not make sense, but, for most horror fans, this will not matter. They will just want to see the violence, the gruesome and deformed creatures, and the hellish underworld formed whenever the lights go out. As for casual movie-goers and people who have never played the video games, 'Silent Hill' probably will not cut it. They will most likely not like the overly-complicated plot that does not explain anything that it really should have and they will definitely not like the inane ending. But, it is still a fairly innovative horror movie and has plenty of thrills to go around.Final Thought: 'Silent Hill' is a good horror movie that fans of the games will love.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",7,2,4,8 October 2006
Nacho Libre," 'Get That Corn Out Of My Face!' --- Nacho (Jack Black)
","'Nacho Libre' (2006) Directed By: Jared Hess Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez, & Darius Rose MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for some rough action, and crude humor including dialog) Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise it to no end), but I have always thought that 'Napoleon Dynamite' was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall, but a funny movie, nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of 'Napoleon Dynamite', and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as 'Saturday Night Live' or possibly even 'Mad TV', would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat.Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with 'School of Rock' after all. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke.The performances in 'Nacho Libre' are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines in ever put on paper comical. Unfortunately, this movie just wasn't enough for him. It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's bumbling partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, didn't have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie.'Nacho Libre' just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of 'Nacho Libre': yes, the cast. This cast was justwell, for lack of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's 'Napoleon Dynamite' kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored with 'Nacho Libre'. Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that 'Nacho Libre' is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch Jack Black work. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I am done with this movie and with this review.Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical 'Napoleon Dynamite'.Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+)",4,0,1,5 January 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," 'By All Means, Move At A Glacial Pace. You Know How It Thrills Me.' --- Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)
","'The Devil Wears Prada' (2006) Directed By: David Frankel Starring: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, Adrian Grenier, & Tracie Thoms MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for some sensuality) 'The Devil Wears Prada' was one of my most anticipated movies of 2006. I loved the cast and the trailer, which took a different approach to marketing (by showing one of the earlier scenes in the movie, instead of a series of edited scenes cut together). When it opened alongside 'Superman Returns', however, I had to make a choiceand I, ultimately, chose to see 'Superman Returns' simply because, I felt that it was a film that would be much better on the big-screen and wanted to witness it as such. I enjoyed that movie and I am glad that I chose to see it in theatersbut I still had to see 'The Devil Wears Prada'. When it came out on DVD, I rushed out and bought it (blind buys are not my usual thing, but I just had to do it for this film). As I waited for the movie to begin, a thought crossed my mind. What if 'The Devil Wears Prada' wasn't as good as I thought it was? What if it was a disappointment? Sure, critics liked it and Meryl Streep was practically guaranteed an Oscar nominationbut, suddenly, I was a little worried. But, did it live up to my original expectations or were my fears realized? Andy Sachs (Hathaway) is a young journalism major who moved to New York City in hopes of finding a job at a major publication. When things down go as planned, Andy is forced to apply for a job at 'Runway', a fashion magazine. The job is far from the journalist position she so desperately wanted, but it is something. It's a position as an assistant for legendary fashion editor, Miranda Priestly (Streep). Andy, having never heard of her before, does not know that she is possibly the devil incarnate in high heels and with a Prada purse. Andy, despite not being the typical fashion lover, gets the jobbut she realizes that it is possibly one of the hardest jobs imaginable. But, with the help of Nigel (Tucci), the magazine's art director, Andy will reinvent her life and prove that she is tough enough to handle Miranda and all of her crazy demands. But, what she will learn is that, sometimes, it just isn't worth it.When 'The Devil Wears Prada' ended, I wanted to watch it again. When I am compiling my 'Top Ten' list at the end of every year, one of the things I look at is how I reacted when the movie ended. It is necessary that I must have had an instant desire to watch the movie again right after it was over. I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Devil Wears Prada' and thought it was one of the best comedies of the year, sporting great performances and a poignant message that is not over-baked. Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses ever and this is one of her best performances. It's a bitter, yet subdued performance. She could have gone over-the-top and could have griped and complained the entire movie (which would have cheapened the performance), but she did not. She used great amounts of restraint and it worked beautifully. Anne Hathaway, one of the best young actresses, gives yet another nice performance, handling herself very well. I enjoyed it. The true breakout star of 'The Devil Wears Prada' is Emily Blunt who aced the role, giving a cold performance with a twist of sarcasm. It was great.On the slight downside, I thought there were a few moments that made us question Andy's integrity. I won't go into the details, but I found the moments to be slightly unnecessary. Not only were they ultimately a pointless subplot, but they detached us from our lead character. However, every other aspect comes together wonderfully. The music, the direction, the performances, and, of course, the fashion are all blended together in perfect proportions. It is a hilarious movie that works so well due mainly to its cast and its director who gives a certain element of style and class to the whole film. 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a great comedy that never fails to entertain.Final Thought: Funny and well-made, 'The Devil Wears Prada' proves that comedies don't have to be cheesy and recycled.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,0,1,4 March 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," 'Grandpa, Am I Pretty?' --- Olive (Abigail Breslin)
","'Little Miss Sunshine' (2006) Directed By: Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris Starring: Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, & Steve Carell MPAA Rating: 'R' (for language, some sex and drug content) If you have never read a little story called 'The Little Engine That Could', then I don't think you can truly appreciate 'Little Miss Sunshine'. For those of you have not read the book, I will give you a brief overview. It tells the story of a little steam engine that can't pull a particularly large load up a hillbut, through positive thinking and self-confidence, the little engine that could succeeds. For most children, this story is their first encounter with the notion of 'positive thinking and devotion can lead to success'. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is that timeless children's story adapted for adult and is just as timeless and effective. It is a movie that truly understands people, families, and how they all relate to each other. Sporting some of the best performances of the year (particularly from the young little Abigail Breslin), 'Little Miss Sunshine' is the year's best comedy and one of the best comedies of the past few years.Olive (Breslin) is a young girl who only wants to be pretty and to win a beauty contest. When she gets the chance to compete in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' pageant, her diverse family all pile into a VW van to take a cross-country trip to get her to the pageant in time. Her family contains some of the most awkward yet lovable characters ever formulated, including her caring mother, Sheryl (Collette), her controlling motivational speaker of a father, Richard (Kinnear), her brother, Dwayne (Dano), who has taken a vow of silence, her drug-abusing foul-mouthed grandfather (Arkin), and her homosexual, suicidal uncle, Frank (Carell). With a plot like this, 'Little Miss Sunshine' could have easily been just another Chevy Chase 'Vacation' rip-off and yet it certainly is not. It is a touching, poignant film that is soaked in originality, creativity, and colorfulness. Its plot, though simplistic in nature, becomes a complex, multi-layered story as each different character is introduced.'Little Miss Sunshine' features some of the best performances of the year. It has a truly amazing cast that all display some of the most electric and realistic chemistry ever put on the screen. Abigail Breslin, despite being so young, proves that a skill for acting is most definitely in her blood. She owns the movie, completely winning over the audience with her character's realistic childlike wander and understanding. Greg Kinnear managed to capture a very complex character. His character has so many detestable qualities and yet he is truly a good person. Kinnear nails it. Toni Collette took a simple part and made it real. Her character is really the only family member without a significant plot point and yet she never feels overshadowed. She holds her own and gives her likable character more substance than the script originally did. Paul Dano speaks only a few times in the movie and yet manages to be a sympathetic, relatable character that we grow to love just as much as any of the other family members. Dano achieves this through facial expressions and slight mannerisms. Steve Carell plays a gay man and yet he does not flaunt it. He underplays it, not giving a clichéd, stereotypical performance. I definitely respected the realism he injected into the part.When comparing 'Little Miss Sunshine' to 'The Little Engine That Could', one cannot simply discuss the message they both share. 'Little Miss Sunshine', itself, is surprisingly comparable to that little engine. Here was an independent comedy that, like many films of the same ilk, could have been praised by critics and ignored by audiences. However, it became a surprise hit, winning over critics, audiences, and Oscar voters, as well. It became one of the most successful independent films ever, grossing nearly $60 million on an $8 million budget. Much of this can be attributed to the amazing press it received from its premiere and, fortunately (as so many bad movies are becoming shockingly successful lately), 'Little Miss Sunshine' deserved all of its praise and financial success. If you have not yet seen 'Little Miss Sunshine', then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately. It is one of the most effective comedies made in the last twenty years, giving amazing performances and a solid, truthful heart that is as touching as it is realistic.Final Thought: Heartfelt and real, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a wonderful comedy.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,1,4,10 March 2007
Over the Hedge," 'I Am A Crazy, Rabid Squirrel! I Want My Cookies!' --- Hammy The Squirrel (Steve Carell)
","'Over the Hedge' (2006) Directed By: Tim Johnson & Karey KirkpatrickStarring: Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Thomas Haden Church, Nick Nolte, Allison Janney, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, & Avril Lavigne MPAA Rating: 'PG' (for some rude humor and mild comic action) Are you sick of talking animated animals yet? Ever since 'Finding Nemo' was such a huge hit in 2003, talking animals have been a very prolific part in Hollywood cinema. And I am officially tired of them. From 'Madagascar' to 'Happy Feet', it seems as though Hollywood is being overrun by little animated critters. Don't get me wrong, I love most of these films as individual projects, but I think that we definitely need a break from them as a whole. But, Hollywood obviously has a different opinion than me, as we have yet another: 'Over the Hedge'. Following with the tradition, it has talking animals, a big-name cast, great animation, and plenty of humor and adventure for the family. It's a clever movie and its satirical look at the over-development of nature is genuine, without coming off as cynical. With a scant eighty-three minute running time, it's pacing is rapid, keeping all of the kids entertained, and not overstaying its welcome. Everyone in the family will enjoy this movie! Even for those tired of talking animals (like me), 'Over the Hedge' is one of the must-see animated films this year.RJ (voiced by Willis) is a sneaky raccoon who has made a huge mistake: trying to steal a huge, violent bear's food. But, he got caughtand now he must replace all of the food before the full moonor RJ will find himself on the menu. Meanwhile, a family of mismatched animals awake from hibernation to find a new neighborhood built in their backyard. RJ decides that this is his perfect chance to get back the food and he thus befriends the animals, led by a turtle named Verne (voiced by Shandling), and agrees to help them gather all the food they will need for next winter. Of course, he plans on them getting the food and then stealing it to give to the bear. But, when the pesky president of the Homeowner's Association, Gladys (Janney), calls an exterminator to wipe out the small animal family and to restore 'peace' and 'tranquility' to the neighborhood, what started off as a particularly easy task becomes a difficult, deadly battle. Will RJ succeed in his task and get all of the food he needsor will he become a big bear's next meal? If you live in a nice neighborhood, then you have probably had an encounter with the president of your neighborhood's homeowner's society. She's the woman with the measuring stick out in your lawn or the man who's calling to check up on you if more than four cars are parked in your driveway. She's probably in charge of the neighborhood's Christmas party and probably is very adamant about you having a certain number of shrubs outside of your home. You probably also know someone who has no family and no friends and yet drives around in a large SUVby themselves. You have also probably been seeing an excessive amount of development lately (I know that I have). Neighborhoods are going up like crazy and woods are falling just as quickly. If you are reading this and nodded your head, then you will probably find much of the humor and satire in 'Over the Hedge' to be very clever and very effective. This movie skewers much of the excessiveness that we experience everyday. 'Over the Hedge' will never become a long-lasting classic, because its humor is set for today. Fifteen years ago, this movie would not have worked and the same could probably be said for fifteen years in the future. But, it works beautifully now.On the downside, 'Over the Hedge' suffered from an ample amount of predictability. If you didn't know the bear was going to wake up at the slightest sound despite sleeping through loud crashes and bangs, then you must have never seen an episode of 'Looney Tunes'. I could see almost every moment coming from the very beginning. Little kids probably won't notice, but parents may find themselves becoming a little too bored. Overall, 'Over the Hedge' is a clever comedy that kept me entertained, despite the almost constant predictability. Its intelligent social satire had me practically rolling on the floor laughing. Parents and kids, alike will find it to be one of the best animated films of the year. Kids will love the physical humor and obvious child-directed jokes and parents will love the fact that it is an intelligent movie that doesn't dumb everything down for younger audiences. 'Over the Hedge' manages to balance everything out flawlessly. This is a must-see movie of the year.Final Thought: It's social satire and childlike fun more than make up for its predictable plot.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",8,0,0,18 December 2006
Dreamgirls," 'You Stopped Me Once, But You'll Never Stop Me Again.' --- Effie White (Jennifer Hudson)
","'Dreamgirls' (2006) Directed By: Bill Condon Starring: Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson, & Sharon Leal MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for language, some sexuality and drug content) For the first time ever, I heard thunderous applause during a movie in theaters. I have heard people clapping at the end of movies before and even at the beginning (yes, at any of the 'Star Wars' films), but never in the middle. If you have seen 'Dreamgirls', then you know which scene of which I speak. It is Jennifer Hudson's powerhouse rendition of 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going'. This crucial scene in this uplifting movie is when I realized that 'Dreamgirls' was not merely a movie, but the birth of a superstar. Hudson may have lost the 'American Idol' crown, but she gained so much more. During her season on the popular reality show, Hudson was my pick and I was devastated when she was eliminatedand far too early, I might add. Ironically enough, the winner of that season, Fantasia Barrino, was also up for the role of Effie White. Barrino did not get the role. Hudson didand thank goodness for that. Hudson aced the role with her powerful vocals and her straight-forward, vulnerable acting ability. 'Dreamgirls' may not be the best movie of the year (though, it is up in the top tier), but Hudson may very well have given the performance that will be remembered for years to come. She's aiming to win over the hearts of movie lovers everywhere--and I know she has won mine even more so than before.Deena Jones (Knowles), Effie White (Hudson), and Lorrell Robinson (Rose) are members of a struggling girl band who get the chance of a lifetime when Curtis Taylor Jr. (Foxx) gives them the chance to do back-up for legendary James 'Thunder' Early (Murphy). As the three girls skyrocket into fame and fortune, Effie soon finds herself being edged out in exchange for Deena. As tensions reach a climax and the three best friends find themselves drifting apart, drama erupts and once-sturdy friendships crumble--all for the price of fame. But, through all the arguing and even a tragic death, the girls will learn that fame isn't everything and that the dreams they had been struggling to fulfillare only true if they are together. Fame comes and goes, stars rise and fall, but dreams live forever. Based on the Broadway musical, 'Dreamgirls' tells its story with spectacular performances, an all-star cast, and powerful music. This triumphant film will have you clapping, crying, and smiling when you leave. It is the epitome of an uplifting film that will have you seeing stars.The performances in 'Dreamgirls' are easily the highlight of the movie. Jamie Foxx, fresh off of the decent 'Miami Vice', the ho-hum 'Jarhead', and the amazing 'Ray' (for which he won an Academy Award), gives one of his best performances here. He dominates the role of the sleazy Curtis and exudes arrogance and corruption. Beyonce Knowles is probably best known for her amazing voiceand for starring in an Austin Powers movie, but she proves here that she really can act. Forget 'Goldmember'. Knowles is Deena Jones. The star of this show, however, is Jennifer Hudson who garnered much applause throughout the movie. She has put her 'American Idol' loss behind her and has proved that she is a multi-talented superstar that can give a powerhouse performance. Her voice is awe-inducing and her acting is mesmerizing. Eddie Murphy gives his best performance in a very long time. I didn't know what to expect. Murphy has always been an iffy actor for sometimes. Sometimes he is good, but, other times, he just doesn't work for me. Here, he is very good. Someone who hasn't been getting much press for her role, but certainly deserves more is Anika Noni Rose. Rose did a very nice job and should be commended. Somehow, unfortunately, she got lost in all of the star power behind this movie. Don't worry, though, she hits every note flawlessly.'Dreamgirls' is a movie fan's dream and one of my favorite movies of the year. But, it isn't completely perfect. The movie starts off with a very rapid pace, but it loses steam a little too early. Thus, the second half is a little long-winded. But, overall, 'Dreamgirls' is a massive achievement in movie-making--the best musical since 'Chicago'. It's breathtaking, wonderful, and beautifully-told. With amazing performances and beautiful direction from Bill Condon, every aspect comes together flawlessly. If you haven't yet, then you must hurry out and see 'Dreamgirls'. It is one of the most triumphant movies of the year and will definitely have you smiling by the end. If I didn't make my point earlier, Jennifer Hudson is the cherry on top of this sundae. Her commanding performance completely enthralled the audience. 'Dreamgirls' is the best musical in years.Final Thought: 'Dreamgirls' is a must-see movie with excellent performances and wonderful music.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,0,1,14 April 2007
Cars," 'I'm In Hillbilly Hell! My IQ's Dropping By The Second!' --- Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson)
","'Cars' (2006) Directed By: John Lasseter Starring: Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, & Tony ShalhoubMPAA Rating: 'G' Disney and Pixar team up once again to continue the legacy of animated excellence. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen 'Toy Story', 'Toy Story 2', 'A Bug's Life', 'The Incredibles', and 'Finding Nemo' more than once. They are amazing animated movies that are entertaining for all ages. They have proved to be modern classics. The question now is: does 'Cars' live up to the Disney and Pixar legacy? Does it retain the same excellence executed so brilliantly in the four movies that came before it? Well, mostly yesbut a pinch of no. 'Cars' is a charming family movie with an excellent array of intriguing characters and a wonderful voice-over cast. But, there was something missing and I'm still not sure what it is. It just wasn't quite as good as the other projects from Disney and Pixarwhich, please let me stress, does not mean that 'Cars' is not a good movie--quite the opposite actually. 'Cars' kept me entertained throughout and presented a seamless balance between entertaining adults and entertaining kids. If you were a fan of the other Disney/Pixar, then 'Cars' will, no doubt, find a warm place in your heart, as well. Though, don't expect this to surpass the likes of 'Finding Nemo'.Lightning McQueen (voiced by Wilson) is a big-time racecar who has the chance to win the Piston Cup, gain better sponsoring, and become the greatest champion racing has ever seen. But, on his way to the cup, he accidentally falls off of the truck carrying him and crashes into the small town of Radiator Springs, home to eclectic bunch of cars, including Mayor Doc Hudson (voiced by Newman) and the beautiful attorney, Sally (voiced by Hunt). McQueen accidentally destroys the only road in the town and, as punishment, is sentenced to community service. He must repair the road before he can leave. As all of his plans for escape fail miserably, McQueen slowly becomes closer to the somewhat wacky citizens of Radiator Springsespecially to Sally. But, with the Piston Cup quickly growing, will Lightning choose his old lifestyle or will he stay at the quirky, but lovable Radiator Springshis one chance to find a caring place in the world. Life is a journey. Enjoy the trip.I missed 'Cars' in theaters, but I managed to watch it at the school (where I work) with my group of children (all are in Kindergarten). I, as well as the two teachers with whom I work and every student, had a blast. 'Cars' shows that I should probably rethink my average reviews of such animated films as 'The Wild'. If Disney and Pixar (combined) can consistently make amazing animated movies year after year, then why shouldn't any other studio? But, that is beside the point. 'Cars' has got some of the best laughs in the world and is amazingly creative. The cars in this movie all have very human characteristics transformed to feet the fact that they are automobiles. If you have ever been to a concert or to any big event, you have probably done 'The Wave'. The cars also do the waveexcept instead of raising their arms in the air, they flash their headlights. The movie is filled with moments like these and 'Cars' seems to enjoy packing itself with small bits of humor that you will miss on your first showing. I know that, even though I have seen the movie approximately three times, I still haven't found everything.I know that the 'Cars' fanboys will probably give me heat for thisand I am sure that many of them will probably discontinue reading this review at my very next sentence. 'Cars' seems far too similar to 'Doc Hollywood'--and that, my friends, is the problem. Disney and Pixar, when together, typically revel in their original story lines. Yet, 'Cars' was far too reminiscent of the Michael J. Fox comedy from 1991. Trade a wealthy, young doctor for a cocky, young racecar and you have 'Cars'. I really must admit that this was the most disappointing aspect of the movie, though I am sure that most six-year-olds have never even heard of 'Doc Hollywood' or even of Michael J. Fox. However, 'Cars' almost completely makes up for that with its creativity everywhere else and with its characters. The bright spot of 'Cars' is the cars themselves. Everyone, from Lightning McQueen to Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), seem to have their own personalities. 'Cars' proves that, if you want a good animated movie, Disney/Pixar is STILL the company to trust.Final Thought: Though not the best film from Disney and Pixar, it is easily one the best animated movies of the year.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",9,0,0,15 January 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," 'Don't Let It Control You.' --- Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)
","'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006) Directed By: Brett Ratner Starring: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Kelsey Grammar, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, & Aaron Stanford MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for intense sequences of action violence, some sexual content and language) 'When an individual acquires great power, the use or misuse of that power is everything, Will it be used for the greater good or will it be used for personal or destructive ends? Now this is a question we must all ask ourselves. Why? Because, we are mutants.' --- Professor Charles Xavier.The above quote sums up 'X-Men: The Last Stand' well, considering that it is the supposed final installment in one of the greatest superhero sagas ever put onto screen and the director of the first two films, Bryan Singer, turned the director's chair over to Brett Ratner--yes, Brett Ratner, the director of numerous music videos and the 'Rush Hour' series. Ratner gained a vast amount of power with the studio's decision to hire him and what he did with that power mattered greatly to every fan of this franchise. Well, did he use it for the greater good or did he use it for destructive ends? In all actuality, Ratner did both of these things. On one hand, he made a fun, exciting, and engaging film with many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. On the other hand, there is a lack of a conclusion to this film, making this a disappointing final installment. It would seem that someone forgot to tell the screenwriters that this was 'The Last Stand'not just another sequel. Or maybe this was their plan all along--call this the final movie so everyone rushes out to see it and then release yet another sequel a few years down the road. Let's hope that is the caseotherwise, the 'X-Men' franchise has let me and many others down.The world's population is split in half when a cure for the Mutant X gene is discovered. Should the cure be turned into weapons that could force mutants to give up their powers or should the cure be on an optional basis only? On top of that, Jean Grey (Janssen), who was thought to be dead, has returned and has gained far more power than any other mutant could ever wish to have. She is now the Phoenix, a 'Level Five' mutant who could destroy the world in a matter of seconds if she so desires. Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) and the other X-Men seek to help Jean control this dark, evil side of her powers, but Magneto (McKellen) wants to harvest her power to help his Brotherhood of Mutants. Jean, unable to control her alternate self, the Phoenix, cannot escape the upcoming war, which will be raged between man and mutantand between mutant and mutant. Can Professor X, Wolverine (Jackman), Storm (Berry), and the other X-Men stop Magneto, fight the war, and rescue Jean before Magneto gains ultimate power? Whose side will you stand on? When Brett Ratner was named the director of the final installment in the 'X-Men' series, fans were up in arms and it seemed as though everyone was expecting Ratner to fail? Fortunately, he didn't. In fact, the only thing he didn't do correctly was choosing to work with this script. Very few expected the change in screenwriters to affect the movie so highly. Unfortunately, it did. The screenwriters here handle most of the film well enough, but, when they falter, they fail miserably. So many ends are left unconnected. Characters that we have grown to love (or hate) vanish and are never seen again, leaving their fates up to interpretation. Many of the characters we loved from the first two films are given a limited amount of screen time in favor of new, pointless characters. In all honestly characters such as Angel (Ben Foster) and Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) are completely useless and wasted on dull parts. They could have easily been cut out completely and it seems as though they were merely added for the sake of telling the fanboys that these comic book characters would be in the film. Had this been another sequel, I would have enjoyed this movie far more and, if another film is made, my opinions of this film will improve greatly. As it is the final movie, at this point in time, I find myself slightly disappointed. I wanted more of a conclusion to this amazing franchise and that was something 'The Last Stand' lacked.Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed 'X-Men: The Last Stand'. It is an action-packed, electrifying film that isn't afraid to kill off main characters or completely change everything we know about them. It held my attention constantly and, if another film is made, I would probably say that this is a great movie. As the end of a trilogy, I must say that it doesn't quite cut it. It's a notch below the previous two installments, in terms of emotional resonance and characterization, as well. Still, when this movie ended, I had had a good time and, when watching the three films back-to-back, I couldn't notice any real drastic decrease in quality. They all work together nicely. I simply hope that this is not, as the title suggests, the last stand for the X-Men and that we will be seeing another film in a few years' time--a film that concludes the series far better than this. Bring on the next 'X-Men' film, because I am ready.Final Thoughts: As just a sequel, it is great. As a conclusion of a series, it is just good.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",7,0,0,3 December 2006
The Illusionist," 'Everything You Have Seen Here Has Been An Illusion.' --- Eisenheim (Edward Norton)
","'The Illusionist' (2006) Directed By: Neil Burger Starring: Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell, & Eddie Marsan MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for some sexuality and violence) I had heard wonderful things about 'The Illusionist' from all of my friends so I was very excited to get the chance to see it. With its great cast, it looked like one of the best movies of the year. But, I'll be honest; I've been so disappointed with many movies this year so I was a little hesitant. I am sick of being disappointed, but that seems to be what most Hollywood films do lately. So, I was very surprised when 'The Illusionist' turned out to bewell, a beautiful and great movie that kept me thinking without completely losing me. It is a magical and deeply-involving film that is brought to life with vivid imagination and colorful direction, giving the film a surreal aura of mystery. This is what movies are supposed to be.Edward Norton stars as Eisenheim, a talented magician who captivates the world with his magnificent illusions that are unlike anything anyone has seen before. When he was younger, he fell deeply in love with Sophie (Jessica Biel), a girl who is far above his social standing. The two were told that they can never be together and, for years, it seemed as though this were trueuntil Sophie happened to attend one of Eisenheim's performances. But, she is engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopoldand it seems as though there love is destined to be forgotten. But, Sophie still harbors much love for Eisenheim and Leopold reveals himself to be a greed-filled, power-hungry man who wants nothing but power. Eisenheim, desperate to be with Sophie, plans his greatest illusion yetone that will shock the entire city and make everyone question what they have seen.Great performances fill 'The Illusionist' with the highlight being, of course, Edward Norton. Norton does not overplay the part and, instead, does the complete opposite. He underplays it, lending to his character's mystery and intrigue. Jessica Biel makes for a beautiful and sympathetic love interest for Eisenheim. She shows that she is a versatile actress who can do more than just beat the crap out of a chainsaw-wielding maniac while wearing a wet, white tank top. Paul Giamatti, fresh off of the disaster that was 'Lady in the Water', gives a solid performance here. Rufus Sewell is wonderfully villainous as Crown Prince Leopold. He gives a confident, fulfilling performance that I thought worked very well.'The Illusionist' is not a perfect film, however. I, personally, thought the plot twist was quite easy to figure out. I've never been one to brag about being able to guess endings to movies, because I don't typically know what is going to happen until it does. But, 'The Illusionist' was different. I felt that everything was quite obviously leading up to the big twist. This isn't a horrible thing, but it lessened the 'big reveal' for me. But, a predictable twist is hardly the worst thing that could happen to a movie. The remainder of 'The Illusionist' more than makes up for it and makes the film a well-told, beautiful, and deeply magical story brought to life with brilliant direction and superb performances. If you haven't seen 'The Illusionist', then you are doing yourself a grave disservice. It is a movie that everyone should be watching.Final Thought: 'The Illusionist' is a brilliant film.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",9,1,1,14 April 2007
Children of Men," 'Your Baby Is The Miracle The Whole World Has Been Waiting For.' --- Jasper (Michael Caine)
","'Children of Men' (2006) Directed By: Alfonso Cuarón Starring: Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Claire-Hope Ashitey, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris, & Peter Mullan MPAA Rating: 'R' (for strong violence, language, some drug use and brief nudity) When 'Children of Men' ended, I left the theater, feeling drained, depressed, and yet oddly content. Because, after nearly two hours of watching death, destruction, and war, we are left with an uplifting finale--an ending that, despite all of the atrocities we have witnessed, has a glimmer of hope. 'Children of Men' is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen all year, being both completely enthralling and visually arresting. Sporting superb performances from Clive Owen and Claire-Hope Ashitey and the rest of the cast and one of the most intriguing premises presented this year, 'Children of Men' is a massive achievement in movie-making. It is one of the strongest, most poignant films imaginable. It is an effective film, but, with that said, I must admit that its effect is very disturbing. In my theater, two people walked out and I suspect that it was because they could not handle the shocking material presented here. I, however, could not have left for I could never have pulled my eyes off of the screen. Moving and ultimately chilling, 'Children of Men' is a must-see film.In 2027, the world is in a very chaotic state. No more children are being born and the world's youngest person has just died at the age of eighteen. Theo (Owen) just wants to live out his life without much troubleuntil his ex-wife, Julian (Moore), comes and asks for his help. She introduces him to Kee (Ashitey), a young woman who is miraculously pregnant. Julian, a known rebel and target for the police, tells Theo that he must take Kee to a sanctuary at the sea where a group of scientists can hopefully use Kee's birth as a way to save the future of mankind. But, as Theo makes his way across the war-torn country into the very bowels of a hellish world, he will discover that, even in the darkest days of what could be the end of the world, there are still people who careand that what we once all took for granted is now our only hope.Academy Award nominee, Clive Owen seems to be making movie after movieafter movieafter movie. I'm a big fan of most of his movies, from 'Closer' to 'Inside Man', and I feel that 'Children of Men' is his best film to date. He gives a raw, unfiltered performance. I think that many actors seem to calculate their actions and how they say dialog prior to making the movie, but that does not appear to be Owen's technique here. His performance is steeped in realism. Julianne Moore got second billing despite having very limited screen time. I thought that her casting was purely brilliant. Moore is a big-name actress and it's great to see an actress of her caliber taking a limited role in a film. It gives the film an element of surprise that is reminiscent of what Alfred Hitchcock did in 'Psycho' (1960). I love Michael Caine and he gives a great performance here. The real gem for me, however, is Claire-Hope Ashitey. The marketing executives of 'Children of Men' practically ignored her when cutting trailers, making posters, and creating TV spots and yet she proves to be an amazing, beautiful actress who gives a perfectly credible and sympathetic performance. It worked so well. She completely blew me away.As I have said, people left my theater before finishing the movie. 'Children of Men' is not for everyone. Sensitive viewers will probably want to stay away and, even if all of the language and the brief glimpse of nudity were removed, it certainly isn't for young audiences. It is a shocking and depressing movie that rockets through violence, terror, and war to finally deliver a slightly hopeful ending. I am not often left completely speechless by a movie, but, when 'Children of Men' ended, I really didn't feel like talking. I needed time to digest what I had seen and to truly comprehend everything. 'Children of Men' is a must-see for mature viewers who can handle it. It is truly an amazing, brilliant movie that affects you emotionally. It's unlike anything I have ever seen beforeand, in a world where most movies are clichéd rip-offs or remakes, that comment speaks volumes about a movie.Final Thought: A thought-provoking and emotionally-resonant film, 'Children of Men' delivers a haunting, yet amazing story.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,6,11,14 April 2007
World Trade Center," 'We Prepared For Everything. Not For This. Not Something This Size. There Is No Plan.' --- John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage)
","'World Trade Center' (2006) Directed By: Oliver Stone Starring: Nicholas Cage, Michael Peña, Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, & Jay Hernandez MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for intense and emotional content, some disturbing images and language) Oliver Stone is famous for his movies with intense political messages. From 'Platoon' to 'JFK', Stone almost always has an underlying (or, sometimes, a little less subtle) meaning. Many people suspected that this would be the case with 'World Trade Center'. Stone could have easily lambasted audiences with anti-war and anti-Bush messages, exploiting the tragedy to no end. And yet, he did not. 'World Trade Center' does not seek to point fingers or to use a tragedy as a medium through which Stone expresses his views. It, in fact, is the complete opposite. It only exists to tell a storya true and deeply emotional story. Told through the eyes of two Port Authority Police Officers trapped beneath the rubble of the fallen Twin Towers and their families waiting helplessly to see the final outcome, 'World Trade Center' puts its audience through a heartbreaking and exhausting tour de force. As the credits rolled, I felt drained and ready for a few moments of uninterrupted peace and rest. 'World Trade Center' is one of the very few movies of 2006 that has made me express such vivid emotions. 'World Trade Center' is a wonderful example of how movies should be made. It is highly effective and delivers a heart-wrenching story with realistic characters and wonderful direction. My goodness, I think Oliver Stone has finally made an amazing movie with no political message supporting it.As everyone knows, on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four commercial places. Passengers onboard one plane overtook the hijackers and crashed the plane into a field, killing everyone onboard, but saving only God knows how many people. The second crashed into the Pentagon. The third and the fourth are probably the most famous, as they are the planes that crashed into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center. The Twin Towers (as they were called) collapsed, killing thousands of people and injuring thousands more. Buried beneath rubble were two New York City Port Authority Police Officers: Will Jimeno (Peña) and John McLoughlin (Cage). Their wives, Donna McLoughlin (Bello) and Allison Jimeno (Gyllenhaal), could only wait helplessly at their homes with their children, hoping and praying for the safe return of their husbands. As Will and John lied their, pinned beneath the debris, they saw something that most others did not see that day. They saw the kindness and the true character presented by many people when faced with an extreme situation. As the tagline so profoundly states, 'The world saw evil that day. Two men saw something else'. Thank goodness 'World Trade Center' stuck to this tag line.The performances in 'World Trade Center' are perfectly flawless, as is the casting. Nicholas Cage gives one of his best performances and hits all of the right notes. I found him to be extremely convincing. Michael Peña blew me away with his visceral performance in last year's 'Crash'. Peña knows how to carry himself in roles that require exhausting emotional peaks and, here, he continues to prove that. Peña is easily one of the best rising stars in Hollywood and I can only hope that we will be seeing much more of him. Maria Bello is on a roll and doing very well for herself, with roles in such films as 'A History of Violence', 'Thank You for Smoking', and 'World Trade Center'. After a relatively slow start, she is finally achieving the roles that she rightfully deserves. Bello is one of my favorite actresses and this is one of her best performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal's brother, Jake Gyllenhaal, starred in last year's phenomenon, 'Brokeback Mountain'. It was arguably the defining moment of his career. Maggie Gyllenhaal has that same success here. Her performance is raw, real, and beautiful. I love her and I respected her performance in 'World Trade Center'. Jay Hernandez has already had one massive success this year with the brutal and gruesome horror film, 'Hostel'. He did a great job there and I am glad to say that there is no deterioration in the quality of his performance here. He does a wonderful job.In the beginning of 'World Trade Center', New York City is portrayed in a series of brief, quiet scenes. The streets of the city are either empty or speckled with silent pedestrians. The entire city seems like a very pleasant place. This portrayal is not New York City. It is an idealized glance at New York pre-attack, made to emphasize the drastic change of the city after the attacks. This is a typical Hollywood clichémaking something seem far more pleasant than it truly is to make the negative side of it even worse. In the case of 'World Trade Center', this was highly unnecessary. We all saw the news that day and we all know how truly horribly it was. We also know that New York City was not a perfect world prior to the attacks. There are two moments that attempt to throw off this cliché. They include one of the police officers spotting two possible crimes occurring, but this is hardly enough. Still, 'World Trade Center' is a superb film and is easily one of Olive Stone's best films. Stone made this movie with no political agenda and no conspiracy theory as a propeller. Stone wanted to make a movie with a heart that tells a story of family, love, and the kindness we never knew people had. This is one of the year's very best films and a must for anyone who enjoys movies.Final Thought: 'World Trade Center' is an emotionally-powerful and highly-effective drama with a caring heart, not a political agenda, at its center.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",9,3,6,4 March 2007
Grindhouse," This Rodriguez/Tarantino Double-Feature Successfully Revives The Long-Dead Grindhouse
","'Grindhouse' (2007)Directed By: Robert Rodriguez & Quentin TarantinoStarring: Rose McGowan, Kurt Russell, Freddy Rodriguez, Marley Shelton, Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Stacy Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews, Michael Biehn, Tracie Thoms, Vanessa Ferlito, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jordan Ladd, & Bruce WillisMPAA Rating: 'R' (for strong graphic bloody violence and gore, pervasive language, some sexuality, nudity and drug use)GRIND HOUSE (n): A theater playing back-to-back films exploiting sex, violence, and other extreme subject matter.In the 1970's, Grindhouse theaters became quite popular. They showed the films that most regular theaters would not show due to their extreme subject matter. Two of Hollywood's best directors, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, team up to direct a double-feature reminiscent of those old theaters with fake trailers put in between. For the trailers, Rodriguez and Tarantino recruited Eli Roth (director of 'Hostel' and 'Cabin Fever'), Edgar Wright (director of 'Shaun of the Dead'), and Rob Zombie (director of 'House of 1000 Corpses' and 'The Devil's Rejects'). Robert Rodriguez directed the first film, 'Planet Terror', while Quentin Tarantino directed the second film, 'Death Proof'. I'll break this review into three parts: 'Planet Terror', 'Death Proof', and the trailers.PLANET TERROR: Robert Rodriguez's segment is easily the superior of the two films and will probably end up being the best horror movie of the year. He strives to make a gloriously bad movie and it works because it acknowledges the badness and uses this knowledge to inject humor and fun into the film. The plot is simplistic: a chemical is released into the air and begins to turn the world's population into a horde of flesh-eating zombies while a small group of people try to survive. It is, surprisingly, one of the best zombie films I have ever seen, delivering plenty of gore and tons of entertainment. On the slight downside, I thought there were a few too many survivors by the end of the movie and that Rodriguez could have knocked off a few more.DEATH PROOF: Quentin Tarantino's segment suffers predominately from a heavy, dialog-drenched beginning that stretches all the way to the last twenty minutes. At first, I wondered if perhaps Tarantino missed the point of Grindhouse cinemaand then the last scene kicked in and I completely understand. What started off as a character-driven melodrama became a high-octane thrill-ride that's success or failure ultimately rested on whether or not we could relate to the characters on the screen. Due to Tarantino's seemingly weighty first half, we could feel for our characters and we did care about what happened to them. The only problem is that all of the dialog became quite dull while it was all happening and could have been taken up a notch with a bit more gratuitous violence (after all, that is what made Grindhouse theaters famous).FAKE TRAILERS: The fake trailers that played in between the two films are probably the highlight of the movie with Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' being my favorite. It was deliciously over-the-top and inappropriate and kept me chuckling the entire time. Edgar Wright's 'Don't' is another very entertaining one, though it obviously has no plot and no real point. Robert Rodriguez's 'Machete' (starring the always cool Danny Trejo) is also a very fun trailer that captures the Grindhouse edge. The low point of the movie, surprisingly, is Rob Zombie's trailer for 'Werewolf Women of the SS', which didn't capitalize on the werewolf angle enough. However, it was still entertaining enough to work. It just isn't up to Rob Zombie's standards (at least those set by 'The Devil's Rejects') and is more on the level of his disappointing 'House of 1000 Corpses'.Final Thought: Overall, 'Grindhouse' is a great movie and far more fun that any movie released so far this year. It delivers bloody action and tight thrills with that Grindhouse grunge as only Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino could do it.~ 'Planet Terror': 10/10 (A+) ~ 'Death Proof': 9/10 (A) ~ Fake Trailers: 9/10 (A)Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",9,2,8,14 April 2007
Invincible," 'Even If You're Down There For An Hour, You're Down There.' --- Tommy (Kirk Acevedo)
","'Invincible' (2006) Directed By: Ericson Core Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Banks, Greg Kinnear, Kevin Conway, & Michael Rispoli MPAA Rating: 'PG' (for sports action and some mild language) Wait just one minute! Haven't I seen this movie before? Inspirational movie? Check! Based on a particular sport? Check! Based on a true story? Check! Has a happy ending? Check? Predictable? Double-check! Made by Disney? Triple-Check! Okay, okay, I haven't seen this movie beforebut I've seen COUNTLESS movies just like it, three of the most noticeable ones ('Remember the Titans', 'Glory Road', and 'The Rookie') being made by the very same company as this--yes, Disney. Everything, even the 70's soundtrack, has been used beforeby Disney films no less. You can figure out every minute of this movie, from the hopeful beginning to the happy ending, and everything (and I stress the word 'everything') will happen exactly as you believe it will. 'Invincible' has no surprises, no originality, and really no point. Sure, the movie works on a very basic level (especially for people who have never seen another movie in their lives), but that can only be expected. After all, it copied at least three movies that worked far better.Vince Papale (Wahlberg) loves football, but really only has experience playing around with his friends. When the Philadelphia Eagles hold an open try-out, Vince's friends convince him to give it a shot. Of course, Vince does and is whisked off to football camp where he is to train for one of the spots on the team. But, with everyone doubting him and expecting him to be cut at any time, can Vince gain the courage and the determination to keep going? Strangely enough, this movie completely ignores the fact that Vince played football for the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League as a wide receiver until 1975. This is what earned him a meeting with Coach Dick Vermeil (played by Kinnear). The movie desires so desperately to pull off the whole 'unknown bartender becomes professional football player' that it completely trivializes Papale's actual life. Why was the fact that Papale has since gone on to help students in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania? 'Invincible' makes Papale's story out to be one of luck and being in the right place at the right time, rather than a story of perseverance, determination, and passion. But, this isn't the first time that Disney has completely skewed a true life story so I hardly expected any accuracy on their part.The performances vary, both as a whole and individually. In other words, some of the actors were good, some were bad, some were good in some parts, and some were bad in some parts. Mark Wahlberg gave a consistent performance, as did Elizabeth Banks. They both did a good job. Wahlberg's engaging made me feel for his characterunfortunately the script gave him no help with that. Greg Kinnear was on and off. Sometimes, he seemed to be on the ball with his performance and I was definitely enjoying watching him work. Other timeswell, it just didn't click. I enjoyed Michael Rispoli's performance, which surprised me because I'm not usually a fan. I guess this shows that you shouldn't judge someone for their work in a movie called 'Death to Smoochy'. Shame on me! The rest of the performances were passable--not bad, not good, just adequate for the roles. That is all that mattered, I guess.At a generous 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, I see that most critics did enjoy 'Invincible' and this surprises me. I suppose that maybe I am being a little too critical. Sure, 'Invincible' followed a strict formula, even with its marketing campaign (the 'Inspired by True Events' clearly marked across any and everything associated with the film), but the formula does worksomewhat. Even though I didn't care much for any of the characters by the end (feeling that the script did nothing to actually bring them to life and relied far too much on the actors to do so), I still found myself cheering at the exciting and well-written conclusion. It was a hopeful ending, but not a sappy one and worked well. Did I know that it was coming? Most certainly, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. On top of that, Mark Wahlberg and Elizabeth Banks gave their bests and did everything they possibly could to save their rather flat characters. I am very conflicted on what score to award 'Invincible'. I didn't enjoy it, but I am sure that many people will, especially if they skipped 'Remember the Titans', 'Glory Road', and 'The Rookie'. Though historically inaccurate (at all), horribly clichéd, and very predictable, there is still a small amount of fun to be hadand I suppose that it is just enough to warrant a watch.Final Thought: Watching it at least once is not a bad thing, but don't expect anything new and don't think you know the true story.Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)",5,2,3,10 March 2007
The Descent," 'Hey, There's Something Down Here...' --- Holly (Nora-Jane No one)
","'The Descent' (2005) Directed By: Neil Marshall Starring: Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, Nora-Jane No one, & Oliver Milburn MPAA Rating: 'Unrated' (for strong violence/gore and language) ***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The 'Unrated' Version Of The Movie*** When The Arrow (horror critic from the 'Arrow in the Head' website and really the only critic I listen to when concerning the horror genre) gave 'The Descent' a four-star rating and named it his favorite horror movie of 2005, I immediately put it on my 'Must-See' list. I finally got the chance in August to see it in theaters and I realized that Neil Marshall is a horror genius. With 'The Descent', Marshall crafted one of the greatest entries to the horror genre in the past decade, combining claustrophobia and bloodthirsty creatures flawlessly. It has been a long time since I found a horror movie that is one of the year's best moviesbut I found that with 'The Descent'. This film is shocking, terrifying, and surprisingly effective. For the first time in a very long time, a horror movie actually had me trembling when I left the theater. And, when I picked up the Unrated DVD and watched it (knowing the alternate ending ahead of time), I found myself even more affected by its unflinching and deeply dark attitude. 'The Descent' is a serious horror movie--incomparable to most others made today.Sarah (Macdonald) is a troubled woman. One year ago, her husband and her daughter were killed in a car accident, which she barely escaped. She has never been able to recover from the devastating blow. Her friends, including Juno (Mendoza) and Rebecca (Mulder), decide that taking a vacation will do her good and, knowing that Sarah enjoys exciting things, they choose a cave-diving adventure. At first, everything is going perfectlybut then the entrance caves in and the women find themselves trapped beneath the earth's surface with no way of knowing whether they can find the exitif it even exists. Things go from bad to completely hellish when they discover that they are not alone in the cave, for a group of vicious, bloodthirsty creatures are thriving down in the darkness and they have been waiting for a fresh meal. Scream your last breath.People expecting a shallow, bloody, and rapidly-faced war between man (or, more appropriately, woman) and creature will be disappointed with 'The Descent'. It is not the typical horror movie and I thank God for that. The first half is a calmly-paced caving expedition that exploits everyday fears we may have, such as claustrophobia and fear of darkness. It gives us to time to develop bonds with the characters, particularly Sarah and Juno. Then, the nightmare truly begins and the characters we have come to feel for are plunged into one of the most horrifying scenarios imaginable. They are trapped in the darkness with the chance of escape growing smaller and smaller with every passing minuteand, on top of that, hordes of violent, snarling creatures arrive and tear into the group of friends. Then comes the war. You see, these women are not the clichéd female characters from horror movies that scream, hide, and cry hysterically the entire timeand then die. These women, though scared and emotional, want to survive and do not merely run around like chickens with their heads chopped off. They fight to the death and unleash their most animalistic instincts in order to survive. This is handled in a realistic and believable fashion.When 'The Descent' premiered in Britain, it featured a different ending than the version released in the originalan ending that changed everything, but that was only a few moments longer. I am proud to say that the 'Unrated' edition features the original endingthe way the movie was meant to be seen. It was a more fitting ending and, for me anyways, a much more thought-provoking. Strong performances by the almost entirely-female cast give this movie an excellent finishing touch and Neil Marshall's direction ups the tension and terror without using clichéd and overused styles. I was happy to see that the creatures were exposed in only brief glimpses or usually bathed in darkness, instead of being shown outright from the opening scene. This concept was probably most successfully used in 'Jaws', but, here, it is used almost just as effectively. On the slightly negative side, there were a few characters that weren't given enough time to develop so I got them confused when things went crazy. But, 'The Descent' is easily the best horror film of 2006 and of the past few years. It is tense, suspenseful, and ultimately horrifying.Final Thought: Are you tired of seeing the same, generic horror movie over and over? 'The Descent' is the cure for that.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,8,15,10 March 2007
Inside Man," 'My Name Is Dalton Russell, Pay Strict Attention To What I Say Because I Choose My Words Carefully And Never Repeat Myself.' --- Dalton Russell (Clive Owen)
","'Inside Man' (2006) Directed By: Spike Lee Starring: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, & Christopher Plummer MPAA Rating: 'R' (for language and some violent images) Spike Lee is an admirable filmmaker, whether you agree with the messages that run thick within his movies or not. Lee is a filmmaker who believes what he believes, whether you or anyone else accept this or not. Many people take offense to his movies, or at least the messages they portray. I must admit that Lee is a very controversial filmmaker and I often find myself feeling that he goes too far in getting his point across. 'Inside Man', however, is not a typical Spike Lee movie. Does he still have a message? Most definitely, but Lee makes sure that it is far more subtle here, instead of cramming it into the faces of audiences everywhere. There are moments of implied racism, though we can never be sure if the characters are actually displaying prejudices or if they are simply doing what they feel is necessary for security. These scenes are shockingly effective and grabbed my attention far more than a bold, blatant scene would have, because they made me ponder about what I was seeing. Lee hits an amazing high note here, yet he falters in other placesmainly the logical aspect. We often find ourselves wondering if a character's motive is even remotely possible and if a man who was old enough to be make a fortune during World War II (meaning that he would have to be of a certain age at that time) would still be able to be in charge of a bank, much less look as wonderful as Christopher Plummer.Dalton Russell (Owen) has planned the so-called perfect bank robbery and he executes it at one of the branches of the bank owned by Arthur Case (Plummer). Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) is put on the case and immediately realizes that this is not a typical bank robbery. Russell has fifty hostages inside, all dressed in the same outfits as he and his cronies. Russell releases one hostage every now and again for various reasons and threatens to kill the others if the police attempt to interfere. Arthur Case, however, cannot afford to let the robbers remain in his bank. He has something in a safety deposit bank that cannot be made public or it will ruin him. So, he calls upon Madeline White (Foster), a power broker, to go in and clear up the entire situation. With the help of the Mayor (Peter Kybart), a man who owes here a few favors, White gets full access to the scene. But her presence and her agenda only intensify the situation and make everything far more complicated. As secrets are exposed and the entire heist begins to spiral out of control, everyone involved is hurled into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse that will grab you, draw you in, and hurl you into a world of lies and manipulation as only Spike Lee could do it. What begins as an average bank-heist thriller turns into a movie of deceit that will keep you guessing until the shocking conclusion.'Inside Man' is a very character-driven film and, if nothing else, Spike Lee proves that he knows how to get an amazing cast to fill these roles. Academy Award winner Denzel Washington takes on the lead and does so with utter competence and confidence. Washington knows how to turn fifteen minutes of dialog into an exciting scene, which was necessary for this movie. Academy Award nominee Clive Owen gives a subdued performance, which works well here. His calm demeanor adds to the idea that his character knows exactly what he is doing. Academy Award winner Jodie Foster was just so 'on' here, but isn't she always? She exudes arrogance and sexiness and it all fits so perfectly with her role. After all, she is playing a woman that feels as though she can manipulate any situation in her favor (and she actually can, no less). I couldn't imagine her character being played by anyone else. Christopher Plummer always delivers spectacular performances and, here, there is no difference. I found his character to be one filled with wealth, class, and powerand yet, at his very core, was a pit of sleaziness and greed. Plummer made sure that both parts of his character were portrayed as they should be, with the dignified portion of his demeanor being the most prominent with only traces of his greediness slipping through. He hit the nail on the head.'Inside Man' is a film that truly understands what it so desperately wants to be and it reaches with all of its might to achieve that goal. Did it actually reach its desired location, though? Well, yesand yet, no. 'Inside Man' wants to be a twisted, intelligent game of cat-and-mouse and was throughout the entire movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat and had me guessing until the ending. I was constantly trying to decipher Dalton Russell's twisted motives and I found it to be shockingly intriguing to watch Detective Keith Frazier trying to outwit him. But, the finale just left much to be desired. I didn't buy Russell's motives. Why go through all of the trouble simply to expose someone's dark secret and steal a few diamondswhen there were millions of dollars right in front of him? I felt that the script was going strong for the entire movie and then, in the last twenty minutes, the screenwriter just decided to put down his pen and walk away with only a disappointing conclusion. Still, the journey to achieve this finale is a great one and is certainly more entertaining than the typical bank heist thrillers.Final Thought: 'Inside Man' is a wonderful thriller, until the disappointing conclusion.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",8,2,3,24 September 2006
The Da Vinci Code," 'What Really Matters Is What You Believe.' Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks)
","'The Da Vinci Code' (2006) Directed By: Ron Howard Starring: Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellan, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany, & Alfred MolinaMPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for disturbing images, violence, some nudity, thematic material, brief drug references and sexual content) When I first read 'The Da Vinci Code', I was completely enthralled with every page. Its rapid pace, intriguing and colorful characters, and controversial subject matter made it one of the best novels I had read in a long time. Naturally, as the book made heaps of money and garnered a massive fan base (as well as many, many enemies), a movie was announced. What could possibly go wrong? The novel, itself, played out like a movie. Surely, any writer and director could put it on the big screen successfully. When Ron Howard was announced as the director, I was even more optimistic. Again, what could possibly go wrong? The casting seemed rightexcept for Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, but this argument has been made countless times before so I will merely ignore itand Akiva Goldsman, the screenwriter, had written some very powerful stuff in his lifetime (a side note: 'Batman & Robin' was not one of them). So, I say again: what could go wrong? This movie seemed like a sure success--one of the year's best movies. But, suddenly, critics walked away from the movie, shrugging their shoulders and exclaiming, 'So what?' Most critics panned it completely, wasting very little time when it came to trashing it in newspapers and internet. The word 'boring' was uttered in nearly every review. 'Dull' often followed it. But, were critics correct? You probably know this plot right now. In fact, you have probably already read the book or watched the movieor, at least, heard the plot outline on the evening news. There is hardly a person in this modern world that hasn't heard about 'The Da Vinci Code'. But, for you people who have been living under a rock or off in a cave somewhere, I'll go over the plot. Museum curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), is killed and Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon (Hanks), is summoned to the scene. Sauniere, after being shot in the chest, decorated himself with numerous symbols with his own blood and the police need Langdon to interpret them. On top of that, Langdon was supposed to be having dinner with Sauniere the night he was killed and Sauniere left a cryptic message on the floor beside his body referring to Langdon. And what would a dying man do before he finally is killed, Captain Bezu Fache (Reno) asks. Obviously, he would want to identify his own killer. Langdon knows this and knows that something just isn't right about the entire scene. Alas, cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (Tautou), comes to his rescue and the two uncover some very strange coincidences about the markings on Sauniere's body--coincidences that were not merely slapped together by a dying old man. Soon, the two realize that they are on the edge of a religious mystery that could shake the very foundations of Christianity.While many people used the line, 'So dark the con of man' to begin their review, I decided against it. I chose the quote I did because it sums up how I feel about the views expressed in 'The Da Vinci Code'. Do I believe that Jesus Christ was really married to Mary Magdalene and that the Church has been covering it for thousands of years? Um, nonot that I really think it would matter. Who says that a married man couldn't be divine simply because he took a wife? I don't believe anything that is proposed in 'The Da Vinci Code' and you shouldn't either. This movie is a 'What if?' kind of film. What if this happened? You know the drill. Chances are, if you are a normal person, the first time you heard about 'The Da Vinci Code' was when there was some riot or petition occurring to ban it. Yes, the Christians who worked so diligently to boycott this movie actually only made more people see it. How is that for irony? Now, I am a Christian and have been for my entire life, but I must admit that many of these ultra-conservative Christian groups freak me out a little. So, like I said, don't listen to them. See the movie and judge it for yourself. I did that with the book and enjoyed it very much.So, back to my original question, were critics right when they slammed 'The Da Vinci Code'? Well, yes and no. On one hand, this movie ruined the pace of the novel, slowing everything down and cutting out some of the more intriguing parts in favor of scenes of slow, piddling dialog. Gone is the novel's brisk, pulse-pounding pacing and lightening-quick action. The film is also far too long for its own good, making it seem more pretentious and self-loving than the book did. The novel was a fun readintelligent and complex, but fun. The movie is far more about telling a complicated story without much of an entertainment factor. On the other hand, Ron Howard's direction is amazing and the movie manages to retain just enough of the book's entertainment factor to keep the audience entertained. On top of that, the performances, for the most part, are nicely-done with the highlights being Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu. Overall, 'The Da Vinci Code' falls victim to the age-old 'The Movie Is Never As Good As The Book' formula, but critics greeted it with a much colder reception than they should have.Final Thought: Though probably disappointing to fans of the novel, 'The Da Vinci Code' retains just enough of its spirit and intrigue.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",7,5,9,24 January 2007
Step Up," 'Do I Look Like I Own Tights?' --- Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum)
","'Step Up' (2006) Directed By: Anne Fletcher Starring: Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan, Mario, Damaine Radcliff, Drew Sidora, Rachel Griffiths, De'Shawn Washington, & Josh Henderson MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for thematic elements, brief violence and innuendo) Dance movies have been running rampant in Hollywood latelyand most of them have been horrible. Critics almost always pan them and, despite the usual strong audience turnout, many audience members leave feeling disappointed. One of the very few dance movies that revolutionized the genre was 'Take the Lead' and, despite still not winning many critics' hearts, it connected with audiences. It grasped a much deeper of the understanding genre than its shallow cousins and sported top-notch performances with impeccable dance sequences. 'Step Up' is more of a romantic drama than a dance movie, though I suppose dance is a huge part of the movie thus sealing it into its genre. It falls for most of the clichés and stereotypes to which other teen romances succumb, but its lively and energetic dance moves coupled with electric chemistry between the two leads and solid supporting performances make 'Step Up' a step above the norm.You've heard this plot beforeor, at least, something very similar. 'Step Up' tells the story of two teens, both from two very different worlds, who meet and fall in love. The first is Tyler Gage (Tatum). He is the 'bad boy with a heart' who is, ultimately, just misunderstood. The other is Nora Clark (Dewan), a wealthy dance student preparing for her senior showcase. When Tyler and two of his friends wreck the stage at a prestigious art school and Tyler is caught, he is forced to do community service. His service: he must work as a janitor at the school. He happens upon Nora whose partner has just been injured. She needs someone to take his place if she wants to get a position at a dance company after graduation. The two meet, sparks fly, the status quo is thrown off balance, and the two prepare for the ultimate dance routine. Does this sound familiar? Delete the dancing and you have countless other romantic dramas. But, that is the key to improving a clichéd plot: adding something new (i.e. the dance aspect).'Step Up' actually has good performances. Channing Tatum is a good actor but, I'll be perfectly honest, his performance here is mixedhowever the guy has shown his talent with other projects (namely 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints', in which he gave a caustic, gritty performance). This just isn't his best work, but don't give me wrong. His performance serves its purpose. Jenna Dewan, on the other hand, aces her role. She worked very well. Not surprisingly, the two leads work best when they are together. They have amazing chemistry and their dance sequences are spectacular. For his first role in a major motion picture, Mario does fine. There isn't much substance with his character, but he handles it relatively well. Drew Sidora starred in 'White Chicks'but I can forgive and forget. Can you? If so, then you will probably see that she does manage to give a nice performance here. My only question is: can she really sing that well? She sounded awesome.When 'Step Up' ended, I realized that, despite all of the clichés, I had had a blast. The movie is, if nothing else, an entertaining film. It is anything but flawless, however. It is cliché-ridden and there really isn't enough dancing. With such amazing choreography, more dance sequences would have been greatly appreciated. I was also a little disappointed with how Nora's first boyfriend, Brett (Henderson), was handled. Instead of making him seem like a realistic character that would have provided more conflict for Nora, they merely took the easy route and made him into a complete jerkthe same was true with Lucy's (Sidora) first boyfriend. But, like I said, I had funas did the audience with which I watched it. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and, ultimately, that is the reason why movies exist. If movies fail to entertain, then really what is the point? 'Step Up' may not be the most original film to date, but it is too much fun to ignore.Final Thought: 'Step Up' is pure entertainment, nothing more or less.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",7,0,1,10 March 2007
Casino Royale," 'I Have No Armor Left. You've Stripped It From Me. Whatever Is Left Of MeWhatever I AmI'm Yours.' --- James Bond (Daniel Craig)
","'Casino Royale' (2006) By: Martin Campbell Starring: Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Judi Dench, Mads Mikkelsen, Caterina Murino, Jeffrey Wright, Ivana Milicevic, & Giancarlo Giannini MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for intense sequences of violent action, a scene of torture, sexual content and nudity) My first experience with James Bond was with the 1995 classic, 'GoldenEye'. From that moment on, I was absolutely hooked with the suave secret agent and the array of interesting characters that surrounded him, from Moneypenny to M. Because this was my first Bond film, I have always felt that Pierce Brosnan was one of the best actors to have ever gotten the role (behind only Sean Connery and equal to Roger Moore). So, when it was announced that Brosnan would not be returning for a sixth film (after 'Die Another Day' in 2002), I was quite disappointed...but yet interested to see who would be cast. After a long search for the new Bond (with Clive Owen as a fan favorite), it was announced that Daniel Craig would portray 007 in the twenty-first installment in the amazingly successful Bond franchise. Some fans were outraged, some were unsure, some were just glad the search was over, and I was one of the few that were rather indifferent to the decision. I knew that Craig was a great actor, but was he the right actor to play Bond? I wasn't sure, but I was willing to give him a chance. Well, having seen his first Bond film, 'Casino Royale', I can say that Craig WAS right for the role. In fact, Craig brings something new to the role: a certain roughness that seems to make Bond more realistic and more fulfilling than any other.After receiving his license to kill, James Bond 007 (Craig) is sent on a mission to Madagascar to track down a known terrorist. Things do not go as planned the mission is compromised. Bond goes to the Bahamas to investigate independently of MI6 and encounters Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his beautiful girlfriend, Solange (Murino). He discovers that Dimitrios is linked to Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen), banker to the world's terrorists, who is planning a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 agrees to stake Bond in the game, with hopes that Bond will win and Le Chiffre's organization will be destroyed. Placed under the watchful eye of the beautiful Vesper Lynd (Green), Bond is at first skeptical of what the accountant has to offer, but, as they face violence and torture together, Bond discovers that Vesper is far more valuable than he originally thought. As the stakes in the game are raised above blood money, 'Casino Royale' builds up to a an exciting, chilling climax.If you will remember, 'Die Another Day' suffered from one major problem: the overuse of gadgets. In just one movie, we had an invisible car, a ring that could shatter glass (how convenient), cell phone bombs, hovercrafts, the world's fastest vehicle, and so much more. Bond was overshadowed by the gadgets and it seemed as though he lacked any reason whatsoever to use his intelligence, because a nifty gadget could get him out of trouble almost instantly. In 'Casino Royale', there are no gadgets and the film returns to the very basics of the Bond franchise. Bond must use his brain and his brawn to survive and, even then, it is not an easy ride. Bond bleedsand bleeds a lot. He isn't some flawless, superhuman agent anymore and that is a wonderful thing. Daniel Craig's Bond is a throwback to the days of Sean Connery and is a refreshing blast of fresh air from 'Die Another Day', which was, in my opinion, a little too clean-cut and pretty.Daniel Craig managed to equal Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, in my book, and is only slightly behind Sean Connery. With a few more movies and more room to grow, Craig may very well surpass Connery. As this is a 'reboot' of the entire franchise, Craig was allowed to interpret the character how he chose to do so without having to concern himself with how his predecessors took on the part. Overall, 'Casino Royale' is an amazing movie--one of the top Bond films ever and every individual aspect seemed to come together beautifully. The performances, especially from Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, and Judi Dench, are flawless and deeply engaging. The pacing is nearly flawless with only a few moments that seem to remain stagnant. Martin Campbell's direction is clear and vivid without being overly-stylized. This movie is a must-see and one of the year's best action films. For fans of James Bond, this is a movie that you cannot miss in theaters.Final Thought: 'Casino Royale' will have Bond fans and audiences in general applauding. Daniel Craig is here to stay.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",10,1,3,14 April 2007
Click," 'He's Always Chasing The Pot Of Gold, But When He Gets There, At The End Of The Day, It's Just Corn Flakes.' --- Morty (Christopher Walken)
","'Click' (2006) Directed By: Frank Coraci Starring: Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, & Henry Winkler MPAA Rating: 'PG-13' (for language, crude and sex-related humor, and some drug references) I have such mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, I detest its marketing ploy: making it out to be a comedy, when it is anything but and showing any funny moment the movie may have in the previews. But, on the other hand, the dramatic element of 'Click' works like a charm. And herein lies the problem, should I judge the movie based on how it was marketed or how the movie actually was? This is not your typical Adam Sandler comedyand thank God for that. I am not what most people would call a big Sandler fan. I have always thought that he has talent, but often wastes it on mediocre comedies like 'Little Nicky' and 'Mr. Deeds'. So, I was not very interested in seeing 'Click' because, from everything that I had seen, it looked exactly like a typical Sandler movie. You know the ones, I am sure. They have lots of bland jokes throughout and then try to form some sort of genuine heart and emotion right near the end. However, 'Click' has two huge differences: it actually has a heart and its jokes, even though you have already seen them in previews, work quite well and had me laughing almost constantly.Michael Newman (Sandler) is a workaholic architect, who is sick of working late away from his family and, of course, having to try to figure out which remote control controls what (?). So, he goes to 'Bed, Bath, And Beyond' to buy a universal remote control. At the store, he meets Monty (Walken), an eccentric man who resides in the very back room. Monty gives him a universal remote for free under one condition: Michael can never return it. 'Why would I return something that was free?' Michael asksthough we all know that, by the end, he'll know. Soon, Michael discovers that the remote can control anything. He can fast-forward through arguments, mute the dog, and so much more. At first, everything is just peachy, until Michael begins to fast-forward too much and the remote begins to act on itselfforwarding Michael through huge gaps of his life. Soon, Michael finds himself divorced, miserable, and with a son who is making the same mistakes he made. Now, Michael must fight to correct the wrongs he made and to try to achieve the life he accidentally gave up.Do you get what I mean? 'Click' is not really a comedy, but it isn't really a drama. It's an awkward mesh of the two that made me feel as though I was watching two separate movies blended togetheralmost as if Doctor Frankenstein had gotten his hands on the final cut. The two parts of the film, if judged separately, are both equally effective in what they are trying to do. However, when you have two effective parts of one movie, it leads to an almost completely ineffectual movie. Had 'Click' stuck to one path, this would have probably been a great movie, but, instead, it was just okay. 'Click' is an uneven viewing experience. When it was over, I didn't know whether to smile or to cry or to whatever. I didn't know what effect the movie was supposed to have on me. I knew I was meant to learn a lesson from the movie, but how could I learn a lesson from a movie that has numerous crude jokes and too much physical humor in the first half? How could I take it seriously? 'Click' is one of Sandler's better movies, but it could have been so much more. Had the humor in the first half been toned down to more serious laughs, the last half may have made more of an impact. 'Click' works best as a drama, but, unfortunately, this drama is tainted by an hour of comedy that, once the movie ends, seems horribly out of place. Adam Sandler is actually great here. He gave an emotional, moving performance that proves that, when he is given good material to work with, he is a fine actor. Kate Beckinsale also does a wonderful job. Is it just me or is she becoming more and more beautiful with every passing movie? When 'Click' ended, I felt conflicted about writing my review. I knew that I could not recommend it for how it was marketed, but I also knew that I simply had to recommend it for what it actually was. This is not your conventional comedy, because this isn't a comedy at all. It's an emotional journey that will show you that you should treasure what you have while you have it.Final Thought: If you want to see a typical Adam Sandler comedy, then skip this completely. It is far more than that.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)",6,1,2,3 December 2006
V for Vendetta," 'Remember, Remember, The Fifth Of November.' --- Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman)
","'V for Vendetta' (2006) Directed By: James McTeigue Starring: Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, & John Hurt MPAA Rating: 'R' (for strong violence and some language) It is the year 2020. A deadly virus has decimated America. Britain is ruled by a Fascist dictator. The British people live in constant fear of their government. One man is brave enough to fight the oppression--one man with a mask frozen in a haunting grin and a shadowy demeanor. He is known simply as V (Weaving). He becomes a thorn in the side of the government and a constant target of the police. But, to the British people, he becomes a symbol of hope...the one person willing to face possible execution for the sake of freedom. By mere coincidence, V meets Evey Hammond (Portman), a young woman who works at the local television station. After rescuing her from two vile night patrolmen, V takes Evey to witness his spark--the action that will trigger his year-long revolution. Now, Evey is a target of the government and must either join V in his monumental revolution, which will alter her life forever, or turn V into the police, which will allow her to go back to her normal life. And she must choose quickly, for, if she does not, the government, led by Chancellor Adam Sutler (Hurt), will make the decision for her.'V for Vendetta' opened to critical praise, financial success, and a strong response from audiences everywhere. I skipped it in theaters, despite the wonderful word-of-mouth, for some forgotten reason, but I had been anticipating its DVD release for quite some time. Now, it is time for me to write my review and I find it very difficult to do so. 'V for Vendetta' is a wonderfully-made movie, well-acted, beautifully-directed, and skillfully-written...though, it feels somewhat incomplete. As it progresses, we are notified of the events that have led up to the world appearing as it does. A deadly virus devastated America, killing most of the population. In fear of winding up like the unlucky Americans, the British elected a Fascist dictator who has, instead of protecting his people, used fear, terror, and murder to keep them in a constant state of surrender. The movie centers around what happens after this. It tells of V, the masked man who fights against the government over the duration of one year--from November 5th to November 5th. We understand all of these events...but what happens afterward? That is the problem.'V for Vendetta' ends with the final stage of V's revolution--a massive event that calls for instant and dramatic change. However, the message that V lived for, 'Ideas Are Bulletproof!', is the same idea that makes me question the ending. Yes, Parliament is gone and many of the Fascist leaders lay dead...though, there are still others. If this Fascist dictatorship is dead, then another government must be instituted and, if it is not, then V's revolution was rather ineffective. Will things change for the better? We can only hope so, though this film does not do much in the way of implying that. We must rely on ourselves to decipher the ending, which is not a completely negative thing, though I would have preferred it had the movie been twenty minutes longer and had provided more evidence, which we could have used to formulate our own ending. I like to think that the dictatorship ended that night--or at least began its descent-- but what type of government would take its place? Democracy? Absolute Monarchy? Anarchy? We cannot be sure. You see, V fought to end the government that was in place...but he did not have a replacement government.Do not get me wrong. 'V for Vendetta' is an amazing movie--a prime example of how movies should be made. They should not rely too heavily on special effects, but these effects should not necessarily be ruled out completely. The writing should be intelligent and should not try to dumb down serious matters for audiences incapable of forming a thought beyond their desire to see a big building explode. 'V for Vendetta' makes its audience invest, not only time, but an ample amount of thought to understand the movie. The use of symbolism is amazing, especially the domino sequence. The grand finale, is easily one of the best scenes of the year and was utterly awe-inspiring. Despite the ending leaving much to be desired, 'V for Vendetta' is truly a wonderful film--one of the year's best motion pictures. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are exceptional, the pacing is rapid, and the script is wonderfully-written. As V so eloquently states, 'A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world.' That statement sums up 'V for Vendetta', as well. Scripts, by themselves, are powerless. But with enough competent filmmakers behind it, it can become so much more--a symbol that Hollywood still has some talent.Final Thought: 'V for Vendetta' is one of the year's best films, even though its ending could have been more complete.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",9,0,1,17 September 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," 'I'm Going Fast Again!' Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell)
","'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' (2006) Directed By: Adam McKay Starring: Will Ferrell, Sacha Baron Cohen, John C. Reilly, Gary Cole, Jane Lynch, Leslie Bibb, David Koechner, & Amy Adams MPAA Rating: 'Unrated' (for crude and sexual humor, language, drug references and brief comic violence) ***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The 'Unrated' Version Of The Movie*** When 'Napoleon Dynamite' first came out, I thought it was very funny movie that worked very well due its quirky comments and bitter humor. It was a creative, original comedy. Then, suddenly, everyone and their cousin began to quote lines from the movie. I can't tell you how many times I heard 'I told you! I spent it with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines!' The movie came out in 2004 and I have just now gotten where I can watch it again and find it to be humorous. When a movie is repeated over and over again, eventually, it gets old. I expected the same thing with 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'but I got a bit of a surprise. Instead of my friends repeating quotes from the movie over and over, it was Will Ferrell who played against his own movie. He constantly appeared in public in character, making appearances in various award shows and interviews. By the time I finally saw the movie, Ricky Bobby had gotten old. It would take a very good movie to entertain me after I had gotten so bored with the character and, fortunately, 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' was good enough to provide a fun time. Had Will Ferrell let the movie speak for itself instead of pushing his character in our face almost constantly, 'Talladega Nights' would have probably been one of the best comedies of the year.Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) has only had one goal his entire life and that is to go fastvery fast. As a member of the pit crew for a professional racer, Ricky finally gets the chance he has always been waiting for when the racer decides that lunch is more important than racing. Ricky gets to take over the wheel of the car and, when things go very well, Ricky becomes a pro racer. But when a gay French racer named Jean Girard (Cohen) makes his way up the ladder and challenges Ricky, Ricky's talent is put to the ultimate test. At the same time, Ricky's best friend, Cal Naughton Jr. begins a relationship with Ricky's wife, Carley Bobby (Bibb) and Ricky's deadbeat father, Reese (Cole), comes back into his life.Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men working today and has always had a history of crafting interesting and colorful characters, from Ron Burgundy to Buddy the Elf. Ricky Bobby is his latest creations and one of his funniest. He does a great job with the role, but, as I said, he overworked it outside of the movie. As he stated in song at the Academy Awards, John C. Reilly has been able to make a transition between stark dramas and wild comedies. Reilly is a very talented man and gives a more subdued performance here. He was still over-the-top, but he managed to calm Ferrell's performance down a little. Had he not been present, I think the movie would have been a little grating. Sacha Baron Cohen exploded in 2006, mostly due to bringing his character of Borat to the big screen. However, he also gives a very funny performance here. He is just a very versatile actor.'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' was shoved in our faces from the time production ended and, frankly, I was tired of it before I even saw the movie. But, judging a movie by its promotion is not fair and, as a reviewer, I won't do it. But, I will still hold the people responsible accountable. Do not overplay your own movie. Don't push it at the audience every time you get an audience. It hurts the movie. However, the movie does hurt itself. The characters, especially Ricky Bobby and his wife, become increasingly annoying as the movie progresses. I was shocked at just how unlikable they got. The romance between Ricky Bobby and Susan (Adams) feels a little rushed and just didn't do enough to seem realistic. But, overall, 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' works well enough at being a surprisingly funny and easy watch. Will Ferrell proves yet again that he is hilarious and Sacha Baron Cohen shows that he is not a one hit wander. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I judged it based on itself, though I wish that Ferrell had calmed down a little with the promotion.Final Thought: 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is a funny movie that has a colorful cast of characters.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",7,0,1,4 March 2007
