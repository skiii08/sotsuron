50 First Dates," Sandler's Best to Date!
","I had seen the trailer for this movie a while back, and had decided that it looked like one to watch. I can usually only watch Adam Sandler stuff when I'm in a certain goofy mood.This one was great... very, very, VERY funny and well done, well thought about, if perhaps a bit clichÃ© at times. Definitely enjoyable and definitely one to see!Ones to pay attention to: the walruses, dolphins, penguins...
And you'll love 10 Second Tom... he's very entertaining.Basically a very enjoyable film, not to be taken too seriously but to just sit back and laugh at Sandler's antics.",8,0,0,1 June 2004
Dead Poets Society," Impressive.
","I'm impressed. It was an all around good film. Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.It's not about poetry. It's about how you look at the world. How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated). Never become conformist - always make up your own mind.I liked the music, as well. The bag pipes give a certain special touch.I gave it an 8/10 - a high score for me.",8,58,93,5 April 2003
Save the Last Dance," One of my favorites
","This movie is so much more than a movie, as it addresses a number of different issues - which it works out between the characters. You've got the problems that happens when a close parent dies, when you are stuck with somebody you don't want to live with, the racial problems in general, then the black boyfriend/white girlfriend, the differences between style of dance (hiphop vs. ballet) etc.To be honest - I'm not a huge fan of hiphop OR ballet. What I did like was the interaction between the music and the characters: it made the music.And the performance for the dance school the second time - what a treat!
I'd watch this movie even if you have your doubts, because it's a crowd pleaser.",8,0,2,23 January 2003
Seabiscuit," Weak beginning, reasonably good end
","Personally I sat through the first half an hour of this movie asking myself, 'what is going on here?' I found it very disjoined - it just didn't flow and it didn't make sense. After that, the story started to come together, but I still can't say that the first 30 minutes really enhanced the rest of the film. It did give some insights into the characters which explained their actions later in the film, but still I don't think it was entirely worth it.Then we come to the later part of the film, where things start happening. Where we actually meet Sea Biscuit and such. It was interesting, though somewhat predictable.I think one of the things that I liked most about this movie was the abstracted parts. It's based during the Depression and Sea Biscuit becomes a symbol of picking yourself up and continuing. Because if you don't, you won't go anywhere. If you do, nearly anything is possible. It's heartwarming... though I still think it could have been better. 6.5/10",7,0,0,26 November 2003
Gangs of New York," Rarely will I give a film such a high rating
","I am generally fairly strict about how I rate films. Rarely would I give a film a 9.It starts out slowly, the first half of the movie. It actually does start with a bang (a battle scene) but after that, it slows down for the first hour or so. But it's like a good book - you have to set up the story for what's going to happen. Because after that first hour, it really picks up the pace. Scene after scene, the suspence of what is going to happen to all the characters that you've begun to understand and root for.
So many different themes run through this movie. I've come to the conclusie that it's just as much of a think-movie as a smash-and-bash movie. You get everything from revenge (as the Chinese say, when one starts on revenge, go ahead and dig two graves) to loyalty, power, fear (in more ways than one), even love - yet it manages to avoid the clichés.Just remember, in this film: is the bad guy really the bad guy and is the good guy really the good guy? Is anybody actually ever right?",9,1,2,19 January 2003
