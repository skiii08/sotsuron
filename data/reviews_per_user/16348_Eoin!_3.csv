Requiem for a Dream," Darren Aronofsky Has Created an Another Artistic Masterpiece.
","Pi has been my favourite film ever since I first saw it in 1998. Everything about it is, in my eyes at least, perfect.  No matter how many times I watch it, I cannot grow tired of it.  I have bought the soundtrack, the screenplay, the video, the dvd, and ever since I first saw it in the theatre, I have been waiting for Darren Aronofsky's second film.  Requiem for a Dream amazed me.  Words cannot begin to describe how intense this film is.  Watching a Darren Aronofsky film, for me, is so much more than watching a movie.  You get drawn into this little world, and you experience everything.  Darren Aronofsky becomes god for ninety minutes, and you are completely under his control.  This film was nearly flawless, and I cannot name a single instance  of this film where I was not uneasy.
Although this film is incredibly intense, I don't feel that the measures movie theaters are taking to prevent young people from seeing it are necessary.  Frankly, I think that the reality of the film is enough of a deterrent to drug use, and that the sexuality of the film IS NOT SEXY.  IT IS NOT MEANT TO ENCOURAGE SEXUAL DEVIANCY... IT SHOWS WHAT DRUGS CAN DO TO YOU.Requiem for a Dream is an artistic masterpiece whose full effect on the viewer cannot be described in words.  This film needs to be experienced to be fully understood, and any viewer can benefit from subsequent viewings. It may be gritty and real, but Requiem for a Dream is a truly beautiful film.",10,1,2,5 December 2000
Fight Club," David Fincher Triumphs Again.
","Ever since i saw fincher's first film (alien 3) i knew i was witnessing special talent.  yeah, a lot of people badmouth alien 3, but it holds a special place in my heart.  every film fincher does surpasses his previous film about tenfold.Fight Club was a great cerebral thriller that combines great acting, beautiful direction, the blackest of dark comedy, and a wonderful story to make possibly one of the greatest films of all time.Fight club is about more than a bunch of sweaty guys getting together and beating each other sensless.  it is about society, and not knowing your place in it.  more than not knowing your place in it, actually, it is about not HAVING a place in society to begin with.in the dvd, edward norton discusses how the film relates to the graduate, which really, i think is very accurate.  both films have a lot of similar themes, and i think in the end of both, you get the same thing out of it. and you question yourself because of it.  definitely read the book by chuck palhinuk.  wonderful read.  and check out the score as composed by the dust brothers.  pure sonic bliss.",10,0,1,23 December 2000
Pi," Pi Embodies Everything an Independant Film Should Be
","Pi is one of those movies that is so powerful, that it once it is over, you just sit there in your seat in thought.  It's incredible.  You sit there and you realize that this director has such a powerful voice, and is such a genius, that he will never be accepted by hollywood or the mainstream cinema in general.  The story is moving, and no matter how you are socialized, you can still relate to its main character, Maximillian Cohen.  The music is beautifully mixed by Clint Mansell (who has now done the score for Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's next film).Pi's genius cannot really be explained to someone who hasn't seen the film. It touches souch dark parts of your mind that you instantly respect Darren Aronofsky's daringness and intelligence.Pi is about so much more than a genius trying to find a pattern in nature. It is about understanding what really matters.",10,1,4,6 December 2000
