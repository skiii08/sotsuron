The Avengers," OK so I got carried away with this one.
","I am a Marvel fan comic or movie. This one really made the year for me in Marvel films. Specifically Robert Downey Jr. He stole the show here with the best performance ever. He got everything down to Stark's arrogance, eccentricity and excellence. Hats off to him. This has compiled every aspect of a total Avenger movie. What can I say, it's got gut, humor, and convincing transitions that keep you glued to the end. And I have got to say this now or never. Finally the hulk speaks. I have been waiting years for that. The one punch liner totally blew me. I will spare Bruce Banner roles as Mark Ruffalo really came out doing a good job here. Chris Hemsworth no doubt is Thor to me and is perfect. Chris Evans is great for a guy lost in time. Scarlett Johansson with her very flexible talent and shine. Who will argue with me on that? Jeremy Renner nailed it. Tom Hiddleston is perfect for Loki. Clark Gregg was cool and had a vital role here. Lastly but not the least, Samuel L. Jackson you are the man. The rest of the cast was seamless for me and they all did a splendid job. The special effects is explosive. It keeps me wanting for more. I'm a sucker for SFX. It's a comic book story and it's what I got and wanted all these years. I can't wait for another Avenger movie.",10,10,21,17 June 2012
Cloverfield," Shaky Cam Hype Disaster Movie
","I checked spoilers to warn readers of this highly marketed garbage, that is if revealing a found footage shaky cam vision all throughout is considered a spoiler. You see, I've always been out for top of the line blockbuster movies that is worth every cent. I don't see film greats such as Spielberg, De Laurentis, George Lucas, James Cameron and Roland Emmerich use found footage crap in their films, and even if they did, they used it moderately to make a point, but not throughout. Super 8 gave us a shaky cam feel but it was so blended well with the entire movie you don't even notice it or get epileptic watching the movie. Now I call that pure genius in film making. So far, we have been bombarded by found footage, shaky cam types since it's conception, and most of these types are truly garbage. Should I say more to smash the likes of these films to oblivion? Sure, I'll give you 2 more examples to ruin your appetite. Imagine the movie 'Godzilla' (1998) or '2012' (2009) by one of the greatest directors of all time Roland Emmerich, shot with found footage, epileptic shaky cam! Now tell me if you will enjoy it like we all did if it weren't. Cloverfield sucks! If the director tried to emulate the greats it would have never been so bad. It's all hype. I hate to see this movie get a higher rating than a 1. For fuck's sake, we want to see a disaster movie with all the special effects and not from a stupid handy cam. Hey shaky cam directors, there's a lot of people who hate your types of films. Your reign of terror must stop. Stop torturing people with shaky cams. Are you in bed with the eye doctors and the shrinks or something?",1,3,4,23 June 2013
Pacific Rim," This is how an epic of epic monster movies should be made
","A perfect 10. I don't care what other people say. This review contains some spoilers, as I reveal the movie's blockbuster features. This is how an epic of epic monster movies should be made. Jam-packed with almost everything in epic blockbusters. Hunk lead star. Check. Death in family. Check. Hot action chick. Check. Hero Come back. Check. Hero rivalry. Check. Comic relief. Check. Gigantic Robots. Check. Gigantic Alien Monsters. Triple Check (They have a whole army of those on the other side). A bit campy but perfectly placed drama. Check. Moderate use of shaky cam as needed (only in intances as shown from news media cam)(ton of pun intended on the movie this one has run over specifically Cloverfield). Check. End of the world as we know it. Double Check. Humans always win. Triple Check. Tons of explosive stuff. A million Checks. Sci-Fi FX at it's peak. Gazillion Checks. Okay, maybe some of the scientific stuff in this could be hogwash, ask Michio Kaku, but who cares, right? It's a 'Sci-Fi Fantasy' movie! Who cares! Pacific Rim delivers the epic of epics no other blockbuster has achieved. The robots in this movie makes 'Transformers' look like kindergarten kids sucking on a lollipop. Exponential city destruction that stomps all of the 'Godzilla' movies, western and eastern combined. Fresh talent uprising. I know some of these new talents, but this will surely propel them to the top further than they have dreamed of. Huge bases that makes G.I. Joe a joke. Idris Elba, you nailed it. Ron Perlman, you never seize to amaze me. Guillermo del Toro has broken every disaster movie ever created (because I know there will be more from where this came from). The size of these robots and monsters makes the Mythology Titans and Greek God movies like an ugly spasm. This movie has gobbled up every alien invasion movie ever made like they were marsh mallows. Avengers was awesome yeah, but the aliens here makes them look like a bunch of girl scouts trick or treating. Now the movies 'Pacific Rim' has run over aren't bad, they are blockbusters and epics too in their own right and in their own time. But, like I said, Pacific Rim has run over them like they were ants. Now for the final blow. This goes out to the makers of the movie 'Cloverfield' in 2006. Listen up. This is how an epic monster movie should always be made. Not told from the point of view of a small group of stupid kids. Oh sorry, they weren't supposed to be kids. Yeah, but they sure looked like a bunch of stupid kids to me. Told from a point of view of a shaky cam found footage? Are you kidding me? With all the hype you guys marketed Cloverfield, it just didn't justify the hype. If you're gonna make a Cloverfield sequel (I know you are), make sure you won't fall flat from our expectations. Do it right next time. We're watching you. Movie goers, learn from this movie. Don't get ripped off by others. This is how an epic of epic monster movie should always be made. Now I would be outraged if Pacific Rim won't win a ton of awards for its awesomeness. To me you are on the top of every epic movie ever made. Till your next epic, Guillermo. A Pacific Rim sequel? You're the man! Nuff said.",10,4,12,19 July 2013
2012," Awesome for Effects
","My review for 2012 is very much overdue. I didn't review it earlier because to me it was perfect. Firstly, I had no problem with the movie as I am a number one fan of Roland Emmerich. I went to watch this for all the awesome effects even if some of them were a bit unrealistic as some would say. But hey, this is one of the best disaster movies of our time if you don't mind some funny bits. I gave this movie a 10 for all the blow it up stuff I always wanted. The story is your basic look at our hero of the day who just happens to be a frustrated divorced writer and drives a limousine for rich people. Not much of a story really although it tries to stick with it even after all the running around and getting on something in the nick of time. I know most of it was ridiculous, but I ain't stupid I just enjoyed it for what it was. An earthquake of that magnitude in this movie? You couldn't run, walk or even drive around like John Cusack did, and he wasn't even a professional race car driver. And I know from personal experience with earthquakes with lesser magnitude. But like I said, I came for the destruction and I got what I wanted and I hope Emmerich keeps doing movies like this forever. Blow up and destroy more stuff for us Roland!!!",10,4,6,20 October 2013
Mama," Motherly Love from beyond
","I saw this in time before going insane with all the trash out there. Deep inside me I hoped I wouldn't be seeing some 4 kids go out camping type movies, and yes it certainly wasn't. I once fantasized about being in the film industry and from all the great films that inspired me, this film actually makes it on the top 100 of my list. I know more about movie making than being a common movie goer because I've learned a lot from the best by just watching. I mean how can other film makers do what they are doing right now? Giving us a sorry excuse for low budget by giving us found footage or shaky camera stuff? When I first caught great film maker's movies(I don't want to mention them all as they are a staggering number) I knew that mostly creativity can go a long way even with low budget. Listen up wanna be's, try to create something like what the director of this movie has achieved. No lame excuses. This movie floored me. The transitions were perfect, and blended seamlessly. Rarely have I seen such craftsmanship from film makers these days. I wasn't disappointed and I got what I needed for so long. It gave me hope that there will be better films out there to watch out for. I thought I was lost with all the crap shoved at me nowadays. The actors were pretty good, with very special mention to child stars Megan Charpentier and Isabelle NÃ©lisse. Do I see the next finest actors of the future? Indeed. The FX were fantastic, and if there were flaws, I hardly noticed them because of how neatly written and directed this film was. A must watch for horror fans out there. Don't just gape there. Go watch it.",10,1,5,11 February 2013
