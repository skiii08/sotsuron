Requiem for a Dream," ...high on self-destructive ways to reach your dreams
","INDEED AN EXCELLENT MOVIE! From the cast and their performance to the way it was shoot, the cuts, the close-ups and of course, the soundtrack. Very, very intense movie and this is probably way I liked it so much. The degradation of the human being is so well portrayed with the help of the great performance of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. This is the story of Sara - the mother, Harry - the son, his girlfriend - Marion and their friend - Tyrone. All four of them have different dreams and hopes but all of them get destroyed by the same evil: the addiction to drugs whether they are pills or actual illicit substances. They choose the easy way to reach their dreams and that brings them to perdition. You can actually feel the desperation that every character reaches, the hole in which they sink deeper and deeper. Depressive movie (and how else it would have been taking in consideration the subject?) but so powerful and real!!!",10,1,2,18 May 2005
Finding Neverland," a beautiful and instructive story....
","Dreams, imagination, freedom, enthusiasm, peace with yourself! This is how I would describe 'Finding Neverland' after seeing it. It proved me once again that beauty stays in the eye of the beholder, meaning that one story is a different story once you allow yourself to look at it from another point of view. The movie shows us where the creator of Petre Pan got his inspiration from. And does it in a beautiful way. I was not a fan of the Peter Pan story, but now I do want to see it again so I can pay more attention to the details. Although this movie made a positive impression on me and reminded me of the fact that we should live every minute the way it makes us happy, it failed to stick with me for more than a second. And I think that happened because it's all just too perfect in the way things happen and that makes it full of clich√©s. All in all, it's a good movie that deserves to be seen for the revealing insights on the story of Peter Pan and for the nice feeling that it creates.",7,1,1,5 May 2005
Monster," ...when messed up prostitute meets messed up lesbian teenager
","This is a very glum and depressing movie. But it makes you realize even more that you don't have to judge anyone. We all have reasons, and most of us, very good reasons for acting the way we do. And more, there are circumstances in our lives that we can face or not, depending on the level of self trust at that time. Charlize's character - Aileen- had a rough childhood deprived of warm feelings, good words and right guidance. And that made her the way she was, lonely, bitter and with no reason to go on living. That is until she mets Ricci's character - Selby. I wonder if the situation would have ended differently if Selby assumed some of the responsibilities of the couple herself. But that couldn't have happened cause she was just a child that needed to have fun without any complications. The actors performance is remarkable and the atmosphere is build in the most appropriate way, making it uncomfortable but also deep and tormenting.",9,0,0,30 August 2005
Man on Fire," ...the will and power that a goal gives you
","It impressed me because I felt the strainght, power and determination you get once you have set a goal for you to reach. There are no compromises to be made and nothing can stop you! Here, Denzel works his magic beautifully, although his character is kind of a loser. That is until he mets Dakota's character who brings him back to life, back to love, back to fighting. He's some sort of Count of Monte Cristo in a modern version. There's no way for you not to fall in-love with Dakota Fanning for the great kid actress that she is. There are also great supporting roles such as Pita's mother or the journalist which help building the story in a very elegant way. I enjoyed how this movie was shot. Those strong images and dynamic perspectives give 'Man on fire' a sense of Mexico's reality. It reminded me of 'Traffic', which I recommend you see if you look for a more rough and elaborated Mexico City story with lots of drugs and violence. Bottom line. Anything special concerning the story line. Great visuals. Great evolution of the characters. Great acting. Great passion. All in all, a great movie.",8,0,0,20 April 2005
