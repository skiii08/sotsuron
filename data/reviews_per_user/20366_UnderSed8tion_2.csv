The Blair Witch Project," Complete waste of time!!!!
","As a rule, I always watch a film twice just to make sure I haven't missed anything ... though, in this case, only to double check my first opinion. I have yet to decide if the idea of people actually *paying* to see this film is frightening or laughable (fortunately, I didn't even have to rent it). As for my 'lack of imagination' ... I think I'll stick with reading books... no special effects, no bad acting and *far* more entertaining.",1,1,3,6 December 1999
Vanilla Sky," it sucked!
","This could have been interesting with a completely different script, cast & director. Not intellectual.  Not bold, new or original.  Not even vaguely entertaining.  Glad I watched this at a friends house, I didn't have to throw my money away on a rental. Don't waste your time!",1,0,4,5 July 2002
