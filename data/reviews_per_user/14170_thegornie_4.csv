Black Swan," Beyond her comfort zone
","I will admit up front that I am no fan of ballet and failed to appreciate the pains that Natalie Portman endured to become a convincing dancer for this role. But it didn't matter. She absolutely earned her best actress award through conveying three metaphors behind the wrapper of a ballerina's quest for perfection:1. Perfection requires balance. You cannot appreciate the beauty in light without darkness. There is no sunrise without sunset, no day without night, no good without evil. Nina's struggle to understand this was the focus of her conflict with Thomas.2. Personal growth happens when you expand beyond your comfort zone. Nina had mastered the white swan because the role was so consistent with her daily life; continuing to practice it was a waste of time. Only when Lily inspires her to pursue the black swan does she unlock the path to perfection.3. Once you've stretched outside your comfort zone you can never go back. Personal growth changes you forever. Nina, in her quest for perfection, loses her innocence forever.Yes, perhaps the story could remain powerful without the gratuitous gore that hurled a dark drama into the horror genre. But this film is worth watching just to see Natalie Portman shatter all the boundaries of her acting career up to that point. A powerful performance, particularly memorable in the final scenes in which she successfully transforms into the black swan.",8,0,0,29 May 2018
Life of Pi," Cast Away meets Forrest Gump...epic fail
","So this dude was the lone survivor of a shipwreck, and he floated around for 8 months before washing up on the Mexico coast. That's a rare, amazing story as it is. No need to embellish anything about it. The mundane parts of figuring out how to catch fish, constantly being on the verge losing hope, being unbearably lonely, and weathering storms in a tiny vessel? You can easily tell those stories and keep my interest. As the Tom Hanks character did in Cast Away.Telling such an incredible, completely ludicrous life story that any sane listener would naturally assume he was embellishing? The charm of Forrest Gump was that the Tom Hanks character wasn't embellishing.Of course the main point of The Life of Pi is to spotlight the natural human awe of storytelling, particularly to explain things beyond our feeble comprehension like religion. But if I was the author dude, I would have punched this jerk in the face for wasting my entire day. I can't recall ever feeling so frustrated from a movie as I did with about ten minutes remaining in this embarrassment of a film.That said, visually beautiful and a great musical score, yadda yadda yadda. But the story is so absurdly frustrating and unforgivable.",3,2,5,13 August 2018
The Red Violin," Better than the sum of its parts
","A collection of five stories as we follow The Red Violin through its lifetime spanning centuries. Each individual story is too weak to stand on its own. But have some patience to hold them in place for 2 hours, and trust that it will finally come together at the end.The film's fatal flaw is that I was unconvinced of the love between the violin maker and his wife. He seemed to live for his craft first and his family a distant second. She seemed to just get bored at home while he neglected her for his work. A more convincing relationship would have set a hauntingly powerful foundation for the subsequent stories. Instead the middle pieces remained flimsy until Samuel L Jackson glued it all together.The total sum is a solid film that falls short of its potential. Beautiful violin music is a common thread throughout. But it feels more the product of a skilled 17th century craftsman than the undying love between a husband and wife.",6,1,1,20 May 2018
Rear Window," Think but don't overthink
","Hitchcock tackles our bizarre fascination with voyeurism. After all, what are movies but a godlike ability to watch a story play out without the actors acknowledging the audience?Filmed brilliantly, so that you feel just as James Stewart does in the film: that you're watching people who don't know they're being watched. The next-level mastery from Hitchcock is that you're watching people who don't know they're being watched watching people who don't know they're being watched. At the center of this masterpiece was witnessing how voyeurism transforms Lisa from conservative cosmopolitan queen to the adventurous thrill-seeker that Jeff desired. A fine story in itself, if that is all that it was ever meant to be.But as some reviewers have called out, this movie could have reached a whole other level of greatness, had it featured a final twist ending. And given the claims that this film was among the greatest ever, I fully expected a shocking twist! Among the areas my mind wandered: while Jeff and Lisa are preoccupied with a murder that never actually occurred...Lonelyhearts's suicide occurs in plain sight; the fire escape sleepers fall to preventable deaths; newlywed husband and Miss Torso start a steamy affair.But the ultimate twist my mind swirled up: That Jeff was secretly being watched all along from another apartment across the way, by none other than Lieutenant Doyle who had been digging for dirt on Lisa in a scandalous corruption investigation. Can you imagine the horrifying paranoia when Jeff realized the tables were turned on him? Such is the greatness that I had imagined, fueled by the hype this movie still generates six decades later.Alas, the twistless ending was plain and simple. With no expectations going in, I would have fully appreciated the fine camerawork and direction, all the more outstanding in the absence of a musical score. Instead I was left wanting more.",8,1,2,26 May 2018
