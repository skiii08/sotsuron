Requiem for a Dream," Eyesore and Headache.
","Requiem for a Dream is the worst movie I've seen in a long while. Whether is was the immature score of the film (which left me bored), the overdone subject matter and obvious themes, or the shameful, explicit sex scenes, I do not know. But the movie, just overall, didn't seem to be anything more than an attempt by a director to trick people into thinking his movie is innovative. Apparently, as far as the public is concerned, he succeeded.",1,16,34,12 September 2001
