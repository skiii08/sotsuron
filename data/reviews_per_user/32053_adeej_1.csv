United 93," A New Zealander's perspective on this powerful film.
","I have just seen 'United 93' at the 2006 Auckland International Film Festival and consider this film to be a very important film that truly commemorates with honour the events of September 11, 2001.Although other respondents have commented on some factual inaccuracies of the film, the film is extremely gripping and gives a good understanding of what may have occurred on board that aircraft. It also gave me an understanding of what it would have been like to have been at the Air Traffic Control tower in New York and seen the events taking place before their eyes. The scene where you are shown an aircraft crashing into the second World Trade Tower gave me an illuminating understanding of what emotions those people would have felt in actually seeing it take place before their eyes. I also gained a perspective on what it would have felt like as an American to have someone attacking their land.The regular swapping between the various agencies that were trying to deal with this emergency increased the suspense of this film and showed what a difficult situation they were in.This film is very respectful of what occurred and does not glorify or 'Hollywood-ize' the events in any way. The use of unknown actors increased the sense of reality of the film. You weren't focusing on any one actor - you were focusing on the events. Seeing the characters come to terms with the reality that they were not going to live through this experience was harrowing but also a fine study of human emotions.I would highly encourage all who can to see this movie. I am very pleased that the families related to the tragedy were supportive of the film. It truly is a very respectful memorial to the events of this fateful day.",10,18,36,14 July 2006
