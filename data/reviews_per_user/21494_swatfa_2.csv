Skyfall," Incredibly Rubbish
","It's been many many years since i left a rating on IMDb. However this film prompted me to resurface.I was left very puzzled and shocked after watching the 'skyfall' movie - everything from the poorly executed adele song in the opening credits to the final scene was horrible at best. Enough has been said about this by other posters so i shall not reiterate the points as to why this movie was terrible. The points are too many.However what was even more horrifying was the fact that several modern critics actually liked it. This leaves me feeling displaced as though I've stepped into the twilight zone. The very criteria of what defines a good movie has been thrown out of the window in favor of poor non-sensical script writing.I've rated this movie a 3/10 for production, cinematography etc. If i was rating it in comparison to James Bond movies in general im afraid i would be hard pressed to rate it above a 1/10",3,13,27,13 November 2012
Captain Marvel," Snoozefest
","Brie Larson's character has the emotional range of a piece of plain damp toast. Over 2 hours of plain emotionless blank stare from the lead character. The only way the origin/backstory for this movie would have made more sense is if she was an alien mannequin that came to life.I don't know where to start. Everything felt spoon fed with so much lazy writing that it felt like this was intended for a brain-dead stupid audience. I'm not going to get into spoilers but if you watch it you'll be hard pressed to ignore the silliness.I agree with what some posters highlighted. At this stage in the game Marvel has a mountain of data on what recipe works for their movies - so to come up with this movie is quite bewildering.I'm at a loss for all the high reviews. I'm optimistically hopeful that it's just companies hired by the studios to pump a lot of fake reviews for good ratings, because the alternative if true would be far more devastating: that the current generation of movie-goers are so easily amused with any movie devoid of story-line but pumped with cgi that studios don't have to put as much effort as before.For those that enjoyed this movie, come over to my house; I have a laser pointer and a ball of string that could keep you amused for hours.",3,119,219,30 March 2019
