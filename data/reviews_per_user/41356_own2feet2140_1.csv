Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Different than Vol.1, but still Tarantino
","I must say that where Vol. 1 pumped me up with it's fast paced homage to bloody decapitating action, Vol. 2 had a whole other vibe similar to that of the Pulp Fiction flavor. I read a review where the critic complained that Vol. 2 is not as good as Vol. 1 and that it's simply Tarantino being 'self indulgent'. I disagree. I don't believe that audiences will be getting a film that out-does the first. However, what they will be getting is a whole other movie, which stands on it's own. While Vol 1. was shocking, Vol. 2 is more sultry and bitter sweet. Where Vol. 1 started you off with the champion of all catfights, Vol. 2 starts you off with a drawn out dramatic scene which builds the tension to a crescendo. You get a truthful look of the girl inside the badass warrior, as well as the man who loved her so much, he had to put a bullet in her head. Although, I was disappointed that the long awaited showdown with the title character was more talk than swordplay. It would have been even more disappointing if Tarantino would have simply created a carbon copy, 'more of the same' from the first installment. And when it comes to talk, Tarantino is the the master. His collaboration with David Caradine in the creation of the 'Bill' character is one of the greatest of all time. Bill is charming, using subtle tricks and tactics to derail the Bride's rampage of revenge. Tarantino stretches his directing muscle by holding back some of his old techniques and using new ones to give you an original film and not just a sequel. Uma Thurman gives the acting performance of her career, worthy of the Oscar she was nominated for in Pulp Fiction. David Caradine is better than ever, and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen give much stronger performances than was ever expected from them. Honorable mention to Gordon Liu as Master Pai Mei.",8,1,2,17 April 2004
