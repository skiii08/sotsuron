The Avengers," too good. just too good.
","I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me so me n my buddy went for the first show on the first day.. not to mention it was a packed house in the multiplex.This movie kicks ass and there was not one moment when we felt bored. All the superheroes' entries were cheered by the crowd and it was Iron Man acc to me who stole the show. It was a pleasant surprise in that it has as much humor as there was action!! By the way in reply to a previous review by Leone D'Antonio (reg Bruce Banner helping patients in Calcutta): In which world is India a third world country sir?? I hope you meant no offense but please watch the news.. we have sent a probe to the moon, run a big chunk of the world's information technology business, have acquired companies like Arcelor, Jaguar/Landrover.. and have a missile with a range of 7000 km!",9,1,3,28 April 2012
I Am Legend," good movie bad ending..
",really nice movie..but for the ending.. will smith alone carries the movie forward..man..his muscles!nice setup.. the city really looks deserted..good efforts by will and his dog..nice graphic effects too..really a waste of resources..very very unclear movie....could have been a very good movie if the ending was meaningful....lets wait if the make a sequel for it in which will smith comes back..he shouldn't be made to die in the movie.. either you will like it or not.... but the purpose didnot become clear to me at all....the ending is very abrupt and dissatisfying..they could have made it much better.. watch it for will smith's sake.. 5/10,Null,2,5,21 January 2008
