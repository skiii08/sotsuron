The Lobster," Good acting, BAD STORY
","I started watching this movie with an open mind. The first few minutes were good. And the possibilities of it been very interesting in the long run was high. But to my dismay the middle story going forward was just pure nonsense and rubbish.It has been a while I reviewed a movie. This could not just slip under the radar. A movie can be weird, absurd and interesting but the director lost it in this one.",3,1,1,6 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is not strong in this Movie!
","I had been very busy but still excited after reading several positive reviews only to be disappointed at the cinema. Even telling myself and friends. Watch 'Star wars and die'.The action and CGI is awesome 10/10 but the movie lacks depth and story. J.J Abrams really spoilt this movie. It is a movie for babies. If you are a Star wars fan and know much about the FORCE. Trust me you will be most disappointed. On a positive note, the performance of the actors were excellent save for Kylo Ren coupled to his badly developed character. The movie is case of excellent cast, awesome CGI effects but it has lost that Star wars theme altogether. Several scenes were funny which would have been much appreciated if the movie plot was shrouded in some mysticism about the dark side of the force.I hope they strive for a better story in the next episode. May the force be with you all.",3,33,50,23 December 2015
