Scarface," If you want to f**** with me, u are f*** with the best
","Yes, any Mafia and Gangsta Movies need to mess with this.. till now and for future.. The later Generations may never understand the 80's Movie.Al Pacino is a great actor and playing the role as he was born for this..'He is Tony Montana and nobody can touch him'Great Artists are Playing in the movie, i could the see the film almost every month.. may be because of the 80's Music and environment which beholds my past as well.. Even if this is something brutal, it has still some to offer.. which is still valid today.. Guilty, Drugs, Corruption and Morale !!",10,0,1,22 February 2007
The Last Samurai," An excellent Movie
","Great performance from the actors and the responsible people. I watched this movie 4 time in one week.. Really authentic and realistic...I see the moral of the movie is that how our 'civilisation' destroy all those cultural development, which took more than 100 years to develop in a blink of an eye.. Which will be lost for ever and ever...I am also a great fan from Tom who deserves the award for this anyway..Hoping to see such nice stripes instead some unrealistic heroic American way of conquering the universe.---------- Great performance from the actors and the responsible people.
