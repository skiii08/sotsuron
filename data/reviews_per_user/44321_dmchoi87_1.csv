The Ring," Much more better than the original, methinks
","The Ring was a movie of suspense, thrill, and psychological disturbance. Even if LOTR: TT or HP: COS comes out, I predict that this movie will create more gross!Many people know that this movie was actually originated from the Japanese movie 'Ringu', which was based on a novel series (Also named 'Ringu') In 1999, Korea made a re-make of this thriller 'Ring' I watched Ringu at least 4 times and Ring 2 times, and I find that The Ring is much more scarier. I'm not trying to be degrading anyone, but I think that the original wasn't really as creepy as the Korean version. The Korean version was also really crappy. And after that, Ringu 2, Ringu o: Bassudai, and Ring: Rasen was also a chilling series that left me out cold. I don't know, but in my opinion, Asian countries (Well I AM Korean myself, so I'm just referring to our wrongs) try to make it TOO terrifying. But the American Version is sooo much more honest and believable.If The Ring was this good, I can't wait for its sequel (The Ring 2), prequel (The Ring 0: Birthday) and its epilogue (The Ring Rasen/Loop) America made some crappy horror movies, but The Ring... just try not to get a heart attack!!!",10,0,0,12 October 2002
