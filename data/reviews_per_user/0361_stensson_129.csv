The King's Speech," Tweed orgy
","The British are of course totally unbeatable, when it comes to this kind of movies. Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth don't destroy the tradition. Totally clever, including large amounts of very dry humor.King George VI was a stammer. Historic facts say he got over it already in the late 20s, but that wouldn't have been such a good story. This is about the abdication crisis and his brother, the king's, urge to marry this twice divorced Mrs. Simpson. The king does and then comes the war and George has to give a radio speech. Nobody can help him except for this obscure Australian with no merits.A movie totally out this world, even if it's 75 years ago. True dry entertainment.",7,2,8,9 February 2011
Black Swan," Not black and white
","To understand this, you have to be somewhat familiar with the plot in the ballet 'Swan Lake'. There you find a woman with two different characters, although on the surface two different persons. Often, those parts are danced by the same ballerina.This is what Natalie Portman does here and this may be the performance of her life. There's a struggle inside her, between black and white, and she gets more and more confused about what's reality and what's not. The same goes for the audience.But anyway this is a movie which has, so to say, seen Polanski's 'Repulsion' a couple of times too much. Or maybe a couple of times too little. The usual ballet clichés are here too. Portman saves it, but can't really save it all.",7,0,0,12 March 2011
Changeling," Mainstream corruption
","It takes place in LA during 1928. A boy strangely disappears. After a couple of months, the police force finds him. But the mother is oppositional. It's not her son.Then starts the struggle against police and asylum corruption and the mother is helped by two good guys, a reverend and a lawyer.Director Clint Eastwood surely knows what is expected of him and does a little more than that. He lets a scene take its time, without loss of tempo. But Eastwood doesn't take any risks either and the same goes for John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie, who both can do better than this. Rather entertaining, but not something you think much about after leaving the cinema.",6,4,8,18 January 2009
Walk the Line," Simplicity as a virtue
","Normally you would regard this movie as another shallow idol portrait, but the actor work makes it the opposite.Joaquien Phoenix are mostly making his performance through looks and body language. And he really tells a lot by that method. Reese Witherspoon forms a full character with another technique, but they are completing each other very well. And don't forget Dallas Roberts in the small part as Sam Phillips. Performance of last year.The script is rather simple, but leaves space for these actors to make something quite interesting out of it. A positive surprise about a true American hero.",7,0,1,27 May 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Prejudice inc.
","Yes, it is very funny and it's the murder of the American attitudes we love to have murdered. Bot not only redneck views. It also hits on New York feminism.It's the candid camera concept. But most of the scenes must have been arranged, with perhaps the exception of the rodeo and the religious meeting. Maybe it would have been even more funny, if everything was authentic.Anyway, the best way of fighting prejudice is to make us laugh at it. This is Michael Moore aim, but with a quite another approach and without intellectualism. It's functioning.",8,1,11,5 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Life and death conditions
","There have been two American films recently on Stockholm's movie houses that go beyond anything else this year. The first is Memento and the second Requiem for a Dream.The latter is really getting you involved as a viewer in a way which is painful. After about 75 minutes I felt like vomiting or almost fainting. Not because of the violence or the blood, which isn't extreme, but because of Mr. Aronofsky's (the director's) way, together with the actors, of hooking you and bringing you further and further into an absolute hell. There is a big big rage here. A rage considering narcotics, but also considering our liberty, which draws people down in despair and misery.This is the strongest film I've seen for years and still a day after viewing it I feel physical weak, thinking about it.Ellen Burstyn is a genius as an actress, but her young colleagues really have a great future ahead. And so has American film probably.",10,0,1,2 November 2001
Captain Phillips," Modern pirates
","There are certain action tricks which live on forever, if they are performed with good handicraft. You find many of them here. Of course you also know who the good and the bad guys are, but you're not that certain anyway. Why are there pirates from Somalia, attacking Western ships? Can it have anything to do with Westerners stealing the fish they used to live on?But one trick is here repeated once too much. That one with the sacrificer. Tom Hanks is good, sometimes it's even quite exciting, but you of course know how it will turn out. An old trick is an old trick.But OK. Entertaining.",6,0,1,3 December 2013
3:10 to Yuma," Good laugh for us and the actors?
","The American Western, what happened to it? This movie category, which is so much identified with American film making, never regained power after Sergio Leone, although there was somebody called Sam Peckinpah.This is a try. Every Western cliché you know so well is present here. You don't have to miss anything, if you ask for the poor farmer, his almost grown-up son, the dramatic intensity between the bad and good, the apaches, the saloons, the typical Western town.So far it's quite funny, but in the final scenes it really is too much and the whole thing starts to take itself seriously. Not at least when it comes to ethic lessons. It stops to be funny at that moment and you've got nothing to do but sigh.",4,3,11,8 March 2008
Skyfall," 50th anniversary
","Whether you like it or not, this is film history. No character has this continuity for so long. Bond always survives. It's not spoiling anything telling he does so this time too.No, they don't just hit each other or shoot each other or go to bed with each other. The people are since a couple of films ago more complicated and the action is not so much computer animation here. And if it is, it's much better made.OK, the world is saved again, like it has for 50 years and we can certainly look forward to another 50 years as long as audiences don't lose interest. Probably they won't.",6,0,7,4 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Old story told like an old story
","The British are by right famous for their costume dramas. But this is a failure with characters as stiff as the men's collars and a picture language which very much reminds of the paintings from the period. The years around queen Victoria's coronation.You can of course make such a movie must about private life, with the prime ministers Wellington, Peel and most of all, Melbourne, turning up. And it can be filmed theater too, but here it is just theater and not a very splendid one.Her majesty deserved better. To quote her: -'We are not amused'. Or like she said about Gladstone: -'He talks to me like a public meeting'.",5,11,23,21 October 2009
The Hangover," Wild night
","The Hollywood bachelor night movie genre hasn't brought much glory to the industry. This put it all to extremes. The guys wake up one morning in Las Vegas and find a hen, a tiger and a six-months-year-old baby in their hotel suite. But one of the pals is missing.The rest is even more crazy. This is a performance in taste-lacking, but it's very funny and the tempo is high. The movie is certainly totally of this world, but 1,5 half hour of shallow plain entertainment.Las Vegas the myth, is once again the main character here. But you don't mind, since there are absolutely no hang-ups in this movie. Absolutely none.",7,3,6,26 July 2009
Marie Antoinette," History without a cause
","The photo is beautiful, but you can pick up any Vogue and get photo on the same level. It takes more to make a picture. It takes more to tell a story.Kirsten Dunst is surely OK and the big surprise Marianne Faithful, as Maria Theresia, too. But there's no intention of giving us any psychology here. Not beyond that of a fairy tale. And the politics behind the French Revolution are only slightly touched. Sofia Coppola's intentions have of course been to show the court being above such things. But that intention isn't enough.Besides. They talk much too good English at Versailles.",4,1,2,26 November 2006
Minority Report," Not just one more sci-fi movie
","This isn't the time to be impressed by 'special effects'. Everything of that kind can of course nowadays be done in a computer. The spiders here are funny and so is the traffic running down the walls, but what was to be expected?However, the story is rather clever. Of course Tom Cruise survives, but his way towards that is quite complicated. The best actor by far is Samantha Morton, who has a great talent and much more 'aura' then Cruise. In the scenes they have together you watch her, not him.Unfortunately as a Swede one is rather ashamed of Max von Sydow, not working very hard. He has come a long way since Ingmar Bergman, but hopefully is making a lot more money know. Peter Stormare is a parody on many things and mostly on himself. He speaks some Swedish too and out of concern of sensitive people, I shall not translate what he says.",6,0,1,23 July 2002
Training Day," No surprises not surprisingly
","Denzel Washington must have had lots of fun doing this corrupt cop character. He is sometimes dangerously near the overplaying, but keeps on the right side of that border. Probably he is sometimes even improvising, for example in one of the first scenes, at the diner.Ethan Hawke keep a lower profile, which is much more easy to believe in. The story is passable, considering the genre, although not believeable of course. The violence is idiotic, showing people beaten up in a way that certainly would kill them in real life. Here they are well and kicking immediately, jumping and punching. We have seen it before. It's been stupid all the time.But you are entertained through all the clichées about gangland and gang members (aren't they protesting against this kind of heavy racism?). However, there aren't any deep thoughts to be found here and not any surprises.",5,1,13,1 December 2001
Gravity," Outer or inner space?
","Pieces of a space ship, space litter, hit this American station. The astronauts are in danger, because in cosmos, you're very lonely. How to survive? That question has been put many times in film history.It's in 3D, but you can't say the film makers take much advantage of that. Maybe it doesn't matter, because the drama is more about what happens inside Sandra Bullock. She meets different space cultures, Russian and Chinese, and there are collisions.It seems to be quite easy making space emptiness the base of dramatic events. Perhaps a little too easy. Anyway, the universe moves on, with us or without us.",7,0,3,2 November 2013
I'm Not There," He's everywhere
","Of course the title is about Dylan the ever-changer. Whenever you think you can put a definition on him, he's not there.And that's why six different actors make six dylans here. There hasn't been any attempt to form a symmetry, not in the acting and not in the plot concept. This is confusing on purpose.But you can only surrender, most of all to Cate Blanchett's performance, which is from another dimension. She's almost frightening, taking the whole of Dylan's middle-60s-complexity into light, making you think you watch a documentary.If you ever thought you will get any grip at all about who Bob Dylan is, this film cures you. But you anyway leave the cinema with a new understanding.",9,1,3,23 February 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Adult puberty?
","I was prepared to write something really mean this time. It was supposed to be about Tarantino wanting us to giggle once again together with the sadist inside us. Giggle about the lynch justice, the reptile morality and the sometimes rather stomach turning violence.But once again I was seduced. Not at least by the dialogues, which go on not only for 5 minutes, but for 10 or nearly 15 minutes. And I promise, even the most shallow action addict will sit quiet, not wanting to miss a word. That's focus, that's great movie-making.But the story is certainly the worst ever by Tarantino, although told in a much clever way. When he leaves the retaliation morals of a 14-year-old, he will not just perform great movie-making. He will also make good films.",7,6,14,6 September 2009
Public Enemies," A little too public
","Well, we've seen shooting in slow-motion already 40 years ago. In 'Bonnie and Clyde' and in 'The Wild Bunch'. And we've also seen these fancy 30s suites and that kind of make-up a lot of times before.But Dillinger reality was shabby, unglamorous and smelled fear. This is a costume show, there things like the ongoing depression is hardly seen anywhere. This film puts the sympathies on Dillinger and the antipathies on, well what had you expected, J Edgar Hoover.If this is supposed to be a celebration of gangster anarchism, it's not helped by Johnny Depp, who is resting his talent, being quite close to overacting. The movie is a half-failure and not a very interesting one.",5,2,3,29 July 2009
Bloody Sunday," Like you were there
","This is a film with a terrible nerve, from the press conferences in the Sunday morning, through the preparations for the march and the preparations of the military, and forward to the scenes in the hospital afterwards. The camera is working in a way, there you definitely can feel the gloomy weather and the excitement.It's also a 1972 feeling about it, which doesn't feel acted, but like  a documentary. James Nesbitt is making a tremendous job as the MP and when you notice that this man hasn't got an Oscar, the Oscar institution definitely seems like the stupid joke it is.The only thing you can have against this Paul Greengrass' movie is the tendency in the end, where the relative documentary objectivity in the beginning, moves over to tendency. The unionists and the British government remain the totally bad guys and the catholics are the eternal martyrs. They might have been that this Sunday, but the conflict of Northern Ireland is a little more complicated.However, this is definitely more exciting than most of what you see in the action genre.",8,18,29,11 May 2003
Coffee and Cigarettes," No tea and biscuits
","Short films with nonsense dialogue of shifting dignity. Lots of self irony or even self sarcasm. Tom Waits is mocking with Iggy Pop in a way that it's hard to believe they ever can talk to each other again. Bill Murray is pulling the leg of the hip hop movement and the movement finds that funny. Cate Blanchett is on a genial level playing the double part of the filmstar and her jealous cousin.Jim Jarmusch can't be beaten. The dialogue seems to be mostly improvised, but the concept is not. Every short chapter here has a meaning and gives us something to think about. The films are in black and white, like coffee and cigarettes and that still is, and will always be, a way of pushing things harder. This is very much comedy and very much serious.",8,82,109,10 July 2004
The Secret in Their Eyes," Dark 70s
","This got the Oscar for best foreign movie. It's difficult to understand for those of us who have seen 'The White Ribbon', even if 'El secreto de sus ojos' isn't a bad film.A prosecutioner investigates a murder/rape crime some time before the junta rebellion. He can't let it go, not even after his retirement. And finally the fog is left off his and our eyes.The problem is that this film can't really decide whether it's a portrait of a man, a crime story, a relation drama or a comedy, because you find it all here. There are movies which can combine it, but Campanella still has rather much to learn, before he gets away with such a mission.",7,4,28,13 April 2010
127 Hours," 5 days in a chasm
","Sometimes, on rare occasions, you watch a movie with a special picture and cutting thinking. There the screen is divided in three parts, there there's a special kind of zoom, a special kind of beat, another way of using sound and another way to stay quiet. This is such a film.This guy is an adventurer of the annoying kind, with a disturbing belief in himself. He falls into this chasm in Grand Canyon, his arm is locked under a stone and his there, waiting for death or...The weak points here are the flashbacks and hallucinations which comes up, like the story couldn't walk (or be locked) for itself. This is an existential drama and no dreams are necessary.",8,0,2,12 February 2011
Alexander," Don't get stoned
","This is Oliver Stone's absolutely, without any discussion, worst film ever. I can't remember seeing a more lousy film for decades. He's sold out. If it's because of the 'republicans' or because of commerce or because of himself, I don't know. Maybe he had to do this after the Castro movies. To be back on track so to say.There's no reason to utter 'Charlton Heston come back, all is forgiven' anymore. I just wanna say 'Charlton, there is nothing to forgive'. Colin Farrell is a complete disgrace to the Actor's Guild, the person who decided the music ought to be in prison and the script comes from Primary school. Well, maybe they aren't aloud to have all this homosexual references in Primary School.Angelina Jolie is lousy too, but you can at least see some potential in her. If she is captured and tutored, she might be rather all right playing Corneille or Racine on stage. But I strongly doubt Hollywood is interested.",2,3,6,3 January 2005
The Others," The plot, please!
","I thought I would get frightened watching this, and must admit that I shivered three times, but was this all there was? This is a film that looses tempo several times. The screw ought to be turned and turned and turned, but it isn't. This is too slow narrated.If it was a parody on Hitchcock of the 40s it would be rather splendid, because it is played in a 40s manner, especially by Nicole Kidman, who is doing one of her best performances. This also goes for Fionnula Flanagan and the actors must have had lots of fun during the making of this film.The plot doesn't hold together however. Definitely not. Nothing should be said about the ending, more than it's cheating and disappointing. Besides it's too much fog outside the house, it's too much spooky victorianism all around, it's too much walking in corridors, which would be all right in an parody, but this isn't. You are not that frightened you're supposed to be.",5,0,1,3 March 2002
Troy," Charlton Heston, all is forgiven!
","There is an old bad Hollywood tradition in making films about the Bible and the antique. Mel Gibson managed to do something acceptable of it in 'The Passion of the Christ', but 'Troy' is unbelievable. How is it possible to make such a movie in 2004? Crowds will run to see it, but doesn't anybody have any self respect here?Brad Pitt is the best male performer, no more to say. That doesn't mean he is good. Lots of British Shakespeare actors appear and they ought to be ashamed. Peter O'Toole shouldn't have done this. He has watched to many Charlton Heston films, but he doesn't reach the Heston level. Worst of all are the women. If I were a feminist, I would cry...out of anger and sadness. This takes female acting 50 years back. To the lowest levels of 50 years back.The battlefield scenes may pass, but they were done better in the Ring trilogy. Between these scenes, it's dull almost all the way. Keep away from this.",3,0,2,15 May 2004
Insomnia," Keeps you awake
","Mainstream thriller. Many clues, but most of them hold together. Afterwards you're not aware of that many logical mistakes. This is done in a professional way.Especially by the actors. Not by Al Pacino however, who is very overestimated and has been playing nearly the same role through his whole career (one is rather tired of him), but by Hilary Swank and Robin Williams. After seeing Swank in 'Boys don't cry' you will always have high demands on her, but Williams is surprisingly enough forming a complicated character here, which wasn't to be expected.A little too much shooting in the end. That's almost parodical, but the movie is all right in many other aspects.",6,0,1,6 October 2002
Juno," A nice surprise
","This is the kind of movie nice girls have strong problems getting their rough boyfriends to. But even they will find it was worth it. A charming comedy with this brilliant Ellen Page as the main character.You maybe don't expect much from a movie about a 16 year old pregnant girl. Especially not since this is not supposed to be a drama. But it is in a trustworthy way. This working class girl is going to have her child adopted by the yuppie couple. But still, she's the strongest of them, making life change in more ways than just having this baby.This comedy is not only charming, it's also intelligent. Screwball hasn't died in Hollywood and here's the proof.",7,2,10,4 February 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," A little windy
","Modern computer animation hasn't done that much to catastrophe films as you would expect. And if you do such a movie, you ought to concentrate on the catastrophe, not on another pale 'father tries to rescue his son'-theme.This is supposed to be a somewhat radical film. As have been seen in thousands of movies before, those who are in power doesn't take warnings seriously, but they learn in the end and the good people are the wise ones. Not much of radicalism really.There is a little fun in the ending, where you find border-problems turned inside out. And those who have the power become humble. Still, it would have been more interesting having more rain, snow and thunder in this movie, instead of some cheap moral.",Null,0,1,19 June 2004
Don Jon," Seducing on- and off-line
","This guy is a Don Juan or a Don Jon. New girl every week, new sex every week, new computer porn-watching every day. It's single-minded.But one week, he comes close to what he thinks are real emotions. But computer porn never ends, it beats these emotions and the girl leaves him because of his mischiefs. So he's back at starting point, until IRL finally arrives.Could be an interesting script with interesting questions, but it's done a little too easy. IRL has a somewhat uncomplicated part, which isn't helped by great acting (again) from Julianne Moore, USA:s best actress.",6,1,5,3 November 2013
Match Point," At least set point
","Woody Allen has made a movie, which is not funny at all, but dramatic in many other ways. It's about cheating. It's about getting more and more involved in something you can't control. Or don't want to control, until it's too late and there's only a final solution.This is again Scarlett Johansson's movie. She is an actress with so much depths already, at her young age, that you are astonished. Without her you wouldn't be that interested, because the problem with Allen's films, is that they usually deal only with rich people's problems. This story couldn't have been made in this way... maybe in no way...if it was about working class men.Still, there is much to be found here for all of us. Mostly because of the life that Johansson brings into it.",7,0,0,29 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Midnight reality
","In Woody Allen's latest, you meet this Hollywood script writer visiting Paris with his girlfriend and her vulgar conservative parents. None of them really like the town, but the script writer keeps his nostalgic dream about the city in the 20s.And suddenly, by midnight, he is invited to the world of his dreams, there he meets Hemingway, Cole Porter, T S Eliot, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, just for a start. He also meets this girl, who instead of the 20s she's a part of, dreams of 'La Belle Epoque'.So what is nostalgia? A pleasant way of refusing to accept your own time and in the long run, your own life? That's the question which is put here. As always in Allen's films, in an entertaining way.",7,1,3,10 September 2011
Zodiac," Retro including success
","This is about the so called Zodiac murderer around 1970. The case is not really closed and if it had, this hadn't been such a good movie.It's procedure school for almost three hours. But every minute means tension. Not just the action or thrilling episodes, but also the patient work done by the police and an amateur investigator.You don't smile at the early 70s here. You get involved instead in a non-ironic way, not at least due to the great acting performed by almost everyone. It's reality as a myth, which mostly is more scaring than any fantasy. See this and fall a little in love. And be present in the past.",8,0,1,2 August 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Why should we care, if we don't get any money out of it?
","The conflict in Rwanda didn't matter much to most Westerners, although one million people might have been killed. That is mostly because those who were killed where black Africans. There is still lots of deep going racism in Western societies. Not only towards Africans but also concerning Asians. There have been much more bad feelings about white people killed in the tsunami, when about the locals.'Hotel Rwanda' definitely makes you think about that. You also come to think about the fact that this country and these people didn't have much business interest to offer West. Why should we give away our tax money to our armies to protect them, if we don't get anything out of it? Don Cheadle is really good in his part as the hotel manager, risking both his own life and the life of his family to save people of another 'race'. Nick Nolte makes another 'Nick Nolte'. The story is strong, but the best thing about it, is that you come to think about certain mechanisms, which seems to be stronger than the compassion you might find in yourself.",7,3,8,19 March 2005
Once," Singing in the gray
","This is one of the oldest film concepts and it will live forever. Poor guy meets poor girl and they start as friends, but something develops. Tracy/Hepburn did that, if someone has forgotten.But this is made in a charming way and Glen Hansard makes much more of his character than you expect from a movie like this.The lines are often sung and there are also long cuts. This is on the limit of being a musical, but the people are real. But the plot is too traditional and it's like the script doesn't have the guts to tell something important. It doesn't even try and therefore this film will be forgotten. Which is somewhat a pity.",6,0,4,12 April 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Boredom at its loveliest
","The Cold War in London 1973. Can any environment be more depressing, ugly and have worse lunch restaurants? Hardly.Thomas Alfredson takes the challenge, the slow tempo and the complicated intrigue and lets this be John Le Carré. People say that this novel by his is the best espionage thriller ever and it is of course as far from James Bond as possible.But it is Gary Oldman's film. His way of eating candy or correcting his glasses is art on its highest level, anyway being among a bunch of brilliant British actors. But you really have to stay awake. Otherwise you're soon lost in the most confusing plot you've ever seen.",8,3,4,27 December 2011
Crash," Touching at any cost
","The main theme is in the beginning. Someone says something about that in L A you are so desperate to get touched, that you're prepared to get destructive about it.The problem here is race. That's what prevents you from touching. The question is put through many everyday scenes, that turn out to be destructive. You try to come near people, but it ends in catastrophe. But there are also angels, who prevent the evil.It's a hopeful movie, because it doesn't just put the difficult questions; it answers some of them too. And you can carry these answers with you.",8,2,8,18 September 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Too much pantasy?
","Let's say it directly. The photo here is absolutely splendid. The rest of the movie is not on the same level.It's about post civil war Spain. The fascist captain is as square as you could ever imagine and the young heroine as divine as anything you've seen. Surely this works out in a fantasy, but what's the amazing thing about these kind of make-believes? It's once again a severely uncomplicated story about goodness winning over evil, together with some gore. But what's the point? This kind of filmic romanticism has failed in power and although it's clever done here, the subject isn't. This kind of darkness isn't interesting anymore.",7,1,3,9 April 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Barber shop singing
","Tim Burton is the leading goth director of today and this is probably his best performance. 'Sweeney Todd' is a 'so so' musical, but there has probably not been such a performance on stage, like the one you see here. And definitely not that much blood.Certainly Depp and Bonham Carter wouldn't have passed any stage auditions if they hadn't been celebrities. Nobody is a good singer but they perform their old mimic tricks, which always function in the movies. And in this kind of rather shallow musical it's enough.The photo is rather excellent and Burton brings out the best of this material into a fairly entertaining two hours. Some time the old discussion about movie violence ought to get restarted however. Are we in the audience corrupted or perverted or what's our problem?",8,0,4,24 February 2008
Blades of Glory," Silly comedy and it was meant to be
","This is both a Cinderella story and a matiné drama, but spiced up. It mocks with the American dream, with homophobia, with the skating world. But it still advocates dreams.Will Ferrell is making another one of his raw characters with the big heart. Jon Heder matches him as the clean American 26-year-old virgin boy (Hollywood's new favorite subject). They form an all-male skating couple! This is a new comedy idea, well supported by Craig T Nelson as their coach. It's funny, down to earth, and its intention is to be an intelligent but silly movie . A nice surprise, since you hadn't expected much.",7,1,3,15 July 2007
The Town," Seen so many times before, but...
","The criminal wanting to start a new life isn't exactly an unknown theme. Here we for once in our lives are in Boston. In a neighborhood which produces most bank-robbers in the world. Sounds promising.The usual betrayal is here. Towards yourself, friends and girlfriends, but it isn't without complications and the working class aspect is also present. That's not totally unknown either in American films about turning-around criminals, but we get more of it here than usual.Too much shooting in the end, because the action film addicts mustn't be disappointed. But professionally made, surely, OK. Could have been a little better, but surely also worse.",7,0,1,3 January 2011
Closer," Close and far away
","It's great seeing American actors making film just for art's sake, not money's sake. And it's great to see how happy they seem to be about it.Julia Roberts is here showing some real capability for once. Didn't know she had any talent, but here it is obvious. This portrait is very intelligent, sincere and complicated. Mature acting for a mature audience.The movie is about love and power. The person in charge is changing all the time. Four people get involved with each other and revenge is inevitable. It's about violence, but nobody gets beaten physically. Very clever.",8,0,1,9 March 2005
Shutter Island," It doesn't help, it's Scorsese
","A mental hospital close to Boston in 1954. OK nothing really new. Who is there? USA's most insane murderers, victims of McCarthyism, people being used for experiments by OSS? Never mind. You anyway get your usual share of dripping cellars, jump scenes (not very good) and DiCaprio as a crusader, trying to find out what is really going on.Let's face it. He has his limits as an actor and here, he certainly keeps within them. Surely the turning point in the end could be surprising for those who aren't used to the usual thriller intrigue tricks, but I'm sorry to say that this is a big Scorsese failure. And for the first time, you are tempted to laugh at many wrong places.",5,1,7,29 March 2010
Capote," One of the best so far this year
","It's of course Philip Seymour Hoffman's movie. Brilliant isn't enough. There is some overplaying in some places, but still, this interpretation is to be remembered.Capote is the New York party prince in the beginning, and he remains so in the end, but with a very dark shadow around him. He has met real life and the most important line in the script, which changes him completely, is the girl who says about a boy, that he has never been into anything terrible before. That's the key to 'In Cold Blood' and that's what makes Capote interested; the real life, which is infected by evil. And he makes a journey into that real evil, which he hasn't known much about before. Or has he? Much to think about here. Is life stronger than art? Definitely, according to this movie.",8,1,2,11 March 2006
Lost in Translation," Ageless Love
","Two lonely, although formally married, people meet in a mad city called Tokyo. Everything seems like a nightmare or at least as a bad dream. Everybody else has some kind company except for the middle-aged man here (Bill Murray) and the young woman (Scarlett Johanson).This is an intelligent movie with two very intelligent actors. Nothing is shouted. Most things are seen by the eyes, by glimpses. He could definitely be her father, but there is nothing ridiculous in this love. They are on an even level.Sophia Coppola is a director with a talent that matches that of her father. She probably has the power to make a change in film history. It will take her some more movies, but she might get further than her father did and does.",7,0,1,20 February 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," 1930s comedy for the 21th century
","It's so clever. The first hour is completely according to the manual, which was settled in Hollywood before WW2. You know from minute to minute what's gonna happen, but it's there at the right second. Professionalism! Meryl Streep is great, but lives only on her technique. There is no intention to make this she-devil a complex person. She never raises her voice, just works with faces, glimpses and ways to say her lines. It's like an instruction movie about making a mean comedy character.But once again, everything is so very clever, until the plot gets too eager in moralizing and doesn't want the audience to make its own judgments (which has been really easy that far). The 30s made these kind of movies better, but this is a good try.",7,0,0,29 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The most boring part so far
","Where did the humour go? Theese films have always been funny to watch, because they haven't taken themselves too seriously. The most mean-looking monsters have been the most gentle ones for example. The thing is, that they have all been characters you are about to meet around the corner. Not their looks hopefully, but the rest of them.But this script is written by a tired man. There aren't even that many exploding planets you are used too. Hayden Christensen is a disaster, totally made of wood and obviously chosen because young girls are supposed to like the way he looks.No, this is really a disappointment. How is it possible to give this ten points, like too many have? Just because it's a part of the Star Wars series doesn't mean it is automatically good. Come on!",4,1,2,24 June 2002
The Aviator," Scorsese's worst
","For some reason Scorsese is considered a great director. I think he's just a working man, not an artist. His interest for perverse brutal violence is however in a sick way shared by many of us. But does those films tell us anything about 'life'? Hardly.'The Aviator' is about Howard Hughes, as everybody know, and especially his passion for making airplanes. It's mostly like average TV, with bad make-up, bad reconstruction of the 20s, 40s and so on and, it has to be told, rather bad acting. DiCaprio is overplaying and so is Blanchett, Alda and the rest. Theatrical to say the least.And the movie is much to long. The second half is better and you find some tension in the story about the senate hearings but still, Scorsese ought to be taken down from the pedestal.",5,4,8,17 April 2005
Burn After Reading," A pure Coen comedy and thanks for that
","Sometimes you could almost think that this is what the brothers are supposed to do, instead of the a little overrated violent thrillers, they've mostly known for.Here the CIA man (Malkovich) is side-stepped and decides to quit. He writes an autobiography which ends up in the most wrong hands you can think of. These of gym workers Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand. What follows is not foreseeable.Splendid comedy acting by actors who usually do the most dignified parts you can think of in today's Anglo-Saxon movies. Very clever indeed and the Coens are bringing the genre further.",8,1,6,16 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," S O S
","It's 1,5 hour to long, the acting is beneath criticism, the effect makers have been lazy (one had expected much more). Have you seen Star Wars, Romancing the Stone and Excalibur you have seen it all been made much better. And it's a cheap trick ending at that point of the plot, to make sure people will pay tickets for the follow-up too. One can only hope the actors made a lot of money, because they are not getting much respect out of this.The good thing is the photo and the composition, which for some reason doesn't make the three hours seem very long, although you are bored several times. This has been nominated for 13 Academy awards. Who cares? Well, perhaps many people do, but this is definitely not the best movie of 2001.",3,1,2,17 February 2002
Cold Mountain," Cold it is
","There is still some money to be earned from making scripts of the 30s, although with a little more realistic violence. I don't wanna spoil somebody's naive expectations, but you really got to have a heart of stone, if you don't laugh at the end of this movie.Zellweger is overplaying, but is anyhow absolutely a born comedienne. Law and Kidman have really been lazy and really been making much money without effort. She, at least, can do much better.The good thing here are the costumes and the whole Civil War environment. You get an illusion of reality and also about the cruelty of war, but mostly this is just a question of total routine.",5,1,2,30 May 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," No shadows
","This movie about a dysfunctional family is more of a satire than a comedy. It's about the father, totally fooled by the dream of the American Dream, his son who refuses to talk after reading too much Nietzche, the grandfather who's on drugs and so on.But most of all it's about the daughter, entering a beauty contest for seven-year-olds. It becomes a road movie and sometimes it's close to the common feel good stuff. But the darkness is always there...in comedy shape.This is a really nasty narration about some parts of American mentality, but with quite many laughs. Screwball satire.",8,2,6,31 December 2006
The Orphanage," Scary childhood
","It's the old tricks, including the old corridors and the old scary music. But it functions, like it always does, when it is performed as well as here.Japanese horror movie children never were frightening. But the Spanish ones are and even if you're a hard-boiled viewer, you will most likely jump in your seat a couple of times, although you're fully aware of another jump-scene coming.This is done with great skill from both actors, script writer and director. The final is however a slight disappointment. They could have scared you some more.",8,1,4,31 August 2008
Duck Soup," Anarchy in Hollywood
","It's funny, but not all the time. The introduction, while we are waiting for Groucho entering the ball, takes it time. The scene were Harpo and Chico is harassing their fellow vendor is more mean than amusing. But the rest still goes.In fact anything goes here and many of the jokes have not grew old. The mirror scene is of course genial and the brothers making fun of war and putting it in a much more severe anarchy than it is even in reality, is really propaganda for disarmament, if anything is.That is definitely not 1933, but goes for all times to come. And you don't have these, for some people anyway, annoying music numbers on piano and harp. This is a good soup.",7,0,0,2 January 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Bipolarity
","You're always glad, when you find a intelligent comedy, after having watched too many idiotic, semi-idiotic and quarter-idiotic ones. But is it really a comedy? Many things go around under the surface of the heroes.You've heard and seen much from Tracy/Hepburn, but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are better. They can both explode any second and you can't say when they are happy or miserable, which makes them like something arriving from a thing called life.The only thing which maybe degrades this a little are the almost slapstick scenes we have here with Robert De Niro. There's no need for it in this heavy drama.",8,1,2,1 April 2013
The White Ribbon," His first masterpiece
","Few directors have like Haneke divided both critics and audiences. He has alienated them. Some say it's not possible to take all this in. You become a voyeur instead of a focused part-taker. And these objections are the most serious ones, considering Haneke's art.But here you from the first second get involved in this little grey German village of 1913. It's about people who have existed and start to exist inside you at the same time as you're part of the screen.The movie is not about the 'German experience', not about the evil in us all, not about guilt. It's about a real life inferno and for the first time, Haneke manages to get us into it. This makes this his really first good movie.",9,1,8,25 December 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Another round
","Strange thing, this Stieg Larsson-hype abroad. His books are very Swedish and you have to live here to understand the social criticism and the satire, which is also in them. Besides, Larsson writes from a clearly politically left perspective. You find nothing of that here.Anyway, this is lame and stiff. It's like just any average filmed crime story and there are many like them. The actors certainly don't behave Swedish in any way, except for Lisbeth Sallander, who really hasn't any typical nationality at all. Not in the books and not here.It's all made for the international market, which doesn't stop the Swedish version to be the better adaptation.",5,16,28,7 January 2012
The Intouchables," Paris in both ways
","It's Pygmalion again. This ex-convict from the dangerous suburbs of Paris gets a job as assistant to a paralyzed millionaire, Philippe. Of course they make friends. Of course they learn from each other's backgrounds. Perhaps they are both Higgins and Eliza at the same time.Could be a rather banal story if it wasn't for this Omar Sy, who has a vitality which lightens both the screen and high brow Paris. It's often funny, seldom touching and quite French.Most certainly this script will be adopted by Hollywood, but I doubt they can find such a Queens or Watts assistant like this Omar Sy. Although the class conflict can be found there too.",7,0,1,4 November 2012
Bad Teacher," Bad about teaching
","We can't count all the school films we've seen. Mostly they are about pupils, but this time, it's about teachers.Cameron Diaz is the educator from hell, or the 'sexy' version of it. She is totally lazy, just shows films to the students, drinks, smokes pot and try to make money in legal and not perfectly legal ways, to get a big breast operation.We've seen many school scenes with pre-pubertal sex jokes from the youngsters. Here the grown-ups provide us with them and that doesn't make them better. This is a comedy which failures and the script seems to have been written by a pupil. Or a school teacher from hell.",3,6,15,26 June 2011
The Duchess," BBC is so clever
","Once again the British show how a costume drama is to be made. Every detail in furniture, fashion and hair is perfect. Much of the acting is made through eyes and gestures. So very clever indeed.This is about the duchess who marries an emotional desert. Not strange according to the times and her class, but she starts to oppose it in a rebel way. It becomes more of a rebellion than is suitable to the times and the surroundings.And the actors get much out of this rather limited problem. You start to care about this poor aristocrat and once again there are proves of class issues never being the only platform for a drama. It's irrelevant, if it hasn't got living people in it.",7,0,0,28 December 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond goes green?
","These films have been radicalized. The enemies are no longer the commies or some international thug God-knows-what organization. The enemies are those exploring environment and aspiring Latin American wannabe-dictators.OK, we can have that. The main problem in this the latest one, is the action scenes. The cuts aren't professional and you often find it hard to find out there Bond himself is among all the bullets, arms and fires.There's not lots of humor here. It's like Connery/Moore were a thousand years away. Anyway, this will go on and on for many more decades to come. James Bond is a phenomena. No film character has lived so long through continuity, not remakes.",5,3,6,8 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," No place for anybody
","Another dark and very bloody story by the Coen brothers. But this time it's about symbolism and philosophy. And entertainment.This is about fighting the devil (Javier Bardem), which here appears as a character from some comic book. It makes him more easy to understand. This movie is about confronting evil by intelligence or by morality. Beside it all stands the sheriff (great work by Tommy Lee Jones) as the commentator and he says what you're mostly miss in these kind of films. Some of the characters are dreadful. It's not, I repeat not, acceptable what they do.The camera work is sometimes splendid. But the story doesn't hold together and of course this a speculation in violence. This is not just a piece of art, the selling ambitions are obvious.",8,2,4,9 March 2008
Mamma Mia!," Sweet rubbish
","Well, you didn't expect a masterpiece and neither did the creators. It's a very lame story indeed, interfiled by the classic ABBA songs.Brosnan can't sing, Skarsgård can't sing, Firth is not so bad, but Meryl Streep is somewhat sensational. Her version of 'The Winner takes it all' is better than the original and really rocks you.OK, this is gonna sell and nobody said it was made for another purpose. That's honest. A true 110 minutes professional feel-good-movie, worth watching for Meryl Streep's performance. And the rather beautiful photo. People will listen to ABBA again. And go to the Greek archipelago. Just feeling good.",5,5,13,13 July 2008
To Rome With Love," No, not this time
","It's like reality isn't enough for Woody Allen anymore, because more and more fantasies or almost hallucinations run through his films nowadays. It was like that in Paris and it is like that in Rome.Many parallel stories here. The prostitute who walks into the wrong room, the young architect guy who does the same love mistakes as the old ghost shadow behind him once did. The boring clerk who suddenly becomes a celebrity for no reason. Like most celebrities.The dialog is funny also this time. Especially when Allen himself is involved. But Allen scripts dealing with reality outside our minds are certainly better.",5,4,9,6 September 2012
Bridesmaids," Is this feminism
","This film has reached big audiences in the US and has also been commented on the newspaper's culture sections. Another kind of girl movie, it has been said.But the difference is maybe just the fact that the women here are doing the same things as guys have in just too many movies. There are the common stereotypes. The girls who have known each other since childhood, the disgusting and mean rich bitch, the overweight woman who anyway is 'a real person'. They get food-poisoned, drunk and have conflicts. You've seen it before, but that was about guys.Certainly there are funny scenes and Kristen Wiig is very good including much warmth. But calling this feminist, as some people have done, is going too far.",7,1,3,26 July 2011
The Chorus," Sweet movie about sweet music
","A failed teacher and composer arrives to a French school for boys with problems in 1949. He starts a choir and because of the power of music, the troubled boys don't cause that much trouble anymore.This is a fairy-tale with some dark shadows. Francois Berléand as the tyrannic headmaster gives a rather good performance and so does Gérard Jugnot as the music teacher, but it mostly just surface anyway. Some energy is to be find with Grégory Gatignol as the worst of the boys. No hope to be found there or...?Rather conventional, but because of its French origin, it doesn't become intolerable sentimental.",6,4,14,21 November 2004
The Pianist," Polanski's revival
","This is probably the best film he has done since 'Chinatown'. That doesn't say very much however. It has been a sad thing to see what Polanski has been up to, during the 80s and 90s.This is a melodrama. You've seen much of it before, but of course you might need to see it again. But there are also aspects here, that you don't find in average movies about the subject. The total loneliness of the main character is what this is about and that's not a loneliness only in WW2 Poland, but for all times. That is the main point here and it's obvious in the scene there the main character walks totally by himself in the ruins.The dialogue is still the weak part and the fact that Polish-Jewish victims speak English to each other is not acceptable. If the 'market' demanded that, Polanski should have had the integrity to refuse. This is commercialism at its worst and takes the film down to a lower level.",7,0,2,23 August 2003
Revolutionary Road," An ambitious try
","The American dream again and has that dream ever been more strong than during the 50s? However that was, this is about the couple who tries to escape it. Or maybe they are escaping the escape? Di Caprio and Winslet, especially Winslet, are competent. But the acting is anyhow too melodramatic sometimes. This is not people of the 50s. And it's not neither film nor theater.But it is a serious try to illustrate complicated feelings. Not silly at all, but the ambitions are higher than the result. If we're still waiting for the Great American Novel, we've already got the Great American Movie. But is isn't this one.",7,0,1,11 February 2009
City of God," Social apartheid
","This is like a documentary with nervous shivering camera work, but still telling a story and telling it in a good way. The movie has a rumour of being very violent and it is of course, because of the subject: Gang wars in Rio.However, the camera mostly moves away when the violence occurs, but you still get the message. This is a kind of slum, which you seldom find in the West. It's a slum were rising fear and murders are the only way to get dignity and where the police force applauds this and sell you more weapons. It might have to with the color of your skin, but mostly of the fact that you are poor. It's social apartheid.The weakest part here is maybe the story in itself, for this is in fact how gangster movies were narrated already in the 30s. It's not a punch in the stomach as some commentators have told you, but it might make you start thinking.",8,0,2,20 March 2004
Mr. Nobody," The hell of alternatives
","There's a discussion about choice in many recent films. It's not something desirable. One of our tortures is thinking back on the alternatives in our own history. And we are almost always dissatisfied.Nemo Nobody lives in 2092 and is 120 years old. He's forced to remember and it all starts with him making a impossible choice, being nine. The choice between his mother and father in a divorce.It would be better for us, if we could just accept fate, not blaming it on some obscure own responsibility. But this film lacks all too much the down-to-earth attitude which would have been needed. The right questions, but put in the wrong way.",6,5,15,12 August 2010
The Number 23," Out of number
","This is the rather pretentious story about the man who reads this book and finds out that it is all about himself. This gives consequences for his future. And his past.Jim Carrey has here completely left his quite tiresome clown attitudes, by which he has made his name. Here he is on the other side, playing a person who goes deeper and deeper into his own madness. But the plot isn't well told. It's not exciting, you don't care and are far away from ever being frightened.The ambitions are about making a non mainstream movie. But it's not even an interesting failure.",4,1,4,14 April 2007
The Lives of Others," Living another kind of life
","It wasn't long ago, that this was a reality. DDR, a paranoid country, with Stalinist views, wanting to know everything about everybody for the safety of itself.Ulrich Mühe is absolutely brilliant here as the very strict Stasi captain, who changes bit for bit. He really starts to live the live of others. Not because he's in a claustrophobic state of mind. But he's the watcher who is conquered by what he watches.There are many clues in this movie, which you come to think about afterward. In a way just like the Stasi captain. This is another example of German film coming back on its previous high level.",8,6,11,29 December 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Can we have some humour please
","Well, here we go again with the second part. Hopefully the creators make as much money as they have expected, because that's what it's all about here.Most figures in computer games act better than the people in this film. The effects are also to be found in computer games and even better made there. There are in fact a little more humour in this part (in the first one there was almost none of it) and that comes from John Rhys-Davies who tries to make something artistic of his dwarf behind the beard.We don't see that much of the four boys or what they are supposed to be. This is far from Tolkien's intentions and one wonders indeed why grown-up people are that interested. If you are 11 years old or younger you might be entertained, but most people aren't.",4,2,3,3 January 2003
Hero," Beauty, once again
","Now is the time to feel rather tired of flying people, people running on water and people cutting down 3.000 (!) enemies in one battle. Maybe not understanding this culture, you are still rather bored now. The colors, the beautiful photo and so on, oh yes, you find it in 'Ying xiong' too, but it takes more to make a good movie.The story about the three murderers trying to kill the king of Qin is told in a fast way. The stunts and other effects, well you have computers nowadays. It's too much violent dying in white clothes without a drip of blood. It's not drama really, it's just photos forming a motion.",6,0,1,2 May 2003
The Hurt Locker," No heroes
","A bomb desarmation squad in Iraq. One of them is the expert of experts. But he doesn't do it because he's an hero or because he believes in so called freedom. He does it for the adrenaline.It sounds like another idiotic super banner-waving war action movie, but it isn't. It's not important who's gonna win or who deserves to win. The soldiers are frightened, cries sometimes, hates it all sometimes, like they were civilians. What this movie wants to say is: There is no such thing as a soldier's identity.But the excitement tricks are much the same as one is used too. It makes the message more pale when it's supposed to be.",7,1,3,10 December 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A really weird story
","A boy is born. But there's something strange about him. He has the face and the body of an 80-year-old. Although baby-size.And he gets younger and younger for every year. That's good in the middle of his life, but causes problems before and after that. One thing goes for sure. The makeup artist here really deserves an Oscar.Brad Pitt makes a great performance, especially as the old man. And the first hour really tells the story in a great way, but the tempo slows down. And you have no doubts about what will happen.Anyway a very clever script, which tells the story of the American 20th century through eyes turned inside out in many ways.",7,0,1,19 January 2009
Lincoln," How to get freedom
","The Civil War is almost over, but it's not self evident that the 13th amendment is passed in the House. If the war is already won, why fight for that? Do the congressmen really believe all people are created equal?This is 2,5 exciting hours, there the excitement comes almost entirely from conversation. President Lincoln is no angel. He buys votes from racist Democrats or send people to just humiliate them. The outcome is anyway not certain.Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely tremendous, being Lincoln both as something from a cartoon and as a believable real person. Great handicraft from Steven Spielberg.",8,0,2,4 March 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Far from knock-out
","There are some good boxing movies, but they all share the same problems: The boxing scenes aren't realistic. In 'Million Dollar Baby' we meet the same problem. There are raw swings here, that wouldn't be accepted even by drunken gold miners in the West. It's obvious, also to a boxing ignorant.But surely Hillary Swank is good and Clint Eastwood too. But until the last half hour, you can't understand all the fuzz about this, except for the famous people who are in it. Swank does the boxing trash broad who fights herself up. You have seen it before, I promise.But in the end there is a discussion about existentialist matters, that you hadn't expected and Swank is really great here. It doesn't save this picture, but make it bearable.",6,0,2,16 May 2005
Garden State," Garden flower
","Zach Braff has made it. Both script, directing and main acting, and everything is more than all right. This is a film without violence about people living ordinary extra-ordinary lives and it's much more interesting than extra-ordinary murders, which very, very few, even in the USA, encounter.The 'hero' has been going on tranquilizers for all his grown up-life and even before that. He's got no feelings left, not even for the death of his mother. Then he meets a girl, well acted indeed by Natalie Portman, who unlocks him slowly, saying the right things all the time without knowing it.Hours after you've seen this, you realize that here was a crucial moment, this was a turning point and so on. The love story gets a little sentimental at the end, but still this is a film that lives long after you've seen it through.",8,180,270,23 January 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," After all, you had expected worse
","If you haven't read Stieg Larsson's books in Sweden, you're excluded from all forms of social life here. The phenomena is strange to me, although I've of course also read the stuff. OK, you can't stop reading, but...Anyway, here happens what almost always happens, which means the movie doesn't live up to the standards of the book. You sit through the 2,5 hours without problems, although its 0,5 hour too much.Anyway, if you're from Sweden, you will laugh at the right places, but I doubt somebody from abroad, who hasn't read the books, will appreciate this that much. But Noomi Rapace as the mysterious Lisbeth Sallander really makes something good out her very weird character. It's not an easy part to play and it could easily have been something from the comics, but Rapace reminds you of a real human being. But a very strange one.",6,24,72,6 March 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Lights in the dark
","It's really the 50s that I am old enough to remember it. Not just the furniture and the clothes, but the moving and face expressions of the actors. That's brilliant! This is about the McCarthy era and in a very clever way the original cuts from his (and other's) TV performances are included. Of course that gives even more of a reality feeling, together with the b/w.This is about morals and trying to swim against the stream and succeeding! Usually such movies are rather naive or even childish, but this a saga for grown-up people. You have more courage when you leave. You might even be a somewhat better person. Sounds too good, but try it!",8,1,2,28 March 2006
Mulholland Drive," Lynch as usual which means brilliant
","Usually you don't have to watch many seconds before you realize you're watching a David Lynch movie. His style is obvious, but you don't get tired of it. There are many clues, which doesn't lead anywhere. Many scenes that you in the end don't know why they were there. Lynch gets through with it anyhow as always.Although his actors mostly performs in a very theatrical dreamlike way, it is rather easy to feel sympathy for their characters, although not always of course. These films are not intellectual. The best way of watching them is to be led through the dream and be glad that you don't appear in it.",8,0,1,9 August 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," How about some screwball comedy next time?
","Yes, he is talented. Now he's learning how to use the camera angles too. The cartoon scenes here are good and almost the ones which is hardest to watch. The turning from colors to black and white comes directly in the right second. Mr. Tarantino has rhythm. But does he have the blues?Many critics have complained about the lack of clever dialogue (almost none of them however dares for some reason complain about the violence anymore). Concerning the dialogue the critics are right. There is humour to be find, especially in the scene with the two Japanese men in the Okinawa bar, yelling at each other.But one has to ask: Doesn't Mr. Tarantino get tired of himself? He should make a comedy, a clever comedy with clever comedians and nobody even getting a slap in he face. That would surprise everybody, including Mr. Tarantino, because there he could really give rebirth to something.",6,0,1,31 January 2004
World Trade Center," Why this sentimentality?
","Oliver Stone's got resources and he has fulfilled all promises in making a movie which will bring in money to the production company. And this is well done due to the premises. Many, many extras and an impressing build-up of the catastrophe area.But what annoys viewers from outside the US anyway, is this eternal handkerchief damaging scenes with the families, always described as the total angels. That's 'Hollywood tradition' at its worst.This movie would have been stronger if it hadn't concentrated on the fate of these two heroic policemen. Instead there should have been many episodes, including more people. This becomes more of a common action movie than an honest interpretation of what really happened 11th September. Stone can do much better.",5,3,8,10 October 2006
Black Hawk Down," If it weren't for all the phrases...
","Oh yes.This is good. You have a claustrophobic feeling through all of it. You can feel the anonymous enemy everywhere, behind you and in front of you. You are sitting in a cinema, but you are taking part. It's a good war movie with Sam Shepard as the General leading the battle and also (in many ways) leading the acting.It is said that the Somalians are unpersonalized and that might be true, but that's the way they are looked upon from the main characters, which are the American soldiers. There are sometimes to many Somalians dead from one shot. It's a kind of James Bond heroism, but you can take that too. But in the last half hour the empty phrases are too many, there is too much bravery in the last words from dying soldiers. Where is too much sentimentality and too much, unfortunately, dullness.",6,0,2,28 March 2002
The Dark Knight," Leather show
","Explosions, shooting, beating and more explosions. But surely there's a timing and a rhythm here which is splendid. It's better than the comic magazines from Batman's golden age, the 60s, ever were.Much has been said about Heath Ledger and much of it is true. He really puts on a performance, which gives new aspects to the film psychopaths and he will be remembered for this.Pity the movie is so completely childish, although it's on purpose. And pity it's 30-45 minutes too long. It loses tempo in the last third and there was nothing Ledger could do about it. For many reasons he should have had a much longer life.",7,3,7,3 August 2008

","Sean Penn is becoming one of America's most interesting directors. Although the story-telling here might be conventional, he has his mission.This is about the top student guy, bound for Harvard, who gives his money away to head freedom. That means crossing USA and entering Alaska.But freedom has its prize. He meets several people, who don't approve this freedom in different ways. They give him, voluntarily and not, examples of what life really is about. Nobody makes it on this earth without a society, which can mean so many more things when just the state. If you avoid it, you'll get punished by freedom itself.This is something as unusual as an ideological movie, with a certain morality put there on serious purpose. It doesn't judge the hero, it judges ideas in a way we haven't heard of from American film-making for quite a while. That's interesting.",9,3,7,14 April 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One winding too much
","The acting is brilliant. Jim Carrey is probably making the best job of his life and so is perhaps also Kate Winslet (and she has never ever been bad).Although this going down into people's minds is not to be believed and worse, it doesn't entertain. The script is a little too clever and sincerely nor the cast, nor even the author might be totally sure of what it's all about in every detail.Anyway, the 'common' people here are interesting, living their rather normal life. This is an interesting failure, saved by intelligent dialogue and once again, very intelligent acting.",7,0,1,23 August 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Be used to it whether you like it or not
","Like we weren't overwhelmed by all this future, now it's over us again. The 3D.It's of course very seducing. And it's fun to have swords pointed at you, teacups being thrown in you face and having butterflies around your ears. And the movie is a quite entertaining fantasy including the cutest animals, talking the cutest English and making the funniest faces.It may be here to stay this time. And Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter must have had much fun doing this. It's about computer aesthetics of course, but never mind. Alice really takes us down under.",8,1,3,15 May 2010
The Artist," Silent art
","This is almost perfect. From the smiles, the teeth, the hair-grease, the fox-terrier to the moves. The pastiche of pastiches maybe.The movie business was certainly changed when the talkies came. There were victims as the male hero here. He goes from being The Star to complete misery. And this girl goes from nothing to stardom.It's told in a classic silent movie way, but no doubt, it's made in 2011. The director smiles together with us. After all, we have more than 80 years of other kinds of movies in the baggage. Which makes this much easier to like. And we do listen to the simple story, although we can't hear.",9,1,4,11 March 2012
Saw," Stomach turning of really high quality
","Seven-wannabe they say. To begin with, 'Seven' is rather overestimated and mostly a favorite among the chic film watchers. 'Saw' is much more than a conventional horror movie and much more than 'Seven'.The agony is for real. This claustrophobia hurts and it's hard to alienate yourself from it. This is a chamber play. It's interesting to follow what goes on between the men who are trapped in the bathroom. Both have had complicated lives before they got there. And you are really surprised at the end. When did that last happened in a horror movie? Has it ever occurred? Not what you can remember of.Great job by director James Wan. Unfortunately there will be a 'Saw 2'. Can he manage that risk?",9,1,2,27 March 2005
From Hell," Victorian gore and splatter
","Well, you can't possibly expect to see a movie from the year 2001 about Jack the Ripper, without sickening scenes. It's strange however how this graphic violence has become common in many mainstream films nowadays. And its getting worse all the time.'From Hell' is better than one did imagine. Most credit goes to the East End environment (filmed in Prague actually). But not just the environment, but also the make-up, the clothing, the mood of this area is to be believed as authentical.But Johnny Depp isn't good. He goes through the whole film with the same expression, even while 'chasing the dragon' in the opium dens. Better acting comes from Heather Graham and many things have been said about her being too pretty, but that's not important She is believeable and so is definitely Robbie Coltrane as the police sergeant.Two hours don't appear to be too long. It is entertaining all the time, if you can take cut throats and ripped out hearts. Does the story hold together? Well, the end is surprising. And somewhat happy, despite of everything.",6,1,2,27 April 2002
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Give us some people, Mr. Loach
","Ken Loach is going backwards and gets younger and younger. A proof of that is his characters getting more and more uncomplicated.This is about a rather forgotten part of European 20th century history, the Irish rebellion. As he's done before, Loach gives us history through the individuals. Two brothers first fight the British, than fight themselves, being on different sides in the civil war.I'm sorry to say that this very fast comes down to a 50s western film level. The theme is about honor, glory and not selling your ideals out. In fact, it would have been much more interesting if Loach had concentrated on the Irish conflict between enterprise and workers instead. There's a lame try to do that here, but the focus is on a rather one-dimensional struggle between two brothers. And of course the British are shown as nothing like bastards, which they sometimes were of course, but it becomes boring.",4,7,14,1 October 2006
Inside Man," Too clever
","This is a thriller there you really can't tell which are the good guys and which are the bad. It confuses you many times. It's a fascinating try, but it is...too clever.There's a smart dialog here. And too smart clothes. And no real people. Washington, Dafoe, Plummer and Foster don't work that hard; maybe they are a little confused about the content too.If it wasn't for Spike Lee directing, I don't think this movie would have been made. Not in Hollywood and not anywhere else. It's an interesting failure and, by all means, a rather entertaining one. But if you expect tension, you'll get disappointed.",6,1,2,6 June 2006
Les Misérables," Musical and revolt
","'Les Misérables' is filled with intolerable sentimentality and some songs which are show-stoppers and I mean show-stoppers. It also has a social context, as Victor Hugo had, and this version focuses much on that. Which is good. Mainstream has for too long not wanted to worry audiences about such things.All actors sing themselves and Russell Crowe has some real talent for it. The film is colorful also for other reasons, although 2,5 hours is a little too long. In stage versions, there is an intermission.You can surely smell France in the early 1800s, although it maybe doesn't have much to do with the mood of Victor Hugo. But it's clever anyway.",7,1,1,1 April 2013
The Da Vinci Code," There's the conspiracy?
","If you haven't read the book, you can watch it with 'fresh eyes', so to say. The fact is that this script would never have been filmed, without being based on a bestseller.It can't decide whether it's about discussions, 'philosophy' or action. It fails in all ways. Tom Hanks is no disaster, but doesn't work that hard. Audrey Tautou are mostly a comic book character, making one of her worst performances.I have no interest in this playing with letters, stupid cardinals and zombie monks. Too much money spent on marketing European travel agencies. Buy a book about art history instead.",4,2,5,21 May 2006
Mystic River," Well done by Eastwood
","This is done in a European way, whatever that means. It's however a complicated story, with persons definitely not in black and white and it puts complicated questions about a complicated morality.Besides it is very well performed, especially by Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon, but also by the rest of the cast. Penn is all the movie on the level to explode while Bacon is acting by small means, concerning his way of speaking, looking at people and so on. He is also near an explosion, but it isn't that obvious.You feel quite uncomfortable together with all these tough feelings and you will definitely not feel unshaken when you leave the movie house. Probably Clint Eastwood's best film so far. He is really getting the respect he deserves now. Or maybe it hasn't been until now that he deserved it.",8,0,1,29 December 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Dear IMDb voters
","How is it possible to give this an average of 8 points? This is a lying movie, without compassion, without even the slightest realism in portraying mental illness, without even good acting.Forgive me, but I thought strings were taken out of Hollywood movies in the late 60s. I know the producers have one interest and that is making dollars, but strings??? This movie is already sentimental without them and worst of all sentimentality is the main characters speech to his wife at the end. This can't be tolerated and it is really ridiculing the Mr. Nash of the real world, who is said having disliked this movie. That's a healthy view.",3,3,6,18 April 2002
The Departed," Boston fuzz
","Scorsese has never made a bad movie and this one keeps to the tradition. But what would it be without Nicholson? He completely dominates every second he's in view and you can only capitulate.Damon and DiCaprio are more problematic. There's no aura around them and in the beginning you even have some difficulties knowing who's who. Perhaps that's on purpose by Scorsese. The two are supposed to be confused in this script. Who is bad and who is good? We shouldn't be too sure about it.Anyway, this is certainly entertaining and has an intelligent dialog, although with lots of dirty language.",7,0,2,9 February 2007
The Holiday," Screwball comedy on routine
","After 10 minutes you know how it will end. Well, maybe you knew it from the start. It's a little strange that this script brings you 2 hours and 15 minutes, because it's hardly fit for an hour.But it's Kate Winslet's movie and you can certainly have her charisma for many days. Cameron Diaz is not bad, but has her obvious limitations which anyway is nothing to Jude Law's, who doesn't function in these kind of comedies. Eli Wallach is of course great, not just because he's over 90.This is supposed to be the perfect first-date-movie. Maybe the daters should skip it and go to a restaurant instead. The Hollywood heritage of the 30s and 40s isn't handled in a nice way.",5,1,4,4 January 2007
Crazy Heart," Crazy once again
","There's a view in Europe about the Real America. That includes loser towns in Texas, unemployment, men in big white hats and, of course, bars with country music.This movie is about all that and perhaps you would have sighed a little, if it wasn't for Jeff Bridges. Somehow he seems to always make the same character. Bridges is the American champion in showing us tired old men who drinks too much and doesn't remember if they've been married four or five times. But being such a champion is of course a guarantee for quality.Anyway, 'Crazy Heart', avoids the worst sentimentality. Otherwise, there would be a problem here.",7,1,2,20 March 2010
War of the Worlds," Spielberg ./. Wells
","I had hoped for the worst. I had hoped for a catastrophe on the screen and I'm not referring to the marsians trying to smash the US. But this isn't that bad after all.Spielberg of course has had all the money in the world to get any effect he wants. And he seems to have used much of that money. But the computers really do a nice job here and so is also Tom Cruise. His love affairs during the last months doesn't prevent him from having capacity as an actor. Even in a film like this.Spielberg probably doesn't beat Orwell's radio version from the late 30s, but the two hours run fast.",6,1,3,10 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," There we go once more
","This movie already has a grand reputation for being epic, including a slight capitalism critic. But the plot is rather average and the epic thing about it is maybe the main character, although he doesn't develop much from the different confrontations he gets into.That's not Daniel Day-Lewis' fault. He can surely make the 'Gangs of New York'-trip once more and comes out of it with honor. Day-Lewis finds the depths when they're there and doesn't pretend to make anything more out of the character than there is in the script. Or in life.The great performance however comes from Kevin O'Connor in a rather small but important part. Anyway this movie wouldn't get the seven points it gets from me, without the last scene, which is quite nerve-breaking, but also a great struggle between bad and bad, there you can't foresee the outcome. If the rest of the movie was like that, it might have been a masterpiece.",7,3,8,2 March 2008
Downfall," Last days
","Yes, it could have happened in this way and Hitler might have been like that. This ought to be Bruno Ganz' greatest acting so far and that means really a lot, to say the least. Not just the masking, but also Hitler's moving as you've seen it in old journal films from the time. The voice is there too.There is much good acting here, especially from Heino Ferch as Speer. Alexandra Maria Lara works by small although theatrical means as Hitler's secretary, but still preserves the documentary feeling. The only main character who doesn't really keep up with the rest of the crew is Urlich Matthes' Goebbels. Here 'theatre' becomes to strong.See 'Der Untergang'. You will remember it for long.",8,1,3,12 March 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Nightmare without real fear
","Much has been said about the claustrophobia here and the constant latent threat. I don't find it really. It's of course a great performance by Forest Whitaker, but how difficult is it really to play a thug? It doesn't take that much for a trained skilled actor.From the beginning to the end, it's a rather conventional thriller about the young Scottish doctor who is hired by Ugandian dictator Idi Amin. The doctor is naive, but learns more and more about destructive politics in Uganda and about his own more and more destructive situation.The main line here is of course someone saying to the doctor that he hasn't experienced anything real. That's true, but goes somewhat for this picture as well.",6,3,5,1 April 2007
The Reader," No, it doesn't work
","It's not just that Germans in Germany of 1958 speak English. Even their books are in English. And that's not all. Surely Kate Winslet does a good performance, better than that of Ralph Fiennes, but she acts in an Anglo-Saxon way.And this is still a very German story. It's about the 15-year-old boy who starts this love affair with a much older woman. He meets her again during his law studies and understands that everything was false. From the beginning of the affair and also from the past. That leads to consequences for his future life.There are many interesting questions about guilt here. The one we deserve and the one we don't deserve. But it's anyway very mainstream. You have the feeling you've been cheated here. Not just because of the English language.",5,4,8,26 April 2009
The Wrestler," An actor's movie if there ever was one
","The script is ambitious. What does the body mean? It means a lot to a wrestler and a stripper, but when the body gets older, is there any life left? Or is death to be preferred? Immediately or later on? Perhaps that's a question everyone has to put to them themselves.So these questions are put also here, but anyway it's very simplified. If it wasn't for the tremendous acting, the movie wouldn't mean much.Mickey Rourke deserves all the applause he has got, but Marisa Tomei is his equal, making a very distinguished portrait and catalyst out of her stripper part. But perhaps the best actor of them all is Evan Rachel Wood as the wrestler's daughter. There is a final scene between them with very profound emotions. It's the strongest part of the movie.",7,0,0,15 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Will it ever end? No!
","This was the first time I fell asleep during a Star Wars movie and it was during the explosions. That might say something about the dialogue.It's disappointing to see actors like for example Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman doing such poor jobs here. But it's quite hard to put life in these lines. This seems to be low budget too, compared to the previous films in the series anyway. Very few explosions and much talking instead.There still is some humor to be found here and that makes it bearable. But it's hard to understand the Star War cult anyway. But now we at least know why Darth Vader looks like he does.",4,1,3,16 August 2005
Inception," What?
","I haven't got the faintest idea of what this is about. Perhaps something about controlling other people's dreams, to get what you want. In this case it's once again the evil corporation, which wants to rule the world. OK, great.In fact there is no plot or five running at the same time. You decide. You can see Paris upside down if you're interested, but really, the time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over.Together with all the quasi-intellectualism in the dialog, this is very hard to stand and not even entertaining. Something is wrong when you're bored already after two minutes and then, there are more than 140 minutes to go. A serious warning about this.",3,12,22,3 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Cockney action
","You're tired of the genre even before it has become a worn-out cliché. What on earth is the point in Holmes fighting in slow motion and Dr. Watson (!) being an even better boxer? And you're already tired of this computer made Victorian London with its alleys and rain. The story is obviously inspired by today's (movie) terrorism, but it doesn't get better, being put back to the 1890s.But if you put on your 11-year-old eyes and stop thinking, you are not that bored. But it's a good thing Conan Doyle is dead. He had no intentions of having this kind of remake made. Try to avoid this and read his texts instead.",5,2,5,4 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," How it all began
","This is not an action movie. It's what you perhaps can call an intellectual thriller, about the man who dedicates his life to a 'higher mission', but pays his price.Matt Damon is here at his best, talking to us without changing the expression in his face or the tone in his voice. It's his moves and his eyes which make it and it's a great performance. Angelina Jolie is OK, but doesn't show us the real depths of the wife, tormented by duties. Other's duties.Well done by director Robert De Niro, who has no intention of making it easy for himself, by filling this movie with violence. The violence is on a completely other level.",8,1,2,5 May 2007
The Queen," Queen Helen
","This is about the reactions, or non-reactions, from the British Royal family after Prinsess Diana's death. Should we care about that? Yes, we have too, because of this performance by Helen Mirren. And Martin Sheen.Most of this movie is built around Mirren's acting, that sometimes goes a little too far. She knows almost too well when to put power in mimic or tone, but you still capitulate. Sheen's performance as Tony Blair is in fact nearly on the same level. Very skillful indeed, including voice and that 'Cheshire cat smile', as the Queen Mother puts it.A funny movie, a performance. But without these actors, the script would be mostly like any TV drama on the subject.",7,1,3,18 February 2007
Bruce Almighty," No power at all
","The idea might be funny if better performed. Give a man the power of God for a week and let him know how easy that is. You might bring some philosophy in it, between the laughs and between the 'theology'.But here you are mostly supposed to laugh at Jim Carey's funny faces and that's tough work. Does anybody still laugh at him? That man is a parody of himself and has been so for years. Why was he hired?Jennifer Aniston doesn't have to work very hard in this part, but she is a competent actress. The movie is a failure however. The Almighty should have used his powers.",3,1,3,22 July 2003
Casino Royale," I miss the old times
","There is some renewing here, but it's not about improvement. There's too much running, too much playing cards and absolutely too many cellphones! There is a serious try of making the love story interesting, but the two contrahents are not that exciting. There is also a try of updating (or is it really an updating?) the world of Bond, including modern terrorism and its financing. But you don't really care. Bond is always, like he always has been, more interesting than the plot. But the actor performing his character here hasn't that power.One misses the playfulness, the irony, the sarcasms. I prefer any Bond movie from the 60s and not at all just because of Sean Connery.",4,14,24,28 December 2006
La Vie En Rose," Keep your eye on the sparrow
","OK, this is surely a melodrama, but quite intense, about the mostly tragic life of Edith Piaf; who has became an icon and a symbol for Paris during the 1900s.Marion Cotillard is simply splendid and really have the looks of the original in a way which is nearly frightening. She's the main person here. Not just because she plays the main character, but also because of her immense passion and intensity.A very theatrical movie, but somewhat you understand that it has been watching the American market with one eye, since much of the plot takes place in USA. Anyway you're not untouched and get even more interested in Edith Piaf's art, then you were before.",7,1,4,26 July 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," USA vs. Europe
","Woody Allen has moved and he obviously intends to stay in this Europe which fascinates him. Maybe a little too much. And that also goes for the girl characters here, Vicky and Cristina, who becomes engaged in this foreign world. And also foreign love.As always Allen uses his old tricks which you never get tired of. That means his funny dialog, mocking with intellectuals and still loving them. This could be just another Allen movie, if it wasn't for the great Penelope Cruz, who enters like a violent tornado and shakes everybody's lives.A little too much respect for 'European' ways and 'European' love, whatever that is. But you're never bored and never will be bored from an Allen movie.",7,1,4,18 October 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Worse than I thought
","OK. What do you expect? Have you seen 'Die Hard' movies before, you know exactly what to expect, but things get out of hand here.The story is about this super-hacker, trying to destroy all American computer networks, including communications, energy systems and so on. This could happen in a James Bond movie and as it does in such movies, the hero makes everything all right in the end, killing lots of people with extremely little blood.So far, so bad. But the final scenes are so ridiculous, that you get too tired even to smile. If there's humor in James Bond, it's just boredom here. And since Bruce Willis really is to be considered the best actor, you get a grip of what it's all about.",4,3,6,5 August 2007
Amélie," Like it yes, but does one have to love it?
","Everybody says this film is wonderful and it certainly has its charm, mostly because of Audrey Tautou in the main part. But what starts really well (considering the story of her childhood) and what goes on building an excitement and much expectations in the following half hour, can't live up to this.This is at least 30 minutes too long. The people are funny to watch, but they aren't really humans, just charicatures. This is a child story with eroticism but not really grown up love. The cinema audiences reactions are a little too pretold and foreseen. This is a little bit too calculated.But it is indeed very clever in many ways, but really one can't alltogether understand so many peoples devotion. Are they really so tired of all evilness shown in most films of today?",5,0,3,24 November 2001
Moonrise Kingdom," Scouting mythology
","1965. Another year legend, like all years of the 60s are nowadays. An American scout camp, named Ivanhoe, including all what this means. A boy escapes and has a secret meeting with a girl. The wildlife and the wild life begin.Wes Anderson has probably made the funniest film of the year so far. Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Hillary Swank, to name a few, are also making parts which is on the contrary to what they use make.A dream adventure, which anyway towards the end gets a little too much into a dream. But our love for the mythological 60s will certainly not waken after seeing this.",8,2,3,16 June 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Computer game over
","One of the greatest triumphs in movie marketing has finished (or has it?). Regarding all billions of dollars there must be more to come.
It's very difficult to understand all the fuzz about this trilogy. The plot is told in an average way, you have seen all the effects before (many, many times) and the acting is really no acting at all. Yes, it's entertaining in a way professional action movies mostly are. Cut the first hour and the last half hour and keep the battles. That would do this a perfect movie for twelve-year-olds.Yes, many things are professionally done on the screen here and you surely don't feel like you've been sitting in the same chair for about 3,5 hours. But once again. What's the fuzz?",4,6,14,6 February 2004
Munich," Tragedy followed by another tragedy
","What happened in Munich 1972 was extreme. But much more extreme is what happened afterwards, according to this movie. That is the retaliation by the Israelis, totally ignoring the laws of other countries and those of their own. Death squadrons were sent out to murder the ones Israel, without any trials or proper police investigations, found guilty.True story or not, there is a moral discussion here about these things, but that doesn't seem to be most important issue. This is an action movie, not very exciting, and the Palestines are mostly shown as uncomplicated fanatics, although not all the time. The focus is on the Israeli agents, but it doesn't go deeply.If you want to be entertained for almost three hours (although it's one hour too much), see this. But don't expect any really interesting questions or answers.",6,0,1,12 February 2006
Hart's War," 11th September moral in 1945
","It starts all right. The grey-tone scale in the prison camp is well photographed and you think you are watching a rather exciting war drama. But that's only what you think. It tends to be Sunday School drama with that kind of morality included and lots and lots of empty words about honour, sacrifices and so on. bin Ladin has really done lots of damage.Bruce Willis is OK as the American colonel; he is an underestimated actor. But Colin Farrell's puppy-like looks are not even a parody on themselves, they are only tiresome. And Marcel Iures' German colonel is the same character we have seen in too many films, starting in 1945 probably.You ought to miss this one!",3,7,10,21 May 2002
Sin City," 'Sun' City
","Clever. Very clever. Much of Frank Miller's original comic book feeling is here, but even more sophisticated.The hardboiled lines are delivered in a hardboiled way, but the emotions are strong. The interesting thing is not the violent vigilante stories, but the stories about love. Love is complicated here. It goes far beyond what you find in comics; even in the ones of Frank Miller. You get interested in these people. Their vigilante actions might be regarded as completely primitive fantasies, but their love actions and shortcomings are from life.Bruce Willis once again shows that he is a really talented actor. Usually he hides it well, but not here. See this, if you can stand lots and lots of yellow and sometimes even red blood. There is sun sometimes even in Sin City.",8,1,2,24 July 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Two pictures in one
","Everything winning eight Oscars should make you suspicious. This is no exception. The plot is already well known. It's about the young guy from the slum who gets to higher and higher levels in the Indian version of 'Who wants to be a millionaire?'. Is he cheating or not? How can he know all this? The first hour is a hectic pseudo documentary about the quite brutal childhood of two brothers in the slums of Bombay. It's funny and barbaric and very well cut.The other half is a quite conventional melodramatic love story and both the tempo and your interest gets lower and lower. 9 points for hour 1 and 4 points for hour 2. There are more and deeper things to say about the modern Indian development. Can we ask for higher ambitions during all two hours, please?",7,1,3,8 March 2009
The Social Network," The Facebook story
","This guy is one of the much loved American film nerds. But he isn't much lovable. Quite arrogant, too clever and an absolute lousy dater. He's much more successful in front of the computer.So he creates Facebook and heads big business. Not with a little help from his friends, on the contrary, but with big help from this Napster guy.There's one problem here. They talk far too much and sometimes you almost have the feeling that you're listening to radio theatre. If it wasn't for this screen. Good handicraft about a very present story, but not really filmish.",7,2,4,3 January 2011
The Great Gatsby," Greatest Gatsby ever?
","Didn't have great expectations, but became surprised. Suddenly I think I understand what Fitzgerald's novel is about.What Gatsby does is having a hope so extreme, that he even thinks he can not only stop time, but bring it back. That's reality to him. The green light far away but so near is the symbol, but God watches it all through the eyes of a dirty poster.Not that Di Caprio is good, but he is the engine of the Plaza Hotel scene, which puts everything on the edge. Existentialism shines through all the flapper luxury. And the green light is still there, even after the party is over.",8,2,3,10 June 2013
The Proposal," Not the first time and certainly not the last.
","Sandra Bullock is every grandmother's ideal daughter-in-law. And she is many middle-aged men's ideal wife.This time, however, she does the bitchy editor-boss, scaring her staff. But for certain reasons Bullock runs the risk of being deported and therefore she has to perform this phony marriage. She and her so called fiancé go to Alaska. You probably understand what happens there.Bullock goes on routine and so does the script. Except for some updatings, this could have been done in the 30s as well. The attitudes are mainly the same. And that certainly goes for the end. A renewal of charming love comedies feels urgent",5,1,1,6 August 2009
Valkyrie," Tom Cruise goes Wehrmacht
","It's amazing to hear even Hitler talk English. I can understand that Tom Cruise as von Stauffenberg aren't trustworthy as German-speaking, but he's not trustworthy at all here. This must be one of his worst performances.The movie tells the story about how von Stauffenberg tried to assassinate Hitler in 1944. It's no disaster and you can believe in some of the environments and some of the creepy scare among the conspiracy activists, but it's definitely more of an American film than a movie about German history.Leave that part history to German film-makers. And please, stop that English of yours!",5,4,10,11 February 2009
The Fighter," The outcome was clear
","USA has a great tradition when it comes to boxing movies and the masterpieces are of course 'Fat City' and 'Raging Bull'. But somehow the same story is being told all the time. It's about the beaten-up fighter who starts his race upwards, but that wouldn't have been possible without his trainer and his family/wife and besides he's a nice man and...Well, we know that story and here it's being told once again. But Christian Bale is brilliant as the brother/trainer with crack problems. Mark Wahlberg is the fighter hero and he's never been a man of big gestures.

Atonement," Consequences
","A 13-year-old girl, living in a grand English estate, watches some scenes and misinterprets the whole thing. What happens is a disaster, in the long run also for her.This is a movie about power. The one we're aware of and the one we're not. The first hour is tremendous and very clever made. You come to think a little about Antonioni's 'Blow-Up', although this is quite another form of movie and another theme.What brings it down is the rather conventional way the plot develops. It's like two different directors have made the first and the second half. But the first one is a great thriller in a way you haven't seen before. Well worth seeing.",7,0,2,13 January 2008
