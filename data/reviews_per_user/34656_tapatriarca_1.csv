Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Just because it sounds cool! Does not a good movie make
","OK This film really was the pits! VOL 1 didn't impress but wasn't a total loss. Tarrantino wanted to make the COOLEST kung fu flick ever with kick ass fight sequences (none of which even come close to Ang Lee's operatic action in crouching tiger) Vol 2 however has a bunch o f awful monologues trying to out cool each other. this isn't anything new for a tarrantino flick but they generally had a purpose in his other films.QT gives you style, no substance and whole lot of terrible acting.(known for resurrecting careers but nailing the coffin on darryl hannahs here.)QT was looking for a vehicle to throw in as much cool things as he could get out of his pop cultured stew of a brain.In other words if your a 15 year old boy this will be the best film you have seen in your life.The rest of us will be thanking god there is no vol 3.I heard tarrantino abandoned a war film project to make this dribble would much have preferred to see that.",1,1,5,15 September 2004
