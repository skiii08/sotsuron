Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All right, enough is enough!
","Okay, I'll admit it - I gave into the hype. I stood in line for four straight hours in order to get tickets opening day. I should have known better; I wasn't even a huge fan of the original three films. But GEEZ! Couldn't Mr. Lucas, producer of the great Indiana Jones entities among other things have come up with something BETTER??? I mean, R2D2 and C3PO had NO place in this film. They were just there to appease certain Pez candy dispenser collecting freaks in the audience (you know who you are). The costumes were not clever, though one could tell they were trying so desperately to be. I'll admit the special effects and sound were good, but there simply were too many special effects and not enough substance!Believe it or not, I though Jar Jar Binks was perhaps the most entertaining creature in the film, even though his 'how rude' saying annoyed me; especially after Stephanie Tanner so vastly over-used it in the Full House television show.",3,1,2,19 February 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Ya gotta love the romance!
","While not the perfect film, Shakespeare in love does have some of the best original Shakespeare-ian dialog that I have heard since, well, since Shakespeare. If nothing else, this film is actually an interesting yet classic love story with the twist that Will is living out the life of his most famous work as he writes it. When I saw it the first time, I thought it was just okay, but upon subsequent viewings, it just got better and better; probably because of the excellent script and particularly the dialog. Sure, Shakespeare in Love is by no means original (far from it) but it is a clever take on a classic story and classic formula... and even funny at moments, too!",8,0,1,19 February 2000
American Beauty," One of the the best films I have ever seen.
","American Beauty has surpassed my expectations tenfold. Lucky I wasn't sure what to expect (a luxury only too rare nowadays), so I literally sat at the edge of my seat, completely engulfed, for the entire two plus hours. Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance! It has been so long since I have seen a really good movie. I will definitely see it again! As a side note, I got my hands on the real script and though the story is essentially the same, it provided a rather unusual twist as bookends in a courtroom. It was a good read, but the movie was a little less melodramatic than the script and therefore (in my opinion) better.",10,0,0,19 February 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of my All-Time Favorites!
","This is the apex of all Kubrickian films. While it moves tremendously slow plotwise, there is so much going on within the picture that one almost needs that slow-moving storyline to be able to comprehend and grasp the sheer magnitude of it all. Kudos to Kubrick as usual (wherever you are!).",Null,0,2,1 May 1999
