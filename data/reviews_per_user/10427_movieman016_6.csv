The Avengers," Official review of the Avengers.
","I have been very excited for this movie to come out. Being pleased with the other Marvel movies such as Iron man, Thor, etc. I couldn't help but get excited for this one as well. By the time the last credit rolled, I left feeling only half satisfied. On the good side of the movie, amazing CGI, it really was all brought together well creating exciting action sequences. The acting was pretty good also, it was the same old characters we learned to love and adore. But the thing that stuck out the most to me was Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. He brought the character to life and to be quite honest, I didn't really care much for the Hulk until this movie.Now on the other hand, there was a down side to this movie. The movie just seemed to drag on. Almost as if they were building up the characters all over again, but they already had their own movie, so why? Also, and I know I wasn't the only one on this, but the whole story line was to clich√©. Bottom line, it was a really good movie, top ten no, top 50 yes. Although I left the theater feeling half satisfied, it brought back the excitement of the movies and it's a very exciting adventure. Definitely a must see 8/10",9,0,2,4 May 2012
Iron Man 3," Great flick
","The highly anticipated Iron Man 3 is out and to say the least, it was really entertaining. Even though this is the third installment, it builds the story of Tony Stark from rock bottom to top gun superhero in a fashion that was easily paced and never really seemed to be rushed. Shane Black delivers the movie with a darker, serious style, but also kept it's rememberable comedy that gave the first two films their charm. The special effects were great, acting was better than the last two (not saying the last two were bad), and even if this is the last solo Iron Man movie with Robert Downey Jr., then it leaves you with a satisfying taste in your mouth to know that RDJ is, and always will be Iron Man.8/10",8,2,6,3 May 2013
Iron Man 2," OK first off
","Robert Downey Jr played the role of his lifetime. i cant think of a more perfect person for the part. I went into the theater hearing a crap load of bad reviews about this movie so i was expecting it to be not so good but hey with an all-star cast like this its kinda worth seeing. So i'll tell you know, i don't know what those people where watching because this certainly didn't suck at all. Robert Downey and Don Cheadle made a perfect duo. Yes some things in this movie could have been different for example i didn't totally agree with the b-day party scene. Not that it wasn't cool but its just not iron man and hes suppose to be unstoppable but yet Don gets in the suit and totally beats his butt. I was kinda disappointed at the ending fighting scene with whiplash. i was looking for a high action packed fight and i got to see about 10 seconds worth of men getting strangled and blown up. Besides those to things, i thought the movie was very enjoyable and would go see it in a heart beat. Being a guy, I enjoyed the most Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow being in this movie. Scarlett's role as the black widow was very surprising to tell you the truth. She did great with her MMA training and the fighting scenes with her and the things she did...wow thats all i have to say. The CGI and the fighting, all the way round good acting i loved it. its worth the money go see it.8-10",7,4,8,9 May 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," So this is Captain America...
","I saw a midnight screening of this movie and i walked in with high hopes. I like Chris Evans and so far the other Marvel movies that have been released to lead up to the Avengers movie, have been pretty well done.No movie is perfect, but this movie had so much hype, that it had to be...but i (as much as many others) kinda got disappointed. *SPOILERSSSSSS* The scenes in the movie kinda looked like they were put together a little sloppy. One scene didn't add up to the other, but you got the hint on what was going on. Also the ending was rather weak. The last line in the movie 'I had a date', then credits roll...that's not a way to end a superhero movie let alone Captain America.Good things, well the acting was great. The jokes were always spot on and the action was pretty well laid out.Captain America was all around a good movie, i was just sitting at the end of the movie a little disappointed and confused. 7/10",7,8,22,22 July 2011
Evil Dead," Movieman Review
","Recently saw the new Evil Dead and for a short and sweet review, in my opinion, it was pretty good. PROS: The gore (which is one of the main reasons for the remake, higher budget, more money to gross us out) Same eerie feeling from the first one. Different take. Didn't follow the original story line but yet didn't stray to far away.CONS: Acting was sh**ty No development of characters so you really didn't feel anything when they got hacked up. More plot holes then the road that led to the cabin. Overall, the good out weighed the bad. It was a movie that could have done so much more, but yet still made me feel satisfied when I left the theater. 8/10",8,7,24,10 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Amazed!
","Christopher Nolan has out done himself again, striking not just Batman fans, but fans of the series and movie goers everywhere with his beautifully crafted, last installment of The Dark Knight trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. The acting has always been well done in the last two, but something about the last one really made me feel the performances were real, quite like the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one that will be an all time favorite of mine, and a true classic.10/10",10,15,23,3 May 2013
