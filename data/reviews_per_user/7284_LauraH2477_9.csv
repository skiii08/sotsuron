The Ring," Very disturbing
","I see that some people have been really hard on this film because there was apparently a lot of hype about it. Well, I rented it on DVD expecting it to be an average post-Scream horror movie that would be entertaining in a mindless sort of way. Not having a clue that it was a remake probably helped. Anyway, I was completely wrong.   Say what you want about the story or the plot or whatever, but this movie could make it on visuals alone, in my opinion. Whoever put this together seems to have a very good understanding of what sort of images will cause a knot to rise up in your chest and hot chills to run down your spine, and in that respect, The Ring works beautifully. I'm still getting chills and I watched it over an hour ago. It's likely to stay with me for days. I'm not someone who scares easily, and I've experienced a lot of horror movies, including Italian greats like Suspiria. Few films have affected me the way this one has. The Exorcist is really the only one I can think of right now.   I think a lot of people try to intellectualize horror films way too much. The main reason horror films are made is to play on that instinctual, gut-level reaction we have to the abnormal and the unnatural. For the most part, true horror doesn't really try to stimulate your intellect. It's goal is to reduce you to a quivering puddle of human jelly who's scared to get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. If the movie succeeds at that, then you can always use your imagination to fill in whatever gaps you notice when your heart calms down and you're able to think rationally. That's how I like to look at it, anyway. I don't WANT to have a film about the supernatural explain every little detail to me. It takes all the fun out of it. Kills the mystery.   Anyway, if you're here, at this point you know what the movie is about, so I won't describe the plot here. I'll just list some of the things that scared me the most. POSSIBLE SPOILERS - SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!   The image that is most haunting to me right now is the little girl's hair moving up out of the well, seemingly of it's own will, before she climbs out. It's almost as gut-wrenching as the famous head-spinning scene in The Exorcist. Just completely unnatural. Something inside you just screams, 'That's not supposed to be happening, make it stop!' I am trying not to freak out right now as I'm remembering it. I don't think I'll be getting much sleep tonight. The girl's slow lurching towards the television screen as you're hoping the guy will have the good sense to grab a chair and smash the screen before she gets there. The final glimpse at the girl's water-logged, bloated face after she comes out of the screen. The distorted and collapsed faces of her victims is also terribly disturbing. The video of her in the hospital, just sitting silently with her hair obscuring her face, or pacing her cell, never sleeping. Her lonely little loft in the barn. The look on the little boy's face when he asks his mother why she helped the girl get out of the dark place after you thought it was all going to end happily is also quite a blow. The blurred faces of future victims in photographs is effectively creepy. This stuff alone is worth the price of the DVD.   The entire movie is just that, creepy. The beautiful scenery of the gloomy countryside, the stark black and white video and the flashbacks as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the music...it all just gives you a tense, uneasy feeling as you wait for the next haunting image to pop out at you, one that may be so frightening that you can't bear to watch anymore. And that always makes a more intriguing horror film, to me at least, than those films that try to make you jump with loud noises and false scares, and if that doesn't work, outright gross-out. This movie does have a few moments that make you go 'What are they thinking?', but that's to be expected. All-in-all, I think this film is a work of art in it's own right, and I recommend it to everyone. It is definitely one of the best horror films to come out of Hollywood in a while.",Null,0,0,19 March 2003
Meet the Parents," A Terrible Movie
","This movie is almost painful to watch. You just feel sorry for Ben Stiller's character. He basically spends a couple days being tormented and humiliated by his girlfriend's family. There is no way anyone would put up with this crap in real life. I would have left the first night. He is intimidated and nervous around his girlfriend's father, and desperate for approval, so he screws up over and over, each time worse than the last. The father doesn't help matters, as he belittles and embarrasses the poor guy at every opportunity. (Sorry, I forget the characters names.) The girlfriend hardly does a damn thing to stick up for him. Then Dad's friends show up and join in on the fun. One scene in particular has them playing volleyball in the pool and they are ridiculing him for missing the ball. So then he overcompensates and ends up smashing his girlfriend's sister in the face with the ball. They all criticize him, telling him it's 'just a game, Focker!' and act as if he meant to hurt the girl. Another is when he finally has enough and is leaving and the whole bunch stands on the porch and laughs at his given name, which we find out is Gaylord. The girlfriend says nothing, just letting the poor guy take another kick in the teeth after all the other humiliation he's been through for her sake. The entire family is totally unlikable, Focker is the only one I cared about, and that's only because I was forced to care by watching this poor guy get put through the ringer over and over. Then comes the contrived ending where everything is made good in about five minutes and he forgives all. If I were this guy, I would never speak to these psychos again. Sorry to run on so much, but this movie really affected me and I couldn't see how someone could laugh at this guy's misfortunes. Maybe it's just me...",Null,11,18,20 August 2002
Final Destination 2," Mixed feelings
","I liked the first Final Destination because it wasn't the typical teen horror movie, although it wasn't perfect (no movie is). It had a little bit of a story and had quite a few creepy moments. The deaths were sudden and violent, but for the most part they weren't excessive. I had hoped that Final Destination 2 would continue with these traits, but it seemed to be just an excuse to show people being constantly splattered, burned, smashed, ripped, crushed and impaled very graphically. This is not scary, it's just makes the movie hard to watch for some people. I was entertained by the movie because it was fairly fast-paced and because it's fun to pick out all the mistakes, illogic, stupid dialogue, continuity lapses, etc., but I really don't care to see guts and heads flying all over the place. I understand that this is sometimes necessary in horror films, but really, can't we leave SOMETHING to the imagination anymore? All the best horror films have a message or a moral that they are trying to get across to the audience, however crudely executed it is, and that message is the focus of the story. But in Final Destination 2, and similar movies that emphasize blood and guts over plot and atmosphere, there is no message to be taught. It exists for no other purpose than to glorify death and carnage. I don't understand why some people find graphic portrayals of people getting sliced and diced amusing. At least in a movie like, say, Evil Dead, people are taken over by evil spirits that are bent on murdering everything in sight, and they HAVE to be killed in gruesome ways. FD2 is just full of nice people, who have done nothing more evil than avoid a car accident, getting destroyed in the sickest and most painful ways possible. There's no satisfaction in that, it's just sick and mean-spirited. So while it is entertaining, FD2 is definitely not a must-see movie. If you like bad movies, there are plenty out there that are way more entertaining than this one, without all the senseless gore.",Null,0,0,2 December 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Pretty good, but it can't hold a candle to T2.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS This is a very well done action film that's really fun to watch. Acting and special effects are excellent, and Arnold is funny as usual. But it actually does disappoint somewhat, because of course Sarah is gone and John is played by a different actor. The guy who plays John does a good job, but he just doesn't seem like the same person. I'm not sure it would have been much better with Edward Furlong playing the part, though, since this installment of the series lacks both the dark and brutal atmosphere of T1 and the emotional warmth and thought-provoking depth of T2. Those hoping for any deep connection between John and his protector in this episode will be disappointed.  This is a straightforward action flick that doesn't leave much room for that kind of development. And I do like Claire Danes, she always seems to put her all into a performance, but her character didn't really add much to the story. In T1 and T2, Sarah goes from an innocent young girl to a hardened warrior. Danes doesn't seem to do anything but scream and get knocked around. T3 is fun to watch, however, and the new female Terminator does some pretty cool tricks, though she isn't nearly as creepy as Richard Patrick's T-1000. All in all it's worth renting and even buying, as long as you're not expecting it to top T2, which was a masterpiece and the end of the story, as far as I'm concerned.
PS - To those of you who think this was better than T2, please get real here. T2 was more than just an action/sci-fi flick, it was a deeply human story that had something important to say, while T3 is basically just a long, entertaining action sequence. Ok, I'll shut up now.",Null,0,0,28 November 2003
Mulholland Drive," I didn't love it or hate it.
","But I was disappointed, though. For the first hour or so, I thought, well, this has some typical David Lynch weirdness, but I might actually like it. But I guess it just isn't meant to be.I have watched 3 or 4 Lynch films now, and I just can't bring myself to believe he's a genius. I love a movie that makes me think, but Lynch just doesn't give the audience much to work with. It seems like he just films a bunch of scenes, throws them together and walks off laughing with his paycheck in hand, while his fans make up the story based on what THEY think it means. Then they tell everyone who doesn't absolutely RAVE about every crapfest he churns out that they just aren't 'creative' enough, or 'imaginative' enough, or the worst ones - 'You just don't 'get' it' and 'You must only like movies like 'Scream' and 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'. You're so dumb and lazy that you can't appreciate Lynch's genius. I pity you, really.' I mean, it's sad. It's like he's got his own cult, or something.As I was saying, though, I love movies that intrigue me and stay in my mind for a while. The movies that do that for me may not match the standards set by all you super-intellectual filmgoers, but I know when a movie is good. I also know when a movie stinks. And Lynch couldn't make a good movie to save his life. One of the main reasons is because he has no understanding of character development. I don't care how 'original' you want to be with your films, if I don't like your characters or at least despise them heartily enough to be interested in where they will end up at the end of the movie, then why should I care enough to waste time trying to figure it out? There are other, better movies I could be watching.The characters in this film are made of cardboard. Betty was the only one who I came close to liking, but there are several things that kept me from it. One is her hopelessly innocent and naive, 50's sitcom attitude. Then she switches to a raging nympho with a strange old guy in front of a bunch of strangers for an audition. That was totally out of the blue. Next, she's in a raging lesbian love affair with 'Rita' some chick who wandered into her aunt's house and is most likely brain damaged. Judging by Rita's acting skills, someone better get her to a hospital, quick (but hey, she's hot, right). Naomi Watts is a good actress, and she plays her part well, but her character seems to change personalities every five minutes. I can't really tell if I like her or not. The other characters were mostly quirky and weird and had no purpose. They were just thrown in to make it 'freaky' and 'different'. They go nowhere, and then when you get to the end you find out that they aren't GOING to go anywhere, because none of them were who you thought they were. But you didn't really care because they weren't the kind of people anyone would spend five minutes with, anyway.I probably could have handled the ending better if it weren't for the pointless masturbation scene and the tiny, giggling old people. That was just plain laughable. Oh, and if I had given a crap about Diane, who just seemed to be an emotionally disturbed loser. But I didn't get to know Diane because the first chunk of the story was about an entirely made up character that never existed. I don't know about some of you, but I don't like to plunk down even a rental fee just so someone who thinks his every brain-fart is pure genius can jerk me around for 2 hours. I like movies to engage my emotions as well as my mind. I want to feel something besides exasperation that I got taken for a sucker. I won't be getting that from David Lynch.If Dave wants to throw his audience a bone, maybe he could start using all the time that gets eaten away by dead silence and pointless, one-note weirdo characters to throw in a little main character and story development. It wouldn't hurt, in fact it might help some of us stupid people who think Armageddon is an intense psychological drama. Which, of course, is anyone who doesn't love this stinker. But hey, like I said, I don't hate it (though I probably would if not for Naomi Watts), I'm just disappointed. And I am certain that I won't be taking another risk on a Lynch film. I hope anyone who reads this will take my advice and avoid his films at all costs.Oh, and if you didn't like my review, it's simply because you're too narrow-minded to understand my particular brand of genius. You have to go back and read it very carefully three or four times before you will start to piece it together. Trust me, it's a great review. I don't get it yet, either, well, not all of it, but trust me, I just KNOW it's brilliant, complex, symbolic, and a total masterpiece. No? Maybe I should have thrown in a lesbian sex scene?",Null,0,1,21 April 2003
The Evil Dead," One of the best horror films ever
","This is not a movie you need to watch if you have been raised on 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' type horror films. No, this film is for people who grew up watching the films that 'Scream', 'IKWYDLS', etc., got their ideas from.   It's a low-budget 1980's cult classic because it's full of originality, humor, and genuinely scary, sick moments, it never takes itself seriously and neither should the viewer. It intends to scare you, make you laugh, cringe, and even gag at times, and it succeeds in these areas admirably despite its budget and its numerous flaws. Keep in mind that it was made by college students who, in spite of being amateurs, put their best efforts into it. They did a great job and as a result the film is dear to my heart and to many other people who have seen it time and again over the years.
  If you can't relax and enjoy a horror film because you're expecting 'Sixth Sense' type mind games (not knocking 'Sixth Sense', though, it was excellent), then you are also among the folks who should avoid this one, since there is nothing subtle or thought-provoking about it. It's in your face from the start and isn't the slightest bit ashamed of it, but it's done in a very friendly, tongue-in-cheek way. People should just sit back, relax, make fun of the mistakes and bad acting, and enjoy the scares, which are many. A great party flick.",Null,1,2,22 November 2003
Bruce Almighty," Don't listen to the bad reviews
","Wow, what a surprise - a Hollywood film that portrays the Jewish/Christian God in a positive light (and he's black! I know that's gonna cause a lot of problems with the fundamentalists!) I was a bit worried that it would be blasphemous and irreverant, and that at the most I would get a few guilty laughs out of it. Much to my shock, it turned out to be a wonderful movie. Jim Carrey does a great job portraying Bruce, a man whose life isn't going as well as he thinks it should. He blames God for every one of his failures in life, and some of the things he says COULD be considered blasphemous, but this story is really about a man who starts off thinking that money, job status, and the recognition of his peers is what life is all about. However, throughout the course of the movie, and through his meetings with God, he learns what's really important in life, and of course these things are: a relationship with the Creator, love, compassion, and selflessness. Bruce goes from a self-pitying jerk who thinks that God and the world owe him something, to a kind and caring man who puts others before himself. I know that in today's jaded, 'me first' kind of world, a movie with a message like that isn't going to impress people (and that's pretty sad, when you think about it), but instead it's going to be called 'lame', 'preachy', 'corny', 'sappy', and a million other derogatory terms. Well, if you are a person who doesn't really care about majority opinion, then you will see this movie in spite of the bad reviews and decide for yourself, and you may even enjoy it. On the other hand, if you're a person who is easily swayed by critics, or overly religious (yes, that's possible), or someone who can't enjoy a film that lacks a nihilistic, cynical message, then avoid this because you will hate it.
I know I'm buying the DVD.",Null,0,1,3 December 2003
Identity," Pretty disappointing in the end
","I expected this movie to be really good, and it is entertaining up until the 'big twist' at the end, which just ruined everything. The performances were good all around, and it could have been a solid thriller if it weren't for the cop-out ending. As it is, though, I certainly could have lived without ever having seen it. I do feel the need to say to all the people who rave about this movie and how original it is and then call anyone who disagrees with them an idiot - just because someone doesn't share your opinions, it really doesn't mean they're beneath you in intelligence. If you were a mature adult, you would realize that, and when you start name-calling, you sound really insecure. Truth is, there really isn't one scene or idea in this movie that hasn't been done before, and better in some cases. Also, it in NO WAY compares to The Ring in the chills department. The Ring did have a few cliches, but it was actually original. Unlike Identity. All in all, this was just a let-down.",Null,0,1,9 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best movie ever made!!
","This movie is as amazing as it was expected to be. I've seen it three times now, and it takes at least that many viewings to take everything in. This is the movie with everything - adventure, romance, horror, tragedy, great acting, great special effects, beautiful music, costumes, and scenery. All the rabid Tolkien fanatics who criticize this trilogy need to get a grip on reality. There is no way anyone on earth could ever put every detail of the books onto film. No one even had the guts to attempt to get it on film until Peter Jackson decided to dedicate years of his life to the project. He and all the actors and crew worked their butts off to get this extraordinary work done, and they did a wonderful job. It's as close to perfect as you will ever get, so why don't you quit whining and enjoy the films for what they are. They are historic pieces of cinema and will be treasured as classics for many years to come. They will lead many people to read the books so they can learn more about these beautiful characters that so many of us have come to love through watching the films. I can't begin to tell how much Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Boromir, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimlee, Theodin, etc., have affected me. I feel like these characters are my friends, or at least they make me wish I had friends as true as these. I am really looking forward to reading the books so I can spend more time with them. Anyway, to all the critics, if you think you can do a better job than Peter Jackson, I wish you'd try. I would love to see it.",Null,0,0,24 December 2003
