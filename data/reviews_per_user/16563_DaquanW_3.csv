Casablanca," first timer
","Never seen Casablanca before, iv herd a lot about it, iv seen cartoon remakes of the movie but never the actual movie. Seeing it for the first time I actually thought it was really good. lighting was great throughout the entire movie you always saw just what you needed to understand and feel connected to the movie. never seeing the movie and hearing a bunch of quotes on the movie really blew my mind. iv herd 'here's to you kid' somewhere before and I just was shocked it was from that movie. the lovers quarrel in the story was really good I learned a lot about the history of the war in this movie a lot more then I though I would.",8,0,2,5 March 2015
Annie Hall," new fan
","iv never seen a woody Allen film besides antz (which is a really great movie) even though its animated woody Allen's character still has a lot of his traits, smart and very sarcastic, also extremely witty and sort of shy. but this film was really great for the first time of me seeing it. the whole time in my head I watched this film I mistook woody Allen for woody Harrison boy was I way off. for some reason all his characters in his movie are always connected with sex, was this guy a sex maniac in his younger years or is this something that has always been in his background? And woody Allen is not the most attractive guy (no offense) but what made him want to go that angle, I just the 60s and 70s everyone was a sex addict.",7,0,0,28 April 2015
The Graduate," first time lover
","this movie blew my mind completely, secretly this is like the American dream for young men, I think every man that watched this movie wished they were in the same position as him (no pun intended) track star of a wealthy family, and just graduated college. he sure sowed some wild oats. iv never seen this movie till I watched it in class, I absolutely loved that Dustin Hoffman was in this film, had no idea. he was hilarious! hi character just seemed so shy borderline weird and I loved it. he was so non chalet, everything that anyone said to him kind of just went over his head. he'd be so in his own mind sometimes, I can defiantly relate to that. I love movies that connect with you as a viewer.",7,0,0,16 April 2015
