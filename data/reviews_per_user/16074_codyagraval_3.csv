Scarface," Great Film........
","It took me three sittings to watch this film, I don't personally like it. But don't let that deter you. It is one of the best films I have seen.It couldn't have gone wrong, really, when you have the mix of Brian de Palma directing, Oliver Stone writing, and of course Al Pacino acting (and throw in there Michelle Pfeiffer to sell it further). It delivers on direction, with that unmistakable retro look, and cinematography was great at times. The acting was great from start to finish, Al Pacino sells his Cuban character really well (that's an understatement) and supporting actors do a fantastic job, too. The set designs and the locations, as well as the music, really do a great job in bringing the story to reality. It is amazing how the film, with all these sets and all the big names, was made for only $25 mil. I like to think, for that reason, that it is slightly art-house (you can argue with me there) in that its concept and quality really strays from the typical Hollywood film we know today (if you compare the calibre of films Hollywood made in the 70s and 80s, and the different types of film we see in today's Hollywood you'll notice the artistic difference (again; you can argue that)). Its box office receipts do reflect this, and so the budget was perfectly set to set the film up to make a profit.The script is where I start to be divided. On one hand it is fantastic; elements of the American Dream are strong, and the character development of all the key characters is brilliant! The realism in each characters lines is priceless. The only quibble I have with the script is that I found it to be quite formulaic. I thought for the caliber of film it is the script could have taken a chance and branched out from the typical plot structure and realised a greater artistic appeal (with albeit a lesser commercial appeal). When you compare it to the Godfather I & II for example, the difference and quality of plot structure is quite evident. (Granted, the Godfather films were based on books, and these films' particular religious adherence to the books makes its plot structure more appealing, and is one of its greatest selling points.) For me, the formulaic script was an annoyance which slightly flawed the whole film. However, I am definitely the minority on this point, and I stress that with every other facet of Scarface, it is a high quality and entertaining film.",7,0,1,16 May 2007
3:10 to Yuma," The Western. Updated.
","Everyone's saying it. This is the Western of the 2000s like Unforgiven was for the 90s. I liked Unforgiven, and I liked 3:10.I like 3:10 better, though. I dunno bout those of you who have seen the original of this film, and I dunno if they modified the story for this version, but it seemed to be one of the most original westerns I've seen. Or maybe its that I love Westerns without clich√©s. The supporting stereotypical characters seemed very grounded and real. The acting by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale is worth paying for alone. And the direction was great. The maturity of this film is priceless, something Hollywood is starting to dish out nowadays. My hat's off to James Mangold and his crew.I will probably have to tame my vote back down to 8 when I've psyched down a bit, cause it is a little slow in the earlier part of the film. This works for character building--and some great dialogue--and tension building, but the tension doesn't really get built until towards the end of the film, so that slower pace is definitely noticeable.Thats my only grovel, though, for a film that is personally a 9.5 out of ten, but I don't wanna build your expectations. Enjoy it. And Mr. Mangold, I'm keenly awaiting your next project.",9,2,5,30 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," I Won't Call It 'Epic,' But That Word Is On The Tip Of My Tongue
","There is some criticism out there that this film is slightly too long, that some scenes are a little bit too different (and drawn out), and that the plot line can be too involving sometimes. These are all true, and it is commonly the case when a director has a billion dollar grossing film under his belt which then allows him or her more creative freedom from their commercially minded producers and studios (remember PJs King Kong?). We all know when watching it that there will be that great action sequence at the end, and it is great, yes, but the potentially confusing, backstabbing and treacherous plot line preceding it, in my mind could have been toned down a notch so more epic-like action could be fitted in earlier on in the film as well as at the end.However, with all this in mind, the film still manages, somehow, to keep your attention for its nearly 3 hour entirety. And its a keen, engrossed and excited attention that it gets from its audience, too. One of its greatest appeals is its unique and appealing style which we are rarely given the pleasure to witness. The style arises out of that largely unexplored area somewhere between 'artsy' films, fantasy films, commercial films and of course, comedies. You can't help but think that in 20 years time, people will watch this again for the first time since when they were kids and revere in the nostalgia (and finally get the story line), like we did with Indiana Jones and Star Wars amongst others.It will be very interesting to see if this film, with its Luke warm reception from critics and its massive momentum from 'Pirates 2', will beat out the Spidey to regain its opening weekend records, and whether it can carry through to earn more than 'Pirates 2's $1 billion Worldwide BO taking. If it does, I think we'll be seeing wicked Jack a couple more times.",7,0,1,24 May 2007
