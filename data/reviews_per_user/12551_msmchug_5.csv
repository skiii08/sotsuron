Insidious: Chapter 2," This has ruined the first film!
",This film was a major let down and I think five stars is quite generous! Chapter two picks up straight from the end of the first film. Its like the director completely over thought the story - remember the woman who appeared closer and closer in all the photos? Well in this film that woman is actually a man... A man serial killer who wears a black dress. Why? I don't know why.. I think because his mom abused him and made him dress like a girl. There was no point to it. There are also lots of other silly ghosts and the costumes are just awful. I feel like this film killed the terror that you get from the first film. When they go into the farther it just loses the plot. I would not recommend this movie at all.,5,0,0,24 February 2014
The Babadook," A perfect creepy horror
","As a big horror fan, I was looking forward to the babadook and it was a brilliant watch. It's basically a good old fashioned boogeyman story about a widow mum, who's left bringing up her needy little boy who has some behaviour issues. A book (mr babadook) appears and the mum reads it but soon realises the content is not for children as it tells the story of mr babadook who comes into your room at night and terrorizes you.. And that's what he does. Once she reads the book, mr babadook starts to appear. Pretty freaked out she burns the book but it comes back re written with an evil end about a mum killing her boy. There are many similar boogeyman / ghost movies but this one was different. It feels real with lots of tension. I won't give too much away but the ending is great, as mr babadook is real. The mum and child set a trap and kind of end up keeping him forever!The mum is fantastic at playing a drained widow and equally the little boy plays quite the brat, but you cannot help but feel sorry for them both. I would recommend this film and I watched it again a few weeks later.",9,3,5,22 March 2015
Cloverfield," Really enjoyable
","There's a lot of found footage and similar films out there but cloverfield has to be one of the better ones. The story is told through the camcorder of a young couple who attend a house party in New York and end up filming all of the action and horror as it unfolds. I liked the pace of the film, it got going very quickly and keeps you entertained. The last thing i was expecting to see was a big alien/ monster in the film. Most of the main characters do die and or get eaten etc. This movie reminded me of I am legend mixed with war of the worlds! Overall I liked it. The effects are good and realistic without being too over the top.",8,0,1,11 June 2016
Evil Dead," Close to the original story but way scarier
","The movie centres around Mia who is a drug addict, who's been taken to a cabin in the woods to get clean by her close friends and brother. Very quickly after they arrive a book is found (covered in dead skin and says do not open) that calls on a demon and Mia has a horrid experience in the woods.. And let's just say she is engulfed by the Forrest! She is very different and her whole personality changes and of course everyone puts it down to the drug withdrawal and ignore the signs that something is seriously wrong. The graphics and special effects are great especially if you have seen the original! When the demon takes over there is a total change is appearance and the make up is very real. The story is fast paced and eventually the demon gets a hold of all the characters leading to a scary bloody climax. Obviously there's a lot more in between. I like the realism of all the people. The movie wasn't over the top, it's quite simple but keeps you gripped. There's a great scene in the kitchen when one of the friends goes all evil and zombie, and cuts her own arm of with a turkey slicer! One armed zombie chick who won't die! It was frightening and you feel panicked for the characters who are trying there best to survive. I really loved the end, and I won't say anything to spoil it but it's good and Mia plays a great part. I would recommend this film as it's a good scare and enjoyable.",7,1,7,26 January 2015
30 Days of Night," Proper scary vampire flick
","I love this film. There are so many vampire movies out there but this one is in a league of its own. The film is about a small Alaskan town that goes dark for a month every year. This winter the most evil believable vampires attack the town and take out most of the population. The main characters are the sheriff Josh Hartmett and his kind of side kick leading woman Melissa George. Ultimately the vampires are there to kill everyone and suck the town dry. Most people get killed of pretty rapid and things are left to the sheriff and his closest friends to try and survive/ escape the vampires. In order to save the day the sheriff decided to make the ultimate sacrifice (himself). I won't ruin the end but its really good and different from all the other films in the respect that the heroin gets a pass to the final. These vampires are not pretend humans. They look and act ancient. They speak a forgotten language and do this awful howl when they are in a pack, and they are very fast. There are lots of great scenes in this film that had me almost holding my breath. Omg the fear is amazing the film is quite dark, and feels scary when your watching it and that's what a horror should do.",8,2,3,6 December 2014
