Sucker Punch," Glorious
","This is my favorite movie of all time and my favorite soundtrack of all time.Snyder is a wonderful teller of complex stories and this is no exception- it took me three watches to truly understand it, and each time I rewatch it I notice something new!Although some of the action scenes are too long for my taste, the emotions I felt throughout the movie (especially the beginning and ending) make up for it.I highly recommend watching the extended version over the theatrical version, there is one very fun scene as well as a very meaningful scene- why this gets a 10/10 from me.",10,4,6,3 January 2019
Hereditary," Great
","I found Hereditary to be suspenseful and highly disturbing rather than scary; it isn't a screamfest, but it doesn't have to be. The acting is also very brilliant and Toni Collette is a star.Note: I wouldn't recommend to very religious or superstitious friends, as this winds up being about a cult that worships a king of Hell.",8,0,2,5 January 2019
Sinister," I HATED It.
","Why did I give the movie I hate most in the world 10/10 stars? It scared me ****less.I saw the movie when it first came out and it is the scariest thing I've ever seen. I've watched TONS of horror movies spanning all decades and this is definitely the scariest. I only watched it once and images of it are still burned into my brain and give me nightmares. I literally talk about this movie and what it did to me with my therapist.Again, I am a horror fanatic- I love everything from the the original Texas Chainsaw to Scream to Saw to the Conjuring, but you couldn't pay me all the money in the world to watch it again!My eyes were screwed shut through most of the snuff film scenes but just the face of the demon alone was so scary to me!!!I ended up trying to watch *the trailer* for the sequel, but I was so traumatized by this one that I started crying and had to turn it off.Not for the faint of heart!",10,1,2,3 January 2019
