The Sound of Music," This movie never grows old
","I have seen the Sound of Music when I was a little girl, but every time I watch it again, I never cease to be charmed and forever entertained.  This is one of my favorite movies and its story never grows old for me.  Every time I see it, it's like I'm seeing it again for the first time!  I still laugh and cry with every heart-warming scene.",Null,0,5,20 July 2000
