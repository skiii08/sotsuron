The Blair Witch Project," very over-hyped, overrated. absolute s#!t
","Well the Blairwitch project. a lot of people have different views on this film, many believe this is the greatest horror film ever made. Fortunately i am not one of those people. this film is up their with the contenders of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I respect the fact that they tried summing new with a hand-held camera and to their credit it has not been used all that much in horror films during that time period. It tried being a horror film, however the film was a horror show rather than horror film. one of the main reasons i dislike this film is because its one big anti climax and the concluding part of the film is laughable.if you wanna watch a descent hand held film watch paranormal activity it much better and way more interesting than this. I dread to think what the Blairwitch 2 is like.",1,2,3,26 November 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A very good horror flick
",Sam Ramimi returns to what he does best. Horror. Its an amazing return to form from the director who brought us the pretty dire spider man 3. The film holds out very solidly and the old lady is not the nicest thing in the world believe me. the acting is very much excellent. The dark tone of the film bring the film to what it tries to achieve which is show the audience this is a dark horror movie from the person who brought us the amazing Evil Dead films.A couple of good jump scenes and scary images make this film a very good film that in many years will be considered a classic. I watched this film with my Fianc√©e and she was terrified of the old lady. so if theirs any male readers out here who wanna scare there loved one give this film a watch its highly recommended highly recommended.,8,0,0,12 February 2011
Rosemary's Baby," sorry to all you loyal fans out their
","This film is absolute dyer rubbish. i really did try to like this film i honestly did. But it was just plain awful I did all the stuff like watch it alone in the house with no lights on. i even watched a second time a week ago to see if i could like it but unfortunately i will never like this movie. I am an huge fan of horror films they are the only films i watch but i will never know how this film is considered a classic its absolutely a complete waste of time. This, The Shining and the Blairwitch Project are the most over rated films of all time. The only good thing about this film was Charles Grodrin and thats why it gets one star. if you want to watch a real horror movie that does try to be scary and succeeds watch the 1978 version of Halloween.",1,15,47,12 February 2011
Halloween," The greatest horror film anyone could ever wish to see
","Halloween is, was and shall ever be the greatest horror film ever made. From the genius of John Carpenter this is his industry calling card. i don't think anyone should disagree that this isn't a top quality horror film I've seen people below slate this film saying that Rosemary's baby and the blairwitch project is better. If people find them films scary then i don't know what going on with the world today. Anyway this film is the definition of perfect. a MUST SEE FOR ALL HORROR FANS. If people judge this film before they see it they should occupy their time counting how many hairs they have on their head (if any).The film has many great plus' the theme that these days is instantly recognisable. In my opinion the ultimate killer. And of course the legendary Donald pleasence and Jamie lee Curtis. its one of those films that you must see before you die so you can tell your kids about it.hope you all enjoy!!!!!",10,0,3,26 November 2010
