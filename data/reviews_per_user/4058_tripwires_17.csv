The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped and disappointing
","I thought this movie was going to be great. Unfortunately, the thing I stared at for an hour and a half or so was unthrilling, boring, and filled with stupid people whose vocabulary did not go beyond the word 'f**k', who spend the entire time screaming at each other, walking around aimlessly in some strange woods. Did I mention that they spent the entire time screaming VULGARITIES at each other? I don't have a problem with vulgarities; in fact, I use it a lot myself. But it really disheartens me to know that people today cannot find a more intelligent way to insult others and have to resort to swearing, simply because their vocabularly isn't wide enough.Not only is the 'Blair Witch Project' boring, it's pointless. 3 (or is it 4?) kids with a hand-held camera, walking around in some strange woods (did I mention that part?), doing nothing but yell at each other, scream at seemingly nothing, and basically annoying the life out of people who don't have time to waste of crap like this. I understand that the point of concealing the thing they were all screaming at is to let the viewer fill in their own blanks, but it got tiring after a while. Besides, the actors are so incoherent it's virtually impossible to hear what they were saying, or muttering, or whining about.Add its over-hypeness to the whole thing, and you get one hell of a stupid movie with a storyline that sounds pretty interesting, but fails to deliver.",Null,0,1,15 August 2001
Se7en," Oh, my god...
","(This review may contain spoilers)I'll just go right ahead and say this: Kevin Spacey is phenomenal. His portrayal of a serial killer is perhaps the best I've seen. He was only on screen towards the end of the film, but for me personally, he stole the movie. John Doe's eerily slow way of speaking (unless agitated) and his blank, vacant stare will more or less linger in the audience's minds for a while. I've not seen much of Spacey, only in this and 'L.A. Confidential', which got me interested in him, but John Doe has made me a fan. He is amazing, and easily surpasses the two leads, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.'Se7en' is definitely one of the most intense, disgusting and intriguing thriller I've seen for a long time. Unlike recent thrillers ('The Bone Collector' instantly springs to mind), it features a killer whose motive murder is believable and understandable, and not completely laughable like 'The Bone Collector'. He's a man who appears to be as ordinary as the next person, someone whom you wouldn't look at twice on the streets, but underneath that exterior lies a dark side. The film can be looked at an exploration of the darker side of the human mind (which is also what '8MM' did, and it should only make sense, as it is written by the same person), and John Doe is the right person to pick. Throughout history we have seen people like him, the most obvious being Jack the Ripper. For those who are interested, the character of John Doe is able to shed some light on the inner workings of some serial killers and their lines of thought. As twisted and sick as it may be, at least then one'd be able to understand.Morgan Freeman gave a good performance, but Brad Pitt annoyed me half the time. I liked him a whole lot better in '12 Monkeys' and 'Interview With the Vampire'. Gwyneth Paltrow...is not an actress I like. Hell, I'm being generous already calling her an actress. Since her character is crucial to the plot, I will just forget I've ever seen her in the movie.Andrew Kevin Smith is extremely creative, pure and simple. The victims of envy and wrath was just brilliant. I admire him a lot for being able to think of that; it was totally unexpected, and when John Doe utters 'become wrath', I felt this intense chill which can only be interpreted as admiration for the writer on my part. The setting, music, lighting, and basically the entire atmosphere of the film fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Some scenes in 'Se7en' made me sick to my stomach (rotting and talking corpses, anyone?), but in a movie that deals with a theme like that, those scenes become necessary.Definitely watch 'Se7en', if it's only to witness Spacey's brilliant performance. An amazing thriller.",Null,8,11,15 November 2001
The Others," The chills haven't stopped
","I'll admit straight out that I get scared easily. I couldn't sleep for months after watching 'The Sixth Sense', and I really want to watch 'The Exorcist', but I fear my heart wouldn't be able to take it. 'The Others' is one of those movies that I know would scare me senseless, that I should avoid if I want to sleep in peace, but the more I realise that, the more I want to see it. It's a funny thing, human nature, it's almost masochistic. I can never understand why I enjoy scaring myself so much.(spoilers) 'The Others' concludes on basically the same note as 'The Sixth Sense'. Like I said, the latter film scared me, but I found 'The Others' somewhat more chilling and thrilling. In 'The Sixth Sense' (a very good film too), I was scared by the images of the ghosts, like the woman in the kitchen. But in 'The Others', I was scared by the POSSIBILITY of what haunts the house. We don't get to see who's behind the mysterious closing and opening of doors and things like that until the very end, and it's a good thing, because it allows the viewer to exercise his/her imagination. The film doesn't show the audience its scares; it suggests them, and it's a lot more effective than creating a CG ghoul that floats about and have it boo at the audience every few minutes.I have another confession to make: I screamed out loud at possibly the scariest scene in the movie, during the climax. The last time I did that was during 'Scream 3', which wasn't scary, but everyone in the theatre was screaming, so I thought it would be fun to join in (it was). But here, I didn't scream for fun; tension was building up, and you're dying to see what's behind the closed doors (I wouldn't say what doors), and when you finally do, you see a sight that is so...grotesque that you can't help but scream. Needless to say, I got laughed at by my dad, but even he admitted that that scene sent chills down his spine.Throughout the whole movie I kept feeling goosebumps all over my body, and in fact, still do now, when I think back to the film. Its geographical and period setting, its small cast, its music, its cinematography, everything contributed to its creepiness. I was surprised to see that Kidman was actually good in this, after her unintentionally comical performance in Moulin Rouge!. She displayed a range of emotions and daringness that I did not expect. Very much like 'The Sixth Sense', the truth that was revealed was more tragic than scary (though it did scare me), and Kidman, along with the two kids, evoked a pity in me that almost made me forget how scared I was. That, I think, is a real accomplishment.The movie boosts some of the greatest props I've seen in a while. I absolutely hated the photographs of the dead. They're old and yellowed and the most important photograph made me want to hide behind my cushion. The film also doesn't have any special effects or elaborate CG images. It's all atmosphere and mood, and it works very, very well. This is a brilliant and subtle horror movie that is well worth watching.",9,0,0,27 December 2001
American Pie," Amusing
","Another plane movie. 'American Pie' was R(A) in Singapore (21 and over to enter). I was 14 when I saw this (I'm 15 now, and I'm sure that required so much Maths skills). With my mom beside me. She was, of course, mortified that I was laughing at some of the scenes, but oh well.
Okay. 'American Pie' is a funny movie, no doubt. I think it's rather hilarious, and um, Jason Biggs is funny, but if you ask me to describe the plot, I'm not sure if I can do that. Because 1) I can't remember half the movie and 2) there isn't a plot. 'American Pie' is just a comedy with lots of sex. That's all there is to it. It requires no thinking skills, or even any apprehending skills. Perfect in-flight movie, considering the other junk they showed (like oh, 'Sweet November'), and perfect cure for boredom. The funniest scene is the Jim (Jason Biggs' character, I'm not sure of his name) and the Pie scene; absolutely had me in fits. And Jim's dad is hilarious as well. Alyson Hanningan is SO irritating. Can she just stop doing the nerd roles, because quite honestly, I can't tell the difference between Alyson in 'American Pie' and Alyson in, say, 'Dead Man on Campus', or even 'Buffy'. Besides all of that, I cannot remember anything else.Definitely one of the better 'teen movies' (funny that it was rated R(A), as I don't consider people over 21 'teens'), but not one of the more memorable movies released that year, whatever year it was. Or maybe it's just me.",Null,0,0,4 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," THE best fantasy epic of all time
","I hate Star Wars. Granted, I have never seen any of the films, but seeing clips from it during various awards ceremonies and things like that tell me I never want to see any of them, the originals included. I'm also not a big fan of fantasy films, so it was pretty damn daring of me to make that statement in the summary box.The thing is, The Fellowship of the Ring just REEKS with brilliance. Every single second of the movie is astounding, from the first battlefield scene until the last few scenes. I don't need to watch any other fantasy flicks to know that this is the best. Now, I'm not a Tolkien reader. I bought 'FOTR' after watching the film and watching a National Geographic documentary on his life. I've owned the book for maybe 3 months now, and so far I'm still at page 94, thereabout. But I have seen the movie 3 times. And each time, it just got better. Peter Jackson deserves all the best director awards the industry could ever give for his beautiful masterpiece. How he managed not to get the Golden Globe for Best Director is beyond me. Actually, how anyone can think that this picture is anything but brilliant is beyond me. 3-hours too long? Hell no. 3-hours too short. I truly hope the Academy awards Mr. Jackson for his great eye for detail, and all-round awesome direction, and I sincerely think this movie is Best Picture material. The acting is also superb. I've always liked Elijah Wood, but I loved him in this. Not only are his eyes beautiful, he is able to speak volumes with them. I don't understand how the Academy and the rest have managed to overlook him for a Best Actor award. Orlando Bloom is devastatingly gorgeous as Legolas. He has captured the hearts of teenaged girls the whole world over, myself included. You can't blame us. Legolas is the perfect man you'd want by your side in times of danger. His movements are agile, like a cat's, and you couldn't tell in the movie that Bloom has taken only 2 (or was it 3?) months of archery classes. My only gripe about the character was that there wasn't much developement in the movie. I hope we'd get to see more of Legolas in the coming two movies, which I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Viggo Mortensen was dashingly handsome as Aragorn, Sir Ian McKellan radiated gentleness and his Best Supporting SAG award was well-deserved, and the hobbits were excellent. You simply cannot fault the acting, or any other aspects of this movie. I love everything about the film, from its breath-taking sceneries to the grotesque appearances of the orcs to Howard Shore's beautiful music. EVERYTHING! The only -- and I truly mean only -- negative thing I have to say about the trilogy is that they're making me wait an entire year for the next part. It's like feeding me a piece of delicious cake and taking the rest away, and then telling me, 'You'd get the next bite next year.' The cake is lovely, and I want to eat it whole, all at once. And to anyone who wonders why 'FOTR' is best picture material: it draws you in, it makes you care whether the characters lived or died, and it gets under your skin and refuses to leave until the whole movie is over. It stays in your mind when it's over, and you know you want to go back and relive every moment of that wonderful journey you were a part of. Three times.
All hail 'The Lord of the Rings'.",10,3,3,13 March 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I didn't get it
","(Possible spoilers ahead)Maybe there was nothing to 'get', but I didn't get it anyway. 'Revolutions' made close to no sense to me, partly because I forgot what 'Reloaded' was all about, and also partly because I was too busy laughing at the movie to attempt to follow the plot. Granted, the movie was better than I'd expected, but then again, I didn't expect much, if anything at all, in the first place. 'Reloaded' left me very, very cold and angry, and thus I thought 'Revolutions' wouldn't be much different. While the last installment is a lot better than the second, I still contend that this is a 'trilogy' that should've never be.First of all, I don't think there was even a plot to follow. Ask me for the story and I couldn't tell it to you. Thanks to its two sequels, 'The Matrix', to me, is merely a 'trilogy' of visually-spectacular effects, bad acting and a whole mess of pretentiousness that I would like to have done without, thank you very much. The first movie was fantastic, the second total nonsense, the third a continuation of 'total nonsense' and since I've already forgotten what 'total nonsense' is all about and wasn't keen on sitting through 'total nonsense' again, I was clueless about 'Revolutions''s plot right from the beginning.Still, any intelligent person would glean from the first few minutes that Neo is going to save the world. Or something. I didn't know what he was doing half the time, and frankly, Keanu Reeves is such a wonderful actor that he makes me NOT want to even ATTEMPT to care, sarcasm fully intended. There were a few intriguing scenes in the movie, especially the whole thing about the train, but the film-makers' solution to that problem, for lack of a better word, felt as though it was resolved too quickly. And thus, whatever interest it managed to arouse in me also quickly dissipated along with the dismissed idea that the annoying Oracle was going to lose her eyeballs (THAT would've been something!).(spoilers ahead)This movie also produced one of the most drawn-out, melodramatic and downright silly death scenes ever. Just how long did Trinity take to die, anyway? And I thought I'd seen enough of those in cheesy and horribly-dubbed Hong Kong flicks. I lost track of the number of times I started laughing, only to be silenced by annoyed members of the audience, but who could blame me? It was funny!One thing I did like about the movie: The battle scene in Zion or whatever. It was exciting, although awfully predictable (we all know that the commander or whoever was going to die. Like, duh). This time round, the effects didn't make me laugh as much as I did during the previous movie, and that part with the water droplets was breath-taking. That's about all the good things I can say about the movie. It was mildly entertaining, both intentionally and otherwise, but on the whole, it was also very silly. Keanu Reeves, in addition, is hardly a convincing superhero, so I was glad that he was left out in half the movie.And can I just add that I did not get the ending? I went to see this movie to know how it all ends but I ended up not knowing anyway.
Somehow, I'm not surprised at all.",5,0,0,17 November 2003
Save the Last Dance," Soooooooooooo MTV
","The moment MTV's logo appeared, I knew I was in trouble. I saw 'Save The Last Dance' on a plane, and I almost fell asleep. The only scenes I could tolerate were the dancing ones. The movie is like a 2-hour long music video that's played on MTV 24/7! Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas have absolutely no chemistry! I couldn't believe those two could fall in love. Almost all the actors seem to overact; I cannot think of anyone who seemed at ease with his/her role, except maybe that girl who played Derrek's sister. And Julia Stiles has got to be one of the more overrated actress. I can't tell the difference between Sara and her character in 'Down To You'.
'Save The Last Dance' tries so hard to be hip, it's sad. Every single line the actors are made to say just TOTALLY scream, 'HEY LOOK AT THEM! THEY'RE COOL! YOU SHOULD BE LIKE THAT TOO!' 'Save The Last Dance' takes itself way too seriously. And what a bad thing to do, considering there isn't even a bloody PLOT! I think it's great that it tries to address the racism issue, but I'm sorry, it failed terribly. Like someone else has said it has too many sub-plots and too many ideas to raise until it gets lost in them and the result? A huge waste of money on an unwatchable, predictable, boring mess. I guess this movie really isn't only for teens. I'm 14, and I hated it.",Null,2,4,18 June 2001
Meet the Fockers," Bland.
","Meet the Parents was good; I liked the De Niro/Stiller combination, and it made me laugh. Unfortunately, the sequel was boring. The only thing that saved it from the trash bin was the impeccable casting, ie. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The chemistry between the pair was very palpable and they were a joy to watch. Scenes between Hoffman and De Niro were rather entertaining too, and they induced a few laughs in me.Still, the movie's strategy of recycling tried-and-tested sex jokes ultimately failed it in my opinion. It got to a point where it became so predictable that it descended into the fiery depths of banality. Meet the Fockers is a great piece of evidence that illustrates the vast difference between American comedies and British comedies; just compare this to, say, Love Actually, and you'd get my point. Perhaps Meet the Fockers will score with people who don't really like to think, but its low-brow, un-intelligent brand of toilet and sexual humour is something I've seen so many times already that it failed to hold my interest for a significant period of time.In short, a waste of talent and money. The original is so much better.",3,1,2,25 January 2005
The Game," Edge-of-your-seat suspense
","'The Game' is, to say the least, very, very exciting, despite the...interesting ending that could work for or against it (it worked for me). Michael Douglas is excellent as a snobby rich man who got thrown into a real-life action game that messed up his life. Sean Penn - the reason I saw this movie - is absolutely BRILLIANT as Douglas's 'a little out there' brother. Too bad he had such little screentime. This movie is really very thrilling. When you think you know what's going on, something totally unpredictable happens and the mystery's back, all over again. Who cares if something like this would never happen in real life! It's a movie! Get over it and enjoy it!And I defy anyone who claims to have predicted the ending. Whether you liked it or not, it's undeniable that it's, well, unpredictable. Brilliant. Definitely worth sleeping late for.",9,0,1,4 September 2001
8 Mile," Painfully mediocre
","I didn't think that '8 Mile' was going to be great. Eminem doesn't impress me, and neither does his sad life story. In fact, I couldn't care less. I went to this movie because my mate likes Eminem and she dragged me into it. Fine. I did, however, expect to be entertained, since that's about all that Eminem does. Unfortunately, I spent the entire movie waiting for something to happen, but of course, nothing really did. The climax didn't feel like a climax (didn't even know it was a climax until the movie ended) and maybe it was the direction or the script, but I couldn't get into the movie at all. There wasn't a single moment in which I felt like I was part of the story; in the entire time, the movie remained a movie, and I remained very, very detached. Eminem's acting was surprisingly good. He has incredibly expressive eyes and he used it to his full advantage. Brittany Murphy was wasted, and I can't remember who else appeared but they obviously didn't make an impact. The rap scenes (yeah, whatever) didn't do much for me either. Sure, I don't like rap, but I did expect them to be more exciting than... that.
Like I said, I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. The script felt way too disjointed and disconnected. The only thing that I took away from the movie was that Eminem can kind of act.
In short, '8 Mile' is horribly overrated.",Null,0,1,17 November 2003
Titanic," I like 'Titanic'
","I like Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was excellent as Jack Dawson, and I think too that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work. 'Titanic' deserved to win Best Picture, and I really don't care what sort of flak I'd probably get for saying all that, but I like 'Titanic'. I was 12 when I saw it, and I remember clear as day being touched by it. It may be tacky, sappy, or just plain unbelievable, but 'Titanic' is one of the more memorable movies I've seen. It's basically mindless entertainment brought to life by a group of actors who can really act (DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, etc). It's mindless entertainment that tells a rather corny but moving tale of two people brought together and torn apart by fate, and it's mindless entertainment that just *happened* to make millions at the box office, and just *happened* to scoop Oscars left and right. What are you going to do about that?What I like about 'Titanic' is the simplicity of its plot (yes, it has one). I hate to reiterate, but a story about two different individuals falling in love while they're on the legendary Titanic doesn't get anymore complicated than that. Call me a sap if you must, but my attempts at swallowing the huge lump I had in my throat when the film concluded were futile; one cannot help but be touched by Jack's sacrifice for Rose. And it also helps that there's real chemistry between DiCaprio (who's a truly gifted actor) and Winslet, and again, you can't help but want them to be together. I usually stay away from romance films as a lot of them are crap and have retarded plots, but 'Titanic' is an exception. It's 3 hours long, and throughout those 3 hours, there's not a boring minute.Let me first declare that my admiration for DiCaprio has got nothing to do with looks. I have just recently became a huge fan of his, and if it's got to do with looks, shouldn't I be obsessed (for lack of a better word) with him 3 years ago? Having that said, despite what a lot of people think, DiCaprio is more than a teen idol or a pretty boy with no acting talent. Jack Dawson may not be an awfully hard character to play, but DiCaprio excelled in his role, like he always does. He's one of the most talented actors of his generation (others include Joaquin Phoenix), and his works before 'Titanic' should more or less prove that.Something to ponder about: If 'Titanic' was an independent movie with a budget of much less than what it had, would you hate it too?",9,2,3,7 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Overrated much?
","I don't read Harry Potter and never intend to. I wasn't even going to see the movie but my conniving and manipulative friend tricked me into seeing it (long story; you wouldn't want to hear it). Needless to say, I did not like the movie, although my 11-year-old brother loved it to death.First of all, let me state a few things. I do have an imagination. I grew up reading Roald Dahl and have seen 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' at least twice. I thought 'Alice in Wonderland' was really cool. I have also seen 'James and the Giant Peach', among many other adaptations of Roald Dahl's books, and I loved it. I'm looking forward to 'Lord of the Rings', even though I wouldn't read the books. As for the 'E.T.' thing: My mom recommended 'E.T.' to me when one fine night I was at a loss of what to rent at the rental shop. I was reluctant at first, as I thought it was just another kid movie, and I don't usually watch kid movies anymore. I wasn't expecting anything from it but boredom. When the film concluded though, I was in near-tears. In my opinion, by comparing 'Harry Potter' to such classics like 'E.T.' is a tad insulting to the said film. 'E.T.' was something fresh, even in the year 2001; 'Harry Potter' was just trite and recycled.'Harry Potter' struck me as a mix of 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Hercules' (you know, the TV show starring Kevin Sorbo?) and just about every other fairy tale you've heard. First, there were the cliches. Of COURSE Harry's a poor, abused boy who lives with wicked foster parents! He simply HAS to be, or there wouldn't be a reason why he's such a supposed expert with wizardry. The opening sequences with Harry's foster family totally reeked of the story of 'Cinderella' (sp?). The mean uncle in 'Potter' is the mean stepmother in 'Cinderella', and the obnoxious cousin in 'Potter' is the obnoxious stepsisters in 'Cinderella'. I really could've done without that whole sob-story designated to evoke pity in the audience; I have heard it before, and I have heard it told better.Another thing that made me squirm in my seat was its length. Unlike another equally hyped movie, 'Titanic', 30 minutes of 'Harry Potter' felt like an hour. When I saw 'Titanic' though, I was surprised to find that 3 hours had passed in the darkened theatre; it felt like an hour and a half. I didn't understand -- and still don't -- why they couldn't have just cut to the chase and dump Harry in the dungeon hole to face-off with the bad, evil guy. On second thoughts, I also don't understand why they took almost an hour in getting Harry's butt to his magical school, whatever it's called. It was a good one hour wasted, and if you add that hour to the time they took to unravel the very unexciting events that took place after that, like the Quiddich game or however you spell it, you get almost two hours. Two hours of oh-so-spectacular events that were mostly irrelevant to the actual finding of the socerer's stone. If you don't call that tediously slow-paced, then I'm not sure if we saw the same movie.The boy who played Harry was a terrible mis-cast. I can't imagine how he got the gig in the first place; he has got to be one of the most uninspired child actors I've seen. Even little Anna Paquin in 'Jane Eyre' (sp) shone in comparison to him, and I didn't think she was all that wonderful in it. His acting was flat, dry and at times, laughable (his portrayal of fear towards the end made me laugh out loud), and even more so when he appeared in scenes with Emma Watson (I think that's her name, she played Hermonie, however one spells it) and Draco, whom I deemed as little Count Dracula. I liked only a few things about the movie, and Draco was among them (another person I liked was Oliver Wood, simply because he's a cute Brit). Emma Watson did well, as did the boy who played Ron and Draco. Child actors are capable of doing their jobs right; it all depends on who we're talking about.The other thing I liked was its visual effects. I can hate the rest of it, but if I ever want to see it for a second time (probably due to permanent insanity), then it'd be for the effects. The school was pretty, and the floating spirits thingy inside was kind of cute, if not funny, though I don't know if that was the intention of the film-makers. The scene in the woods was also done pretty well; the entire look of the place gave the scene an almost creepy feeling. But it was destroyed when **spoiler** the half-human half-horse character (I forgot what you call them) came out to save Harry. I was just so reminded of the likes of 'Hercules' that I started laughing. Beside me, my friend went, 'What the hell?' In fact, she did it quite a lot throughout the whole picture.I would definitely not recommend it to anyone I love. But judging from the amount of positive comments on this site, I guess a lot of people are going to like it. One advice though: if you're sick of the whole Harry Potter hype, avoid this film like the plague, which was what I intended to do. Trust me, you wouldn't want to see it. It'll just make you want to set fire to its many merchandises even more.",1,7,16,6 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Shames the original
","'The Matrix' was a brilliant film that was almost prophetic of the future in its message to viewers around the world. I could draw parallels between it and Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel set in the near future, 'Brave New World.' In my book, a film that can be compared to a novel, a great novel, is a film worth watching. 'The Matrix', the original, was such a film.Unfortunately, 'Reloaded' isn't. Not even close. First of all, I don't see any elements in the first movie that actually garners it a sequel, one that isn't only unnecessary but also undermines the impact of the first movie. Second of all, 'Reloaded' was - gasp - painfully and utterly boring. I slept through the first half of the movie and was only kept awake during the second half because I decided to keep myself awake by chewing on a Mentos.
'Reloaded' was pointless and pretentious in its futile efforts to pass off as an intellectual action movie. Somebody should've told the film-makers that such a formula hardly ever works, and when it does the first time round, they should be counting their blessings and be happy with the state of pinkish health their bank accounts are in. While its predecessor managed to mix quality action sequences with thought-provoking philosophical truths, 'Reloaded' fell flat in that aspect. Its action scenes, for one, were too incredible, the special effects so overdone that they appeared fake. And the philosophy part? It was a noble attempt on the film-makers' part, I will admit, but unfortunately, whatever they were trying to convey got horribly lost in the mess of flying bodies and constant sprays of bullets that nobody could actually get what they were trying to put across in the end. One scene featuring some holy person spewing some philosophical gibberish that lasted for about fifteen minutes out of the two-hours-and-something-minutes of the film cannot possibly be powerful enough. After two hours' worth of an assault of the sense of sight which was also practically a lullaby for the brains, one simply cannot really bother to figure out what that man in the TV room was saying to Neo. Personally, I didn't even care.The plot was also a problem. The love angle between Trinity and Neo was redundant and boring, and the lack of chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Fisher didn't help matters much either. It was too overplayed and the time they spent kissing on screen could've been saved for bored members of the audience like me to do more productive things. The mass orgy/whatever scene at Zion was, too, an incredible waste of celluloid and screen time. It served no other purpose, it seemed, other than to please stereotypical male members of the audience. And the rest of the plot... wait, plot? What plot? I highly doubt a plot existed in the first place.In addition, Keanu Reeves becoming Superman only made me laugh out loud and his usual bland as plain water acting only added to the hilarity of it all. Reeves is a bad actor through and through, but he somehow managed to overcome that intriguing handicap in the first movie. Here, the lack of character development and his lack of anything else to do but fire guns, save Trinity from the evil clutches of the awesome Agent Smith, and fly like Superman, only made clearer his immense disability to say a few simple lines with that tricky thing called emotions. He expressed his love for Trinity, and I thought he was ordering a pizza or asking directions to the toilet. Reeves would be much better off without seemingly complex emotional scenes for him to handle, scenes that would other be handled with ease by a better, more profound actor.The rest of the main cast, fortunately, were okay, although they seemed to have got slightly more pretentious and annoying. Still, Agent Smith was the highlight of the movie (although that scene with hundreds of him was a huge joke to me), and the direct element that made me stay on and not walk out after I fell asleep for the 20th time. There is just something so compelling about the way Hugo Weaving snarls at Neo and morphs into people that it makes you rather excited to see the kind of havoc he'd be up to next. If there were to be a movie with Agent Smith as its protagonist, I'd definitely pay to see it. Keep Keanu Reeves out though. And while we're at that, keep the overall senselessness of 'Reloaded' out, too. A sorely disappointing sequel, even worse than what I'd originally expected. A shame to the first movie.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
Bring It On," A big waste of time
","I'm so glad I missed 'Bring It On' in the theatres. I saw it on a plane on my way to Australia, and it bored me so much I almost fell asleep. Yes, 'Bring It On' is not supposed to be a deep, dramatic movie, but come on! How more brainless can it get? The only good thing about this mess is that Sparky guy. Unfortunately he had too little screen time. Kirsten Dunst annoyed the living bejesus out of me; she over-shrieked, over-whined, and basically over-acted. Which is saying quite a lot since she didn't have much to work with in the first place. Like someone else has said this flick is very similar to 'Coyote Ugly'. See that instead, although I'm not a big fan. It actually has a *plot*.(PS. I'm 14 years young.)",2,3,6,13 June 2001
Final Destination," Silly and unintentionally hilarious
","When this movie was screened at a movie marathon held in my school I laughed out loud, garnering me a few weird stares from my fellow schoolmates, who were actually pretty terrified by the nonsense that was going on on-screen. I laughed for that reason too, but more importantly, I found this movie extremely hilarious.Perhaps it is my sadistic sense of humour, I don't know, but it's funny how the producers of this stupid, brainless 'horror' movie could think of such creative ways to kill off their irritating characters whom nobody really care about. A good example would be the death of the teacher, whatever her name is. That scene nearly killed me, pun fully intended, especially when she needed help to actually get herself totally killed.
'Final Destination' had a great premise. It just had an extremely lousy and predictable execution. What could've been a truly terrifying movie about the inevitability of death and the suffering one goes through living with that knowledge became a rehashed, one-dimensional joke of a movie that had elements of previously and equally bad slasher movies in it. Its greatest flaw was its cardboard cut-out characters. With the exception of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter, the cast looked like they were picked from unwanted extras who failed to make it to the latest teenage flick. The characters irritated the living bejesus out of me because they were whining so much that I just wanted them to get killed already and put me out of my agony of watching such stupidity. The jock was predictably cocky, his girlfriend predictably bitchy, and the rest of them? Don't even remember.The only good part about the movie is Devon Sawa and Ali Larter. Sawa is a good actor whose talent was wasted on playing a silly character, while Larter, whom I've never seen before prior to this, was surprisingly convincing as Clear Rivers ('Clear'? What kind of a name is CLEAR?!). She was pleasantly understated and provided a nice break from Alex's perpetual high-strungness, so to speak. The chemistry between them also helped to make the love angle that just HAD to be present a tad less sickening.
Still, it was obvious that this movie existed for no reason other than to rake in the cash at the box office, which should explain the extreme gore factor. Somebody should tell the producers that sometimes, the thing that scares most is not what one can see, but what one cannot see. Our imagination is a powerful tool. They should learn to make use of it.",Null,1,1,6 July 2003
Gladiator," Spectacular in every way
","I must admit, when I saw the trailer, I thought it was another crap period movie; I didn't like period dramas a lot back then. But after I became a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's, I watched it on a VCD, 5 months after it was released in the theatre. And I truly could not understand why the trailer turned me off so much. Besides Joaquin's brilliant and Oscar-robbed performance as Commodus, Gladiator has all the right ingredients of a spectacular epic, beginning with the opening battle scene. I firmly believe that it is filmed 'shaky' to convey the confusion and madness in a battle, and not because the guy behind the camera didn't know how to use one. Yes, it contains blood and gore and all that jazz, but do not forget it's a movie about gladiators. Gladiators back then did not sit around, drinking tea and eating sandwiches; they did almost exactly what was depicted in the fights scenes in the film. How else were the film-makers to portray the violence of gladiator fights than to include it in the movie?Another good thing about 'Gladiator' is that its villain is very much 3-dimensional. I am a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix, and I strongly believe he deserved that Best Supporting Actor Oscar no matter what people say. How often do you get a villain in an action movie who isn't portrayed as entirely bad? Phoenix played Commodus not as a mere villain, but as a spoiled child whose intense search for love drove him to commit deeds he'd later regret (as seen in one of the deleted scenes in the DVD). He gave Commodus a depth that isn't found in most action-movie villain (for example the bad guy in 'Kiss of the Dragon'), and drove the audience into grudging sympathy mixed with loathe. For that alone, he deserves the Oscar.Connie Nielson also deserved some sort of recognition for her underrated performance as Lucilla. She handled her role with great dignity and care; her confliction between her love for her brother that's slowly fading and her duty towards her country is very clearly put across, giving Lucilla the conviction that is certainly needed.Gladiator also has a magnificent score that is, again, Oscar-worthy. The music gives the picture the extra push that sends emotions into overdrive, particularly the **spoiler** Patricide scene, the opening battle scene and the very last scene. The special effects were ASTOUNDING! Just take a look at the Colosseum! Perhaps I'm over-sensitive, but I felt like I was being transported right back to that period.'Gladiator' is certainly meant to be seen on the big screen. Due to its second release, I had a chance to do just that. And what an experience. Contrary to what some has said, 'Gladiator' WILL be remembered some ten years from now, simply because it's an epic film about the Roman empire. And a spectacular one at that.",8,1,1,13 August 2001
Back to the Future," I enjoyed it a lot
","I think Michael J. Fox is really adorable, and I can watch 'Back to the Future' and its sequel (haven't seen 3) a million times back to back. I wouldn't take up too much space with my comment, just that 'Back to the Future' is very well-paced, well-acted, well-written and very interesting. In addition to all that, it's hilarious. Plainly put, it's the perfect popcorn movie for a boring Saturday night, and just about whenever one feels listless and wants to be entertained. I really liked Doc. He's like this weird fireball type who's really cute and eccentric in his own way, and Christopher Lloyd has wonderful chemistry with Michael J. Fox. And is it just me, or does he look just a little bit like Einstein...?",9,0,1,13 December 2001
