Mission: Impossible III," Terrible Movie
","This is hands down one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Huge major holes in the plot left and right if seeing Tom Cruise grinning like an idiot and pretending to be bad ass wasn't enough to get you to not see the movie. WARNING SPOILERS: They have you following Cruise around doing his usual almost formulaic stunts, chasing after some random terrorist that they completely made up. They then pull the typical plot line of a secret agent getting married, and all of the 'you shouldn't do that in this line of work' business. THEN in like 5 minutes of movie after Cruise gets married, the guy he is chasing after kidnaps his wife, and uses her as ransom to get cruise to get some item called 'the rabbits foot'. This 'rabbits foot' is the equivalent of some thermos with a biohazard symbol stamped on it. *COUGH*NONSENSE*COUGH*. If this wasn't enough, even at the END of the movie THEY NEVER TELL YOU WHAT THE RABBITS FOOT REALLY WAS!! They only tell you that some arms dealer was selling it for 800 million to someone, and that it is important enough for someone to have to blackmail Ethan into getting it. Also, they never tell you why the guy that blackmailed Ethan couldn't get the item himself...ALSO they make this big schpeal about how the rabbits foot is in this building guarded by all these people and somehow Ethan (Cruise) gets it inside of 2 minutes, and jumps out a window with it...they never even show the inside of the building the 'rabbits foot' is stored in the whole time Cruise is in there, trying to break it out. Your time is better spent watching paint dry than watching this movie. I want 2 hours of my life back.",1,1,2,20 May 2006
