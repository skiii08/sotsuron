Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Another QT gem
","It took me a couple days to figure out where Vol 2 would rate in the Tarantino universe. I'd rate Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and both Kill Bill's as 10's on this site but... I would consider Kill Bill Vol 1 about the same in quality to Reservoir Dogs, whereas Vol 2 is similar to Pulp Fiction. Since I think Reservoir Dogs is better than Pulp Fiction, I then also think Vol 1 is better than Vol 2. But it is just fun to split hairs like this, since all 4 are great.But Vol 2 is a splendid movie, completely different in style to Vol 1, but just as great. It was just one of those movies that I wished would never end. It is one of those few great movies where I didn't want each scene to end because it was so interesting and memorable.It's just fun to see a director at the top of his game, and it is amazing how a director can make 5 movies (well 4 if you count Kill Bill as 1 movie) and have 4 of them be instant classics.",9,0,1,18 April 2004
The Others," If you are interested in seeing this film, stop reading the reviews and watch it
","This is the best movie of 2001 in my opinion.It's a spooky film. I can't call it a horror film, though that's probably where it will be placed. It is just spooky. And that is the most refreshing and wonderful thing about this movie. I was always uneasy about what would happen next. I knew something was going on but couldn't figure out what it was.If you've read the reviews of this movie, you probably already know much more about it than you should. And that was to my benefit. I watched this cold. I hadn't heard much about it aside from the fact it was a scary movie with Nicole Kidman. I checked one place and it gave it a 4 star review, then I checked here and it was around 8.1. I specifically did not read another word about the movie. Glad I didn't.Very few films make me feel good to be a movie fan. Maybe a few every year are just excellent. This is one of those.",9,1,2,25 October 2001
X-Men," Decent start, lousy ending
","The movie started promising with attempts at character development of Wolverine, Magneto, and Rogue. I accepted the comic book-ishness of it as fun stuff. Then it just turned into another typical Hollywood action movie. It started to drag halfway through. Typical silly subplots occurred plus it was rather predictable.",3,4,7,27 December 2000
"I, Robot"," Good popcorn movie
","Entering this movie, I had pretty low expectations since most of the big summer blockbuster movies often are pretty weak efforts. Also, I felt like I had already seen the movie since I'd seen the trailers for this movie about 5000 times. So, I already felt like I knew the plot of the movie.But, I enjoyed it. It won't be on anybody's Top 10 list of best movies of the year, but it works for the exact reason alot of people go to see a movie. For two hours of entertainment. It was an enjoyable 2 hours.The movie isn't perfect and I'm sure people can comment upon the weaknesses of the movie. And there are some. But all in all, I was able to suspend disbelief in this movie and enjoy the movie.",7,0,0,22 July 2004
Before Sunset," Really liked it
","I really loved the first movie when i first saw it when it came out nearly 10 years ago. It was one of those movies that no one has ever seen or heard of, or at least seemingly. So, when I saw the poster and then the trailer for the sequel, I was excited. You don't get the chance to see sequels to movies like this very often.So, this was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year for me. I just saw a sneak preview of it yesterday and it works on exactly the same levels that the first one did. It is simply just these two people walking the streets of Paris (Before Sunrise was Vienna iirc) talking, talking about life, romance, people, love, relationships. The movie relies on acting and dialogue. Aside from the views of Paris, there isn't much more to it.And I loved it. It was a wonderful movie. And I love movies that rely on acting and dialog to make them work. I saw another Ethan Hawke movie recently, 'Tape' which follows the same principles. 'Death and the Maiden' was another one that I loved for the same reason. 'Glengarry Glen Ross' yet another.",9,0,0,2 July 2004
Mulholland Drive," Interesting
","This is an interesting movie. Without the first two hours, the last half hour makes no sense, and without the last half hour, the first two hours is rather bizarre. Seen as a film, putting the two parts together makes an interesting movie.But, the first two hours never drew me into the movie. I was never intrigued by the characters though it kept me interested enough to continue watching. Though in truth there are a few excellent scenes (such as in Silencio and the audition scene). Oddly enough, i remember thinking at one point the lead actress (Naomi Watts) was either a really BAD actress or a really GOOD one. Halfway through I figured she was quite bad... until I saw the rest of the movie in which it is obvious she is very good.",7,0,1,15 July 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino Returns!
","I was entranced with Tarantino the first time I saw 'Reservoir Dogs,' and that movie is one of my 5 or 10 favorite movies. Then 'Pulp Fiction' showed everyone else what kind of movie maker this guy is. 'Jackie Brown' was fine but nothing special.In 'True Romance' (which Tarantino scripted), the lead character praises a big movie guy about his movies being 'MOVIES'. And 'Kill Bill' is exactly that. It's a MOVIE.It's cool. It's style. It's kinetic. It's a great achievement of film of a movie maker at the top of his game.Very few movies actually reach a level of going beyond the 'typical' style of a movie. And that's what Tarantino can create. He creates a universe, a world where anything he puts up on screen works.This is easily the best movie of 2003.",10,0,0,10 October 2003
The Mummy Returns," Bad, Really Bad
",This was a bad movie. I thought 'The Haunting' and 'Wild Wild West' were bad but this was worse.It's another movie that just tries to make a movie with computer special effects without even trying to make any sense out of anything. This is a movie you must leave your brain at the door. Most of it is completely ridiculous and cliche filled.I wasn't expecting much but I thought I might be entertained for 2 hours. I thought the original did that for 2/3 of its length before turning ridiculous at the end. I'm not quite sure why I continued to watch this movie -- maybe its like looking at a car wreck on the side of the road.,1,3,6,25 October 2001
