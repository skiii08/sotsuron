The Mask," Unmasking the wasteful ideas from other movies.
","THE MASK was not very good. Jim Carrey tries too hard to be funny, and seems to be the perfect role model for a guy with the green face. Wasteful are the references from vintage Hollywood movies and cartoons. Remember the old M.G.M. cartoon about a wolf who falls for a bombshell singing 'Oh, Wolfie'? That's among the plentiful you'll discover here. I also remember how this film was marketed. Why would THE MASK attract very young audiences with its killer display of tornado animations when it has enough violence to keep 'em away? This is definitely no ROGER RABBIT, and not what you're expecting!",4,2,18,28 January 1999
Antz," There's more that meets the eye, but Disney it isn't.
","What a terrible long wait this has been following TOY STORY! Even with more than three years worth, I was truly astonished by a few mixed emotions in observing this jewel of 'family' funfare. In a world where rich colorful 3-D animation surrounds the imagination, ANTZ is marvelous at this surrealistic reality. This may be the next step in animated movies. Nevertheless, the water bubble and the boy's gum-shoe are two reasons to go see this. The celebrity voices including Woody Allen and Sharon Stone add the sparkles, giving this the splendor of Hollywood magic. Unfortunately, young kids may not take ANTZ too seriously, and with the unexpected mild language and violence, they're better off watching TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE for some light-hearted fun. Your kids will be bored and sleepy-headed because this aims at a much older crowd, which took me by surprise. The brilliant wonder of computer animation should be attractive fun for virtually everyone, and until we notice the movie feeling so casual and hard-heavy, it's too far away from being a 'G'-rated show. It's not what it should be, and it lacks the magically spirited punch of Disney, but ANTZ is fine testimony in transforming hand-drawn art to polygons. The competition between this one and A BUG'S LIFE is going to be very stiff. Expect Disney / Pixar to win the title, or at least they have already. That film I'll comment on later.",6,0,3,14 February 1999
Mulan," Just one of hundreds of reasons to watch a Disney movie.
","It'll be hard not to recommend any movie from the folks at Disney, be it a vintage classic or cartoon minus the recent stinkers. MULAN shows what the Mickey Mouse cartoonists can do with a setting where samurai warriors and concubines rule. It's been practical as always to show off familiar renderings of hand drawn art just as with past animated films, and can remain timeless in years to come. As long as stylish techniques apply the basics (like THE PRINCE OF EGYPT), the flat 2-D cartoon film will stick around longer. Even more, you can notice the 3-D effects that stand out as realistic. How many warriors on galloping horseback can you spot? With this being mentioned, it isn't stunning anymore once you saw THE LION KING for the first time. That one was incredible in detail. The story of our young mistress becoming a bold fighter in disguise to bring back peace and family honor is astounding for a Disney creation, and sounds like a step above previous summer efforts. Still, it's another kid's tale filled with the usual instances of comedy relief and sing-along songs that remain a pure delight by Disney's trademark standards, but remember that grown-ups will appreciate the entertainment too. You can't beat the Magic Kingdom for delivering wholesome quality 'family' fare. MULAN is another excuse to be satisfied with Disney's tradition of excellence. The world can be a better place to live, if you just feed the kids a huge Disney video collection. But that's good, right?",7,0,0,24 February 1999
Wayne's World," A movie so tiring of jokes and one-liners isn't worthy!
","Mike Myers, with his comically canny dialogue and one-liners, fares much worse from WAYNE'S WORLD in my book. NOT! (he does, really) I would only recommend this for those who grew up watching the skits on S.N.L. a long time ago. View this all the way through for the first time, and you'll laugh, and you'll cry, and you'll hurl (as the tagline suggests). The funny jokes and gags are too weird enough to make you learn the entire script. Other than trying to understand Cantonese, 'babe' Tia Carrere performs some rock tunes down to her lungs for your 'excellent' pleasure. After that, it quickly becomes stale, and soon you'll forget it until another ten years pass by when you want to relive those precious memories. To me, this has never been my kind of movie to take seriously because it's downright obnoxious. For the benefit of some who have not had the chance to see it during high school, better give it a swing...er, I mean SCHWING! It'll be great fun. Take my word and repeat after me: 'It's NOT WORTHY....NOT WORTHY....NOT WORTHY!!!'",5,2,7,14 March 1999
Happy Gilmore," HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HO HUM!!!!
","The best you can do is laugh out loud and see this only once. Any comic like Adam Sandler will impress and entertain you with stupid jokes and one-liners, and that's what flatulent comedy is. It's something that we take for granted to escape the dark realities of the world in which we live, but that's also the problem when you have thousands of other motion picture comedies and sitcoms that duplicate each other. What difference does a TV & film star make in pulling off a success story? Take a good hard look at HAPPY GILMORE and you can see why somebody stole the ingredients from CADDYSHACK in making another lame 90s comedy film. It sets no revolutionary boundaries to make it a worthwhile pleasure. The one thing that saves this from being any worse is the scene with Bob Barker in it. I guess Hollywood will never learn!",5,0,6,11 November 1998
The Fifth Element," Science fiction worthy of imagination that gets too silly.
","Showing you how fun saving the world can be is judged by having a chance to see THE FIFTH ELEMENT. It's a wild fantasy ride 300 years into the future that makes this one enjoyably satisfying, but the imagination gets clearly overstated by making itself too obnoxious. Of course, the visuals are as good as any recent sci-fi outing and there is some appropriate meaning about a female life-form while staying alive to prevent the end of the world from coming. The big beef is that its futuristic setting gets over-exaggerated for its strange behavior. Part of this factor is Chris Tucker, who is downright annoying as a radio freak on hyperwarp. I like how science fiction is vigorously refined for the 90s and beyond. I wish the film crews and directors would find better alternatives in not forging over the top on excess junk material. Pray that STAR WARS - EPISODE ONE doesn't fall into the sleaze trap where STARSHIP TROOPERS and this film landed in.Sony, your formula is greatly showing. Keep it up, or we'll run your godd--n studio like a bunch of professionally trained business execs who want to discuss a corporate takeover!",6,0,1,10 January 1999
Spice World," The spice is right. The movie is wrong.
","Please, whatever you do, count me out as a Spice Girls fan! You've probably had the chance to read at least 100 of my commentaries on all kinds of movies on this site, so what difference does SPICE WORLD make as long as a forgettably single viewing is just fine. I won't say that is a pretty lousy timekiller. It just isn't worth the appeal, even with five singing Barbie dolls who can dress. The movie is a lot of kidding around, but it actually has its heart in the right place in satirizing movie references and showing off its 'Girl Power'. There! You've got the formula, but you've got it all worn thin after (yup!) one single viewing, not 700!But wait! A star-studded cast isn't complete without the delightful likes of Posh, Baby, Sporty, Scary, and Ginger (one of which is gone in reality), and they're getting an extra fifteen minutes of fame selling movie tickets. We'll see in the near future if they can start taking advantage of their acting more seriously. Paul, Ringo, John, and George can do MUCH better! Not only does this rip off The Beatles, but it wasn't even intended to! As you easily know, this movie was put out within a year following the Spice Girls' rapid rise to fame and fortune, and so you have here a rush job in the making. It all goes to show why promoting big name franchises pays off in these high-tech days, without a whole lot of 'movie' to back it up (Are you paying attention, Sony?).Sooner or later, you're gonna find SPICE WORLD sitting right next to those New Kids On The Block tapes in the thrift stores, and even the GARBAGE PAIL KIDS MOVIE on the dusty shelves of hidden stockrooms. I must call upon any current Spice Girls fan who loved this movie to hang on to what you got. Just like The Beatles proved, the next thirty years will compare to a glass of wine. History is sweet, right? For me and other anti-fans of Top 40 pop music, this movie simply doesn't cut it.",4,1,3,6 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The most revealing chapter of STAR WARS, if the least.
","The saga continues, and our brave cast of rebellious fighters has got older! No offense please! In the three years apart, something new has to come along. Once again, their performances are true to the series in itself, with RETURN OF THE JEDI as the final (and I do mean FINAL) episode in the STAR WARS legend. Either more or less, it's still heavily balanced on plot and is backed by George Lucas' technical and imaginable wizardry. If you STILL haven't seen the previous two in chronological order, then you're suddenly lost without the Force! Then, a giant pack of Ewoks will come out running after you!If there had to be one litle thing I would disgress on the trilogy, it's the cute-and-cuddliness of this third installment. Almost everywhere is a big puppet, and that's saying much for the children who has endlessly loved the STAR WARS phenomenon. Ewoks included, the puppets and heavy costumes were the most creative and lively characters ever since the first film (not counting C-3PO and R2-D2). It feels like you're watching a Jim Henson masterpiece, though. The disadvantage is that it loses much of its epic splendor that was present in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, but it is gracefully made up by the greatest climactic conflict between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This IS worth seeing the whole 6-7 hour saga in the anticipation of a captivating and powerful premise. You've got to see the first STAR WARS...first!We go to the movies to see special effects, and there has been much more done. Without them, there would be no signs of real life! Just remember to hang on tight for the 'air ski' sequence which was amazingly well done at showcasing a little speed for the ultimate thrills. The Special Edition gives us an ending that must be believed. It was a desperate need in front of the unsentimental one the original version had. Long live Lucas!No matter what striking events there may be, the best recommendation lies upon the original STAR WARS TRILOGY (1977-83).",8,0,1,10 May 1999
Full Metal Jacket," Compelling war drama takes time, but it entertains.
","'ACCLAIMED BY CRITICS AROUND THE WORLD AS THE BEST WAR MOVIE EVER MADE!' Sez who? Wherever you turn to, there's bound to be a different opinion from anybody who sees and tells all there is to FULL METAL JACKET. What begins as a vulgar training exercise becomes a battling bloodbath at the end. It provides a very tight example of being prepared to live or die in wartime. Slowly, the movie builds up to the point of fair interest when the Marines fight at Vietnam, an element of Stanley Kubrick's unique presentation. The story is compelling and provocative from the start, outweighing the further drawbacks. I would almost have to give the entertainment value a strong '10', though, if only it weren't for the last few minutes, which was a letdown, although it gave us a clear mystery about what may be predicted to happen next. For this to be the greatest war movie around, it needs PLENTY of hell-raising, heart-gripping war action to create a higher excitement level, and despite some bloody casualties, there should have been more of it badly. It actually will have viewers wondering why our drill sergeant shoved the hell out of young recruits (including 'Pyle') preparing for the worst time of their lives. That part is really the best thing about the film. Still, it's a fine war story with a style of Kubrick's own. I can't say it's the best one ever made, but it holds its own ground.",7,0,0,20 January 1999
Forrest Gump," Hands down, one of the finest works of American cinema.
","Call me CRAZY! I usually get to view tons of good cheap movies in my lifetime, but that's not always what I see. Every once in a while, I'll also see a film the the entire American public has enjoyed and disliked through the years gone by. Among those is FORREST GUMP, which proved Tom Hanks as an acclaimed dramatic actor. The tale of a young man living through the life and times is among the many landmarks existing in cinema today. No one understood that the nostalgic visuals and props (plus the legless Gary Sinise) were actually real and not copied or duplicated, meaning an Oscar winner. It is both funny, serious, and heartbreaking for one entire movie, but it isn't labeled as a 'comedy' like many have called it. The film greatly shows Hanks maturity after his comical heydays, and it continues on. It also shows the way past generations of time are reborn in this present, but disillusioned era. FORREST GUMP is a bona fide genuine classic that will stick around in future generations to come. I ADMIT IT!",9,1,4,24 October 1998
Top Secret!," You know what to expect from those Zucker boys!
","It's the clever, comical writing that makes the Zucker Bros. films worth watching, and although watered down a tad bit, TOP SECRET! still carries the fine tradition. Noteworthy are Val Kilmer's singing acts and the looney German National Anthem. The last 20 minutes delivered the fun-filled goodies, as the most of the movie had little that was original and slapstick compared to AIRPLANE!, which remains my valid choice. Good thing it was void of any strong profanity, although there had to be something here that would make any comedy a bit trashed. But I can't stand that 'Tutti Frutti' much longer!",6,2,4,10 March 1999
Face_Off," The film's title says it all!
","FACE/OFF isn't really your same old action guy film, but it's original in terms of John Woo's style of directing. This is the first movie I've seen from the guy who gave us HARD-BOILED, and obviously, Hollywood needs him more than B.B.B.B. (Big Budget Block Busters, to be exact). What I have learned is that his films have a distinctive trademark: the guy holding two guns at one time. The question of the hour is: will it appeal to everybody? Pretty much to say, yes, thanks to the familiar 'faces' of John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, who swap skins in beating the living hell out of each other. Some more face-to-face action would've been appreciated for this ultra-lengthy feature that has you wondering when it's going to be over, but both are truly incredible in the well-crafted action bits given. I felt Cage fared better overall, but Travolta, still showing off his grinny expression, proves that a Hollywood comeback requires a much needed and much stronger level of momentum. There's so much here that it has you shrouded in mystery about what's going to happen later on, and who will win at the end? FACE/OFF is unusually strange in its storyline, so maybe a few more viewings would help gain some better understanding (please, I've seen enough of 140 minutes already!). Comedianne Margaret Cho is an unexpected surprise here, trading her stand-up comedy routines for dramatic roles. John Woo could be a driving force behind Hollywood action / intrigue movies in the coming years, and is he making anymore lately? Let's hope so!",7,0,0,8 January 1999
American History X," Painstakingly important film provides a shattering look at violence and hatred.
","It was very easy to realize in the beginning that I, too, would've found AMERICAN HISTORY X a minor coincidence in the making. Well, I was wrong. Again! Even with the influential direction of Tony Kaye and solid acting of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, the movie still could have squeezed more juice. It could have been simply more or less. More on its details and less of the slow pace, to be exact. You won't keep anybody down for not liking this picture because of its explicit nature. This one took the more provocative route, and it suddenly runs as smooth as premium unleaded gasoline. The disturbing racial hatred that has changed America's societal infrastructure forever is how this picture is portrayed. With its correct state of mind, the movie is nonetheless disturbing as well as horrifyingly true, and shows itself on a very high pinpoint of accuracy. It walks a large step further in giving out a dramatic study of what can actually be a truthful account of the life of a racial hate crime syndicate, and how the lives of two adjusting individuals are shared. The violence is what makes this movie fully express the way society is being mistreated. Certainly speaking, it does go off the deep end and is not for the faint of heart, so that's all there is to know. One nice touch is the use of photography and its expression of colors, which is a good move for having the story tell itself with proper understanding. I really wanted more out of AMERICAN HISTORY X, but it's got rock-solid potential to keep its open-mindedness with a variety of moments.",7,0,0,21 April 1999
The Commitments," Excellent story about the rise and fall of Irish 'saviors of soul'.
","Alan Parker's brilliant directing effort on THE COMMITMENTS really shines. More than an entertaining spectacle, it has a whole lot of influence on the soul music circuit. Shots of Dublin city life are nicely photographed. The musical acts are extremely well talented and well done, if only the occasional dialogue breaks didn't interrupt the awesome sound. There could've been some more new tunes instead of old ones, but it's amazing to discover the fictional band's lead singer pull them off out of his lungs. Phenomenal! At least you can try to find the soundtrack album. One thing stands out the best: the casting. We need more of today's movies to do the same thing: to provide creative acting talents. The musical genre of modern Hollywood needed something like this to keep it afloat. Highly recommended!",8,36,44,2 February 1999
Amadeus," Classy musical account of Mozart makes a remarkable stage play.
","AMADEUS lives up to its wholesome beauty by paying tribute to classic musicals that are all but gone. Milos Foreman must have survived this massive undertaking in earning another batch of golden Oscars. The sound of classical music is rich and lively enough to consider this true to art. Seriously, folks, it does come up a wee short from being an authentic masterpiece, but it does translate as a satisfying and amusing stage play filled with lavish sets and costumes. It's only the movies, really.Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide described this as 'fatally overlong'. If you're casual enough to belong in the martini crowd or just like going out to see operas, then chances are your time is going to be spent perfectly well. And yes, even the entire family will like this one, despite getting a little crude on occasion. Unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (that one was great, but it just seemed too long), it is fully satisfying and the talented stage performances make this one to appreciate. We should also examine Mozart's life and love of music, which bodes strongly for a lengthy picture. The film's total magic is in the directing talents of Milos Foreman.AMADEUS is a wondrous spectacle of harmony and ambition from centuries ago, and like I said before, it isn't an all-out cinematic masterpiece. While not for those who lack interest in classical music, it is a hungry feast for some. Hey, I may not be a fan of public television, so why waste some pledge money when this movie sticks to your mind in years to come.",8,3,7,21 March 1999
Ghostbusters," Comedy that remains timeless.
","What childhood memories I had with GHOSTBUSTERS! The first time I had watched was at the R/C theater when I was almost nine. Nothing had ever prepared me to get thrilled with excitement over the Stay-Puft guy roaming around until he's marshmallowy goo! The perfect casting of Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and others, plus visual imagery and an original idea made this one a winner for its day. Only the sequel wasn't as solid, though. I felt the hand crawling from the chair that Sigourney Weaver sat on WAS scary! This remains to be a true 80s comedy classic in my book, not like the disappointing MEN IN BLACK, which was awfully hyped on visuals and Will Smith than absolute fun. Take a dare at searching through the reference books on Saturday morning programs, because this was, by accident, named after a '75 Filmation live-action series titled THE GHOST BUSTERS, which became a cartoon series in '86 as a 'rip-off' of the movie, and which also had a cartoon series of its own! Don't believe it? It's true!",8,0,0,17 January 1999
The Last Emperor," An Oriental paradise that is wonderfully mastered to the screen.
","I guess I'm the only one who watched this from a worn out-of-print VHS copy. No matter what the quality, THE LAST EMPEROR is arguably among the best of the foreign pictures. The sights and sounds of The Forbidden City are sharp and beautifully screened right on with the provocative events that unfold the coming-of-age life of Pu Yi. It has plentiful moments including his romantic affairs with concubines and how he learns the way of the world as a child. His chronicle of a young emperor boy paints a colorful picture for the first half, only leading to more conflicting matters later, which is the most exciting part. Don't expect to see heads getting chopped off, like I thought would happen (unless you have the longer DVD version), but the intensity of the talk surrounding it sounds horrifying and true. Nevertheless, the dialogue is clearly mystical. Every minute is a feel-good breeze through crafty cinematic art, but it ends too fast, and the narration from Pu Yi in his prison term could use a lot more detailing. Maybe I'll stick around longer and wait to see the Director's Cut which has more. Definitely a winning treat not to be missed for foreign movie lovers and collectors of premium filmfare.",8,29,34,21 March 1999
A Bug's Life," Disney's visual feast scratches the surface!
","Let's remember this analogy for a moment and see if this makes sense: TOY STORY (1995) is to three-dimensional polygons as SNOW WHITE (1937) is to two-dimensional hand-drawn art. We have here two little movies that set all-new standards in cartoon animation. Now, I'm finally glad that Disney and Pixar waited three years by not leaking out their secrets kept behind locked doors, and A BUG'S LIFE is ultimately worth the impatience. This is the best looking 3-D showcase I've seen so far, even surpassing ANTZ, and has applied the same technical formula that TOY STORY gave to us. Of course, there are going to be more and better 3-D movies coming our way, but we're already tasting the future right now.It will be interesting to point out the comparisons between A BUG'S LIFE and ANTZ, both that has tiny little ants that appear large when seen off a projection television. ANTZ was a tried-and-true effort by newcomer Dream Works SKG; it just wasn't satisfying enough to hold its appeal to everyone, not even the children. It was also a little too slow in its animation, and was keen enough to make a Hollywoodian image for itself. Or even 'Woodian', as in Woody Allen. It needed a lot more bite than it could chew, but that's ANTZ.Here, in A BUG'S LIFE, 'family' entertainment is a whole definition not just for its intelligent sense of humor, but in the way Pixar established a whole new environment for animators to take better advantage of handling three-dimensional objects and landscapes. You want a lifelike cartoon to become a surrealistic universe that's far beyond our imagination. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo would be wandering around reflections of the sun and getting lost in the dark shadows. It's amazing how fast and slick this movie goes on its motions of ants running and birds flying even with colors that appear and shine as a glossy liquid. Whatever more there is to the tantalizing visual quality, it's something we all are going to look forward to the next few years, and it could threaten to dethrone the traditional cartoon as we know it. Tempting but frightening words, aren't they?The visuals aren't the only best things about it, but you can't knock down Disney for its timeless heritage of magical fun-filled wizardry. Let's face it, the movie looks so good enough to burst a chuckle or two. Or, if you handle it, say 99! Just as appealing to grown-ups as it is to children, the comedy relief bodes extremely well for an animated movie running on ultra-high speed microchips. It makes a new statement for the term 'ladybug', which is sure to fool many! This is the finest example of creativity and delightfulness in a 'family' picture sitting next to the original BABE. Sure, we can handle the modernization of its jokes any time!There is just one quibble though: the celebrities give this the all-too familiar voice of Hollywood. I wish there were more talented voice acts to liven up this brilliant looking movie a la creme rather than hiring overpaid TV stars and film actors. Oh well, at least they contributed to the characters with all their diligence.For those sitting in the front row near the boxing ring watching the fight and have kept track of the action, you'll see why A BUG'S LIFE wins over ANTZ by a stunning knockout in the first round, and so does Disney. I hate to question about Dream Works' further potential, but the studio sure has a long, long way to go before managing itself as a triumphant pioneer in 'family' entertainment. It may not become the next 'Disney' than we'd least anticipate.And for a while, you'd believe I'd give this one the undisputed title as 'The Greatest Motion Picture Ever Made'! Not exactly! But what a fine 'family' movie this is! (Are you at all convinced that a bold summary like that would be the perfect fashion statement for presenting user comments? Like in TITANIC?)",8,1,2,22 April 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's groundbreaking sci-fi film remains a classic milestone for the future.
","Let us remember Stanley Kubrick as a genius of provocative filmmaking, and also a prophet of events that came and went. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has survived the test of advanced time. Not just in eye candy, but the imagination of living in an artificial world where new forms of communication are evitable. This is science fiction a step forward in fantasy that becomes reality. In this case, things already have...Don't thrash the movie's opening sequence. Try to picture your mind the living standards man would use later. With a few primates hanging around the barren land of Earth, there is a point of significance about the future of civilization. 'The Dawn Of Man' instantly becomes 'The Dawn Of Computer'. The primates' ways of intelligence is applied for the next challenge in an artificially run setting like the year 2001. Smart thinking from Kubrick!As I've said numerous times before, visuals do not always make the movies, but this is an exception when you had a movie that revolutionized special effects. For 1968, expect the impossible. If you have remembered seeing this in the theater, it's because you had terrible seizures from looking at the most vibrant graphics and pyrotechnics ever mastered on film. No object is ever tacked onto the print (like the Starship Enterprise), and they look like glimpses of future sci-fi hits including STAR WARS. But if you have developed severe hemorrhoids after the film was over, it was because of the knockout 'hyperwarp' scene. Its amazing display of dazzling colors and quick speed still rivals against the eye-heavy, eye-demanding visuals of today's movies. Give this one another thirty years to prove itself worthy as time and technology progresses. Truly incredible!Like I mentioned, Stanley Kubrick acts as a prophet by using ideas that soon become reality or has already happened. The supercomputer HAL-9000 is a perfect example, which lead to modern operative machines and devices running on simple chips and bits of hardware. And did this movie predict a form of network communication like the Internet? Computer malfunctions? Artificial intelligence? If time had only told us, the answer is strictly 'yes'. But let's continue to believe that this is a science fiction movie without inducing panic.There may be thousands of other possibilities to discover from this masterpiece. We've learned an awful lot out of this one, though. I don't mean to say it 'is' the greatest thing ever created (and no, TITANIC 'is' not the greatest, either), but if we can dig deep into Kubrick's finest talents of a genuine Hollywood classic, we'll know that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can easily withstand all of the mediocrity that will continue to play in the high-tech multiplexes.A perfect '9' winner from you know who!",9,4,11,20 March 1999
Men in Black," Like other mid-late 90s movies, this one is hard to please.
","Of all the big movies released in the uncertain 1990s, FORREST GUMP, JURASSIC PARK, TOY STORY, and CLUELESS (no joke!) set all-time high water marks in innovation and creativity that equals up to timelessness. Not so with MEN IN BLACK! The costume designs and attitudes of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was what made it original, making this a franchise worth a hot sell, but that's the whole problem! This was Sony's finest hour back in the summer of 1997 after striving through miserable flops at the box office, only to have stumbled again with the high-tech remake of GODZILLA combined with more than $50 million of promotional advertising. Nobody wins in a game of risk when a product lacks the expectations we take for granted! It's a crying shame that Will 'Fresh Prince' Smith's oddball acting performance kept INDEPENDENCE DAY from being a true bona fide science fiction classic, so you know what to expect from him in this movie. I'll wish him good luck on his successful music recording career. The visuals look duplicated as with other recent efforts on a budget of $70 million and the action is mighty scarce. Why in the hell does Hollywood have to blow excess dough on special effects? Just so that the audience can say 'WOW!' or 'IT LOOKS GOOD!' and keep coming back to the movie theater? The answer is a simple NO!! Even if MEN IN BLACK has the wow factor and looks good, it has no redeeming quality! Despite the luxury it has, the typically stupid jokes and puns contained here means it's branded as a 'comedy', a very mainstream but tiring Hollywood genre with virtually no taste. Expect the usual things come the sequel. The future outlook is going to be terribly bleak for the big studios due to the fact that big budget movies will have all show and no go, combined with huge marketing campaigns worth millions. Sony isn't the only one in the red, though. Warner needs to focus more on how not to make a flop instead of endless campaigning over BATMAN movies!",5,4,8,6 November 1998
Chariots of Fire," Award-winning film is very craftworthy, yet glitched.
","CHARIOTS OF FIRE has everything its got to be a true film classic...except for 'The Award-Winning Mistake'. A truly dramatic chronicle of the running sport, it has unbelievable craftsmanship in its masterful screenplay about competing athletes, and shows us how the mind and soul can possess a willful spirit of hoping for the best, making a winning statement for itself. Holding up exceptionally well in the test of time is the visuals that recreate 1924, much like rivaling TITANIC eighteen years later. Vangelis' electronic music score has been sensational, including the breathtaking theme music that still gets played on some easy listening stations. Put these pieces together and you have a fine work of cinematic art for all the future generations to see. And now, I present to you 'The Award-Winning Mistake'! A black boom mic shows in front of two kissy-pies who are about to say goodbye, and we have news reporters who carry paper and pencils, but no high-tech microphones (see, they didn't even exist in the 20s!). There should have been further examinations of this scene by the A.M.P.A.S. judges before giving this a 1981 Best Picture Oscar. Without any other doubts, this is a disgusting piece of matter that makes a fine film look bad! Minus one point, there! It's still a captivating masterpiece to behold, and you wouldn't mind the visibly minor glitch that can never make a difference to the whole program.",7,1,3,20 March 1999
There's Something About Mary," There's much to like in this wishful, yet crude comedy.
","There's something to like about THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. A nicely rounded satire about guys telling all about the girl they love proves that such desiring moments are hilarious in a sophisticated way. If only wishes do exist in becoming true. Cameron Diaz may not be doing so much at first, but there's reason to find her likeable as a young woman who becomes attracted by guys who want to dig her. This has to be the best performance for Diaz so far, yet a no-show at the Oscars. A name to watch for in future Hollywood releases. This is also a truly unique style of modern-day comedy. It's real cool to have the story told through some brief singing numbers, making this much more special. Unintentionally funny bits are sweet and nifty. In a nutshell, it's fun-filled all the way through, but the 'R' rating is what bothered me the most. You might have heard rumors about Fox putting the movie out on video as a watered down 'PG' release. That should have been a smart idea, and while the crudeness can be laughable on occasion, it takes some of the advantage away in willing to be a truly heartfelt satire. Still, this is one of the better modern comedies I've seen, and one to show to your buddy who has strong temptation over pretty gals.",7,0,0,10 February 1999
Total Recall," Verhoeven's 'sci-fi' thriller does not recall the total hype.
","I'm sorry, but TOTAL RECALL is another in a series of endless 'survival game' thrillers set in the future, and a constant throwback of THE RUNNING MAN, where killing nearly does all of the work. Paul Verhoeven did much better with STARSHIP TROOPERS overall, despite me not being a fan of his bloody science fiction stories. I get turned off for the bad acting, and especially parts of its writing, leaving me stunned out of a movie that generated millions of dollars. The same goes for the voluptuous vixens, one of which possessed the 'Big Three' to make such a total embarrassment. Here is where science fiction started to carry a bad name for itself, and just by proving, it shows off a sleazy catfight between Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin. What TOTAL RECALL really stood out best was the nightmarish feeling of fantasy we get when we're living in a state of chaos. Arnie's your main man if breaking bones and blasting flesh is what you desire. Recommended only for Verhoeven buffs, but the movie is left criminally overrated to justify my interest.",4,3,10,9 March 1999
Rocky," Stallone's strong writing power flies high in this award-winning 'B-movie'.
","It doesn't take an expert (not including myself) to recognize ROCKY as a genuine B-movie, something that hasn't been mentioned yet in the minds of IMDb users. Even for a 1976 Best Picture Oscar, the film really isn't all THAT great, until you're caught by the outstanding wonders of Sylvester Stallone's personally talented writing and his impressive street bum character of 'The Italian Stallion'. There are no stellar production values as expected from an upper-class Hollywood, but it's an easy-going movie that you can sit all the way through. Other than the landmark finale that remains among the most memorable shots on film, not a whole lot can be said. This is, pure and simple, great entertainment thanks to a bright mind who overcame tough obstacles in hitting a big time movie career.***The mention of 'B-movie' in this message can be exploited. Noteworthy in the film is Troma's founder and creator of THE TOXIC AVENGER Lloyd Kaufman, who took part in casting as a 'drunk', and also serving as a pre-production supervisor. He also appeared (and presented) in John Avildsen's earliest directorial effort, CRY UNCLE. Long before ROCKY, Avildsen was known for making a couple of low budget films. It is assumed that he and Kaufman are true buddies in the movie-making business.Don't be shocked and stunned at the original ROCKY being the greatest B-movie to take home the greatest honors in the world, particularly the Oscars!",7,1,6,18 March 1999
Pretty Woman," A classic romance delightfully updated in modern form.
","From start to finish, you can't wait to see Julia Roberts temptingly delightful until the fun is over. If you're dead serious about her but only want to watch one of her greats, then PRETTY WOMAN is it, THE quintessential Julia Roberts film that updates PYGMALION in tasteful contemporary flavor. This has to be a remarkable performance from a young 21-year old who could pull off an older woman's role so well. Practical and funny at times, it clearly defines the 90s 'chick flick' comedy that saw a rising trend. Almost everything about it has Roberts' name written all over it, but let's not forget Richard Gere who quickly gets hooked with her in a wig. In fact, he's the perfect example for all male stereotypes to find and cherish love in surprising, affectionate, but sometimes hurtful ways. Boasting an excellent pop soundtrack, this is a true modern classic, except for one thing: the way Roberts dresses like a 'street junkie' makes it a little too vague for an all-too-good movie that has plentiful moments. One thing's perfectly clear, though. Anyone who never saw a romantic comedy before will have desperately wished they've seen PRETTY WOMAN! Another strong recommendation from yours truly!",8,1,2,9 March 1999
Titanic," The Greatest Motion Picture of all time..??
","So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as 'Rose' is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a 'street boy' and a 'troublemaker'. The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The 'modernized' scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with 'Happy Face' shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old 'Ross' makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made.",9,50,96,31 January 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson shines in one of the most entertaining films of our time.
","You can't keep an almighty classic down! ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is fully admiring on Jack Nicholson's view of the uncertainy of confused hospital patients. He easily steals the program for his edgy talent, but he is often regarded as an inspiration to his pals, including the 'Chief'. Risking all that he can to give them a new life in the outside world, he is also an acceptably rewarding character that can put smiles to your faces. It's a role that many would choose to take. Enjoyably fun, I'd say!Nicholson isn't the only one, though. The cast of a few 'newcomers' as patients shows a lot of accurate chemistry. They have conflicting matters between easy and hard realities in which to live. Most importantly is Louise Fletcher as a strictly determined nurse who tries to keep up with her daily routine of duties. Overall, the characters are extremely vital to the whole film itself. Perhaps this did give an honorable mention of Oscar-winning performances.In the end, other than good writing or good characters, a true classic needs 'the works': a touch of laughter, some fascinating situations, and occasional moments that can be both good and bad. And again, you can't always prove that it's the greatest print on celluloid. Thanks to the exceptional direction of Milos Forman, the movie is hands down, another platinum '9' winner in my book, and one of my personal greats.",9,1,3,22 March 1999
The Waterboy," Sandler is getting better at his movie career! For now.
","Adam Sandler is finally starting to prove the world (and me included) that he is a downright likeable comic, even if his speech needs therapy. After his previous outings prior to THE WEDDING SINGER (I have not forgotten that one!), I had virtually no hope that THE WATERBOY could pull himself together in show business. Sorry to say I'm right, but Sandler is acceptable for an otherwise standard fare sports comedy. Whether you liked HAPPY GILMORE to the fullest or not, the  changes in Sandler's personality is sure enough to disappoint the most faithful fans. He stands out with far greater appeal set in an environment of Southern flavor, and while his usual hijinks continue in his series of movies to date, he's less childish and more calm than in the past. Still, he's got the potential to give us all a delightfully good time. 'Cartoonish' can also describe this movie, with characters that add life to the comedy experience, including a welcome appearance by Henry 'The Fonz' Winkler as a 'football' coach.  It could even be the the perfect Sandler movie that pulls off a wacky cartoon episode, and it does well. THE WATERBOY still could have done much better, though. It could have toned down some of the objectionably crude matter that is mighty pointless for a cheerful movie, and it didn't have to be overused on typical comedy cliches that make it look similar to the rest. I'm about to become convinced that Sandler may start to impress me a little. Let's hope his next big movie receives a '7' or higher.",6,2,3,18 April 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Overrated, and poignant infirmary drama is too long, but has a satisfying value.
","I'm way too astonished to find THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION at the top of the rankings list. Maybe it's because TITANIC got your tongues!This is a very satisfying tale about prison life that develops friendships and painful moments, with solid performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's disturbing to mention a couple of major flaws I've noticed in spending 2-1/2 hours of silver screen magic. Lengthy time is just one of them. Another is that certain scenes quickly lose your interest, while others are so interesting that you can't help but sit back and enjoy them with the pleasure of comfort. Just draw a line graph inside your head and notice how the levels get screwed as time progresses. Same thing with those machines that measure waves of earthquake intensities. I'm not being too complex, but I think this is a good comparison to what the movie accomplished in general. So much for the harsh part...With good intentions, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION gets better and better at the conclusion, which is by far the most impressive I've witnessed. We must think of this film, as a whole, a true part of escaping society's problems, the definite basis of what it really means. Freeman's narration contributes to the story with thought, and Robbins does exceptionally well as a con who awaits the splendor of freedom. Stephen King did an adequate enough job in writing a book that escapes horror. Prison flicks usually are straightforward, but there is higher emphasis on its ideal writing, a crucially vital element in good filmmaking standards.So while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has some pros and cons, it is a natural and redeeming look at the pains and friendships that any living soul can accept or caress. It isn't THE greatest movie ever filmed, but stands out as a Hollywood classic that will see future years for the whole world to crave.Then again, I did not say TITANIC 'is' the greatest...",7,1,3,14 March 1999
Platoon," A strikingly accurate view of wartime horror in Vietnam.
","Oliver Stone's PLATOON accurately lives up to the experience of fighting hard and dying in wartime. Nothing takes place elsewhere on the globe except for being inside the bloody, torturable action at Vietnam. If you're a veteran of the Army or Marines who still carries a peace sign, then you'll see why this picture (and as with many others) is gratefully dedicated. This appeared to be a first for the screen, perhaps a step above other war films. It paints a hair-gripping portrait at fighting during the Vietnam War with strong attention to graphic details based on extremely true and tense situations. You might complain that this looks nearly like another 80s war action movie with no real substance, but this put into effect is demanding along with tensions, pain, and suffering on the battleground, which is conceivably portrayed. Take very careful notice of the end conclusion, which is horrifyingly true! While I'm waiting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for the first time, this movie was best for starts. PLATOON is a milestone for (yes) Oliver Stone. I can't always judge a Best Picture winner to the most supreme, but let's say it does rank among the few best innovative war pictures that stood a long and lengthy test of time.",8,0,0,18 March 1999
Space Jam," Remembering #23 in the world of Looney Tunes.
","Michael Jordan's recent departure from basketball will make SPACE JAM a memorable video collector's item to behold, now and forever. His appearances with Bugs & Company in past TV commercials put the tall guy into greater stardom than on the court. Here's where the magic is!Frankly, SPACE JAM is a swift update for the LOONEY TUNES cast due to some modernized comedy. I can't believe Porky Pig actually said he wet his pants! It's no surprise this got a PG rating, and that's largely due to the animated effects of Jordan and other real-life humans sucking into holes, which is amusing, but points out the subject of 'mild violence'. It's not bad as it is cartoonish. To say it simple, it's great fun for all ages because of Bugs, Daffy, & Company who have timelessly entertained us for decades.When Jordan spoke his words about retiring, there's one thing he forgot to say to the public: 'TH-TH-TH-TH-THAT'S ALL FOLKS!'",5,2,11,15 January 1999
Speed," Sit down and enjoy the cinematic bus ride, or take the taxi!
","There are three ways to describe this virtually nonstop action experience: it's a 'brake'-through, a break-'through', and yes, a 'BREAKTHROUGH'. Never before my bleeding eyes has there been a movie so exciting, and yet, so suspenseful and pulse-pounding that it blows all the other 'me-too' action movies out of the water as fast as you can say 'Roadkill!'! The opening is incredible enough to feel that you can't take any more high intensity, and that's only warming up. Among the breakthroughs is Sandra Bullock, for whom this movie confirms her now-classic signature role as 'Annie', taking over the driver's seat and SPEEDing along. If it sounds like just another runaway bus, then you're missing everything else! The high-powered plot is hands down, the most well-conceived idea that it can be derived from past 'disaster' films of the 70s. A simple bomb threat creates a widespread panic for all of us sitting around eating popcorn and drinking Coke. Only one thing could be wrong: the action usually stays in the same place while plenty of it is moving in all sorts of frenzy directions. Action lovers need not to look any further, because SPEED is one of the best films in the genre, and approved by my highest possible recommendation.",9,0,1,24 January 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Don't spend a night at the living room watching this sour comedy.
","Paramount has impressed me with a few good movies recently, so why does A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY have to get so moronic and tasteless to easily consider this a box-office flop? This is a very poor parody of the disco life that took 1998 by storm through efforts of revitalization (i.e. 54, THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO, maybe BOOGIE NIGHTS). Neither of the two loonies (Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell) take advantage of handling what should be comedy flavor; the movie isn't even worth a single grin! The return of the 'head bop' is too awfully planned to stage a cultural comeback. But what more can you ask in a movie that's got plenty of hoochie-koochie gals wearing tight outfits above the knees? So terribly dull from start to end, this definitely lives up to my list of 1998's bottom ten Hollywood stinkers! It's only worth buying the soundtrack album if you're into the disco dance music craze.",3,2,8,22 April 1999
The Truman Show," Carrey's 'breakthrough' movie unearths too many possibilities.
","First off, this is Jim Carrey's best performance I've ever seen, although he still doesn't act very dramatic like some have believed. He has a jolly, cheerful character inside of him, and is toned down from his past films, which is acceptable. Consider him a world famous television icon, if you will, because THE TRUMAN SHOW is how simple, everyday life compares simultaneously with a never-ending broadcast. In other words, 'All Truman, All The Time! 24 Hours A Day, 7 Days A Week!'. (L.O.L.) Many will miss Carrey's goofball personality, which confirms a local newspaper out here giving this one of the worst five movies of 1998. Well, go figure! You have many options of how to describe the movie. Is it based on real life accounts or is it an imaginative fantasy about the world media? Does it mean to be heartwarming or just made to be the highest-rated television program in the world? Will it be funny, or will it make you shed some tears? It's obvious that the first half tends to be tedious, only for the second to be more meaningful as we finally understand our pal Truman being under surveillance by a special broadcast control center past the heavens. This bares a similarity with God in control of everything around him on the earth. It appears like Truman is the inspiration for every one of us who tune in. Overall, I discovered the second half being the best feature, but while it had the best entertaining value, it goes by way too fast along with its final ending, making me beg for more. THE TRUMAN SHOW isn't a bad idea on Peter Weir's part, but it might not be appealing enough to attract our strong desires for solid enjoyment. I fare this film better than the newspaper gave it, but as a whole, I say 'above average'.",6,0,0,22 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," STAR WARS--The Original American Film Epic
","A long, long time ago, I was never familiar with STAR WARS until this familiar sound of music played on the radio. Later, visions of action figures on TV commercials dominated my Saturday mornings. This sure was a completely giant success story that even I couldn't understand way back in my pre-school years, but it was just happening. It took years of waiting experience to get a new VCR, and I finally took advantage of the Force. If you were like me, your early childhood days have been rough because you never got to see the STAR WARS trilogy. Fascinated by flying spaceships, bold warriors, and especially C-3PO and R2-D2, the days were a joy to behold. George Lucas' sci-fi epic that includes this first original movie is a timeless treasure, thanks to his establishment of a fantasy adventure that goes galactic. He's not just an ordinary director, but a director of technology. The excitement of its epic combat battles are worth infinite viewings, and was destined to blow away the audience with a rapid-fire force of impact. And this revolutionary piece led to numerous imitators!You can very well remember how George Lucas and the whole ILM gang made this trilogy through its history of complications. The original STAR WARS was a terrible undertaking for Lucas because he wanted a movie that feels true to realistic. When JAWS was playing in 1975, it showed off some new special effects technology of a great white shark, and managed to achieve in editing. That hit film was released at a time when production values remained tight, which they were often called 'B' movies. STAR WARS has been the same thing, and it wasn't exactly clear that high-quality visuals would ever be possible. It would take more than the entire National Football League to create a 70s masterpiece. Lucas tried, and won by displaying a thrilling speed of action with a lightning fast pace. One example is the brief 'hyperwarp' scene, where one blink of an eye ruins your day. When you have an incredible view of the fireworks, there's always a big plot to make more excitement. Like the movies themselves, one good story leads to another.Without characters, there wouldn't be a movie at all. Make them appealing and then everyone can enjoy the fun. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) lives the adventure; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is always the bold type; Chewbacca The Wookiee adds to the chemistry with his furry appearance; likeable droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are loved by the kids. But there's always the villain, Darth Vader whose familiarity would still be hated through fun, but always recognizable. This first installment actually serves as an introductory platform for the characters and their potential of things to come. We know them well, but this is only the beginning (in Episode four!). Keep in mind, though, that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has always been the central hero of the series. Pretty fascinating!Always take notice of the 1997 Special Edition. This is a mandatory must for STAR WARS newcomers who still haven't taken advantage of the Force in all these years. The myth is that there aren't a whole lot of changes. The truth is that they're saying quite a lot because the editing of these enhancements is phenomenal, and hasn't been done before. It's a remarkable achievement in modern film technology, and the scene with Jabba The Hut explains why. Remember that some of original pieces of footage remain the same with a certainty of noticeable glitches, which is still a minor offense. Add to this some incredible restoration and we still have a sci-fi gem that will stick around longer while the new trilogy slowly builds on. Think of this, you're watching an entirely new movie!I hope this original movie and the whole trilogy in itself doesn't fall victim to a terrible amount of backlash when EPISODE ONE arrives. That one will do excellent business based on our cravings for special effects; they actually sell the movies! Should it happen, this would be a fatal blow to preserving a quality image to American cinema, past or present. We must take for granted that movies are essential as entertainment, and how the many possibilities can be discovered. Judging a movie's popularity against the odds is only going to hurt it. It is currently being demonstrated with E.T. (1982) and TITANIC (1997), two highly acclaimed films that are receiving tons of negative criticism and scrutiny from the public. They do this by pushing popularity off the wall. At least we know how to handle STAR WARS movies carefully, and while we enjoy science fiction as a make-believe cushion, it's important to know that it took a genius like George Lucas to create a universe where excitement exceeds the imaginable. Without him, the movie industry would be in deep space beyond the far reaches of our galaxy. The greatest movie ever made? Only on a cult level; it is the best one for the crowd, but consider this a fine American piece of movie art for all.The Force will be with us.....always.",8,2,3,9 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The next STAR WARS chapter improves over the previous one.
","The very first STAR WARS movie changed the way we looked at motion pictures, and this second feature is a BIG significant improvement. It is the best in the trilogy, hands down. Regardless of watching another mega-classic, I'm not going to write up a skyscraper-high comment for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK because this only makes one-third of the legendary saga.It looks like we have another director in charge: Irvin Kirshner. But it is still George Lucas who's in full command. Key elements are (or were) beefed up to maximum 'force', which is very noticable throughout. The simple layout of the story is still STAR WARS, now with a plot that thickens into greater epic dimensions. Continuing the story in motion is a brilliant thought. You just never call this a sequel! Characters have much more to their integrity than the previous film, with Yoda as a new addition. Luke Skywalker remains the powerful hero, but his interest with Yoda adds to his legacy along with the revealing truth about Darth Vader. Han Solo and Princess Leia have some touchy chemistry in-between the action (finally!). R2-D2 remains likeable, but you've got to look at C-3PO! What happened to him? We've come to know more about the cast, that is if you aren't careless to see EPISODE FIVE for the first time in your life.Like I said before, this next installment has much more. More speed, more intense combat battles, a more thundering orchestrated soundtrack by John Williams, and more special effects. Sights of objects that float in the air looked unbelievable (for the time). The biggest achievement goes to location filming under adverse conditions (the scene of Hoth), adding life to the story.George Lucas' script was of extreme brilliance in the first STAR WARS that only some further polishing would make his follow-up more revolutionary. Which is the one and only improvement in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Once again, please don't forget the Special Edition; no major movie classic has ever been updated in style thanks to Lucas' ILM team. Will EPISODE TWO live up to this?",9,0,0,10 May 1999
