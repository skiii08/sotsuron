It," Good job converting Stephen kings HUGE novel into a movie
","I liked this movie, it is a classic Stephen King book (not movie). Its set in Maine in the 80's, its a simpler time, there is a backstory that slowly unfolds to give you a solution which have been handy at the start and there is some omnipotent creature
I read IT 20 years ago, haven't picked it up since but I remember some of the big themes in that writing style SK used and they had to be added to this movie, with vary success.
First of all this movie is split it into two parts whereas in the LONG book they flick back and forth as their forgotten memories return, only remembering how they defeated Pennywise as kids 9/10ths into the book so they can use it now
The movie attempts the flashbacks and poor memory recall which is perceived as bad editing
Another was how Pennywise was able to accomplish so much carnage without anyone noticing.That's because of the whole manipulating your mind thing
For Movie makers this is gold as it allows them to make main players make stupid decisions and therefor keep the movie rolling on without blaming poor writing and reverting to the old obligatory horror movie ethos 'lets split up' 
This book came out around the same time as Nightmare on Elm St (which is referenced in the movie) with a similar theme using your dreams/nightmares/emotions. Its not that new now but this movie does a good job of it. Bring on part two.",Null,0,1,8 August 2018
