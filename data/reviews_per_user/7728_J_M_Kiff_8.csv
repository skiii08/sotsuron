The Incredible Hulk," Excellent. (very minor spoiler)
","Very well done. Much better than I expected. Much better than the previous Hulk movie (not that that would be tough). I especially loved the cameos by Stan Lee and Big Lou. Without them it just wouldn't be the Hulk. I grew up watching the TV show, and to me Lou Ferrigno IS the Hulk and always will be. And from the brief look at Lou in the movie, he's still in incredible shape. You only get to see him in one scene, but his arms are just HUGE! How old is he anyhow? He must've been in his twenties when he did the TV show, and that was darn near 30 years ago! I wish I could be jacked up like Big Lou when I'm in my 50's. Very well done.",7,4,33,12 June 2008
Sucker Punch," Very disappointing
","I've seen a lot of movies. I've seen good movies, I've seen mediocre movies, and I've seen bad movies. I've even seen some movies that were so bad they were good. This isn't one of them. This is just a bad movie. Threadbare plot. Cardboard acting. Rehashed generic dialogue. And the most overused plot 'twist' at the end. But how to describe it....? Imagine a live-action anime rape fantasy with cheap matrix-y special effects played out by a handful of women who couldn't act sick if they had the flu. I work in a movie theater, so I screened this movie for free, and still I wanted my money back. Save your $10. Go buy an ice-cream cone. You'll save yourself two hours of misery and, hey... you'll have ice-cream.",2,36,76,24 March 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Awesome
","Honestly, I wasn't really expecting to like this so much. I really hate Jack Black, he's just disgusting. But since I didn't actually have to see him, it was OK. The subtle expressions and under-the-breath comments between the characters was rendered beautifully in CGI. My only criticism is that, considering the stunning array of huge stars doing voices, so many of them got so few lines. I mean, it's a Kung Fu movie, and Jackie Chan gets only a handful of lines. WHAT?!? But this movie really drew me in. It'll be a great movie for kids and families, but if you're an adult go to a late show and you will love it. I was pleasantly surprised. I think you will be too.",9,2,6,4 June 2008
The Expendables," It is what it is.
","Don't try to over-think or over-analyze this movie. It's an excuse to get all the great action stars together and blow stuff up - A lot. It contains just enough of a thin plot to tell a cohesive story. The love story sub-plot with Stallone is just enough to provide a sense of motivation for the main character, other than being strictly mercenary. And there is just enough humor to lighten the mood between gun fights, car/plane chases, and big explosions. Eric Roberts as the bad guy was a brilliant choice, as he never takes himself too seriously, so you feel okay rooting against him but you never quite come to hate him. I do feel, despite the R rating, that the movie pulled it's punches (sorry) with the language and other adult content. If you're going to make a big budget R rated action movie explosion-fest, then go all out with it! It's worth seeing, but not on a date. Get the guys together, go out for steaks and beers, then sit back and enjoy.",7,2,32,27 August 2010
Drive," Pathetic
","Don't waste your money. This is the second-, maybe third-worst movie I've seen in a year; and I work in a movie theater so I see EVERY movie that comes out. The soundtrack is some no-name pop crap from the 80's mixed in with occasional lame attempts at horror music. The dialogue is darn-near non-existent, but the few lines Ryan speaks are monotone and cliché. The 'action' scenes are two very short very boring car chases and two murders that are so graphic they seem grossly out of place in an otherwise-PG movie. You'd think with a title like 'Drive' that there'd be a lot of cool... you know... Driving. Nope. Every scene is a dragged-out uncomfortable cliché. If I hadn't known better, I'd swear I was watching a very long, and very bad, SNL skit. I saw it for free and it still wasn't worth the money.",1,35,109,14 September 2011
Insidious," Haven't we seen this movie before...?
","Oh wait, we have seen this movie before, about 50 times. Same predictable 'scary' elements and two-dimensional plot, that I nearly fell asleep. OOoooo... there's a scary bumping sound in the house- go investigate it alone, in the dark. OOOoooo.... the creepy old psychic lady says your son is haunted, gosh that old lady sure has lost weight since Poltergeist. Oh wait, that's a different old lady, she's just playing the exact same role, I get it. Why does every family in every movie that involves a 'haunting' insist on keeping as many lights turned off as possible? Is the midst of a Haunting problem really the best time to go green? Did the ghost trip a circuit breaker? Hey, your house may be haunted, your kid may be in danger, but don't bother turning on a light somewhere, naww.... just blunder around in the dark. Hey, maybe the ghost is afraid of the dark, right? Weak. Overdone. Predictable. Go rent 'Poltergeist' and enjoy yourself.",3,6,42,2 April 2011
The Dark Knight," Even better than the hype. (very minor spoilers...)
","Amazing. Usually when a movie is hyped this much it's a bad omen. We all knew, following the tragic and untimely passing of Heath Ledger, that the buzz around this film would spiral beyond control... but I was pleasantly surprised (well, maybe not too surprised) to find that the movie actually surpassed the hype. I went into the preview expecting a great movie, but got even more than that. The opening sequence grabs you, the pace of the action keeps you moving along (even for such a long movie), there's just enough (dark) humor mixed in to make the issues the characters face palatable and to make the characters more believable as human. I have just one very minor beef with this film- totally unrelated to plot or characters. Gotham, though fictional, has long been associated with a particular American city. I was kinda bummed to see the movie filmed in that Second city. Oh well. Still a great movie. I just watched in twice in a row, but just couldn't stay through a third screening. Not that it's not worth it- I will definitely see it again, but it's kinda long and I'm reeaallly tired, so, off the bed. I'm sure you will love this film.",10,5,11,16 July 2008
Hancock," Good, but not great. *** Spoilers ***
","If you're going in expecting a life-changing, perspective-altering film, this is not it. However, it is a great way to kill time, get a few really good laughs, and down some popcorn. That's all the film is intended to be, and it holds up OK. The a-hole anti-superhero is a nice twist on the recent rash of 'take-me-seriously-darnit' superhero movies. I never got the impression that this movie was intended to be anything more than it is. It's goofy-funny at times, a little vulgar at times, and I knew there was something going on between Hancock and Therron's character, but I was honestly surprised when I found out what that connection was. Granted, it could've used a few more scenes to add more depth, like when she's reminding Hancock of their long-past adventures they should've had her narration run over some foggy-memory type of scenes playing out their troubles in Sumer, and Greece, and Brooklyn, and Miami, etc. But overall I enjoyed it. And let's face it, who among us wouldn't like to have that kind of power? Honestly?",6,1,29,30 June 2008
