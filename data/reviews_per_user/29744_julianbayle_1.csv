The New World," This film is a disgrace.
","I have never seen a more terribly written, directed, edited, and sound designed film EVER. For a group of 'A list' professionals and an 'A list' budget, it is incomprehensible to me how this rag could have made it to the screens. Aside for some pretty scenery this film had absolutely no redeeming qualities. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT. I almost feel bad being this harsh, but that feeling is outweighed by how bad I felt watching it. Apparently I need to go into more details about how bad this film is in order to submit my displeasure. OK, so here goes...Was there even a script? Was Colin Farrel meant to be a mumbling Irish bloke? How much money did this film lose? I no longer wish to beat a dead horse.",1,25,44,15 June 2006
