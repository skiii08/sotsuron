Your Name.," Well executed tropes, ingenuity and visual porn
","Who would have know... This gem took a while to cross the oceans into western audiences cinemas, and it was worth every minute! It is a signature Makoto Shinkai piece, the visuals are just beautiful, the dedication to representing modern Tokyo and the Japan country-side is mesmerizing, a work of art which carries intensity and uses all at its disposal to provide a truly cinematic experience, including a great soundtrack! Story wise I can't praise enough the well executed tropes from the genre, and the appropriately quick pacing which respects the audience capacity to follow the flow. Plot wise there's no overly complicated setups (altough some would argue the plot is complicated...), the hooks are fantastically delivered and more than delights the viewer with their conclusions. The main character relationships are always on the forefront, and the secondary characters are well fleshed out, the audience grows to love them.Can't recommend enough Kimi no Na wa doesn't revolutionize, but neither does it have to, it is plain simply excellent. 9.8/10",10,3,6,1 June 2017
Interstellar," Awe, visual awe!
","I would like to go on a rant to justify my words, and then give my personal review of the movie but I won't, because otherwise no one would even glance at this!--- DISCLAIMER: I am not a movie critic, I am not a professional in writing, and I do only want to convey my own opinion on this movie and Nolan's work. ---Interstellar delivers. On audio and visuals. With exception of the main characters everyone else is lacking a certain depth to them, many will critique this point, but honestly... Why should the great majority even care? So many tropes have been applied to deliver us some of those iconic side roles that do we really want some more? Instead one can enjoy the fact that the original story being presented is given in a focused manner around the main characters, Cooper and his daughter.On another note, this movie does not deserve an Oscar for being the 'Best Movie' or 'Best Drama', it just isn't. Yet I personally wouldn't be able to give anything else but 9.8/10 for this fantastic experience.Sometimes we see movies advertised as experiences for IMAX, or 3DXD or whatever else, but truly rare movies deliver on that, which is disappointing for me, because that's what some of the audience is looking for. When some want a SOLID STORY, books are there, novels, from any imaginable genre. But for visuals and audio that makes your very core shiver and tremble from emotions and awe, there's MOVIES.This movie is audio-visually so impressive and captivating that it's in my honest opinion SECOND TO NONE. The last frontier here is just so fantastically presented in such a fashion you just WANT to believe it's true, Hans Zimmer delivers the audience with such a soundtrack it perfectly fills the empty void of outer space and vacuum.From an audio-visual guy to any who dare listen, this is a must see in all the glory a cinema-like experience can deliver, fill your eyes and ears, sit down and you won't notice time passing by. I certainly didn't, the 3 hours could've been 4 and I still would've been submissive to the awe that this movie created in me, I was utterly speechless by the experience.",10,1,9,26 November 2014
La La Land," I came out of the closet because of this movie!
","By that I mean the musical closet (gotcha)! What a visual masterpiece, some say being critical about something shows how much respect one has about what is being criticized (worthy of critique), I feel La La Land has received quite a bit of mixed views, because somehow it portrait a telltale which is very dream like if not unrealistic. Is that really the point? La La Land praises the very medium it is being portrayed through, film and cinema, it does so in a thoroughly enjoyable way, by delivering the panache, colour splash and the dazzle most of us actually dream of. It is an optimistic vision, in a world full of anger. It is a nostalgic protest, a loud praise for musicals of old and it is beautiful. The cinematic execution is out of this world, the production, music, fidelity, filmography, costumes the love for the form is transpiring through the silver-screen. It makes you want to dance, sing and celebrate, are those feelings hard to enjoy? It also makes you sad and angry, at times it surprises, it is FUN. It delivers all that with what I would call a perfectly fitting ending. The scene on the clouds, why care if it was corny? All the awkward bits play into our own subconscious anxieties and insecurities, at least for some. Oh well... a solid bloody 10!",10,2,9,1 June 2017
