Conquest 1453," Not enough
","I think these kind of historical movies have to be done by the ones who know the history. Lets say nothing about the script, acting and costumes.. But one of the most important thing about the Ottoman culture was forgotten. Where is the Mehteran ? ( the Ottoman war band). I was hoping to hear the encouraging attack song at the battlefield, we just heard the European neoclassic ambient songs instead. Just awful. Disappointing. Someone should make an another film about the conquest which had closed an age in order to make us forgot this incapability. Turkish people are waiting this film for decades, the answer should not be this. This should be a kidding i think, if not i am wondering also supposing that the producer should have thought that Turkish people just deserve this, nothing more. I got so angry.",5,37,72,19 February 2012
