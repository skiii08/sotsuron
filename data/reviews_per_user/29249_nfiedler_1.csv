The Blair Witch Project," Excellent horror movie!
","I read several of the early comments and I can't believe there are people who didn't like this film. Who can honestly say they weren't scared? Are these people human? This film was terrifying and has kept me up at night. If you like horror films, you must see this film. You may get a headache from the bouncing camera but you will be scared. A new horror classic.",10,1,2,3 August 1999
