Skyfall," very good
","It is the 1st time (since a long time) that the cinema was fully booked. It's not without a good reason though as the movie was worth every penny of its ticket. Although he is probably the ugliest of the series, Daniel's 007 incarnation is so believable, that might be the best of all the previous and hopefully he will remain at least another 10 years. This Bond adapted to his time, does a great physical performance, getting injured or having emotions other than those related to bed time. As a spy he uses his charms to accomplish his objectives, but he doesn't carry the girl as a plant all along the movie to keep a romantic attachment. It is very interesting to see this modern approach to women, who have more interesting roles when they have one. I never liked the female M, but she did a great performance. I really appreciated to see the roots of JB, as concerns his life story, but also the iconic references like the old car. Besides, the plot was quite original, as 007 was the hunted instead of the hunter. Finally it was well assembled to the traditional structure with M, Q, Monepenny. It was about time.",10,4,18,3 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This might bring back the lost fans
","Did SW7 hurt you? Well this might partially heal you.Despite some unjustified scenario points (like Jyn's mother revealing herself and shooting, or how the Empire soldiers despite all their technology could not locate Jyn under the rock, etc,etc), the overall plot stands fine. It is dark, serious, and targets clearly a more adult audience than the previous movie. All the 7 y.o. kids (about 50 of them!) brought to the cinema by silly parents believing they would see one more Disney tale were annoyed and bothered with their behavior the rest of the cinema. This is a solid indication of saving the saga! Biased from previous failure I wouldn't watch this if Donnie Yen was not in. My hopes were satisfied. He is the Donnie a fan would expect and although he didn't get a light saber (despite being more close to the force than anyone holding one in SW7), his presence and character portrayal will stay in audience's heart. It was certainly an attempt to please and interest the Far East Asian audience, but it was a pleasant one. Felicity Jones was an other great presence. Unlike Daisy Ridley, she didn't have all the spotlights on her. Although following a female lead, we didn't have the feeling of a Barbie/Hunger-games crap targeting under age girls. And that's a win-win for Felicity and Gareth Edwards. K2SO was another great addition. Mature acting with good sense of humour, was a refreshing take on how an android of that era should be, making C3PO only good for scrap. And finally Darth Vader was there. Finally some good old bad-ass baddie we missed so much. His guest star appearance was enough to rise Rogue One to new levels of approval. Something must be done to somehow keep him in SW universe, or there will be no future for the saga.All in all a good film. Not a great one as already most die hard fans acclaim, but an acceptable one. One that deserves a place next to the 6 older movies and far from the last one. Watch and appreciate it now. Before Ridley-Boyega pair return to remind you that you are no more a SW fan.",7,2,5,23 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Captain Boredom. Better watch Wonder Woman instead
","I was expecting this for a long time. There are some things happening, but Captain Boredom is continuously bored despite her rainbow colored super powers and the 'someone imposed us to add black actors at the last moment' characters. The last scene is the epitome of the movie where she does some cleaning in the kitchen and speaks to rejuvenated Samuel Jackson (only reason to put 1 star) as if she really was at her home washing dishes after a hard day at work.I would advise to watch Wonder Woman instead, which conveys the same messages (if needed) with a better plot and in a more action packed and fun way",1,37,62,22 June 2019
Alexander," who can do better?
","I remember when this came out, most people (and particularly in Greece) were annoyed, including myself, from this seemingly messed non-linear-story movie, with no sufficient respect to the iconic historical person and to the ideas he represents. Stone started being called Stoned.One day after watching Jared Leto in the Suicide Squad, I was compelled to see Alexander once more where he plays Hephaistion, the historically supposed love of protagonist's life. And this was where all the problem of this movie began. Excellent cinematography, dialogues, writing, editing, music, had less impact than the love story of the main character. Diminishing it to a peephole-movie rather than the biography of 4 in 1 king (King of Macedon, Persia, Asia, Egyptian Pharaoh) everybody expected to see. Indeed this was a serious mistake, both historically probably inaccurate and vexing for the viewer. Alexander had according to historians 3 wives and more lovers (women) than his supposedly unfaithful father, plus a personal harem. He might indeed have had some unconfirmed bysexual traits, however this is not the reason he is remembered today by the whole world. His battle record, military genius and inspiring spirit were depicted as collateral damage to his ineffable character.Today with sufficient distance from the first shock, I was able to appreciate the rest of the movie. I was amazed by the cinematography, the artistic touch in scenes of action, drama or romance and the great historical accuracy of production design, battles depiction and costumes. Even if Alexander was not far from this depiction, we live in a world a lot different than that time. What was ethical then would not necessarily be today and vice-versa. But you cannot sell a lot of pasta in Italy if you label them 'noodles'. All in all, for 155M$ you get a more real and far better movie than the 175M$ CGIed Suicide Squad. (And I am a hardcore DC fan). The kind of movie that makes you want to buy a projector for home. Just skip a few scenes the first time",8,2,4,4 December 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," is this a movie?
","No this is not a movie. Oversimplistic plot, zero character development, zero acting.
Why did they bring all this great actors? for nothing! Why did they need oscars' Kate Blanchett for a superficial villain who just kills a few people? What did the presence of Matt Damon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Karl Urban added to the movie? Nothing! A few scenes, a few lines to make a couple of jokes and that's it. Idris Elba could bring some dramatic effect, but no. I can go like that for the rest.Yes some images are beautiful (although much less than previous movie, the pair Thor - Loki had some nice opportunities, but even them seemed too fake, too one-liners, too child acting. Even when delivering some 1st grade jokes they did it so badly. Marvel continues its own Ragnarok. Maybe they target the youngest audience in purpose to ensure future gains, or the silliest. Just look at the positive reviews, they either venerate Marvel as a perfect God, or their reviews are similar to the movie's cheesy lines on simplistic arguments.",1,10,19,28 January 2018
Captain America: Civil War," good worth-forgetting entertainment
","Further to the general acclaim over this, I was expecting something great. It's true that Marvel has been doing great so far, but I think they are kind of losing their touch. 1. what was good: the fighting scenes, the actions scenes, Spiderman and Antman jokes, Captain's overall presence, young Robert Downey Jr special effects. 2. what was mediocre: I haven't read the comic and I cannot know if they respected it, but the whole plot didn't seem powerful enough to justify a massive collision. Which was more of a Step-up dance-fight than a civil war. I was expecting a global war between them and I was only served with a 10min airport fight (in 2h30 movie), with mostly insignificant scratches. 3. what was bad: was there any music? they could have revived these 5 super winter soldiers and make a mess, instead they were simply put to sleep. I'm fed up of Spidermen reboots. Spidey was T.Maguire, the rest I don't bother watch. The way they brought in Spiderman and Antman was even more forced than Wonder Woman in BvS.Movie was entertaining because each character is likable, but other than that feels a lot like filming before writing it. Marvel once again fails to deliver a worth remembered sequel",7,2,7,8 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Great... for 20 minutes
","The 1st guardians was totally awesome. I was expecting this 2nd one for some time. The 1st action-packed 20min were totally justifying my expectations. And then that low quality joke about what Rocket would place on the pillow of StarLord arrived. They even put an emphasis on that supposed joke continuing it for a few minutes. It reminded me low level jokes like seen in recent Baywatch movie or other Zack Effron's nasty ones. This kind seems to be the new standard now? The next part of the movie continued with some nice fake backgrounds, flat jokes, uninteresting developments. Seeing Stalone, Michelle Yeoh and David Hasselhoff speaking a few words was nice, but wouldn't save anything.",1,2,4,22 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Marvel in tears
","I always watch movies before reading reviews. Despite its mythology and practical inaccuracies, WW was very pleasant to watch and had the quality direction and artistic-sequences that Snyder used us to expect.I read afterwards the surprisingly too many hating reviews which could be categorized in 3 categories: those who judge as documentary commentators, those whose views are biased by Marvel and those who doubt the impartiality of IMDb.To the 1st I have to say that at this moment BBC produces a supposed accurate retelling of Trojan war, including black actors as Achilles and Patroclos. While in a first script of WW, she was supposed to be of extraterrestrial origin and Superman's kin! So you can understand my relief when I found out that it wasn't the case and that mythology damages were contained. To the 2nd I will retort that except Dr Strange and the 1st Captain America I didn't see any memorable movie or TV series from Marvel whose stories are inconsistent and boring. To the 3rd I would advise to check Box Office Mojo where WW stands 5th in all-time comic adaptations.Despite a few scenario holes and a couple of bad CGI, the movie respects the feminist ideas conveyed traditionally by the character and provides a good entertainment",10,15,30,17 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dawn of the Bat
","Although I prefer DC characters over other comics' brands, I was skeptical about this movie. Especially due to the quick way they would try to gain the lost battle against Marvel. Every now and then we were hearing about new forced additions to introduce before its time the Justice League.Then came the choices of Gal Gadot, Jesse Eisenberg, Ezra Miller which was ruining already my excitement.The movie having started, I liked the transition with the M.o.S. which seemed realistic as the Cloverfield movie. Ben Affleck, despite the previous protest of a number of fans for his choice, seemed immediately capable of lifting the weight of the whole movie, which he indeed did. Dark as Wayne, while so vengeful and identical to Arkham games' knight in the costume, it is a scandal not to have been considered earlier for the role.Henry Cavill was luckily less loquacious and more substantial than in the Man from UNCLE, allowing Snyder to make a couple of artistic sequences that will be remembered. Gal Gadot was a nice surprise. Despite her skinny model background, she filled well the Amazon's armor and her face and acting when in Diana Prince's shoes, was mysterious and beautiful as she should be.All in all the movie had an easy but well narrated plot, with some short but often deep dialogue, and outstanding soundtrack outshining to my view the phantasmagorical but shallow teen targeting of Marvel's ways.One less star for the bad choice of Jokerish Lex Luthor and the oblivion of Grunt Gastin and Stephen Amell.",9,4,8,29 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Teen Wars
","I don't read reviews before a movie. I went to watch with great enthusiasm. The appearance of Clone army in the 1st few minutes rings a bell, but OK lets see. Kylo Vader appears, impressive stop of a laser bullet by Kylo. Ah I believe it would be amazing despite the deja vus. A girl protagonist so far, I'm OK with that. A black guy clone soldier (more clone of Eddie Murphy) easily leaves the army. Eh? Rolling R2D2 hides something that the bad guys want (again)? Daisy Ridley is good as Rey, but Rey is too good at anything, even opposing a Sith lord mind? Kylo takes off the mask and a duck-face teenager appears? Luke's lightsaber blue? Teen ex-clone Eddie Murphy can use it? Another teen as Hux? Seriously? how many teens will we see in protagonistic roles? Leia and Han have not many things to say? When did the bad guys have time after episode 6 to create a new death star? How did they even appear? Supreme leader is named Snot? Spok? Ah no it is Snoke. The new death star has the same construction defect as the previous one? A non-chemistry interacial friendship-romance is it really necessary? Kylo sith lord cannot defeat anyone (even completely inexperienced teens) with the lightsaber?All in all it is not a bad movie. We get to see everything we had missed so many years and some of the actors we liked. But after watching it so many story holes between episode6 and 7 annoy you. The myth of 'power' is broken to easy pieces. And you have just given a ticket to Disney for taking a huge saga and diminishing it to some Disney-teen-harrypotter-hungergames thingy.I would put a 6 if it was a new movie. But I put 1 for lack of vision and lack of respect for the fans/ the myth/ the saga.",1,15,20,28 December 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Weak
","As 1st movie, this is a visually good film. Backgrounds, production design , costumes are good. Photography makes everyone look well included in a work of art. Characters are graphic and the whole film wants to be something of a high tolerance James Bond series. It certainly has potential, but where it fails is the emotion. No matter who portrays 007 there is generally a lot of emotion, even if it is anger or dislike. Here everybody seems cold, doing things with cold blood, acting with cold blood. I would be OK with that if action was a bit more realistic.Keanu is my favorite since the matrix, however in this duology I was expecting a faster choreography. Everyone looks like waiting the next move to reply with his own . A bit like the first Jackie Chang movies but in slower pace. I would prefer Donnie Yen in the leading character despite the good looks of Keanu.Ruby Rose is an interesting discovery. The innuendos-meeting with Ex-Morpheus is top. Photography is good. But John, despite all the surrounding wanna be myth, is quite Weak",6,2,8,25 June 2017
