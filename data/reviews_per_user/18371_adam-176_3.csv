The Blair Witch Project," Not exactly high praise....
","After all the hype, I was really expecting great things from this.  I went to see this in the cinema when it first came out, and I have to say, it was quite a let-down.Do location points count as spoilers?  If so, then, I guess this next bit is a spoiler....There's 2 hours of fumbling about in the forest, lots of which is out of focus (largely when the moaning, whinging, 'I know best' Heather Donahue isn't on screen), followed by a bit in a house.  The bit in the house is the only part of the film that is any good, and it doesn't last long enough to be worth sitting through the rest of the film for.This film was supposed to be the scariest thing people would ever see... the only scary thing about it is that I paid to see it.In honour of the camera work, and The Whinging Heather, I move that this film be re-titled The Blurred Bitch Project.",Null,0,1,27 April 2002
Underworld," Who turned out the lights?
","Hmmm... the trailer for this film would have you believe that this is an action packed, intense, gripping story about vampires and werewolves.Yes, it's action packed.  Yes, it has vampires and werewolves.  However, the story, such as it was, was only mildly intense and completely failed to grip me at any point.A large part of the trouble with this film was that some of the lines were just too forced.  Two of the principal characters (Kraven and Lucien) were portrayed by actors who looked too much like they were trying to be Alan Rickman.  Sadly, although they could (just about) manage the creepy, angry or just down-right ****ed off looks, they fell very short of the mark with their deliveries, which were just too... choppy.. in places, and just flat in others.Many of the characters fell pray to the choppy speech problem, although even if they hadn't, the dialogue would still have been pretty low on the interest meter.  Lines like 'find him!', 'Kill him!', 'find him, then kill him!' etc. are fine once in a while during a film, but every 10th line is pushing it a little.The film is also exceptionally dark.  I do understand that vampires have some issues with sunlight, but could they not afford lightbulbs?  There could have been some really interesting stuff going on in there, but it just couldn't be seen.They also seem to have skipped on some parts of vampire lore, specifically the whole 'no reflection' thing.  Supposedly, one of the ways to tell a vampire is that they cast no reflection in a mirror, yet at several points in Underworld, we see vampires clearly reflected.Although the film had a couple of good ideas (the customised ammo each side carries, for example), its only real 'selling point', such as it is, is the prospect of seeing a nice lady in a tight outfit (which even for me is not quite enough).  Granted, many people said the same about Charlies' Angels, but at least they managed to include a plot.Best avoided.",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
The Italian Job," Not too bad
","When I first heard of this remake, I was sure it was going to be awful, and that it would never live up to the Michael Caine original.As it happens, there's not much living up to do, since it bears so little resemblance to the original that directly comparing the two would make no sense.  There are one or two points which can be compared (and I will get to them), but other than that, this film can quite easily be considered by itself.The first comparable point (which is quite minor, really), is the characters.  Yes, Mr. Bridger and Charlie Croker have the same names as the original characters, but that is where their similarities end.  Please, if you're doing a film with the same title and same character names, make the characters at least similar.The bulk of the film is very enjoyable- a heist is pulled off rather successfully, one partner double crosses the others, and things kick off when the cheated partners go out for revenge.It has casing jobs, safe-cracking, breaking in and a couple of great getaways- all the ingredients of a good heist film.Unfortunately, it has one thing that heist movies do not need- emotional ties.  What is it with Hollywood these days, that means that every film needs to have some kind of personal reason for things happening?  Why couldn't they just make a heist film about a group of thieves trying to steal gold because it's there, rather than because it was taken by someone who killed your dad / friend / brother / favourite poodle?So... the ties are set up, the heist is planned and pulled off, and they make their getaway.  This is where the second comparison comes in.  The original film featured a very long race through underground shopping centres, down church steps, over roofs, all to avoid a traffic jam.  Whilst this new film features cars racing down steps, and through tunnels, it's very obviously a case of 'fans will expect this, so we'll put it in', as there's very little of it, and it does to some extent seem tacked on.Admittedly, this section of the film did please me a little bit, in that Croker says 'let's do it like The Italian Job'.  Although his reference to the characters is referring to the job pulled in the film's opening, it also seemed to be a nod to the original as this section did bear the most similarity to its namesake.Overall, I quite liked The Italian Job.  It did have some flaws, but then it had some great moments.  I found it very enjoyable to watch, and would advise others to see it.",Null,1,2,20 September 2003
