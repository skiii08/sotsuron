Mission: Impossible III," guess that accent?
","just watched film and I have to ask can any one please tell me the accent that Jonathan Rhys Meyers' was doing? For the reason that I could not understand if he was Scottish, Irish or English. why did the canister roll so quickly? good film though! Enjoyed Simon Peggs performance very much. Nice amount of action, though agree with other people when they say too much of Tom Cruise(even though his film,but there are other people besides him) Whats with the face mask Mr cruise wears when he gets captured? Though would it of been a better film if he died in the end? Also the fact that at the end ,he got told that he had only 4 minutes to live, I think he was running around fighting and talking to his wife for way over 4 minutes.",7,0,0,27 November 2006
