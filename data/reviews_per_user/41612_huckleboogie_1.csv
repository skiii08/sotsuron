Alien 3," not that bad, c'mon!
","while i admit there's some weak points in the movie and that it surely won't equal ALIEN, i don't understand most of the complaints here.... too depressing....was ALIEN uplifting???? thats exactly what i like bout the movie. the dark mood and the missing happy end! no characters You care for? can't tell them apart? well i cared for the characters in ALIEN but the marines in ALIENS: i neither cared for them (with some exceptions), nor could i tell them apart! plus i like the idea of one Alien versus a bunch of people only armed with fire far more than the concept of ALIENS, dozens of aliens against heavy firearms. after ALIEN, this is my favorite of the four movies.",8,3,63,3 February 2009
