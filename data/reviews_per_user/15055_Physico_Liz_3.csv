50 First Dates," Wonderful Movie,
","I loved it. It had just the right amount of romance, and Rob Schnider was a great piece to this film. VERY unexpected ending. I honestly thought that Lucy(Barrymore) would find some way to get her memory back and she and Henry(Sandler) would live happily ever after, and blah, blah. But that wasn't how it ended and it was great.The acting was absolutely breath-taking. Everyone did a wonderful job doing this movie, and it is clear that a lot of hard work was put in to the making of this movie.The small flair of drama was also a good addition to the movie. Of all those types of film's they did the perfect mix of them. I was very, very, impressed with this movie altogether. I think that this is the best movie that Adam Sandler has done so far.If you have not yet seen this movie yet, than take your freakin' eyes off this computer screen and go see it. You will not regret it.-Elizabeth",9,0,0,27 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I really recommend this movie if you are into fantisy...or if you hate fantist...try it!
","Seeing this movie was one of the best things that I have ever done! I was never into fantisy...and I am not now...but seeing LOTR made me giggle, gasp, and cry. I love that movie!I really recommend this movie for people really into fantisy...and for people who hate it! This movie will sweep you off your feet and leave you begging for more.
My favroite part in this movie was the Council of Elrond. That is the place where alot of the characters were introduced...and in that council, you also got to see how they were as a person. And for me, That is a big deal.The part that made me cry was the part where Frodo wanted to go to Mordor alone and Sam risked his life to go after him, and when he made his speech about keeping his promise, I lost it. Because for some reason, that means alot to me.
I also like the way they put, Drama, action, and comedy all in one movie so easly. I hope to see LOTR still a good popular movie in the next generation to generation.-Elizabeth",9,1,2,11 May 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Funny, amusing, basically altogether entertaining.
","This movie is by far better than the old one. Much more funny, and much more fun to sit there and watch. I really liked this movie. These are one of those movies where I think that the sequel will be just as good as the first, if not, better.They did a wonderful job picking out the cast for this film. All fit their roles perfectly and did a wonderful job and seemed to have really got into their role, something I don't see very many actors do.I love how that this movie, it makes you root for the criminals. The ones that are considers the Protagionists in this movie are all thieves and basically criminals. And one of them has even been in prison. But you find yourself hoping that they succeed in robing a casino and that the $160,000,000 will end up in their possession.I will tell you also that this is also one of those movies that I don't get tired of watching over and over. Every time I put this film into my DVD player, I get excited and I very much look forward to watching it. This Film was a fabulous production in the movie industry and I look forward to seeing the next one.-Elizabeth",10,0,0,27 December 2004
