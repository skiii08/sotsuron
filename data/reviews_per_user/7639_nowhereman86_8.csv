Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Sad Attempt At A Western
","Shhh. Do you hear that? It's Sergio Leone rolling over in his Italian grave. Poor guy. He didn't know that years after his death some video store clerk turned director would completely rip-off the sty lings of his ever so popular movies. Well he might not be able to protest, but I sure can. 'Volume 2' is one of the biggest rip-off's I have ever seen(closely followed by 'Volume 1'). I used to respect Tarantino until I saw the movies that inspired him. After watching this film again, I think that someone should call the studio and file a copyright suite! 'Volume 2' was full of corny dialog and ridiculous action. It's almost like Quentin was trying too hard. I would recommend this movie to a thirteen year old boy who doesn't have the patience to sit through any Kurosawa or Leone films because they are too 'long' or don't have enough 'action' or not enough 'cool one-liners'.",7,2,6,10 July 2005
United 93," More of a reminder...
","I think this movie would have been better described as a documentary. It wastes no time building characters or telling individual stories, but cuts right to the punch. I like to think that the main purpose of this movie will be to serve as a reminder as to what happened on September 11. I can only speak for myself when I say that the horror of that day has been largely forgotten. I walked into this movie having a vague memory of what happened five years ago. I left it with the same feelings of utter sadness that I experienced that morning. I highly recommend skipping this film if you're in no mood to be depressed. Overall, it was well done and accurate. The only complaints I could muster about anything in this film would be the constant use of hand-held cameras due to how nauseating it can get overtime; however, I fully understand how this adds to the real life feel of the film and is a minor detail in the scheme of things.",8,2,8,29 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," A Video Game Or A Movie?
","Poor Sam Rami. I guess he got dropped on his head as a child. I say this because it is obvious that he has some brain damage after watching Spider Man 2. Did he think that the CGI effects in this movie looked good? Is it possible? Because when I watched it, I had to check the back of my ticket to make sure I hadn't been admitted to 'Spider Man: The Game'! What is the matter with using live 'actors' instead of computer graphics. Oh, oh and I almost forgot about those things called 'sets' and 'locations'. Since when has it been okay to throw scene after scene of CG effects into a movie and call it 'action'. Yeah I guess it's action. If action is watching your little brother play Nintendo. Not to mention that it is BASED OF A COMIC BOOK! I don't know what the obsession is with comic book movies lately, but I don't see it. Maybe I should just go back to playing video games.",3,0,1,10 July 2005
Ed Wood," Tim Burton & Johnny Depp's Best
","I thought this movie was overall very good. It's one of those movies that you have to 'get in to'. The thing that makes it ten times better is watching the Ed Wood movies themselves. They did an excellent job at recreating the sets and matching the dialog. I'd say that this film was arguably Tim Burton's best. 'Big Fish' was good, but it didn't have the Tim Burton style. 'Edward Siccorhands' had a little too much Tim Burton style, but that didn't detract from the film at all. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion. If you're more into a story and character driven movie, this is definitely for you. If you like cheap action and cheap laughs, don't watch this film.",7,2,2,26 July 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," What A Rip-Off
","I used to adore this film. If you would have asked me six-months ago, I would have given this movie a 10. Then I got educated. After watching films by Akira Kurosawa the lines in this movie became almost laughable. I can picture Quentin pounding his fists on the coffee-table screaming 'I wanna make a samurai movie!!'. Kurosawa's films had a certain nobility to them, which is sadly something that Quentin has yet to master. I think the problem was that he tried to hard to replicate the 'cool' feeling of 'Pulp Fiction'. The redeeming thing about this movie is that it almost feels original. Only in a few spots did I roll my eyes at his corny dialog. Lucky for me, I hadn't seen the stinking pile of garbage that became known as 'Volume 2' yet.",7,1,3,10 July 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Good Intentions
","I'd like to state first that I liked this movie. It just had a few minor issues. For some reason, Tim Burton has a sick fetish with Johnny Depp. He has now been cast in a leading role in one fourth of Tim Burtons films. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that. I loved him in 'Ed Wood' and thought he was perfect in 'Edward Scissorhands'. But he went too far this time. Johnny Depp is not what I would call a 'comic' actor. His little one-liners began to annoy me about half-way through the film. I don't know if they were trying to capture the magic that Gene Wilder had in the original, but I think they failed miserably. I really have no other complaints besides that. I just wish Tim Burton would stop thinking that it is a requirement to have Johnny Depp in his movies for them to be good.",5,0,1,17 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Could you waste a little more money?
","I can almost see Steven Spielberg rubbing his greedy little hands together. 'I knew that America would fall for the old special effects/ Tom Cruise trick. Ha ha ha!' Don't get me wrong, I love 'Minority Report'. I own it. But this was a sad excuse to fart around with CGI. The story was SO WEAK! I guess Tom Cruise just thinks every movie set that's graced with his presence is pure gold. Wrong. And I am actually starting to feel sorry for Steven Spielberg. He used to be an amazing director. It's of his own doing though. Maybe if he went back to putting TIME into his films instead of MONEY. Or even better yet, maybe if he stopped trying to please everyone with these big Hollywood blockbusters and went back to worrying about the film more than the box office revenues. Just maybe...",1,3,6,10 July 2005
Sin City," It's A Good Comic Book Movie.... So What??!
","Listen, I was never into comic books, so maybe I just don't understand this like I should. People say this movie is so good because it 'captures the feel of a comic book'. SO WHAT?!! I could capture the feel of garbage on film, but I don't think that many people would be running to the box-office (except maybe garbage-men). The only reason this film is rated so high is because people that are OBSESSED with comic books WORSHIP it. It pulls it off so well because it is so unbelievable corny. Last time I checked 'X-Men' wasn't up for a Pulitzer Prize. The funny thing is, the only people that respect comic books are the people that read them. Everyone else views them as juvenile. I mean come on! Can't you people strive for something a little deeper! Why not praise a film for trying to capture the 'feel' of a 'book'? I know that they don't have all the cool pictures in them, but they are still pretty good. Stand back and look at it. What kind of emotions did the stories in this film try to evoke? What 'hard hitting' topics did it tackle? What 'undisputable truths' did it state? If your having trouble finding them, it's because they don't exist. The only thing this film was trying to do is look 'cool' and give some nerdy comic book teenagers new catch-phrases to spew at each other.",5,2,4,10 July 2005
