Black Swan," Overrated
","I can already see that most reviewers won't agree, but: this movie is overrated in my opinion.I will just briefly say: the actors are really good, so is the camera and artwork and yes, the characters do represent some interesting psychologic constellations.But overall nothing about it seems brilliant (except perhaps for camera and artwork, which create a very tense atmosphere): the characters portrayed, a girl who cannot realize an own sexual identity and has to pay for preventing her mothers career by being born; a mother who has given up on life since she failed to become a ballerina and now makes her daughter suffer for her loss while at the same time, lives through her and forces the daughter to live her mother's lost dream. All of this has been portrayed before and much better. There is no 'beyond' this in the movie, the rest is exploration of the scenario with endless 'thrills for entertainment'. Neither does the lucid nightmare portray ballet, nor the music, nor the characters in a credible way. One can accept the hallucinative horror episodes as some surrealistic form of storytelling, but the very bold symbolism they incorporate makes it just less credible and nowhere deeper.Afterall the movie works somewhat similar as any teeny slasher: shocks for entertainment.",7,6,11,31 January 2011
Fight Club," One of the best movies ever made
","Long ago I saw Fight Club for the first time. Back then it was so precisely showing all that I felt about modern society, and a lot more, it just seemed like a divine revelation. I can hardly say how much and what it gave to me, but the closest word to describe it would be 'hope'.Usually as time goes by, your point of few changes, you get into other roles in life and tend to distance yourself from turbulent times in the past. But looking back today, I have to realize, that although many things have changed, Fight Club is still what it was:Not only can I still identify with its extreme criticism, not only is it still a uniquely deep and perfectly done movie, it still stands all alone, more alone then ever perhaps, with all it has said. Brad Pitt playing Tyler Durden has remained one of the best performances ever given - just like Edward Norton as anonymous main character of the movie. Norton portraying the 'normal', sick life standard of modern societies, contrasting himself to and finding himself in Tyler Durden, the anarchistic mythical creature living in and from the idea of the portrayed life standard itself. (think of the plot at this point)The movie's portrayal of our lifes is at least a strong call for realism towards our roles in a capitalistic world, which - in the terms of globalization for example - has never seemed more unheard. And this is exactly what makes Fight Club's devastating, anarchistic point of few so highly legitimate. In the end everything is subject of interpretation, as this subversive masterpiece has put every piece of even itself into a context highly ambivalent - consciously avoiding any constructive criticism.Many have associated this movie with a Generation of people identifying with it. Looking back many years later, this is still true - with one addition: It is clearly going to be more then one generation.",10,0,3,8 October 2007
The Doors," No one is getting out of here alive!
","What an incredible piece of art! The Doors is without doubt the most underrated movie I have seen so far. Given that it is dealing with a character of which almost everybody already has a picture of his own, this might not be a surprise. It is a surprise though, how poorly the movie's message seems to have been accepted.What Oliver Stone has done here, is not an accurate portrayal of Jim Morrison or the Doors. Instead he has created something far more valuable: An extremely deep insight into the work of the Doors, but mostly Jim Morrison. You have to understand this movie as a fusion of Jim Morrison and his art, as a portrayal of his life from the perspective of the artist.This does not mean the movie is portraying something imaginary, which never existed like this. Jim Morrison WAS like this, just he was not like this for most of the time or for most of the people around him. So you could ask, why making a movie from a perspective, why portraying a side, that for most does only cover a small piece of reality? The answer is simple: Because this piece is the one that persisted, the one that will persist. And that is not by accident, it is because this is the most fascinating and deepest picture Jim Morrison has left for others to explore.The idea of having only a short moment to live, the idea of putting all your passion and all your anger into this moment - at the same time being desperately in search for a way to forget, to bear this fate. The life on the edge of death, in a world of beauty and pain - the desperate attempt to squeeze out every feeling just possible from your given moments, before everything is over. Giving away everything, in the light of the insight that you won't be able to hold tight anything - being delivered to death: 'You have seen This entertainment through and through. You've seen your birth, your life and death; You might recall all of the rest...'If you now go into criticizing and analyzing this attitude, for good reasons for sure, stop for a moment and imagine:I am the lizard king - I can do anything!",10,4,6,8 March 2007
Empire of the Sun," Beautiful journey
","Empire of the sun is the second most underrated movie I have ever seen - right after Oliver Stone's 'The Doors'. Furthermore it is perhaps the best movie Steven Spielberg has done. Just like with 'The Doors', you have to keep wondering why it has been accepted so poorly.In the end whether you like this movie or not, goes back to the question of how you think about its perspective on the events of WW2 in the 'Empire of the sun'. Some people might not even have consciously noticed that the emotional perspective of the movie is purely guided by a child's few but felt just uncomfortable about its lack of realism - and those who did consciously notice, might have neglected it merely for the fact itself.As defense those who did like the movie have pointed out the deep symbolism, others have for good reason referred to its uniquely beautiful imagery. But there is something far more valuable about this movie: It is just the perspective mentioned above. What you may notice as beauty inside this movie, what others may have felt irritated about, is just its emotional point of few, which seems 'out of this world' in the true sense of the word. In a child's mind everything you see gets a meaning different of what we are used to and often shines bright for seemingly no reason. Like this the time in an internment camp can seem like a joyful adventure, while life's disappointments can easily break your world. Like this the borders between the sides might blur as well as between right or wrong. And like this you will finally see, and have to see, the absurdity of the witnessed events, of the war itself.Like this and only like this, the movie develops a slow and highly surreal maelstrom of narration, which together with breath taking images might seem almost meditative. A seldom experience of a movie!",9,5,11,30 September 2007
Apocalypse Now," An incredible masterpiece
","If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, you missed one of the deepest experiences that a movie could provide. This movie is about war, about politics, about the beauty and the horror, about the human nature in itself. Many have written extensively about it, so I will rather comment on one certain issue:The Redux version:Whilst there exist almost only negative comments about it, I think it is even better then the original. The Redux version has been released many years after the original and contains 49 minutes of new footage (taken from the original materials). Coppola explained, he felt the necessity of making this version. Mainly for the fact, that the original version was cut in an atmosphere of extreme pressure and desperation (read about the making if you don't know why). They cut the huge amounts of material to some simple format, leaving out scene after scene in the desperate attempt to make sense of something that could not make one certain sense. The Redux version was meant to give the original some of the hectically cut out footage back.The new scenes contain nothing that would change the story or meaning of the old movie, instead they either continue the story parts in more details or open up completely new scenes. There is the continuation of the famous Playmate scene for example, showing the perversion and insanity that briefly shines through in the original when the soldiers are heading for the playmate stage. The logical continuation takes place when Captain Willard and company meet the playmates stranded further up the river, being delivered to their goodwill.Then there are some small additions, like a really intense close up of Marlon Brando, whose acting in this movie is legendary! You will hardly find anything to criticize about these small additions, you could perhaps argue about the changes in background music, but this is mainly a question of individual taste, since the spirit of the music did hardly change. Its still a psychedelic mix of synthesizer sounds and music by the doors.Now other things, like the rather infamous scene on the French plantation, leave more room for debates. This scene, which was completely left out from the original, opens up a new story part, taking place on a French plantation. In my opinion, this scene added much to the movie's atmosphere, fitting perfectly into its beautiful psychedelic style. Also it was making even clearer that this movie is not simply about war: 'There are two of you, don't you see ? One that kills and one that loves.' This is exactly general Kurtz's dilemma: being caught in a world of insane double morality, looking for a way to find a 'true' way of acting, Kurtz finally decides to break out by choosing his role as murder, by abandoning the role of jurisdiction in his (a)moral world. At the same time this sentence points to an even deeper conflict inside human nature or the world itsself: The existence of unimaginable horror and beauty next to each other. The desperate situation everyone faces who gets to see both. Overall, the new scenes do not contain anything that would really change the old movie (whilst there was hardly anything removed from it), whilst in my opinion they add much to it. The movie is longer, it has an even more epic character and becomes an even more breath taking psychedelic trip trough the dark corners of human nature and morality. If you really hate the Redux version, ask yourself why exactly. I think it is pure perfection, as long as you don't judge it simply for the fact that it is a changed version of one of the best movies ever made. Enjoy.",10,4,5,5 March 2006
Hero," Beyond images and words
","'Hero' was one of the movies I liked from the first minute watching it. Although it has some ideas and characterizations I would generally dislike it has left some deep impressions - in some sense it gives you insight into something hardly reachable by images and words:Looking at the portrayal of the characters, one could find them superficial and hardly realistic. Most of them are exceedingly over glorified - as the English title already says, they are partly portrayed only as 'Hero's', with almost no further dimensions. The story and the events lack any realism at all - one is obviously watching a fairy tale.And at this point you have to accept all those clichés as the means of any fairy tale - and remember that they serve telling an allegory. Otherwise you will miss the quintessence: This movie gives insight into something beyond images and words, a state of mind you probably can only experience. The state in which everything goes with ease and your actions seem to be guided by an inner flow. And this is what you could probably try to call it today, the state of 'flow'.The unspeakably beautiful images serve this and every other aspect of the movie, making it not at last one of the most marvelous fairy tales ever told.As far as for political dimensions, I for my part haven't noticed them when watching the movie - but of course if you apply the fairy tale's ending on todays china and its people - which I do not find entirely convincing - you will get a horrible message.",8,2,2,30 September 2007
Blade Runner," All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.
","Blade Runner is one of the really great movies of the past century. It has for good reasons remained one of the most cited examples for critics. Most of all, Blade Runner is the visually most captivating Sci-Fi movie of all times. Its' dark, haunting vision of an apocalyptic post industrial world can even today easily compete with special effect loaded CGI movies. The rich, sinister pictures wrapped in lurid neon light create an atmosphere which pulls you deeper and deeper into the melancholic, monstrous world of Blade Runner. The music, the pictures and the deeply symbolic story create an unmatched, intense atmosphere, that has inspired countless other movies and generations of directors.The rich story touches not only some of the deepest of human emotions, fears and hopes alike, but raises plenty of philosophical questions concerning the strive for an identity and moral integrity - and the sense in any life that is delivered to death. Roy Batty's quest for survival throws his counterpart, Rick Deckard back to a haunting uncertainty in every single of the concepts of his life: He has to face the insane amorality of his life in an amoral world, has to question the fundamentals of his identity as a human being and finally faces the tragedy of death by gaining a deep insight into Roy Betty's world just at the moment of its' demise. In the last moments of his existence, Roy takes a deep look at his shining but all to brief lifetime and finally comes to see: 'All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.' The way how Deckard lives through this fundamental, existentialistic crisis could easily be compared to Beckett's 'Godot' or Camus' 'Sisyphus'. And just like these characters, the story refuses to give an answer or non-ambiguous solution. It leaves you with questions to think about for a lifetime.A haunting and dark, but highly rewarding journey into a fictional world, with all too real references, that is not easily swallowed or digested. But if you should try to do so, you will be working on tightening the fundamentals of your life - or just enjoy a unique trip through the corners of your mind. Bon voyage!",10,0,1,7 June 2008
