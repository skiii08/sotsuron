It," Bad taste
","While entertaining, this film ceases to evoke any real emotion of fear or thrill. It naively sojourns on disgust and dantesque produced by disgust. While having the opportunity to mourn and elaborate an essay on the relative meaning of fear, totally passes by and ignores the whole motif of the concept 'it'. Cinematography was rather good Chung Chung-Hoon never disappoints on the depiction of scenes but direction may not have exploited the full potential of a remake. Diverging from the unfruitful comparisons with the original film we may conclude that as a stand-alone film it disappointed horror genre itself.",3,2,7,16 September 2017
