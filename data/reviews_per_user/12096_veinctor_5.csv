The Lobster," eww no. an absurd, disturbing allegory where nothign makes much sense.
","As a movie, it's slow. As a story is absurd. As a sci-fi, it's weak, as nothing really is explained or makes sense. As a comedy, there are no jokes and if anything, it was disturbing. Yes it's supposed to be an allegory, but come on. Nothing makes sense.",3,0,0,21 June 2020
The Prestige," The awesome hidden truth!
","The whole movie is a massive magic trick and it deserves a second viewing just to comprehend the whole thing, which seems to be a constant thing regarding Nolan's movies.The movie is about two magicians (Bale and Jackman) who compete with each other as to who has the best trick, escalating to insanely extreme situations. Bale's biggest trick for example was that he had a twin brother and they swapped places the whole time! The twins went as far as cutting one's finger to match his twin brother. This was pretty awesome, especially if you know that real life magicians have gone to similar lengths. James Randy for example used to carry a piece of paper in his pocket for years. That piece of paper had 'today's' date on it, saying that 'today I will die'. If he had a fatal accident, would you believe that he predicted his own death or that he wrote a piece of paper each day for years?! Talking about devotion! The movie explores that devotion and the sacrifices someone must do to deceive others. But the greatest deception of the movie was fooling the audience itself! The movie is very realistic but the explanation about the cloning machine was not something I could accept, so I looked around to see what other people thought about the ending. In my research pretty much everyone was agreeing with the explanation given, that Tesla gave Jackman a cloning machine, and Jackman in his every act kills one of his clones (or dies himself). That's pretty awesome and the audience bought it. But it's a lie nobody really saw! Michael Cain gives the secret 10 minutes before the end. Earlier he told a story about a sailor but he reveals now that the story was a lie. This is a hint that Jackman's story was also a lie, and Bale and the audience bought it.Cain tells the audience in the end that you don't want to know what happened, you want to be fooled. So what happened? Over the course of the movie, many bad things happen. Bale kills Jackman's wife and Jackman shoots Bale's fingers. Bale takes Johansson to his side, manipulates Root (Jackman's double) and humiliates Jackman on stage while braking his leg. Jackman kidnaps and buries Bale's friend to blackmail him for his secret. The secret was planned and Bale sends Jackman to a wild goose chase to America. There, Tesla fools Jackman with some hats and some cats to get away with the money.Jackman returns the favor by giving a fake diary to the imprisoned Bale. Everything regarding Tesla's machine, is only known from Jackman's diary. And knowing that Bale lied in his diary, then surely Jackman lied in his as well.So to wrap this up. Jackman was obsessed to find Bale's secret and it was only revealed to him in his last breath. The Tesla story was a lie and the machine never worked (that would be completely unrealistic, even for Tesla), but Jackman used it in his favor. Jackman used and killed Root to frame Bale. Bale dies, but his twin brother takes revenge by shooting Jackman.Almost perfect score because it fooled almost everyone!",8,2,2,18 October 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Loved it but I got a few complains
","Not a fan of Marvel but I loved this movie. Here's my complains in this almost flawless animation:I wish I could see more of the secondary spiderman characters. In the 2 hours of animation I didnt got to know the Noir guy, the anime chick and the pig toon.Plothole: Kingpin's plan would fail since bringing Vanessa from another dimension would kill her eventually, just like all Spidermen would die because of the glitches.Ex-machina: In all that multi-dimensional chaos, the flip of a magic switch fixes everything.The philosophy of the movie is that 'everyone can be Spiderman'. Unless you get bitten by a super-spider, this statement is wrong and misleading.",8,1,5,21 February 2019
Wonder Woman," So many questions and plot holes!
","I wished for this movie to be great because I like the DC universe. Nice action, nice effects but the story.... If the movie is divided in 3 parts, the beginning the middle and the end, the middle part was good. The other two parts suffer greatly.I get it, they want to create some kind of new mythology, a powerful origins story. But in the process they create so many problems! Where do I start? Diana as a kid Jumps off a cliff and her mother catches her just because she happened to be there. Would she die otherwise? Why did she jumped anyways? It seemed like something very casual without any seriousness. I have no idea what was the point of that scene.We don't know what Diana's bracelets are or do... why they repel bullets? Why she needs a shield if she has the bracelets? You don't know how long it takes for Diana to grow up (which in turn would explain why she hasn't grow old since 1945). The director said that Diana is 3000 years old but that doesn't show in the movie at all. Then.. why she grow up anyways, she is made of clay! Well, OK she is not made of clay as it is revealed, but why lie to your daughter for 3000 years? (that would make sense if Ares was Dianas father).We don't know where the island is... the hero is English, he was fighting Germans and they get to England by boat in a day! The amazons are training for millennia, but they have no traps at the beach for any intruders! The Amazons fight the Germans just because a stranger told them that they are the bad guys. The Amazons are not getting old, so they are immortal? Then why some are older than others? And if they are immortal but they can die.. then what the difference between them and the Gods, who also died? And between immortal Amazons and Gods, why is Diana special? Diana's super powers such as flying, is not explained at all. What are the origins of the lasso? Why the Amazons were isolated on an island if they were destined to bring balance to the world? And how they learn the thousands of different modern languages that they speak if they never left the island in thousands of years? And if they know so many languages, then how come they don't know what Germans are? Why the Amazons hide? Why there are no men in the island? And what her mom said, that 'the more she knows, the faster Ares will find her' that makes no sense at all. Also, Diana's mom trying to shield her from training made no sense, because in that island everyone learns to fight and Diana's destiny was to kill Ares and that's why she was created. So that was just forced drama and tension between Diana's mom and her sister. And then suddenly Diana's mom goes from one extreme to the other, making Diana to train 10 times more than anyone else. Everyone has an extreme viewpoint in this movie.How did Ares killed all the Gods? the Greek Gods were dozens, surely someone would notice that someone murders Gods and they would find out who is the killer. If Anything, Ares would be the prime suspect, as opposed to Hestia for example. Most of the other Gods were Ares family and it's not justified why Ares kills his family.Also, since they are Gods, how come they don't know that Ares is on to something? How come Athena the Goddess of Wisdom didn't know about any of that? Also who makes those rules about 'only Gods can kill Gods'? How did the Gods were created? Nothing of real importance is explained.Ares had the face of a drunk farmer. No offense to the actor or the drunk farmers, but that was not the face of an epic war-God. It would be redeeming if he had another 'true' face in his final form, but nah. The Wonder Woman cartoon movie and Xena had much better Ares. A better plot would be Ares convincing Diana that he is a good guy and make her question her beliefs.Then Ares says that he didn't make men fight, he only provided the weapons, which doesn't make sense because according to Greek myths, Hephaestus made the weapons. Even if Ares only provided the weapons, then his appearance there and killing all the Gods was meaningless! Ares here had no real philosophy and his death didn't change the world at all.How is it possible for the God of war to lose to a woman that only got out of her island like 5 days ago? That makes him a complete loser. Ares has the power to melt swords, he can teleport, he can telepathically move objects, and yet Diana suddenly has super magical speed and wins. Ares could easily teleport away from that final explosion. The final battle had no stakes either: they were both immortals with superpowers. If Diana died, nothing would change because we are like that even now. If Ares only gives us weapons, then why Diana fights him instead of humanity itself? They only fought only to kill each other.The message of the movie was pointless. Diana said that love wins all but... she didn't win with love but with force and killing. Every singe one of her battles. The movie would have a better meaning if there was no Ares and human made the wars on their own and Diana could help with that. If anything, blaming a fictional figure for a real war may sound like mocking the people who actually died in that war.",5,4,11,17 October 2017
Annihilation," I never thought I would give a movie 1 star!
","Some random internet guy suggested this as a good movie. So I went for it.It starts well. Decent cast, decent mystery, and even the biology lessons in the beginning were pretty accurate. I can buy that a weird energy blanket expands and it's about to consume everything. Sure, soldiers and drones sucked into it never return. Interesting premise.And then the nonsense starts. The military keeps secret that world ending threat (for no good reason) instead of sharing it with the scientific community. 5 women get there without protection suits and masks. The 'blanket' is just for show, it's immaterial and anyone can get in and out without problems, so telling us that nobody ever returns is a lie. Helicopters could get in without problem and yet, these women have to walk for 8 days to get to the center.The movie trolls you with irrelevant flashbacks just after chapter titles invade your screen. Instead of the women going back to report what they found, they just keep going further. There are many ways to solve the radio signals goign out of that blanket. Try wires for example! The whole procedure is very amateurish for a world-end scenario. They dont even leave a trail behind them.It's laughable that they have maps but they dont know where they are going even though there are distinct landmarks, like lakes and houses. They dont even have clocks and calendars, so they need to count their food to know how many days are in there. They know that nature is messed up and yet they touch contaminated water and they never do anything smart. I'm not a smart scientist as them but it took them 8 days to figure out the problem that it was obvious from the first 30 minutes!In the end, they whole story could end withing hours, if anyone with a helicopter could go in there and throw a grenade into a hole. And as silly story have it, if you kill the source who caused all evil, then everything wrong returns to normal. Just like that SouthPark episode where they had to kill the original zombi to save everyone else. Only this movie wasnt trying to be satirical.Needless to say, even the title is misleading, since there is no annihilation, just the threat of it. Just like in Geostorm.",1,6,10,15 June 2018
