The Longest Yard," Don't Worry Fellas I Didn't Spill My Beer
","I'm a big fan of most Sandler movies and this one proves to meet the expectations. I laughed very hard watching this movie and i like the fact that some of the actors from the original 'Longest Yard'. Such as when Paul Crewe goes to see the warden while he is golfing, the old head guard is there as a friend of the warden. Also Burt Renolds coming back to be the coach was a pleasant surprise.Although I feel that this movie is not as good as the original due to the PG-13 rating but the extensive cast and the crazy antiques of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock make this movie a must see. If you are in need of a good laugh then this movie is for you. I spent a good amount of time laughing at this movie and the incredibly sarcastic out look of Adam Sandler.",7,0,2,15 August 2006
Wayne's World," She's magically babelicious
","This movie is filmed with a classic Mike Myers style, with the silly humor that is still utterly hysterical. Dana Carvey and Mike Do an excellent job in their roles and really make a movie worth seeing.Despite the sometimes over the top style of humor, with the incredibly long subtitles when Wayne and Casandra are speaking another language. It is a very similar style to that of Mike's other more well known works, The Austin Powers series.This movie is a very light movie to watch and cause not hard laughs but a bunch of giggles and puts you into a happy mood. This is a good movie for a rainy depressing day and the soundtrack won me over because the music they play is a solid choice.So its Wayne's World! Party Time! Excellent!",8,0,1,15 August 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," I'm not quite dead yet
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a true stroke of genius from that of the python crew. All of the python crew are able to play many different roles with ease, including that of women, which adds a sense of great humor to the movie. This is British humor at its greatest. It is a silly slapstick type of humor, but words do not express what the movie is like. It is an experience on must have for themself. Whether or not you will enjoy its a whole different story because Monty Python is an acquired taste, where it is either loved or hated by the viewer, there is almost no middle ground. When watching the movie i suggest that it is watched in a controlled environment where there is as little noise as possible due thehard to hear voices. If this movie is liked i strongly suggest the pythons 'Life of Brian'.",9,1,2,13 August 2006
Sin City," He Talks. They All Talk
","This is a classic example of Quentin Tarantino at his best although he is only a special guest director I can see the same filming style. It is a similar style to that of 'Pulp Fiction'. There are three stories told within one movie, and like in most Tarantino each character is somehow involved or seen in each other's stories.In 'Sin City' you get to know each character through their inner dialog, making it all the more intricate and it has a much better effect than when the character speaks aloud.You learn to love the people in the movie even when they have done something wrong because you learn about how each character really feels. Also the movie is filmed in black and white, but there are things occasionally filmed in color that add a really awesome effect to the movie. Such as the blue eyes of Kevin, while everything is black and white, his eyes are blue which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.This movie I highly recommend and think that it is an amazing movie and I look forward to the sequel.",10,0,1,15 August 2006
