Casablanca," Significant meaning exist here
","Rick Blaine needs to make a choice. Will he stay on the sidelines and play turn a blind eye or will he pick a side? Such was the question for the United States of America before Pearl Harbor. I thought the film had a Noir feel to it. The movie was somewhat predictable, but well done and also an interesting concept and I liked the underlying meaning.Humphrey Bogart is very polished in this movie and I thought Ingrid Bergman was superb as well. A story about choices, love, and selflessness, you will gain wisdom from watching this movie. Although not my personal favorite, Casablanca is one of the greats.",7,1,4,10 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Mezmerizing
","One of the most known movies of all time, Citizen Kane by Orson Welles is just a flawless piece of movie making. The cinematography is what makes this film the classic that it is. Orson Welles is known for his unorthodox camera work. Welles manipulates the space on screen in this movie in a beautiful and hypnotizing way. Low angle shots are prevalent in the film, providing a unique spatial effect. Orson Welles used the zoom a lot in Citizen Kane. The story is a flashback of Charles Foster Kane, a millionaire businessman. The movie chronicles his life, and the events that lead to his fall.",8,1,3,10 May 2013

Singin' in the Rain," Sorry, just can't get into it.
","There's just something about musicals that I simply cannot buy into. Something very cheesy about them, but Singing in the Rain is at least watchable. This movie has a cool concept. it's about the transition from silent movies to sound and the problems that arise. Actors/Actresses with unpleasant voices for instance, like Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen, will not be wanted in sound movies. That is the basic story here in this film. Lina Lamont has a horrible high pitched voice that needs to be dubbed out. Kathy Selden, played by the beautiful Debbie Reynolds, is chosen to do the voice over for Lina. Of course things don't go as planned and it culminates in an entertaining ending.",5,5,9,10 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," A true classic
","Pulp Fiction (1994) is the type of film you can see multiple times and still notice new things. The characters are deep and the story is enthralling. Tarantino uses discontinuity editing and the story is told out of order. Each story is told as its own movie and the details of the characters are deep. A movie about a crime boss and his hit men is sure to be filled with violence and Pulp Fiction is no exception. Scenes are murder, kidnapping, and even a homosexual rape appear in the film. Tarantino loves to push the limits and he does so in Pulp Fiction, arguably his best film.",10,1,3,9 May 2013
Psycho," one of the best 'code era' thrillers
","Alfred Hitchcock, One of the most famous names in the industry comes through with a thoughtfully done masterpiece of a thriller here. Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, has just stolen money from her boss. Marion leaves town and is forced to stop at a motel, called the Bates Motel. The The owner of the motel has a weirdo son named Norman. Norman, played by Anthony Perkins, is a loner and a very strange man. Perkins does a great job of creating an eerie feel with Norman, he's just very creepy and you can feel yourself getting lost in the film because of Norman. Of course the famous shower scene is amazing when you think of the Hays Code. Hitchcock did a wonderful job of pushing the limit to create one of the best scenes in movie history.",8,0,0,10 May 2013
