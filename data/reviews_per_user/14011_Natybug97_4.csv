Casablanca," Certain Expectations
","After hearing so much about Casablanca and about how great of a film it was for it's day, I have finally been able to watch it. For a long time it has been on my Movies To Watch list but I've just never had the opportunity or just never got around to it until now, and honestly though it was a good movie, I guess I was expecting more. When you hear about how great a movie is, you have high expectations and you expect those to be met, sadly, this film didn't meet those expectations. The film is a well shot film and the lighting is remarkable how it singles out characters or makes their face look just so, but the story is not necessarily what I expected. I fully expected a sappy romantic movie that you couldn't help but like because the characters were so genuinely in love. Definitely not a man who owns a saloon and is secretly pinning away for a girl that left him at a train station who then pops back into his life very much unannounced and undesired, especially because she is with another man. The story itself is not all bad, don't get me wrong, just not what I was expecting. Though the hero did not end like I would have wanted him to because of his selflessness, he does have a happy ending to a certain degree, and he certainly isn't all that alone in the end. Despite my expectations for the film, it is a rather good film and I would probably watch it again.",8,1,3,8 April 2014
Gone with the Wind," Two Stubborn Fools
","I love this film, I have seen it a handful of times, and even though I am always a little frustrated by the stubborn pride of the two main characters, I can never dislike it. True Scarlet O'Hara is a foolish woman who believes she is madly in love with someone else's husband, but she is just as bad as the proud Rhett Butler who loves her through it all. Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down, and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and it's timelessness. We all love that great, timeless love story despite it's tragic ending, and Scarlet's tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive, even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part. Despite all this, the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed. That is the true power of this film. Aside from being able to enchant it's audiences, Gone With The Wind was truly a groundbreaking film in American Cinema. It was one of the first major films that came out in vividly well-done color, not only that, but the photography was phenomenal also. Much more can be said about this film, but for now, all I will say is this: Fantastic film, worth the 4 hours.",10,10,14,6 May 2014
The Graduate," Not great, but not bad
","I have heard such good things about this classic movie, but I cannot say that I was enraptured by it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with fantastic acting. I just found myself constantly distracted, especially when they have the quick edits of when Ben and Mrs. Robinson get together. Ben and Elaine's romance is also a little far-fetched to me, it seems that after one night with he is completely smitten, and that's fine, but then he decides he is going to stalk her after she left him so that they can get married. I'm not saying that the movie was bad by any means, it was well done with some interesting photography, I personally enjoyed whenever he was in the pool because he always seemed to slip away to another version of reality. I also liked Mrs. Robinson. She was classy and sexy and confident despite all her life mistakes, her character was also very- well executed. The one thing that I did not like at all was the music! The soundtrack that accompanied the movie was definitely not my favorite. The Sounds of Silence and Scarborough Fair? No thanks. Especially the latter.",7,0,1,9 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain
","I absolutely loved this film! The color was so vibrant and it added so much to the film because it helped make things over the top, as only musicals can do. The music was fantastic and the tap dancing (though a little too much at times) was also great! As a choir nerd myself, I love musicals of all kind and I had not seen this, but it was so much fun! I definitely found myself humming some of these tunes later through the week. The story was perfect for a musical, it was lighthearted and fun and you still had a bit of a problem to resolve, but nothing that couldn't be solved with music. The characters were all likable except for the really annoying Lina, played by Jean Hagen, who did a great job. The friendship between Cosmo and Don is palpable and the romance between Don and Kathy is sweet and both of these relationships add to the feel-good feel of the movie as a whole. The humor was also there, and though at times it was a bit cheesy it was part of what made the movie memorable. Perhaps not the best of films in other people's book, but it's a 10 in min.",10,0,2,8 April 2014
