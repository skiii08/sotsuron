Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The critics are all wrong!
","For the past month, it seems, all I've been hearing is how bad this movie is, how disappointing it is, how soulless it is. To these people, I have but two words: 'Shut up!' Star Wars: Episode 1 is absolutely great. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, reveling in the sights and sounds of another universe as only George Lucas can imagine it. The pod race was phenomenal, and the fight between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul is one for the ages. It may be easy to let the massive hype overshadow what's real there, to be sure, but this film is amazing, people, and more than a worthy installment to the series.",8,0,0,19 May 1999
