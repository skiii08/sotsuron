The Devil's Advocate," Classic 90s thriller
",Great horror drama with Pacino and Reeves. Theron was very good too. A one of a kind entertaining thriller. A remake would be interesting.,9,1,3,19 May 2020
Ford v Ferrari," Good film
","An excellent biopic, similar to Rush, it has great racing scenes and cars. Excellent acting and story. I recommend this film.",7,0,1,22 January 2020
Moneyball," I've never watched a baseball game but I love this film
","Great film. I've seen it around 5 times and it's still good. A fascinating look on the game of baseball and how statistics influenced the Oakland A's 20 game win streak. Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt are work great together and there are some great supporting cast too. You don't have to like baseball to love this film, any sports fan can relate.",10,4,5,2 June 2019
First Man," Excellent space scenes
","The film has realistic space action sequences that are really good, the test missions and the moon landing were very interesting and well made. Unfortunately the rest of the film is quite boring, nothing really interesting just filler between missions and this spoils it from being a great film.",6,1,1,27 October 2019
Alien 3," One of the worst films ever made
",Terrible. Why set an alien film on a planet of British skin head prisoners. The story the acting is all bad. The story only kicks in near the end and it's still bad. Skip to resurrection .,1,2,5,2 May 2019
Hereditary," A creepy and unsettling horror
","This isn't a conventional horror, it often in times doesn't make sense, however it is a genuinely creepy film and is a well made horror story. 
It is slow in parts and feels more like a drama sometimes than a horror but if you have the patience you will find it an interesting story.",7,7,13,23 August 2018
Training Day," To protect the sheep you have to catch the wolf
","Classic Denzel film. Many great scenes, quotable dialogue and action. Direction, acting script, music it's all there and is one of the best cop films around.",9,0,0,21 February 2019
Wind River," Long winded river
",A little overrated. Slow and long winded. Good acting performances. Story doesn't pay off. Depressing like the endless snow.,6,0,1,23 September 2018
Darkest Hour," Good film but...
","An excellent and well made film, great set pieces and costumes. Great acting from the cast and cinematography. Only downside not much of a story arc. It would of worked better as TV series or a lengthy biopic but it was a good film non the less.",7,1,2,7 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Below average marvel
","Wasn't too bad it had a good introduction to the character, I didn't like the confusing back story and I thought Jude Law and Annette Bening sucked. Sam Jackson and the age CGI was awesome tho.",6,1,3,24 November 2019
Us," The story never paid off
","Your invested time in this film doesn't pay off, it's not a badly made film it's just a silly unbelievable story. It could of been told a lot better If the plot was improved.",4,4,6,11 February 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Bad Will Ferrell comedy
",You can put this in the not funny Will Ferrell comedy section with semi-pro and zoolander 2.,2,11,25,1 July 2020
Knives Out," The white devil strikes again
",Rich people are evil. Poor immigrants are the salt of the earth. It's an old tale. I thought the mystery would be a lot better given the reviews but it was average and Daniel Craig's accent was really annoying. You stop caring half way through.,5,5,8,18 May 2020
The Irishman," Stop comparing it to Goodfellas and Casino
","If you start watching this film thinking you are going to be watching Goodfellas 2 or Casino 2 you will be disappointed. Just because it is by the same director and stars the same actors doesn't mean it's related. It's a completely different story.
Yes the film is very long. It's about ageing mobsters. Joe Pesci has slowed down in the last 25-30 years. He's not a psychotic murderer like in Goodfellas and Casino because it's a different story. This film is about the acting and the story not the shocking ultra violence.
People are focusing on the CGI, that it's not good enough? I thought it was excellent. De Niro is in his 70s. You can't make him look like a 21 year old man but they did a good job of portraying him in his 30s. Same as Joe Pesci.
Speaking of Joe Pesci any real fan of Goodfellas and Casino will love seeing this guy back on the screen with De Niro. You will never get these two on the screen again, especially with Al Pacino as well. Not to mention one of the best cast films I've seen in years. The type of movie you enjoy watching to recognise some great actors from your favourite shows.
Film fans have trouble watching long films these days and I don't blame them with fast paced big films of the marvel era. You will not get that here but what you will get is a sprawling gangster biopic beautifully shot with amazing actors, script and soundtrack.",9,5,12,28 November 2019
Aquaman," Best water film since water world
",I wasn't too sure about this film until I saw an octopus playing the drums and it certified it as a good movie.,7,1,3,12 February 2020
Deadpool 2," Big disappointment
","You go into this film thinking it will be brilliant. 
It's not. 
1. The jokes are more or less the same 
2. There is no plot 
3. The scenes with Vanessa are really cheesy
4. Why is the bad guy an overweight Aussie teenager? 
This film sucks!!",4,23,60,21 May 2018
Zodiac," A great thriller
","A great thought provoking film that leaves you wanting more of the story. One of David Fincher's best films and definitely most underrated. An excellent cast, particularly Mark Ruffolo and Downey Jr. it's a long film but if you like murder mystery films you will love this.",9,1,1,9 August 2018
The Prestige," Entertaining drama
","An interesting and well acted mystery drama. Great story and characters, plenty of twists and highly enjoyable. The Victorian London setting is excellent.",8,2,3,4 December 2018
Snatch," Classic Guy Ritchie
","A genius gangster comedy caper. Great comedy, memorable dialogue and some solid performances from a wide range of good actors. Keeps you entertained and is never boring. Snatch is a classic.",9,1,2,9 June 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Pretty boring to be honest
","This film was disappointing, it's not that interesting and the pacing is terrible. Nothing really new just the same old stereotypes. It's just boring.",3,0,8,18 May 2019
The Town," Good heist movie
","An excellent robbery film set in Boston. Good acting and story, especially by Jeremy Renner.
Always interesting to see the Irish side of crime instead of the usual mafia movies.",7,2,3,7 October 2018
Elf," Whoop there it is
","Fantastic Xmas film. Silly fun, good story, Will Ferrell is excellent as elf. Some really funny moments there should be Elf 2.",8,1,2,17 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I liked it
","A surprisingly good film to end the trilogy. It was better than The Last Jedi but not as big as The Force Awakens. It's a darker film than it's predecessor and it was great to see Emperor Palpatine. The only downside is that no one really dies in Star Wars, there either dying and get healed or die and come back as a ghost. So I'm thinking the next film could be called Star Wars: N.E.R.D",8,1,8,23 December 2019
Nightcrawler," Great film
","Very interesting film, a cult classic. The guy is a classic psycho like a skinny Patrick Bateman. Some great scenes of L.A too",8,1,2,13 February 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent film
",Rami Malek was excellent in this film. From Mr Robot to Freddie Mercury was very impressive. It had an interesting story and the live aid finaly was brilliant. It really made the film great and you felt like you was there.,7,1,3,9 April 2019
Bird Box," Ye it's not good
",One of those stupid films where there is a mystery but it's unexplained. I thought they stopped making these? They are lame the audience wants and EXPLANATION.,5,0,2,5 January 2019
Split," Too weird for me.
",This film is weird. People may say oh he played it well etc but for me it was too freaky and it doesn't pay off. Not worth the time.,3,0,3,31 July 2018
Rocky IV," Classic rocky
","This film is great it has it all, Rocky,Draco, Creed, even James brown is in it singing. Great fight scenes one of the best ones. It makes you want to watch them all.",9,0,0,21 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not as good as infinity war
",Infinity war had a massive build up and then the disappearance happened. In this they defeat Thanos in 2 minutes like he's nothing? I know he doesn't have the stones but he's still powerful. Then the rest of the film is about time travelling which felt like a cross between interstellar and The Leftovers. There wasn't really any great action scenes. The ready player one type battle at the end was good but apart from that a lot of the scenes were rehashings of old movies. I know there going back in time but I still wanted to see something original and new. It just didn't blow your mind like Infinity War. There's a lot of sob story to it. Very corny too and at 3 hours long it is exhausting. Also one of the least funniest marvel films. The one liners were lame and some fell flat. Basically Infinity War set a bar and this didn't match it. RIP Stan Lee.,6,4,8,5 May 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Crazy film
",An interesting and original drama. Not classic but a solid effort. Dealing with disturbing themes it's not an enjoyable watch but it is a good film.,6,0,0,2 December 2018
Alien vs. Predator," I came for the aliens
",Yes the film is a disappointment and the characters are terrible but to be honest I just like it for the predator and alien scenes. It's always fun to watch these aliens on the screen doing their thing. Check your brain at the door and watch some intergalactic gladiator battles.,5,1,1,11 June 2020
No Country for Old Men," Best Coens movie since Fargo
",Great crime drama. Well made with brilliant acting from all the cast. People complain about story not making sense or the anti-climatic ending but this is a film that shows the true reality of crime and murder. Sometimes there is no happy ending and there is no hero and it's the cold blooded gangster that wins. Great dialogue and key scenes that make it an enjoyable slow burn watch.,9,1,1,30 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Awesome film
","It really was an awesome film. Despite not having a heavy plot it was amazing to see a film so visually stunning. Had everything you expected, the cinematography, the set pieces, the homage to pop culture, the dialogue, the in-jokes. The acting was brilliant and it really captured the 1960's era. The ending was suprising but I really enjoyed it and wish it were true. Also the dog was awesome and deserves an acting award!",10,29,51,16 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Feels like films you've seen before mashed into one
",I had high expectations of this film and it failed to deliver. It felt like I'd seen it before and nothing was new or original. It was a let down.,5,3,6,28 May 2018
22 Jump Street," Not as funny as the first
",The first film 21 jump street is brilliant this is average. It's more or less the same kind of jokes with a plot that's not so good. Channing Tatum isn't funny and neither is his blonde football friend. Schmid's girlfriend isn't really interesting and it doesn't go anywhere. They should do the men in black crossover because that would be a lot better than the new one,6,0,3,10 August 2019
Gran Torino," Great drama
",Excellent film. Clint Eastwood at his best. The acting and story were interesting and well written. It's a simple story but enjoyable with a powerful message. Just as good as million dollar baby.,9,0,0,8 December 2018
1917," Sorry but the film sucked
",This film had some good points such as the cinematography and the set pieces but apart from that it's just two young soldiers who have to pass a message on. No real story arc just following someone pass a message. That's not a story. I'm not rating it highly because it's to do with war. Don't get sucked in. Weak story.,4,3,5,1 April 2020
Donnie Brasco," Forgetaboutit
",An interesting story about an undercover agent infiltrating the mob. Good performances from Pacino and Depp. The film is a little outdated however and could of been better in terms of script but otherwise it's a good watch.,6,1,2,14 June 2020
The Insider," Excellent film
","An interesting and intelligent film that despite its long running time, keeps you engaged in the story. One of the great films of 1999.",7,1,1,21 February 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," The biggest con in cinematic history
",One of the worst films I have ever seen. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up. First 20 minutes are apes jumping around. I thought it was a joke. The second time was worse. It has that stupid waltz song that plays for what seems a good half hour. It is horrible. I now hate this song. The characters are bad. The dialogue is bad. The pacing is bad. The soundtrack is the worst you will ever hear. The story is pointless. It could of been made a lot better. Watch it at your own peril. It will give you a headache. Everyone has heard of this film but not a lot have seen it. The reason why is because no one would recommend this tripe.,1,13,22,1 May 2019
Midsommar," Marmite film
","Very strange film, shocking in parts. Good main actress however. I thought it was incredibly stupid that the visitors didn't realise that something suspicious going on them disappearing one by one. It's also a very bleak? Depressing film. Overall not great.",5,1,4,10 June 2020
The Godfather: Part III," Frustratingly average
","This film had a lot to live up to and it is very good in some parts but ultimately the story doesn't meet expectations. If the film was made in the early 1980's it would of been better because being made in 1990 it had a modern feel to it with the music and the corny dialogue. ( my lucky coat, it's my lucky coat) also the final act in Sicily wasn't great and the worst part was Michael Corleone having a change of heart. It's not the character we know. Part IV should happen.",6,1,2,10 June 2020
Joker," Do you call it miniature golf or just golf?
","The Joker is back and he's great. A great beginning with hopefully more to come. Focusing on acting more than action, it's an enjoyable if not disturbing film and any fan of DC should love this film. It inevitably leaves you wanting more and I look forward to seeing him again. Hahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha haha.",8,1,1,6 October 2019
American Gangster," Epic gangster film
","An ambitious and highly entertaining gangster film. Great direction from Ridley Scott, Washington and Crowe we're both excellent in their respective roles. Many set pieces and locations made for a harrowing re-telling of the rise and fall of a Harlem kingpin.",8,3,5,29 November 2018
The Big Short," Interesting story
",A very interesting insight into the 2008 banking collapse. The story is told in a way that is easy to understand to a layman. It has a great cast and gave a thorough insight into the workings of the big banks at the time.,7,1,3,23 January 2020
Prometheus," A visual masterpiece
","To truly appreciate Prometheus it is best to watch it in HD or 4K. The cinematography is beautiful. It is a fascinating story of humanity's pursuit in finding the origins of life. It features top of the range visual effects and set pieces.
It does contain plot holes and leaves questions unanswered but people misunderstand Prometheus and it is a great sci-fi film.",10,2,6,27 April 2019
Halloween," Classic horror
","A simple yet effective horror that has the right amount of suspense and horror to create the perfect slasher film. the music, the acting and the story are all on point.",9,1,2,30 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Good effort great potential
","A solid effort to the start of the Wonder Woman series. Similar to the first captain America film, it is set in world war 2 to establish the story. Hopefully like the Captain America series it will get better with sequels. 
Gal Gadot is amazing, no one could play the role better.",7,2,4,16 August 2018
Creed II," Shockingly boring
","This film had potential. Especially with the story of Creed vs Drago son. Rocky IV was the best of the series. This however was not good. It was slow, boring, full of cliche and melodrama, even for a rocky film. There is no tension, no real build up. The music or lack of it was terrible. Very predictable. Should of been a lot better. Disappointed.",3,4,9,9 March 2019
The Purge," Not great but entertaining
","This is the last Purge I have seen, I have seen the sequels and this is a lot better than the first purge. It's a silly film but I liked it it was entertaining, just don't take it seriously.",6,0,0,7 June 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 80's nightmare
","A nightmare within a nightmare. The 1980's setting is terrible and has not aged well. However the film itself is a classic, smart original horror slasher flick.",8,1,2,28 October 2018
Heat," Clsssic heist film
","This film has everything. Acting, action, story, dialogue everything. It's a great movie with many quotable lines and classic scenes. There is no better heist film.",9,1,1,18 July 2019
The Thin Red Line," The best sleeping pill film ever
","If you are tired or have trouble sleeping I recommend this film. It is bad, boring and slow. You really won't like it. You could pretend to but people will know.",1,2,6,9 August 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Da strange film
","The script for this film is not good and the pacing is terrible. The actors in it weren't great and the focus on Delroy Linda's character was irritating. You can definitely tell it's a Netflix film. It is very similar to Triple Frontier which wasn't great either. The film is 2.5 hours long and it should of been 2 max. The flashbacks to the war (50 years ago) had the same actors with no attempt to make them younger. I guess Netflix didn't want to give Spike Lee money like they did to Martin Scorsese for The Irishman. There is however, some beautiful scenery of Thailand which was a plus but overall the film misses its mark which will leave you feeling disappointed.",4,29,60,12 June 2020
Semi-Pro," Film sucks
","You will see this and think Hey this an old Will Ferrell film I haven't seen, I wonder why? Then you realise it's because of sucks. Awful film.",2,0,0,7 February 2019
