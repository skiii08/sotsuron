Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Not as bad as some reviewers make out
","When I sat down to watch Abe Vampire Hunter I wasn't expecting much. This may have been the reason I was pleasantly surprised by it. The story of Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter seems like an idea that would be so hard to pitch that it would have never have gotten off the ground in the first place. Indeed 20 years ago it would not have. With so many movies being remakes and reboots it's nice to see that the studios do look at new concepts and are willing to take chances. Abraham's story does indeed have flaws. There are times that i was watching it jump from scene to scene like a storyboard concept with all the subtlety of a montage. The characters are fully fledged comic book characters that all have a story to tell but not much heart to go with them. But this was never meant to be a heart warming story of a man and his dog. It's a high concept action/horror film using a historical figure as it's main focus. I do feel that the tongue in cheek title does deceive a little bit as I was hoping for a bit more humour, it's title alone is a eye roller that asks you to just go with it. But sometimes the film actually takes itself too seriously a bit. But once you get over the fact this is an action/horror, you are left with a great piece of Saturday night entertainment. The ideas on show here are very refreshing to see and some of the action sequences are visually stunning. The 3D is also very enjoyable, with the slow motion really giving the pop out effect another little extra treat for you. (Apologies to the 3D haters but I happen to enjoy films that jump out and occasional moments that break the 4th wall). I found myself looking at the scenery and camera angles as they showed off the set designs and props fantastically. It is a piece of eye candy and its very pleasant on the eye.Possible Spoiler Alert: One scene I found incredibly refreshing was the galloping horses action sequence. Original, brutal and something that makes the film stand out from all the usual hum drum action fare out there. Abe's axe wielding is also another little piece of genius.It's fair to say that this film is style over substance but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I want to see great sets, brilliant SFX and intricate action sequences.Will this movie save your love of cinema? Maybe not but it will keep the bed warm until a film that does comes along.Abe Lincoln is a great piece of action cinema that will keep you entertained for 2 hours. Give it a go, Timur's vision has to be applauded even if the script is lacking a little X factor.6 out of 10. Better than average.",6,4,7,24 October 2012
The Expendables," OK but should be amazing!
","With an action line up of this caliber it's easy to see how disappointing it eventually was. Promises of Bruce willis, schwartzenegger, mickey rourke, jet li, Jason statham, randy couture, Eric Roberts, stone cold Steve Austin, stallone, Gary Daniels, dolph lundgren and many more made every action fan wet their pants. Sadly what you get is too many people, not enough screen time. Many big names fall short of a starring role, unable to fully be a part of it. Arnie and Bruce in a very weak cameo that looks almost like a laboured add on scene made so that their names could be dropped into the posters. Jet li fights that are so edited they break up his natural skills and speed plus Mickey Rourke sitting on a chair smoking a pipe like some sort of sage like caterpillar spouting advice to a very lost Alice... Er I mean stallone. Very misused people. Still it's enjoyable, several scenes made me smile including the initial escape stallone and statham perform from the island. Plus the opening scene. Dolph Lungdren is by far the unsung hero of this film though, his character is viscously under used and the most interesting, he should get better parts. So is this the final 80's swan song to action movies? No, you only need to look at the last Rambo for that. This, however could be a new action franchise as long as they don't try to use cheap name dropping tactics to sell the sequels!",6,1,5,15 December 2010
Tangled," A Disney classic to rival loin king, mermaid and beast.
","The first thing to say about this movie is that it IS Disney. It is clear that it was originally intended to be traditional 2D Disney animation. Sadly since Pixar has been on the scene the 2D animation department has struggled to keep up with their new rebellious little step brother in terms of story and, indeed - success. Rapunzel was never the most exciting fairy tale ever which is why it has taken so long to use it as a basis for a film. Luckily the writers have done a sterling job at making sense of the whole tale, giving a reason for her to be in the tower and a use for having such long hair etc Then it was taken over and the decision was made to make it a CG 3D movie. And I should say, it's about time. Disney have tried in the past with limited success without Pixar showing them the way. Bolt and Meet the Robinsons were both very OK films but struggled to have that special'something' to make people endear to them. They lacked the 'heart' of Disney's beloved classics. Tangled takes the tradition of 2D classics and puts them into a nice looking CG 3D package. The result is the best film Disney has done in an age and lays a foundation for a bright new future. Let's now talk about the film. It's musical, very musical with lots of sing songs and dancing. Problem? It wasn't for Beast or Lion King so it's not a problem here. It's funny, sharp witted, warm and scary in equal measures. It has small characters like the chameleon, maximus the horse and the old drunk in the Snuggly Duckling pub that makes you instantly like them as well as the main characters. Rapunzel and Flynn are entertaining and their relationship is as good as Belle and the Beast's in terms of believability. The main bug bear I have with this film is that it may kill 2D features completely. Why would Disney go back if they can now make great films this way? All I know is that Pixar better beware, they are very established now and can run the risk of becoming fomulaic with Disney taking up the slack and moving back out in front again. (CARS 2 and MONSTERS INC 2 suggests that Pixar may be running low on steam). Here's hoping the next one is even half as good... P.S. go watch it.",9,1,3,2 March 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Fantastic movie
","This is possibly one of my favourite films of the year. Very enjoyable, very funny, very dramatic, visually stunning and breathtaking. The films pace is perfect, you feel like it ended exactly when it needed to. The animation is amazing. Several subtle characteristics come out from the animation That impresses me all the time. I have watched it at least once a week since released on blu ray. I could try to give you a detailed break down into what is good about this film but I decided to just let you watch it and then you will know. If you haven't seen it already then where have you been?! Don't take my 9 stars lightly, this is better than megamind by far. Much more complete as a film. Now bring out the 3D version and stop hogging it SAMSUNG!",9,0,0,15 December 2010
