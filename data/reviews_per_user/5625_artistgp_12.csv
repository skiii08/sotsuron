Vertigo," Excellent
","I finally watched Vertigo in its entirety. It was quite good. I've heard documentaries say that its Hitchcock's most intimate and emotional film. I most definitely agree. Jimmy Stewart gives an incredible performance. You really feel the tormented state he's in.The sets were great, which proves to be a Hitchcock norm. The music is magnificent. I won't comment on the story too much, other than to say you should give it a watch. Its quite good! Given that I am too young to have known Hitchcock's films when they were released, I am greatly enjoying the ability to go back and watch all of his films at my leisure. I can't watch one on any given night then another HC film the next night. That makes me the lucky one.Go watch Vertigo. :D",9,2,4,1 March 2012
Black Swan," It's good to refuse to play it safe.
","I finally had a chance to see this film. I was on the fence about whether or not I wanted to watch it. I enjoyed the fact that it was made in a very indie fashion even though he could have went a different route. The CG is very well done and flows throughout the story seamlessly.I like the film more and more each day, but I feel it does have its problems. Its almost like the picture needed some 'crazy relief' sprinkled in it from time to time. Altho, maybe that was the point. That we feel as off balance as she does.The film itself is very well directed, shot, edited, and acted. I may like it even more tomorrow and raise my rating. For now I'll need to let it cook for a while and wonder if it felt like the right balance or if it felt a bit too much like a beat down.Its definitely worth checking out to see what you think. Its a film that takes risks and I can definitely respect that.",7,1,4,5 March 2012
The Prestige," Masterfully Handled!!!
","I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did.",10,21,32,23 February 2012
Fast & Furious 6," Some thoughts...
","I'll refrain from breaking down the entire film for you given that you've either seen it or are curious about watching it. So instead I'll just hit what I considered a few of the movies strong points and not so strong points.THE GOOD: The tank scene was surprisingly awesome to watch. I didn't expect the carnage they actually showed in the film, given it was a popcorn movie. The hand to hand fight scenes were also quite well done (most notably in the train station). Obviously the movie had tons of car chases that were well handled.THE BAD: The story was very weak. So tell me again why Diesel's team is the only group of people that can take down this bad guy? It's like they predicted that there would be tons of car chases. Why would you even assume that? Besides lots of plot issues the dialogue itself was a bit hard to get through. I will say that Tyrese's character was the high point of the film for me. Thank goodness he had his little quirk. It was definitely nothing special, but if you like the franchise you'll enjoy the movie. Not one I would necessarily recommend tho.",6,0,1,7 June 2013
Alien," Not quite what I remembered
","I saw Alien as a kid and I recalled it being extremely scary. Many years have gone by and I recently watched it again. It fell short of my memories.It's not that it isn't a good film. It's 'fine.' The main issue I have is that the characters are 99% hollow. They have absolutely no development, so why would we care if they live or die? The only people we get to know at all are the two mechanics on board. They complain back and forth with each other about how many shares they are getting, etc. Other than that we don't know or care anything about anyone else. I'm not even sure that we know what jobs most of the other crew members have.Also, that alien sure as heck did grow fast. It went from the size of a squirrel to the scale of a large man in like 30 minutes. And that was without eating anything. And by the way, Ash said he was ordered to bring the species back and that the crew was expendable. Why in the world didn't he just freeze the facehugger while it was on the random crew member's face? The mechanic even suggested it.Like I said, it's not a bad movie it's just not very extra special. Scott seems (as usual) obsessed with sets and not much else (for another example watch Blade Runner or Prometheus).",7,1,4,9 November 2012
Kung Fu Panda 2," Surprisingly Excellent
","I was quite surprised to watch this film and discover that it was full of hidden jewels. There was some very interesting 'camera work' as well as various nice montages though out the film. There was also a very nice mix of different styles of animation. The paper cut out puppet segments of the film were wonderful.That being said, my favorite part of the film was the relationship between the lead character and his father. For an animated film they truly tugged on the heart strings. I must also add that the subtle acting in the faces of the characters was incredibly well done by the animators.You should definitely check out this film if you're even the least bit curious.",8,0,1,10 March 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," Dang near Perfect!
","There are very few films that one can say are flawless and of course nothing is without some type of error here or there, but I must say that Little Miss Sunshine is absolutely fantastic. I can think of nothing at all that I would change about this film.The cast, story, visual style, pacing, editing, and directing are spot on. It has a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and reason for legitimate intrigue. The group of misfits offer us several passageways into the story. Obviously we each have our own unique needs from a movie, but for me this one is about as close to perfect as you can get.If you haven't seen it, treat yourself to a story full of laughs, tears, and growth. I don't think you'll be upset.",10,2,3,28 February 2012
Hugo," Some Thoughts...
","This is a tough one to break down. The movie was brilliantly shot, but I must say that it seemed to fail at ever fully creating the majestic mood it was going for. The pacing made it very tough to become completely engaged in the first half of the movie. The second portion did take it up a notch and add something to the film.It mainly felt like he made this film as an excuse to tell the origins of film, or at least through one persons life. The acting was hit and miss, but overall I enjoyed the film because it tried to have a big heart and that is at least worth something.These are just my thoughts, I'd suggest that you watch the film yourself and see what you think.",6,5,6,2 July 2013
Ghost Rider," Yikes!
","Here's the deal. I wanted to like this movie. I really really did. Even after the fact I tried to make excuses for them, but the fact is that its just not very good. I thought the design for ghost rider was fairly decent.For an action film it was incredibly lacking in the action department. I kept thinking the fight scenes would suddenly get better........oh wait...no, they're not. Oh well. Don't get me wrong, the film has somewhat of a sense of fun it just still falls short in many many areas.The new version is coming out soon. Its a reboot, even though it also stars Nicholas Cage...odd.Fingers crossed for the next one.",5,0,0,3 March 2012
The Wrestler," A very well made film
","Upon watching the Wrestler the first thing that comes to mind is how true to life it seems. We get a first hand look at the aspect of a profession that it is very easy to act like never happens. Day to day problems, not to mention what happens after the bright lights go dim.Mickey Rourke pulled off a magnificent performance. He really should have won some major awards for it. The shooting style was just right for the story. I will say that the director used the exact same 'feel' for Black Swan with didn't work quite as well as it did in the Wrestler.I'm not a professional wrestling fan, but i do think its something anyone that watches WWE should check out so that you can see what these guys life is actually like.Very good movie.",8,0,0,3 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Eh....
","I will start by saying that I really enjoyed the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. I thought, for me, it was the best of the Harry Potter films. Part 2 isn't a horrible movie, it actually starts out with some really well shot scenes. Nice pacing and a serious tone to what's being set up.I must say though that by the end of the film I felt very unsatisfied. I was told that the film was full of action and little else, but its almost like they decided to not put any heart or emotion into the film, while at the same time not really having all that much action in it either.I was very very unhappy with how they portrayed the ending. Weak. It strayed from the book a good bit......and not for the better. I also found it quite odd with what they chose to spend lots of time on and what they decided to cut very short.The series is now over and it is what it is. I just wish they could have nailed the last piece.",6,0,2,6 March 2012
Jackie Brown," Some thoughts...
","I'll refrain from summarizing the entire film because you've either already seen it or you're interested in watching the story. Instead I'll just share some thoughts I had with you.It definitely felt like a step down from most of his films. There wasn't anything revolutionary about the film. The beginning seemed to lag for a good while. It eventually picked up steam during the heist portion of the movie, but that in itself didn't really seem to have anything new to add to that genre. The were some really nice long shots in the film (I'm a huge fan of artistically staged lengthy takes), the car pulling into the empty lot on the other side of the fence is a good example. I will say tho, that there were some long shots that seemed to be stretched out for no apparent reason other than just to do it.The acting was solid. The characters were a mix. Jackie was stuck in a dead end job for somewhere around twenty years and yet she proved to be quite the master mind by the end of the movie. Kind of makes you wonder why she wasn't able to advance in her career. Jackson's character was well played and was indeed intriguing, but after a while I kind of wished he would leave me alone. It's not a bad movie, but not one I would recommend to someone else. These are just my thoughts on this particular project. If you're interested in the film I'd urge you to see it and make your own.",5,0,1,11 June 2013
