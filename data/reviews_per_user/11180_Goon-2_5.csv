The Devil's Advocate," Annoying horror film
","Keanu Reeves is oh-so-convincing as Kevin Lomax, lawyer who has oh-so-realistically never lost a case who does things like 'bullies' witnesses in the courtroom, the way he does to Welcome to the Dollhouse's' Heather Mattarazzo that makes her 'cry' and blurt out some dull tale about sexual harassment, or something, that Kevin twists around to make her look like she's lying... and I believe that somehow this leads to him meeting up with Al Pacino... who is the Devil in the disguise.I knew that from the trailers and such, but Kevin has no idea and he and his wife Mary Ann(Charlize Theron) get taken in by this guy and all of the opportunities he presents to Kevin.But then, bad things start happening to Mary Ann. She hallucinates a lot, a'la 'Jacob's Ladder,' (which is a movie I can' stand!) particularly in what seemed to be the world's longest and most disgusting sex/nudity scene with her and Keanu, and cries a lot, and tries to kill herself, too.Stupid Kevin is oblivious to his wife's goings-on, he's to busy with Al the Devil, enjoying success and luxary, until he eventually finds out that Al IS the Devil, and wants Kevin the Dog to mate (mate?!) with his sister (I don't recall the devil having siblings...) to have spawn, or something equally ridiculous.Yet, this film made the theaters. Of course, with its 'hot' stars Keanu and Charlize Theron (whose deep voice, and obnoxious dancing that had her raising her arms above her head as she moved around, irritated me, and why did the devil make her change her hairstyle?) And ANYTHING with Al 'the Genius' Pacino, just MUST make the theater. Even if it's 'The Devil's Advocate,' I guess.",Null,0,1,22 March 2001
Pulp Fiction," I gave it a 1 out of 10
","That was to lower it's stupid ridiculously high average, but to put it quite simply, I hated this movie. I didn't expect to like it, I was only watching it for Frank Whaley, but I hated this movie, really hated with it with it's various plot holes that do not make sense(watch 'Short Cuts' if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people), obnoxious, unsympathetic characters(I wanted to cheer when John Travolta died, or did he die? I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being 'cool' and trying to have 'catch phrases,' etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as 'daring' 'good' film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with 'Born on the Fourth of July' and 'Do the Right Thing' for my least favorite 'good' movie.",1,46,107,29 October 1999
War of the Worlds," possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen
","*likely to contain a spoiler* If this movie weren't so over-rated I would almost feel sorry for it. It is one of those movies that seems to earnestly try to be exciting, dramatic, and entertaining...and fails to be any of them.The 'excitement' comes from the impending threat of aliens invading the town of Tom Cruise and his two estranged children. 'Drama' abounds as they steal a car, have it stolen from them, ride on a really crowded boat, have the brooding son leave them (for virtually no reason), hide in a hole and on and on.... 'Entertainment' comes from, well...'War of the Worlds' does not prove to be that entertaining of a movie. The closest thing coming to viewing pleasure is pointing out the ASTONISHING lack of plot and character development (a woman named Carol and her daughter Nora are 'introduced' when getting on the boat. There is no room for Carol to get on the boat. Carol is never seen or mentioned again...); the poor pacing, the amateurish lighting choice, the fact that the 'aliens roaming the basement' scene was right out of 'Jurassic Park (only it was kind of scary then); the fact that the aliens are not frightening in the absolute LEAST (the little silver eye..thing that scanned the basement practically looked like a happy face, and the 'sick' alien could almost be described as cute)and on and on...In short: there is nothing about this movie I found well-done. The grade-Z sci fi channel movies are literal MASTERPIECES in comparison... and yet, those remain relegated as kitschy grade-Z films, while this so-called blockbuster bizarrely gets fawned over, for reasons absolutely...alien to me.",1,1,2,28 December 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," It's no comedy, and to be a tragedy would probably require emotion, which this movie has none
","This was not a movie I chose to see, but rather agreed to sit in the room while it played. My biggest fear was that it would be stupid, or grating, or annoying, seeing as Will Ferrell is the star. Of course, another alternative was that it might have been a work of genius. Little did I know(the not-very-inspired phrase that is repeated in this movie) was how hideously boring this movie would turn out to be.If I had seen Will Ferrell in any other movies, he hasn't made enough of an impression on me to... know that I have. His acting style appears grating in the trailers of his movies I have chosen not to see. I wouldn't say it was in this movie. Yet, little did I know, I would have actually Preferred that to the completely emotionless performance he turns in as Harold Crick, the lonely IRS agent whose routine life is disrupted by the sudden overhearing of a British-accented voice who seems to know what will happen next in Harold's dull little life (which wouldn't be that hard to figure out, considering he brushes his teeth the same amount of stroke, walks the same amount of steps to the bus stop.. etc). At first Harold thinks he's crazy, but somehow realizes it's not some mental impairment he's suffering from, some British lady is actually mapping out Harold's life for a story. Somehow this confirms Harold's sanity and makes him the focus of interest for a literature professor who's really hung up on the phrase 'little did he know.' Instead of trying to figure out WHY HAROLD CAN SUDDENLY HEAR HER, or why Harold is COMPLETELY ACCEPTING OF HER NARRATING PRESENCE, Harold just tries to figure out if it's a comedy or tragedy she's writing about him.I remember this movie being marketed as a comedy and the few attempts at humor making it into the trailer, but it much more seems to be aiming at the 'tragedy' angle with the feel-good 'live like you were dying' moral thrown in, minus any inspiration or warm feelings. This movie is essentially without any feeling, particularly as it plods along at its annoying slow pace in its annoyingly bland colors, with its annoyingly limited background sound. I'm not a fan of endless soundtracks, but music can add to a movie and it might have woken this one up a little.Instead, 'Stranger Than Fiction' drags along with it's not-that-original-as-it-thinks concept of boring, narrated Harold, who, little did he know, finds the voice narrating him belongs to a real-life author (which 'we' knew thanks to the random scenes of her trying to get an understanding of death) who just happens to live in the same city and finds her contact information. Little did she know, EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS WRITING OUT THE PHONE CALL HE WOULD MAKE TO HER, Harold Crick is real, as well. Instead of wondering, say, HOW she had been able to narrate Harold, or wondering if she wasn't completely insane, or HE wasn't some complete nut who had somehow caught wind of her book and was trying to get to her, she completely accepts that he must be the Harold Crick she was writing about and feels bad because she's written some death scene for him that's apparently so wonderful she can't change it. (Harold also completely accepts this, though he has the ability to invade her apartment and even READS her book, he doesn't think to destroy it or 'make' her change it.) Considering it seemed to take an eternity for the characters to even meet (Harold should have learned about her LONG before he did, especially about her 'little quirk' of always killing her characters. It comes so late in the movie, after he 'knows' he is going to die and the audience knows the author likes to think about death, that it really feels redundant) another eternity follows with the author having a nagging conscience and Harold having a creepy, emotionless acceptance of his impending doom. We also see 'why' a kid on a bike and a lady bus driver kept appearing in this movie in the first place (er, why else would they keep showing them if they were not to have played a role in 'the end') and Harold's Mentioned So Often You Know It Will Be Significant in the End wristwatch... also has a significant 'role' (you would think she was writing a kiddie novel about 'Harold and the Amazing Wristwatch.' It seems to be almost as bright as Herbie the Lovebug). Oh yes, and then the movie goes on for another about fifteen minutes or so. Instead of being 'inspired' by the not-very-good narration of the author, I felt about as alert and invigorated as Will Ferrell appears to be throughout the movie.",2,2,8,5 August 2007
Platoon," Can a film BE any more overhyped?
","Did Platoon actually win Best Picture? Please tell it didn't because if so, HOW BAD WAS EVERYTHING ELSE RELEASED THAT YEAR? This film is the epitome of a sub-par movie and I practically feel as though I'm being polite for saying so, considering the numerous flaws this one has. The acting is okay, but nothing more than that, the characters are dull and the 'heroes' are beyond non-sympathetic, the script lacks depth, and the ending is terrible. Why people can pan a fine movie like 'Limbo' for its ending and not this is beyond me. I've never seen such a terrible message given, but what can you expect from a movie where the heroes bond during a big drug circle? Even the film's one really good scene(where they're in Vietnam and freakishly shooting just about anybody) literally goes nowhere. I think it was merely supposed to reflect the 'goodness' of Captian Elias and the monstrosity of Tom Berenger(pathetically the most interesting character), or something, but who knows, considering nobody in the movie is even mentioning anything about it 10 minutes after it happened, though one would have thought it was supposed to be a great plot twist? That, along with a 'shocking' scene where a helicophter flies away, leaving an important character behind(so ridiculously done that I couldn't help laughing aloud)and this is real 'Best Picture' fair alright. What a taint to the Academy Awards.",2,15,30,29 October 1999
