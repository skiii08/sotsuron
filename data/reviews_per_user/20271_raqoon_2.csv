Resident Evil: Afterlife," If you go and watch this movie, you should already be expecting what you're going to get.
","By now people should already know that when you go see a resident evil movie there is going to be shooting, some major ass kicking, glorious explosions (especially the Tokyo one in Afterlife stands out), monsters, zombies, cheesy dialog (which in my opinion only ads to greatness of this series) and of course, the gorgeous miss Jovovich. Also in this movie franchise.. a lot of times we are shown stuff that is explained a lot later.. maybe even two movies later. Like the Majinis and the Executioner, who show up in L.A. for no reason.. Maybe we'll find out in the fifth installment.Let me just say that i am a BIG fan of the RE games, especially 4 and 5, which have taken another direction with the storyline (for the better), but i also like the movies. I'm that kind of a person who enjoys all aspects of movies, music, art and almost everything else in life. I look at, listen to and watch any genre you throw at me, as long as the product is good in its own way. If you are like me, you're going to enjoy this movie even if you aren't an action fan.. oh and definitely see it in 3D.GL",10,25,52,13 September 2010
Avatar," Outstanding! A piece of modern art
","All i can say is that i was amazed and remained stunned when credits rolled (and so was everyone else in the theater as a matter of fact). Like many others have said, this can not be explained, it must be experienced. As a lifelong sci-fi, science, technology and all things space fan, it was a dream come true to come that close to actually experiencing a distant planet(a moon actually).The story is very standard and it does strike close resemblance to the Dances with the Wolves like others have pointed out. That being said, i can confirm that it is nevertheless epic and heartwarming. The CGI animations only enhance the overall great acting, which is a rare thing. The best parts were played by the amazing newbies Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana. Sigourney Weaver also stands out and once again proves to us that she is a very capable actress.James Cameroon is a perfectionist, and it's nice to see that some still are in the world where only fast money production matters. I have deepest respect for everyone involved in making this movie happen, especially to Twentieth Century Fox for having patience and providing funds needed to make this picture what it is.10/10, a must see (in 3-D).",10,4,9,18 December 2009
