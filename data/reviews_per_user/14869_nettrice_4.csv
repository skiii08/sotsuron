The Longest Yard," Nelly's got that slave feet?!
","I just saw it and thought it was pretty good. In fact, there was a couple of times I laughed out loud and that is rare for me nowadays. I did not go to see the movie for the story (it a remake for goodness sakes) but I did go for some laughs. The movie was not afraid to make racism seem funny (silly)...sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying (or worse). While the audience in the theater gasped at some of the racial jokes I was usually smiling or laughing. Although this was made by Hollywood I felt that it nearly represented some of the tensions that exist within the prison walls, between inmates and inmates, inmates and guards, based on race and power...but it was not that deep and did not dwell too long on these issues. There was plenty of homo erotic jokes, as well, and this was expected.I thought Nelly played a surprisingly layered character for the brief time he is on screen. I was really feeling the scene in the library with him, the guards and some of the inmates/peers. I don't even like Nelly's music but I liked him in this film. Also, there are some cool action shots and the football sequences are surprisingly realistic. When one of the characters gets killed (no real spoilers here) about half way through, the movie actually stumbles down the stretch without him.Overall, I think The Longest Yard is one of the better Sandler movies. It has something for everyone and the lack of political correctness of many of the quips/jokes was at times refreshing and very funny.",6,0,0,12 June 2005
Django Unchained," Django Unchained isn't merely a 'slave revenge' film
","Django Unchained is about a hero who saves a damsel-in-distress. The 'damsel-in- distress' is a classic theme in literature, art and film. The damsel is usually a beautiful woman placed in a dire predicament by a villain, who requires a hero to achieve her rescue. In Tarantino's film, Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter, takes great pains to compare Django to Sigurðr and Broomhilda to Brynhildr (the latter characters from the Norse Völsunga mythology). Broomhilda/Brynhildr is a stock character of fiction, particularly of melodrama. However, never in recent memory has an African American chattel slave from the 1800s been cast as a damsel-in-distress... deemed worth saving. This alone was worth seeing the movie.In Alex Haley's Roots (book and television mini-series) Kizzy is a would-be Broomhilda, a beautiful young slave woman who is savagely and repeatedly raped by slave master Tom Moore, producing a son. Kizzy becomes resigned to her fate (as Master Moore's comfort woman). Kizzy is never saved, unlike Broomhilda in Django. Another reason I mention Roots is because of the excessive use of the n-word. BET recently re-aired the mini-series as part of a holiday marathon, perhaps as a lead-in to the Dhango Unchained opening. The n-word was used in Roots about as much as it is used in Django Unchained. The n- word was what slaves were called during that time period and it was (and still should be) a term of hate. Thus, the use of the n-word in Django is more historically correct than in prior Tarantino films. Tarantino's research of chattel slavery in the U.S., during the 1800s is highlighted in the film and he addressed issues such as phrenology (measurement of the skull) and drapetomania, a supposed mental illness described by U.S. physician Samuel A. Cartwright that caused black slaves to flee captivity. At one time science was used to justify the enslavement and brutalization of African slaves in the Americas. Django is just the tip of the iceberg. The knee jerk reactions of some critics regarding the excessive use of the n-word and it being a 'slave revenge' film was not helpful. I ignored these criticisms and saw the movie for myself. I applauded the performances by Christoph Waltz, Samuel Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio, among the others. Samuel Jackson channeled the Boondock's Uncle Ruckus to an extreme degree. If anything, I felt Jackson had too much screen time. Also, there were a few pauses in action and dialog that seemed out of sync with the flow of the film. However, there were also quite a few humorous moments that kept me in the narrative. Towards the end of the film Tarantino pays homage to a beginning sequence from Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' when a Native woman is told to flee the scene. A long time Ennio Morricone fan, Tarantino often makes extensive use of several Morricone pieces from several 1960s film scores. The 2009 film Inglourious Basterds also uses many Morricone pieces, as well as sharing 'Il Mercenario (Ripresa)' with Kill Bill.To conclude, rather than label Django Unchained as a 'slave revenge' film (bringing to mind the historical fear of revolt) I find it more helpful to think of what the film attempts to do for African Americans: offer us a fictional, historical revisionist retelling of Roots with substantial alterations in the characters, to revise views shown in earlier work. The goal, here, is not to bring or keep African Americans down but to insert new mythology into a classic narrative to elevate us and maybe even unite us.",9,18,38,25 December 2012
Prometheus," Look to Greek mythology for Prometheus meaning
","*A Few Spoilers Below... You may want to see the movie first.*It's nearly 3am and I just got home from the 12:01am IMAX 3D showing of Ridley Scott's film, Prometheus. If you're looking for tons of action and gratuitous violence then watch something else. This is an Alien prequel/side story and if you've seen Alien (as I have several times) you know there's a lot of shadows and silence, leading up to the scary stuff. Roger Ebert says the movie raises questions about the origin of human life and doesn't have the answers. I think it's a BIG mistake to compare the new film to Alien. It helps to have some knowledge of mythology and sociology: this is an intellectual's movie!In Greek mythology Prometheus was a Titan who created man from clay which enabled civilization. He was known as a champion of mankind. In the Western canon, Prometheus represented human striving – i.e. the quest for scientific knowledge and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences. In particular, he was regarded as a lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence also resulted in tragedy. Author Mary Shelley gave The Modern Prometheus as the subtitle to her novel Frankenstein in 1818.Also look to The Republic of Plato:'Behold! Human beings living in a sort of underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all across the den; they have been here from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and only see before them; for the chains are arranged in such a manner to prevent them from turning round their heads.'*Major spoiler here. You've been warned!*In the first scene a pale humanoid is abandoned on a Earth-like planet. He opens and swallows a writhing fluid that destroys him and as he falls into a large body of water the organism transmutes through his tissues, into his DNA and further. The particles of destruction (a virus?) infests the water. After seeing the film I began to wonder if it might be possible that we (human beings) are the viruses in an evolved state. The humanoids (in my view they would look different), as possible gods of humankind were our creators and they also attempt to destroy us by sending a spaceship with a viral cargo to Earth. This mission was thwarted by handsome Idris Elba as Captain Janek of the ship Prometheus. :) Anyway...In the new film, we get some of the shadow but little silence. It pays homage to earlier science fiction films: 2001: A Space Odyssey and, of course, the original Alien with H.R. Giger's most famous creation. The 3D was amazing. At some point I forgot about the 3D and was able to focus on the movie that was pretty awe inspiring. The 3D alien star chart was beautiful, as were the sets. I loved that Captain Janek died for a purpose and was basically a hero. I love that the cast was diverse and the women were strong... this is a 21st century space movie, not Starship Troopers. My only issues were pacing in a few major scenes and some of the key dialog was hard to catch. I guess that means I'll need to see it again!",8,2,6,8 June 2012
Hustle & Flow," A Dream Deferred
","Craig Brewer summed it up here:'For many of us, creative expression and collaboration with others is nothing new. But we must never forget that there are many in this world who've never been asked to express themselves with movement or words or paint.Regardless of our given circumstances, we are all entitled to contribute a verse. It is our right as human beings. A right that belongs to you, to me, and to a country stripper named Tequila.' - from Landmark Theatres newsletterHustle & Flow was very much about pimps, tricks, and hoes, about the down-on-their-luck folks and the dreams that often lay dormant...deferred. Langston Hughes once wrote'What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore-- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over-- like a syrupy sweet?Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.Or does it explode?'In Hustle & Flow, DJay ponders this question and soon he discovers the answer and it's not a happy ending. That would have been too Hollywood, to end of the rainbow and not the point. The question, 'What happens to a dream deferred?' appears to be answered with nothing but more questions. But take the time to analyze each question and you'll get an idea of what Hughes and DJay really believes about dreams being postponed. The 'dream' is a goal in life. Hughes position is clear that any important dream or goal that must be delayed can have serious negative affects. As DJay ponders the question we find out what those affects are. Like Hughes' poem, Hustle & Flow offers a possibility of each negative affect. The dream or life goal of a human being is central to what makes the human a valuable member of society, but suppose that person with the dream is told he cannot fulfill his goal just yet...it's a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies.I thought that the writing in Hustle & Flow was inspiring and the acting well done. I've been to Memphis and other cities like Cleveland, Louisville, St. Louis. I have relatives who are living in the same conditions as what people see on screen. Like DJay they all ponder the question: What happens to a dream deferred? Hustle & Flow shows us that having to postpone one's deepest desires can lead to destruction.",8,1,3,23 July 2005
