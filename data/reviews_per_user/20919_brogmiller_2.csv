Spartacus," Spartacus? You are he, aren't you?
","It is very much part of Hollywood folklore that having dispensed with the services of Anthony Mann, producer and star Kirk Douglas brought in Stanley Kubrick to direct. This represented a daunting challenge and Kubrick passed with flying colours. The rest as they say is history although Douglas felt that Kubrick was not as grateful as he should have been! Nigh on impossible to assemble a cast of this quality now. There are some highly amusing interviews on You Tube with Peter Ustonov who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting in which he describes the clash of egos between Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton. Although there was no love lost between them Olivier recognised Laughton's 'genius'. Olivier here is in his physical prime and is magnificent in the role of Crassus. He is ruthlessness incarnate but very tender in his scenes with the Lavinia of Jean Simmons. He had directed her in 'Hamlet' and their professional bond is palpable. There are scenes which are indelibly etched notably the gladiatorial combat between Douglas and Woody Strode and the scene where the slave army watches the legions of Crassus forming for battle which must surely have been inspired by Eisenstein's 'Alexander Nevsky'. The score by Alex North although harsh captures perfectly the brutality of the times whilst Russell Metty's cinematography is superb. Forget the others, this is the only gladiator film that really matters and it will never be surpassed.",9,1,1,16 April 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," Desert loving English
","One cannot really add much to the superlatives heaped upon this undisputed masterpiece, adapted by playwright Robert Bolt from T. E. Lawrence's 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom'. Director David Lean himself has admitted that he 'got it wrong' on a few occasions. Firstly in not having the courage to hold Omar Sharif's entrance for longer and secondly in not making it clearer that Lawrence was not only beaten but also buggered by the Turks. The film suggests that Lawrence did not know about the Sykes-Picot Treaty but only 'suspected'. He almost certainly did know hence his sense of guilt at having betrayed the Arabs. These are minor quibbles of course and do not detract from the films magnificence. It would be nigh on impossible to assemble a cast of this quality now and in the highly unlikely event of its being remade, everything would be CGI'd, even the camels! When Lean and cinemtographer Freddie Young met on the set, Young said 'Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs'. Lean very wisely took his advice. At the films premiere the Duke of Edinburgh enquired of Lean:'good flick is it?' Lean's response? 'I hope so, sir'.",10,1,1,12 March 2020
