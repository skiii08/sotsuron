50 First Dates," Great Movie
","Funny,Funny, more funny and adorable movie.  When I saw this movie I was laughing my way out of the theater all the way home and even the next day, I'd remember some part of the movie and I'd start laughing.  I knew this movie was going to be entertaining but it really impressed  me.  The story line, the animals, the development of characters it was, in my opinion filmed very well.  It has everything love, humor, cuteness, and it's a great love story. Drew and Adam  are amazing together.  This is a movie that I can't wait to see again.  So when your in the mood for a fantastic comedy this is the one to go see. You'll enjoy every moment of it.",10,0,0,7 March 2004
