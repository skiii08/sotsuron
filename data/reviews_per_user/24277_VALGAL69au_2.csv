Saturday Night Fever," What was all the hype about?
","I finally watched Saturday Night Fever last night. For all these years all I heard was hype and good reviews regarding the movie, but in my humble opinion, it was nothing more than a typical 1970s b-grade movie. I was very disappointed. The story is disjointed throughout, acting is very mediocre (except for John Travolta himself), the characters themselves aren't as strong as they seem intended to be, and the sound and video quality is also poor. There are several parts where the audio is almost definitely lip synchronised. (By the way, I watched the DVD version, so poor quality wasn't due to it being a worn VHS video copy). The music soundtrack is probably the only thing this movie really has going for it. I think this movie is a classic that we all have to watch at one time or another, but I don't think it's in the same category as Grease, which can be watched over and over without getting tiresome.",4,3,11,6 February 2006
Crash," Too Complex To Be Entertaining
","This movie has a very complex and incoherent plot (if any), and is hard to follow from beginning to end. There's so many mini-plots running simultaneously that the scene and characters changes too frequently to keep track of. I just finished watching it about five minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just saw. The movie leaves many loose ends and the viewer feels dissatisfied with the explanations that were given to those that were explained at all. Poor acting performances from Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser (who are actually only in the movie for probably 10-15 minutes all up). Not such a bad performance from Matt Dillon, but the character role he played seemed a little too unrealistic. I mean really, what's the chances that a crooked cop could feel up an innocent victim one day and then have to save that very same person from a car wreck the next day? Seems a little far fetched. This movie was nothing more than a wasted two hours, and I don't recommend it to anyone.",2,3,8,10 April 2009
