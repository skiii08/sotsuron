Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An amazing spectacle!
","It is unfortunate that so many people were so eager for this movie that it created some media backlash. George Lucas does not disappoint fans of his trilogy, and is sure to win many new ones. This movie is for every kid, especially those who are now in their late 20s and early 30s.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
