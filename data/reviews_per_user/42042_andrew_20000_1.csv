Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing follow-up
","Compared with the 'middle 3' of the Star Wars trilogy, I found this movie disappointing. This was not because of the plot or dialogue, but rather it was badly-directed. The fight scenes were badly choreographed and 'dragged on', and the politically incorrect character of Jar-Jar Binks was padded out in order to keep the attention of younger viewers.Star Wars will not be a classic series in 20 years time if all of the rest of the series is like this film.",Null,0,1,3 January 2001
