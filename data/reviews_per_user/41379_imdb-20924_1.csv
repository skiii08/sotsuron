The Incredible Hulk," Good Overall, Still Too Much CGI, and VERY LOUD
","First, I went to this movie to see the Tony Stark cameo.Second, this movie is much better than the first one, but that's not hard to do since the first one was so bad.Third, this movie tries too hard. It's a bit sappy love story, and a bit action film. It largely succeeds in the action film department, but the love story bit is forced.Fourth it is LOUD. My ears are still ringing after fifteen hours. I don't know whether it was my particular theatre (I don't think so) or whether it was the movie itself, but when my seat was literally shaking and the movie was still too loud with my fingers in my ears, that's a problem. It largely detracted from the experience. (Yes, I may be too old, but at 33 I don't think so!)Fifth, it's a good movie. It's not great, mind you - it's exactly what you'd expect from a summer action-flick. It's a little over the top with the action and the CGI, but it is a comic book movie, and that level provides for the comic book feel, which is a credit to the filmmakers. It's got the tag-lines that The Hulk is famous for, and a cool cameo that isn't Stan Lee or Robert Downey Jr.",6,1,6,14 June 2008
