Requiem for a Dream," Horrifying, heartbreaking story of addiction
","This horrifying, heartbreaking story of addiction seems surreal to me, a white, middle-aged, middle class male who has been drug-free since 1967, but it is far too realistic and truthful in its depiction of the lives of four addicts (not all DRUG addicts).  The movie's four stories are studies of the characters' depressing, bleak, nihilistic, wasted lives and their demise. No relief from death in for these four:  death is too easy.  The must live in hell.If you aren't disturbed by this movie you don't have a soul.",10,0,0,25 March 2001
