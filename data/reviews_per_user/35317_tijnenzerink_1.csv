Blade Runner 2049," Yeah, I rate it 10/10, but let me explain why
","I have to say, I think the reviews here are a bit passive aggressive. Some are screaming at Hollywood, others at people that rate this movie 10/10 and some scream about the screaming reviewers. So here is just my take on the movie.I loved it. The movie isn't perfect, but to me there wasn't anything that I didn't like. I rate the movie based on my own experience and I'm certainly not unbiased. I liked the original, but I always felt that it was a bit overrated. The story never matched the beautiful visuals. Blade Runner 2049 has improved a lot on the story front, but without losing the philosophical aspects of the original.The visuals are what make this movie amazing. It's beautiful. I don't think better than the original, because they are very different and technically they can do very different things now than they could before. But the cinematography was especially remarkable, it made every scene beautiful. Even in the most mondaine locations.The soundtrack, it fits the movie, but it's trying to copy the original and it fails a bit. Yes, it works in the movie, but no, it isn't great on it's own like the original.Ryan Gosling is great, but the role isn't that tough most of the time. Harrison Ford is great, which was a surprise seeing his work over the last years. Jared Leto was good, nothing amazing, not bad, I would call it serviceable.If you read all of this, it doesn't sound like I should rate this 10/10, but all of these critisms only came to me after I got out of the cinema. While watching the movie, I loved every single second of it. It was one of the best experiences for me at the cinema, I never wanted it to end, and I think that that's the feeling a 10/10 movie should give you.",10,2,11,6 August 2019
