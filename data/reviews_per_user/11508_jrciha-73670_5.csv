The Incredible Hulk," Good, Not Great, Good
","This movie came off of Iron Man which did almost everything right. That's why this movie disappointed me a lot. It was supposed to be the next big movie in the franchise, but instead, it was a letdown. There still were good parts like Ed Norton, and William Hurt. The story was at least a little interesting. The Hulk scenes are cool to see. Sometimes, I have fun watching this, but other times I can't. The music intensifies the action scenes, so that's good. Overall, it's not a terrible movie. It's not great though. It's just good.",6,0,0,28 May 2017
Iron Man 2," A Good Disappointment
","I thought that this would revive Marvel to the level of the first Iron Man movie. And I was wrong. This was actually a pretty stupid movie. The good things about the movie did shine, like Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Don Cheadle as Rhody, the introduction of Black Widow, the fight scenes, Nick Fury, any action, and Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. The things I didn't like were Ivan Vanko, Pepper Potts, and the story. There is a lot of shoehorned stuff in this movie that's not even supposed to be in the movie. This movie just acts as a placeholder to set up for the upcoming Avengers movie. There are plenty of good things, but a lot of bad things.",6,0,0,28 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Great
","This is a pretty great movie. It's definitely not perfect, but it's good. The cast does a great job. Chris Pratt is hilarious as Star-Lord. Groot, once again, steals the show. The character that stood out most to me was Dave Bautista's Drax. So hilarious. Kurt Russell was great as Ego. The one performance that I wasn't a huge fan of was Karen Gillan as Nebula. I did get past that though. There are a lot of stories. Some were weak and some were sincerely strong. The story of Ego and Peter could be very weak at times, but it got better as the movie went on. The Gamora, Nebula story was something. I did enjoy the chemistry between Rocket and Yondu. I did not like when Ego and Peter played catch. That was just dumb. The music is amazing. Not as amazing as the first one's, but still amazing. The effects are awesome. Overall, this is not perfect but is still pretty great.",9,2,7,27 May 2017
Thor," Big Step in The Right Direction
","This movie was a pleasant surprise. I was never a huge fan of Thor in the comics, but this movie got me pretty interested in the character. It also surprised me that it was better than the Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2. Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor. Absolutely perfect. Tom Hiddleston was great as Thor's brother Loki. Anthony Hopkins was great as Odin. Natalie Portman was fine as Jane Foster. I liked Stellan Skaarsgard as Erik Selvig. Kat Dennings was over the top comic relief, but there were times when I enjoyed her. My main problem was that the story was full of clich√©s and was very predictable. The action was fun when there was action. The effects of Asgard were awesome. The musical score was great. All of the movies to this range from Great to alright. This falls in the almost very great section. I really enjoyed it, but it's still not perfect.",7,2,3,28 May 2017
Iron Man," Great start to a franchise!
","I would give this a 9.5/10, but unfortunately that's not an option. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice for this role. He essentially plays himself. Jeff Bridges is okay in the movie. He was kinda forgettable, but that's a curse a lot of marvel movies have. This is the movie back when I didn't mind Pepper's character. Hmm. Anyway, Gwyneth Paltrow is good. Terrence Howard played Rhody with enthusiasm. This movie is a redemption story for Tony Stark. It was an interesting story that always kept me wanting to watch more. There's some AC/DC music in the movie, and that's great. There's Black Sabbath at the end. The effects were fantastic in the film. The part that I didn't like was that villain twist at the end. Because it wasn't a twist. We all saw it coming that Obadiah Stane was a bad guy. The third act was kind of dumb, but once the fight was brought to the Stark HQ, it got better. Good movie, but not perfect.",9,0,0,28 May 2017
