The Equalizer," an equalized john wick?
","if u ask me which is better , john wick 2 or the equalizer , i ll say with no hesitation, the equalizer...the hero is a badass too yes, kicking asses , putting traps, predicting everything, but its Denjel! a good actor! and the movie has a plot! a believable plot, although some clichÃ©s are here too..in fact the entire story is upon Denjel s shoulders..and he made it ! his fight style is also natural and well performed and not gun fights and shot heads like Wick s...the villains are also believable in their part...well, i enjoyed it!",9,0,2,4 March 2017
Passengers," love story
","The story is somewhere in the future( we don't know exactly) when earth has already colonised far far away planets... the technology of course is very advanced , capable to structure gigantic spaceships with all the leisure needed for hundred years trips(!!!) , also robots (humanoid or else) and synthetic foods similar to real food from advanced machines...all these cannot be made for the next 100 years at least in my opinion... After all the above, u may wonder..if science has all the above abilities, why someone abandons the earth for a trip to the unknown and to primitive environments, knowing that he will never see any of the family, friends, etc? the only answer i can say, is the feeling of adventure or curiosity, but its not enough in my opinion to make such a trip, knowing that u may even die from an accident in space or unknown factors..anyway, lets don't let these questions to distract us from the story, which in fact , is a romantic story of love and devotion...the scenery is superb, the ship looks fantastic and safe, the technology magical, the characters believable .. I ll keep from this film the beautiful surroundings and the romantic story...all the actors were good but the ending was a little sudden...i liked it",6,0,2,8 January 2017
The Others," excellent!
","I had watched this film when it was in theaters 17 years ago...and i have to say, that it was one of the best films i have ever seen....the twist at the end is beyond expectations , especially for sensitive and delicate people....its a horror but at the same time sad film....sad about afterlife...sad about the emptiness of life.....the story is stunning, the only thing that was a little weird, was the appearance of her husband from nowhere...but ok...the film is great!! watch it!",10,0,0,1 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," time travel? ideal for plot holes!
","Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..its an invention of writers and authors to close plot holes and impress audiances...so, any film or book containing time travel, IS A MESS! so, i dont see any reason to grade this movie more than 2 stars...cgi, fights, ok , but a real good movie, must have a believable story! for me, sorry it didnt work...
question...why thor and hulk had to be humiliated so much in this movie ? why toni stark had to die? to offer the framatic essence to the story?is this the end of marvel heroes?",2,175,303,4 May 2019
A Quiet Place," no, no...
","Ok, i watched it...at first i thought it was one of the 1920 movies without sound and waited to hear the piano accompaning the script ...there was no piano...at that moment i thought it was a film with deaf-mute characters..no it wasnt....then i found it..it was a film about paranoia...or else how can i describe a family life depending on absolute silence, that decided to bring a baby in the world? as far as i know, new born babies do one thing 16 hours per day..crying loudly! well, ok..lets forget about it..another thing and last one...since the family seemed to have infinite electricity source, why the father didnt make any traps for the monsters? he had a big handy rifle too..anyway, the script was beyond critisism ..there is no way blind and vulnerable creatures of a man size , no matter how fast they are, to devastate whole countries in the 21st century , its impossible . where was the army ?.the atmosphere and acting was good, but i found the scenario, terrible!",3,0,1,23 April 2018
Life," i stopped watching this kind of movies years ago
","Since i voted 3 stars for covenant, this one has to take 1...i am a sci fi fan from my childhood, but enough of this kind of stories..a jelly like being, looking intelligent, changing shapes, making disgusting things to people and animals, and so? cant we make a story about a serious contact with a serious alien race? or we will continue messing with stupidities?",1,9,21,1 June 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," 20000 bullets loose target
","well..what to say....i do like this kind of movies, i liked the first one as a prototype, i liked the choreography of fights, the story..(simple but solid)...revenge is a great motivation in this kind of movies...the difference between chapter 1 and 2 is this ..in chapter 1, revenge was the only motivation..in chapter 2, revenge is a small part, survival is the issue...survival at any cost...yes, its very fascinating watching Wick' s skills, killing his enemies in every possible way no matter how many , but its a little too much for common sense ! i mean , if the future or the present condition of the world is john wick 's world, a world full of assassins and bosses, a world where anyone who dares to stand is meant to be killed in a couple of hours, a world where anyone who resists must have john wick 's skills to stay alive , this world is really a nightmare...anyway, the movie is impressive although kinda like a video game (shoot-kill-proceed- next stage)...two are the things that make the difference in the movie...1. the stylish directory and the fights and 2. the very good performances by most of the actors ...the ending is promising a third chapter , and i hope in the third chapter we will see John smiling a little...",8,1,3,28 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," its a pity...
","I loved Prometheus for its originality and because it moved the series one step forward...after Prometheus, i was waiting in anticipation for the sequel and the evolution of the engineer story..after 5 years i deserve this one? from where to start and where to finish in this mess? i have spotted the main issues and problems in my opinion : 1. a starship with 2000 colonists in cryosleep is travelling for years under the supervision of ''mother'' and an android.2 .after a serious incident and damage to the solar sails!!!(i never understood why these sails were open wide in the vast space) the crew awakes (the captain is burning right away) and a mysterious song- signal is transmitted from an unknown near planet..3. after a discussion of 3 minutes, the captain decides to leave the course and go to investigate, because the crew denies to go to cryosleep again!!!4. they go down the surface almost the whole crew , and get out of the ship without any suits, helmets or masks, because the computer says that the air is breathable! (no germs? no viruses? no microorganisms?)5. after a little while , 2 members are infected by spores of some kind and they found the engineer ship..6. they don't search at all the engineer gigantic ship after finding accidentally Elizabeths Shaw identity..7.the infected men gave birth to alien creatures which kill half the crew..8. David makes his appearance with long hair and saves the rest..9. He get them to the city where still thousands of burnt corpses are remaining but no one seems to care ...10. David shows them his lab and tries to make Walter his allie with no result, meanwhile some hilarious things happen between the two androids...11. David is the creator of the aliens , using poor Elizabeth..12. Departure of the remaining crew from the planet and as always fight to get rid of a xenomorph which entered the ship..13. David is in the ship pretending to be Walter..14. David put to sleep the crew smiling with satisfaction and inserted alien embryos to the system for future use ..end of the story... Notices: 1. Wo is such a moron to investigate an alien planet without any precautions? 2. Why David killed the domestic population since he hates only human as he says ? 3. There is not one comment in the whole film about the race of engineers as they never existed 4. David as a free will android and the creator of the aliens makes no sense at all 5. a huge ship with colonists with David in charge goes to its destination to do what?6. What about the engineers and why Elizabeth was killed? THE GOOD : picture, filming, David. THE BAD : the plot, the horror, the atmosphere. conclusion: failure.",4,3,5,10 July 2017
