The Longest Yard," Good But I've Seen It Before
","Longest yard about a pro footballer who lands himself in prison, so not a bad plot most certainly not unheard heard of. So we have a pretty funny start, i mean when is a film not funny and has Sandler in it and then of course of to prison. Now i personally don't like music artists in films and Nellys performance was good nothing special just like i would expect. The others in the cast were great, Rock i think is great always liked his film especially Bad Company and he didn't fail to deliver in this film. Reynolds like usual was great in his role i mean you saw him play football. And all the other actors were great in their roles could not really fault them.As for the game, it wasn't anything special I've seen better matches but it still kept you watching the screen hoping for the prisoners to win and of course the back stabbing twist wasn't exactly a huge surprise or the fact that his team wouldn't play when he came back overall though a good film one thing this film is EXACTLY the same as Mean Machine, i think the one difference i saw was that in mean machine the old guy died and not the assistant manager apart from that everything from the way they looked up the guards weaknesses to the warden forcing Sandler to stop playing its all the same except its American and not English sport",7,0,0,2 October 2005
Underworld," Underworld Was GRRRRRRREAT!!!
","I saw this film on DVD first, came over it by accident while i was bored at my grandmothers. But my god when i finished that film i just had to watch it again, and again, and again.It was pure genius, and this kind of a film coming from Len Wiseman where this was his first real directing job, i mean wow he can direct. I loved the whole story the Hybrid theory as it was, the fact that no one has ever really thought 'What if you crossed a Werewolf sorry lycan with a Vampyre'.And you can relate to every person, Lycan or Vampyre. You have Raze a big brute of a Lycan but who solemnly pledges his allegiance to Lucian and Lucian the leader small in size but that doesn't stop him from casting his long shadow over his many minions. Then you have Selene, unbelievably beautiful yet dangerous, and Viktor the most powerful Vampyre by far, his stance alone can scare anyone or anything into cowering.OK so Speedman kinda sucked, but the simple fact that Beckinsale and Knighy where absolutely awesome just completely overpowers your urge to rein hate on Speedman. And the special effects weren't half bad either, there were a few bits where you could see the transition to CGI or suited guys. And the gun fight at the start, when i first watched it i was kinda to enthralled and of course loved it, and i love every scene to this day, but my god that subway scene shows that Lycans and Vampyres cant aim at all.But again all the bad points were completely washed away by the good. This is a great film and easily re watchable material. If you like the whole Vampire, werewolf's scenario you're going to love this, if you don't, well.............. you're still going to love it.This is one of my favourite films of all time, and i cant wait for the sequel",10,2,3,26 August 2005
Constantine," Constantine- So-So
","Well saw the film, wasn't expecting much cause of the fact Keanu is the most lifeless actor going at the minute, granted the Matrix was one of the best films ever created, but EVERY other film his acting has been lifeless, pointless like he doesn't care, and never guess what the same is with this. The main good point is Weisz, she is fantastic, shes so underrated and should be an A-List actress, she has a perfect voice she does over or under do her parts, The Mummy 1 & 2, Runaway Jury, Constantine you name it she pulled her parts of flawlessly.The actual story i found real interesting, i have ever read a comic luckily never realised till after i watched it, cause if i had known i would have started on a downer cause there's just so many comic to film movies i would have just passed by this film, but i didn't, and even though Keanu was terrible i did enjoy the film to a certain extent The plot was clever, i thought it was put together well, scenes were amazing, special effects are some of the best in this category of film I've ever seen. The demons, not what i expected yet thats what makes them so good, i never expected them to look that good, a very clever idea. The whole idea of the backstabbing angel, a great idea that not many would have thought of happening.All in all a perfect film, perfect that is except for the main character, he let the whole film down, he lost 4 points out of 10, thats right 4, i think for this kinda film the main character is a key part of the film (i know like most) but with Keanu acting it just ruined the film i think.I will watch it again but not soon, and not in a hurry 6/10 from ToonD",9,4,7,12 August 2005
Corpse Bride," Great Film - Burton Produces A Great Film
","A great little film, i say little knowing that the work that must have gone into this is huge, everything was perfectly animated, not only the characters but the surroundings were perfectly done everything from the little church to the one eyed skeleton were done to perfection.And the direction by Burton was flawless, the film was put together so nicely and it really does make for a great film to watch whether it be with kids or adults. The storyline is nice and the actors played their parts perfectly, Depp who always seems to take on his roles with pure perfection again did not disappoint. As well as Richard E Grant who's chilling voice was perfect in the film, and Carter as the corpse again a nice soft voice and greatly played. The songs were very entertaining and the little jokes here and their again were good fun to watch. And to actually see the story unfold was one of the best bits wondering what the ending would be, which is why this is such a good film.I still think there could have been more to make this better but even so this is a well put together, with acting and surroundings and story done perfectly, i will gladly watch this film time and time again and so should you",8,2,4,6 October 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Its Just The Aliens
","OK so i thought when i saw this its a kinda mix between the obvious Aiens and Predator and a dabble of Freddy vs Jason, and when i left the cinema i mean i have to admit i loved the film yes there were so many down points, the actors, why not have Halle Berry instead of what her face or at least someone who could act, i mean that scene you know 'La Luna Del Catchatori' how bored did they sound, when they laughed at they end it was almost 'is it time to leave' kinda laugh, kinda pointless.The fact also that predators seemed at one point in the film stronger in another weaker back and forth they went, and the fact that the scarred one you know second to die the fat one, the fact that he/she/it didn't realise that the Alien had acid blood is quite stupid considering they were meant to be hunting these every 100 years and so i would have thought they would've caught onto the idea that they have acidic blood.There are more bad points, but even so despite all the downers i loved this film, i mean Bishop, Maxwell and Verheiden i loved them 3 really like there acting the rest well utter rubbish quite frankly.But then comes the Aliens, and this time they seemed a lot realer (i know digital advances) AND you could kind of relate to the Aliens, no their need to kill but you actually had an Alien who you remembered you know the one i mean, cross hatch head, again the fact that, that alien survived 1 Predator is amazing but even so the alien no has character.Plus the fight scenes between alien and predator, although so unbalanced at each fight it still was a great sight to see i love every minute of it. OK so really they should have put more time, REAL actors and balanced it out more but even so i still will watch this many times just for those fight scenes, just to see the Predator chop an Aliens head off. Just for that experience",8,0,2,16 August 2005
Green Street Hooligans," A Powerful Movie To Say The LEAST
","I never actually saw any advertisements, trailers, screen shots nothing on this film and I'm not to fond on Elijah Wood. So when i see this is playing at my local cinema i really thought nothing of it. But then Saturday i get a call and I'm off to see the movies and in i walk not knowing what I'm going to see in the cinema. But i walk out amazed, amazed and astounded by this most powerful of movies.At the start it is a tad tedious what with the whole international boundary and the fact that Matt being a yank knows little of life on good old England. You also see at first Matt being kind off watched over by Pete which doesn't sit to well with some in the GSE. Anyways Matt has never stood his ground or fought for what he believes in, and yet all of a sudden he finds himself becoming a punch bag and the whole story works perfectly. I mean the fights as well as being intense and brutal you can always see the not so good side to them. The whole film from start to finish had me gripped, and i mean gripped this film is unbelievably good Everyone acted their parts perfectly Hunnam plays Pete perfectly as the leader of an up and coming firm he really does have a presence on screen. Leo Gregory playing Bover, Petes most loyal friend his right hand man if you real and he really does show how jealous he is again he plays his part to absolute perfection. Not forgetting good old Elijah who like i said i am not really a fan of and again even in this film i think they could have found better but even so Elijah did play his part as the vulnerable Yank turned fanatical hooligan very well but it was always his voice it just seemed a tad childish. And Geoff bell i mean could you get any more intense he was excellent the kind off evil arch nemesis in the film and was flawless doing it.But the actual power of the film is what really got to me, at the end of the film i found myself looking at my proud Newcastle strip on the wall ready for the Baggies trip and wondering in the back of my mind what is going on after the match in the pubs, back alleys and streets, and thats when this film really hits home, and it hits like a sledgehammer.Whether or not you're a gunners fan, chelski supporter a red devil or a part of the toon army, hell if you hate football to the end this film is still one of the best films you can ever see. Once you've seen it you'll see football in a different light.",10,0,0,4 October 2005
Wedding Crashers," My Friends Were WRONG
","well i went to see Wedding Crashers and judging by everyone around me i was going to come out of that cinema annoyed at paying the cinema ticket, yet when i came out i was thinking of when I'm going to see it again this film is great, the plot is nothing new, but the acting and the way the film is lay ed out is pure genius. Owen is great he never trys to overact and again hes shown that hes pulled off a grade A performance, and McAdams i mean WOW shes is very pretty indeed no wonder Owen wanted her so bad. Then you got Vaughn, i mean he cant not be funny, never really been his strong point serious movies, but when you throw him into a comedy, that film becomes so much better. Every time you saw him something was happening to him or he himself was making you laugh, he was great easily the best of the actors Then you got Walken, you gotta love Walken he never gets to old to watch, he again pulls off a great performance in this film and i was glad to see him in this film because he really is a great actor.But this film i will most certainly be getting on DVD, and i advise everyone else to thats if you have a sense of humour. Its a great film, filled with jokes and a nice romantic film for all of you that prefer that side of a movie.*and an honorary mention for Granny, she was hilarious*",9,0,3,25 August 2005
Fantastic Four," Alba and Evans demote it to 4/10
","OK, saw this film with great anticipation, on the one hand a great comic bought to movie, on the other Jessica Alba who i until this movie heard as being a great actress an upcoming star.So of course i rounded everyone up and we went to see this film. My feeling after the movie, it was great re watchable easily, acting although i think over-hyped in Albas case was solid, Gruffud has always been great and he made his mark in movies in this film, overshadowing everyone else with imperative easeThe plot although very much old news what with all the comic book series was pretty cool, not the actual goodies vs baddies goodies save the world, but i just have always liked how the fantastic 4 came to be and i think the pulled it of perfectly, the whole energy storm effect was brilliant.Then there was the actual comic to film people, i mean again very good, invisible woman looked great, The Thing was perfect just loved watching it, Flame boy was also good, at some parts seemed slightly more com icy than reality but hey it was great anyway, and Mr Fantatsic pure perfection nothing wrong with his stretching.BUT then the one thing that ruined my movie happened, now it may seem like nothing to most of you if not all, but i was watching the Ebglish premier, you know where all the stars line up to be interviewed and up came the fantastic 4 one by one, Gruffud he was great always has been, up for a laugh enjoyed chatting and his welsh accent is great, the Chiklis again great to see having a good time and of course he did the great 'Its clobbering time' quote, but then Evans and Alba, and i mean they were so dull, they seemed so bored it looked like to them saying 'Hello England' was a chore that no one should suffer, and when making jokes to Evans i mean there was no humour. And that moment ruined the film i tried to re watch it but just whenever i saw Alba and Evans i just thought, they never cared about this movie. So i walked out the cinema and vowed never to watch it againMay seem a bit sad but hey i would much rather see a film not knowing actors hated doing it than thinking someone hated doing it, cause by god those 2 tried their best to look miserableSorry but form 8/10 to 4/10",4,0,3,23 August 2005
The Island," The Island, So Nearly Lived Up To Expectations
","When i saw this i was so looking forward to it, just by seeing the trailers it looked awesome, and Ewan talking to well himself was a site, and him duplicating his Scottish accent and trying to be himself that was just pure genius.Johansson, was good enough, she wasn't anything special but i think that Ewan carried her performance throughout the film, saying that Ewan carried the film itself much like he did with Star Wars 3.Sean Bean, well hes been one of my favourite actors of all time and yet again he pulls of his bad boy role with imperative ease. He is pure evil and yet hes pure genius when it comes to him playing his parts. Ewan and Bean where the best two no other actors could have filled their shoes without ruining the film in some way.yes the film wasn't amazing, yes it wasn't anything new, but did i enjoy it..... well yes, it was great Ewan was awesome like i said nothing revolutionary in film making terms but it was a great film to just sit down to and watch. So i gave it 8/10 - - - ReWatchable- Yes - - - Buy It On DVD- Definitely",8,0,1,25 August 2005
