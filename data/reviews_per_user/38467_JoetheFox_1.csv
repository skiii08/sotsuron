Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sick, twisted, hilarious, and great
","Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is not for everyone. That said, if you can take it, it's a hilarious, offensive romp through everything wrong with today's America.Borat Sagdiev is Kazakhstan's 4th most famous news reporter, and is called upon by his government to create a documentary about America's culture, so his people can grow. Borat then ends up traveling cross-country for a new reason, feigning that he and his manager should see more of America than just New York. Complications quickly ensue.Borat, played brilliantly by Sacha Baron Cohen, is an offensive, yet lovable facsimile of Kazakhstan's finest. Meeting such people as a humor coach, women's rights activists, and even a nice Jewish couple (whom he is terrified of), Borat's shenanigans are not to be missed.",9,1,6,4 November 2006
