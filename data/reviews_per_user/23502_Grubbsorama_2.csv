The Monuments Men," Boring, slow...move along, nothing to see here
","Well, I suppose the sets were nice. I didn't go in expecting an action flick, but the characters had no depth, the story plods along and delivers NO really interesting moments. All the talent in this movie obviously couldn't save it from an extraordinarily dry script. The History Channel documentary the other night was far more interesting than this film. Half way through the film I decided to get a snack and when I asked my wife what I missed, she confirmed, nothing. I suppose this film will have a measure of interest from really fanatical WW2 buffs, but for the average movie goer, who likes historical films, nope. There just had to be a better way to tell this story than this film. Perhaps this would have been a watchable HBO film, but in the Cineplex? Not worth the gas to drive to the theater.",Null,5,11,7 February 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," No storyline...a disjointed mess
","I should have known better as it is a Tarantino movie, but this one is just all over the place. A self-indulgent POS. I don't need to feel good about myself by leaving a great 10 star review. Crap is crap....be honest.",1,108,211,29 July 2019
