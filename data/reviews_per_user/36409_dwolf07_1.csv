Alien 3," Weak compared to the Aliens that came before
","If you are a fan of the series, go see the movie. It's not as good as the others, but watch it with that in mind.(Spoilers ahead.) To be honest, I found no huge plot holes that ruined the experience for me, however, all the little flaws really added up in the end. They are not really goofs, just minor inconsistencies with the other two movies (such as how the alien first attached itself to the dog - I didn't like that because the xenomorphs never showed an interest in pets before - remember Jones the cat?). And I was really disappointed that all the survivors from the second movie were killed. Up until this point, every character that died in the series died standing up, so to speak. Its like the writer said 'Well, we can't get a contract with these actors, so we'll kill 'em off in the first five minutes.' These characters (especially Bishop) deserved more respect.Compared to the glory that was Alien and Aliens, Alien 3 added nothing new to the series. In fact, some of it flies in the face of what we've seen before.",1,213,226,28 February 2000
