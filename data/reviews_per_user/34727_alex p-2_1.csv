Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Forget the Critics, the movie is awesome!
","I just got done seeing the movie twice in a row and I wanted to write ASAP to let everyone know that this movie is excellent.  Despite everything all the artsy-fartsy critics have said to the contrary, this movie definitely should be seen and appreciated by anyone.  To Star Wars fans, this movie should not disappoint.  The effects are incredible.  This movie is worth seeing ten times just to admire the effects.  As a fan of the films, I immediately related to all of the characters and was enthralled by the story the entire time.  I even cried a couple times.  The pod race scene is classic.  The duel between Maul and the two Jedi is great.  The final twenty minutes are so exciting. Yes, Jar-Jar is kind of annoying.  But I actually found him funny at times and I understand what he was saying a lot more the second time. Some of the dialogue seems a little off, but who cares.  The minor negatives are far, far outweighed by the positives.  Even if you are going to compare this movie to the others as far as humor and characters and everything, it still deserves at least three stars.  If you judge this on its own compared to all the other trash Hollywood puts out, it easily deserves four stars.  It is a very worthy Star Wars movie and does a great job setting us up for the next two, which will for sure be just as great.  Lucas is a genius, the actors do fine, the story is interesting, the music is greats, the effects are unmatched.  The movie is excellent. Period.",10,1,1,19 May 1999
