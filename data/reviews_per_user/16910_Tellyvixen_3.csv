Hereditary," Can't score this low enough
","Awful, awful, awful that is the only word to describe this. From the actors and their characters to the plot and to the so called music that is supposed to give atmosphere but sounds like your neighbor's party at 3 am when it gets too loud, doof doof doof. Can't believe this got such high scores.",1,1,5,21 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Not as good as it should have been
",To start off they found about a 30 minutes of unnecessary screen time to add in events that weren't needed. They changed scenarios in the film to fill out the run time and just to make thing darker and grimmer and even more violent than they should have been.This is the first time I've seen Emma Watson in action. She seems a good actress but she was completely miscast for this show. Most of the cast weren't that good and the characters themselves just weren't that likable and were flat.The music and singing also just falls flat and for that matter so was the special effects. There were some lovely scenes but a lot of effects had no impact.,4,1,3,1 December 2019
The Conjuring," Best horror film watched in ages
","In all honesty I didn't know what I was going to see when I spotted this on the TV guide. I've just about given up seeing a good horror show, the type of horror film that I love. One that is reliant on scares, dark, atmospheric scenes and great acting. I also liked that this was set in 1971, somehow leaving the story in that period helped up the scariness. I'm very happy that I did give this a chance as this was the most entertaining horror film I've seen in some time. And I'd highly recommend it for a good scare.",10,0,1,2 February 2020
