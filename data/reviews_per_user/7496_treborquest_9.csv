Hereditary," WTF did I just watch?
","I hardly ever give 1 star here, even Mother got a higher rating from me, but what, no, wait, seriously? Why in the world would this movie get such raving reviews in the press? I tempered my expectations, because I saw so many bad viewer reviews, but oh my Paison how bad was this. Never have I seen so many people play with their phone during a movie. I can say a lot, but I just can't be bothered. Just don't go see it. It makes no sense, the acting is horrible, the script is horrible. everything is just horrible. what a waste of money was this!",1,4,8,5 July 2018
Aquaman," It is ok, long and very kitsch, but ok
","I don't really understand why so many people seem to look at this film as if it's god's gift to mankind. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, it was ok, quite entertaining, had some fun bits and nice action. But it was like 20 minutes too long, most of the time I thought that it couldn't be more over the top, until the next scene actually was more over the top and the CGI sucks. on top of that the acting wasn't all that great at some times and horror of all horrors, Nicole Kidman can't move her face anymore.
Maybe it's the best DC films since 10 years for some, ok, but lets not rate it 10 stars just for that. be objective, because this most certainly is not worth 10 stars. it absolutely can't live up to Black Panther if you are looking for to compare it with another movie. While watching this, I was litterally thinking that there is a reason why it took 15 years to develop Avatar and yet another 10+ years for the sequels. Because the time and money went to good CGI. This was straight out of a cheap bin full of unicornfarts dipped in care bear rainbows. Enjoy the movie for what it is, because it is enjoyable, but lets not go over the top with the ratings. the movie is over the top enough by itself.",7,8,17,13 December 2018
Get Out," Why you ask yourself
","Seriously, when I watched this, it had an 8.1 rating. I wonder why. I mean, has this movie been watched only by people who have never seen classics before? The acting is not natural, the story line is incomplete on all accounts and the entire movie is totally predictable. It's a combination of a couple of movies combined. But the story line is as unoriginal as the title itself. And then suddenly the story switches from the friend point of view, where it seems to want to become a comedy, but it never really does. This is not a horror movie. Seriously, it is insulting to all horror movies ever made to be called a movie in that genre. It is a thriller with some horror filled seconds at the most. It is never scary, it is never really keeping you on the edge of your chair. And on top of that, it's never believable. Especially the 'transplant' part. I mean, hello, it was about hypnosis, remember, and why all the white people want their brain cut in half or something and become a different race. How does it work keeping both identities alive? The other black men and women seem to just be in some kind of trance but who's inside? the husband of the older woman? and did she pick him for being a hot young black man, or what? I notice it irritates me to write this actually. it's badly written and directed, racist and stereotypical and just misguiding of genres. Want to see a good movie? Want to save some precious time in your life? Then watch anything but this.",1,277,558,28 April 2017
Don't Breathe," Seriously?
","When I watched this movie it was because it got 7.2 stars here on IMDb. But it was so bad, I seriously do not understand why it get this good ratings. The whole story does nothing special and especially does not make sense. 3 guys go for 300K and don't seem to get to an agreement until the girl needs to be helped out of her unpleasant life. From there on out it goes wrong. The motivation is wrong, the clich√©s are wrong, the backstory of the blind guy they want to rob is wrong. How does a blind guy get a girl trapped in his basement, saying 'rich girls never go to jail', but he can keep her in his own home, and cops never go look for her in his house even though he's suspect number 1 because she killed his daughter in an accident. I am still wondering how I ever came to end this movie. The dog in car part took too long, him finding her eventually was ridiculous. You know what, if you want to spend 1.5 hours of your life wasting it on a bad movie, this should be a good pick for you. end of rant.",3,1,3,23 July 2017
The Fountain," Personal favorite
","Watched this movie again for the I don't know how many times already and it hits me every time. Why this movie didn't get more nominations is beyond me. Hugh Jackman seriously deserved an Oscar for this role. So genuine, so well performed. The story is so well written. Maybe it hits home for me. watched it with my partner today and he gave it a 5, just because he didn't get it. But that's the whole thing with this movie. YOu should not try to get it, but you should feel it. Let the combination of images and music find it's way inside you. The love you can have for one person to do anything to safe his or her life. The roughness of the movie where success is just a factor you can't influence. The symbolic behind it all, taking from more than one religion and yet no propaganda of another. Almost creating it's own, creating life. I can't watch this movie with dry eyes. have tried it so many times. this, for me, truly, is the best movie ever made.",10,4,6,28 April 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Visually stunning
","Let me first say this: many negative comments here are based on comparison with the previous adaptation of the book Murder on the Orient Express. My review is based on this version the way I just viewed it on the big screen. And even though the story may be known, even though it's a star vehicle with a group of big names and not all of them get the time to truly show their strength, it works in my eyes. Why? Because of the spherical way it has been filmed. In a way, it reminded me of the Grand Budapest Hotel. And I have to say, I loved it. The book was written for entertainment, the first movie was made for that and this movie has just one purpose and that's entertainment. A good night with visual pleasure. Not to find out who did it, most of us already know. It's the way it is found out that matters. People who say it was an unnecessary remake in my eyes are in love with the first version and rightfully they are. But that does not make their review objective. If you have an open mind, if you like to be entertained. Then go watch this movie and have yourself entertained. For me, it was a pleasure from start to end. Only negative... it's a bit short. And in the end, Michelle Pheiffer can sing a nice tune during the end credits.",8,7,19,11 November 2017
Mother!," How to-movie
","Don't let my rating effect how you judge the movie, but I just came from the cinema and feel a huge need to vent, so you are going to be my audience. First of all, I have to be totally honest with you. I am one of those people who have to finish a movie before making a judgment and putting a review out there in the world. Second of all, David Aronofsky is one of my favorite movie-makers, director, producer, writer, for a while now. The Fountain is my favorite movie of all times, the only movie I wasn't a big fan of was Noah. Mother! has been on my To See-list ever since word came out it went into production and even more after seeing the trailer. I was so excited to go and see it. This must have influenced my expectations of this movie. Also, and that's where the review title comes from, I might have been influenced by the audience that was in the cinema I was in. The room was almost full, over 200 people and I went alone because I wanted to experience it in my own cocoon, not having to explain why I loved the movie so much to friends who might think otherwise. And yes, I've read raving reviews and also read about people thinking it was pretentious. So why this title? Why just a rating 1? First: how to get a cinema empty? By the time the war broke out, there were only 7 people of the 200 left, myself included. How to miss a point so much with a movie? it gives you little hints, with the chrystal, you must think either he's this or either he's that. There was one point in the movie, I can't recall when and don't want to give any spoilers, that I felt I was questioning myself if I was dreaming or not. I could just not be watching this, was I? It just didn't make sense. Yet, people kept leaving, should I leave? No, I have waited so long for this movie to come out, I should sit it out. There must be an explanation in the end. Then, the wtf moment when Kirsten Wiig appeared and she just felt so miscast in this miss. I'm not a fan of her, but it totally felt as if she just came from any other movie she made and just stumbled into this one.Somehow I have to give credits to this movie. Even though the images were grainy, some shots were visually stunning, some scenes were fantastically acted, some monologues were fantastically written.How to disappoint a fan? How to really be pretentious, even though I was ready to totally defend that? How to make a viewer feel so much emotions and not guide them into giving them a place while watching your work. How to abuse the art of movie-making? That last one is meant for a good reason, because making art is an art itself. you make it to make a statement, to evoke emotions, reactions, anything. But it only evoked anger, misunderstanding and for me sadness, because I can no longer just go to the cinema when another Aronofsky movie comes out. For one simple reason:How can this movie be unseen? I seriously wish I had never ever seen this movie. But that can't be taken away. So that's why I can only give it a 1 star rating. Even though the movie can be seen as art.",1,38,66,30 September 2017
Moonrise Kingdom," Just expected more
","Watched this movie in 2018, after watching other movies by Wes Anderson. I love The Grand Budapest Hotel and maybe I shouldn't compare, but this movie just left me.... kinda... meh. I don't know what it was, except that the acting seemed more like a parody to something than actually meant to be slightly over the top on purpose. Besides that, the whole story is too thin. I doesn't really grab you and invite you in for more. Some images are visually stunning. Especially the end on the church tower I thought looked beautiful. But in the end, it was just boring and couldn't keep my attention.",5,2,4,25 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," This has nothing to do with the Alien I know
","If you are a fan of Alien and work on a movie called Alien: Covenant, you should quit your job and be a shamed to have worked on this. I gave it 6 stars, because I enjoyed the movie and it has some OK acting in it, but while writing I kept deducting stars, because of how bad this movie is actually constructed. As many people before me already wrote. The whole movie is full of moments that are not logical. The way the characters act and react. The plot line itself. It is very predictable on every level. This movie has just been made to cash in on the legacy, but it actually spits in its face. It is truly a shame you can't take it back now anymore and start all over again. Shame Ridley! Bad Writing, bad acting, bad casting and very bad of you to actually think your audience is this stupid. I went without reading reviews, because I am a fan of the Alien movies for a long time and did not want to be influenced, but this movie is a smack in the face to a real fan. Sure, the original Alien-movies also have their flaws. But with this one, someone just had to stand up and say 'this is wrong, we need to rethink this'. Such a shame.",4,9,16,31 May 2017
