The Equalizer," Nice killing scenes, but poor story
","A classic Denzel Washington movie: his looks and faces, blazing guns and some story. And you enjoy the hell out of it! It's an entertaining movie just to watch, relax and see some shooting. The story is full of clichés, such as military background, going under the radar, prostitutes to save and all that, but, in the end, you end up liking it :)However there were some issues that I found annoying: 1) The thing with his watch, that he uses only in some parts of the movie to time his actions is never explained, 2) The old Russian Mob Cliché, 3) Old story, other actors 4) Really, no one could find that girl?! 5) And just like that get all the images for all cameras from six blocks. Yeah.",8,2,4,18 February 2015
