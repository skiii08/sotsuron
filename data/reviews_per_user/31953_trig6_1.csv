3:10 to Yuma," two great westerns; lot o' noms
","I saw 'The Assassination of Jesse James' yesterday and '3:10' today. Thought I would burn out on the genre doing the back to back. Because they're two different types of westerns, I was not bored but absolutely riveted.I am calling Peter Fonda and Ben Foster from '3:10' getting noms or awards at the end of the year and Casey Affleck getting the same. Brad Pitt, maybe, but more for Hollywood political reasons because he was excellent. I don't know if this guy has been secretly getting some acting lessons but he's definitely improved in the last 10 years. Instead of thinking 'Oh look. Brad Pitt's acting,' it's more like 'this guy is a great actor.' The scene when he apologizes to Casey Affleck is a stunner.",8,1,2,23 October 2007
