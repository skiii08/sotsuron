Skyfall," Boring, James Boring
","Jesus Christ help me. This movie sucks so hard but why all those stupid critics are praising it. Let me tell why this movie make me want to blow my screen: 1. It seems that Skyfall is made to make only profits by fooling us with adverts and reviews.2. Too many stupid plot holes, the script sucks so bad 3. The movie contains complete waste of action scenes without any proper storyline.4. No gadgets, yeah like the old lazy ways 5. Graphics of komodo dragon looks classic yeah back in the 90s 6. Poor M, she could have deserved better ending This movie seems to have very limited budget and I really hate low budget movies without proper effort and storyline. I thank you for ruining the bond series.Sorry but this is the worst directed bond and complete waste of time",1,4,11,7 March 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Better than Bond film
","Actually this movie deserves two stars but the overall rating(8.6) is way too high. Therefore I am giving it 1 star to reduce it.This movie didn't give me any enjoyment but instead gave me a lot of stressful scenes. There are too many personal problems in this movie. Batman is fictional film and suitable for any new idea, story, look and feel. However this film lacks all of them.In real life batman cannot exist. But from dark knight it started trying to be more realistic. However dark knight was good film why? it had the joker, a lot of good action scenes with his great acting, lead the film pretty good.Now the dark knight rises is completely in the same old way but however lacks the joker! Image that the previous dark night without the joker. This film should have brought completely new idea, look and feel. But this is frustrating to watch. There is no leading role in it and when the all cops running towards machine guns I was like oh god please why? why? To all directors and film makers! This is 2013 we need something brand new or something really classy or something that makes your jaw drop.Please don't waste all the money on same old bullshits again and again please!!! (P.S The Dark Knight Rises is still better than the Skyfall)",1,4,10,20 March 2013
