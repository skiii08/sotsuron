The Blair Witch Project," Sometimes its not good to find what you are looking for
","this was an ambitious project of local students.  the hand held camera technique added to the authenticity.  It was a little long but altogether not a bad thriller.  I was drawn into the plight of the young filmmakers by the little things- like the things they found outside their tent at night and the sounds.  Not the best movie in the world, but a start for these young men and women.  I look forward to further projects.",5,1,3,11 August 1999
Antz," Ants are pests!
",I only went to see this because there was nothing else appropriate for my 7 year old grandchild.  If I had known Woody Allen was the main character I would have run the other way. This movie irritated me with its preachiness and the visuals were not pleasing.  The only thing I liked was the last scene when you see it was a small ant hill near a trash-can. After the movie Matthew was playing outside and proceeded to step on all the ants he could find.,6,5,12,12 November 1998
G.I. Jane," Women can compete
","Having friends in all branches of the military service, I came to appreciate this movie.  Demi Moore is great as the woman who made SEAL- a friend of mine who is a SEAL saw this with me and said that is exactly what training is like.  Demi Moore never backs down- even when beaten by the Masterchief. She also confronts the Senator to protest her unfair treatment.  In this movie she is both strong and vulnerable.  As a woman in the military she beats the odds, but as a woman in love she has to let her boyfriend know she will NOT stand back and be patronized.  Some of the scenes were hard to watch-- especially her treatment by the Marines in charge.  All together I watched this move three times-each time I found more in it than I expected.  My boyfriend who was a Marine in combat in Vietnam also liked the movie and watched it several time.",8,1,5,12 September 2001
Erin Brockovich," A girl David takes on Goliath
","Julia Roberts is outstanding in this movie of a single mom who is able to defeat a huge corporation.  Albert Finney as the lawyer is her perfect foil. The addition of George shows that not all bikers are bad.  The reactions of the people affected by the poison are varried, showing the hearthbreak of some and the determination of others. Great film",9,1,1,21 August 2000
Se7en," Who decides the guilty?
",Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are an interesting study in contrasts for this dark probing movie.  Though parts of it are violent and gross the overall message of sin is well done. A movie that makes one think about sin and who has the right to judge.,7,1,2,16 June 1999
Amistad," Freedom at any cost
",I'd only heard of the Amistad uprising briefly in a history class. The Gambian actor who portrayed Cinque- Djimon Hounson was very good.  Also Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams makes a very good speech at the end. Spielberg takes an historic incident and turns it into a remarkable film. The court room scenes are well done and the naval scenes panoramic.,8,0,2,10 January 2000
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Music can bring love
","At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better.  I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin.  My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart.  The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans.  I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again.",8,20,31,14 September 2001
Happy Gilmore," Fore!
",Adam Sandler really knows how to make me laugh.  In this story of a hockey player who turns to golf to help his granny- he has added just enough schlock to make it funny- especially the fights on the golf course.  Not for everyone- only people who are amused by inanity.,6,1,3,5 December 1999
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Disc jockey bucks the system.
","Robin Williams is excellent as the disc jockey Adrian Cronauer  who dares to defy the powers that be in Vietnam. He knew the average age of the soldier was 19 so he played what they liked. He also treated the nationals like human beings.  The most poignant scene was as he played Louis Armstrong singing 'Its a wonderful world' the screen was showing just the opposite- poverty, death and war.  This movie makes a strong statement about the power of words on people- Adrian believed in starting the day with a laugh- his supervisors did not. He did more for morale than anyone else.  For those who watch Vietnam movies this is a must.",7,1,2,15 June 2000
Cast Away," Survival at all costs
",Once I got lost for 10 hours on an island and was panicky- how one man survived 4 years is incomprehensible to me.  One know one man who could do it- my friend Mark.... he could catch food and entertain himself like the hero of the movie did.... all is all this is a good film despite the ending-- if he had been my boyfriend I would have waited.... I enjoyed this look at survival under the harshest of circumstances... I intend to watch it another time to catch things I missed the first time.,7,0,0,14 June 2001
American Beauty," Surburbia can be lonely
","Kevin Spacey is a real chameleon- he can play any part well. I was most impressed with both how vulnerable and sleazy he could be in the same movie.  His wife, especially in the motel is a hoot unlike Mrs. Fitts- who lives next door and has no life at all.  The most interesting character in the movie is Ricky Fitts- who sees life though a video camera- maybe he is the only one who really can see what's going on... This movie made me think about life- what I have- what's important and most of all what makes me do the things I do.  It's a black film but a real eye opener... and sometimes I feel that that beautiful plastic bag that floats on the wind... A very disconcerting but satisfying film",9,0,0,3 January 2000
Being John Malkovich," Bipolar disorder in a film
",This is the most original film I have seen in years. I have always been a fan of Malkovich and Cusack.  The movie had enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.  Though a little hard to follow at times- its premise- being able to enter someone else's brain is intriguing.  Jonz did a great job of making a very unusual film.,8,1,2,6 June 2000
American History X," When people look at me they see my brother.
",I saw this movie more than a week ago and I still cannot get the images out of my head.  Edward Norton blows me away with the rage and passion he brings to parts.  I work with lots of teens and I have seen some of this rage- and the movie is right on target for what happens when rage is not dissipated. AHX is an important film showing how teachers can affect the lives of their pupils as well as parents-- like the song from South Pacific 'you've got to be taught to hate' and that is what Derek's dad did- but others taught him to be tolerant.  Norton should have gotten the academy award- but in the days of feel good movies this one is too real to win the acclaim it should have.,9,0,0,29 April 1999
The Commitments," Irish are the blacks of Europe
",Putting together a band is never easy.  This is a refreshing look at the woes of a band... and the soul music is great too...The lead singer sounds so much like Joe Cocker it was scary.... fun and more.,6,4,7,7 February 1999
Man on the Moon," Life can be an illusion
",I remember watching Kauffman on Saturday Night Live in the 70's. Carrey does a remarkable job imitating his voice and moves. it was disconcerting to see the characters of Taxi looking so old. Courtney Love was much better than I expected.  Kauffman always kept changing- his unpredictablity made him more of a performance artist than an comedian.  The music especially the title piece by REM added a lot to the mood of the movie.,6,0,0,28 December 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," stunning fight scenes
",I had heard a lot about this movie-- but I wasn't prepared for the stunning fight scenes... this was a movie both my boyfriend and I could enjoy since he has been in martial arts for 17 years.  The scenery is stunning and the fight scenes exciting.... I don't like dubbed movies since I have to read them outloud.... Great movie I intend to watch it again...,8,0,0,23 July 2001
Pi," God and math- incompatible?
","I found this movie painful to watch- the washed out black and white, the nosebleeds and the clutter of the apartment. Though I am a believer that math is a supreme science-taking pi out to a million places is not finding God.  Sean Gullette is convincing as a mad scientist- but the movie was too grating too enjoy- I like to think but not feel like my head has been drilled.",Null,1,2,15 October 1998
The Piano," The music of the heart
",The Piano is an amazing movie- the cinematography stunning- like the piano on the beach and the sinking piano at the end. There is no praise high enough for Holly Hunter's depiction of Ada. Ana Pacquin and Sam O'Neill also shine.  And Harvey Keitel- having gone native- by marking his body in the native style- gives a truly sympathetic and daring performance. This movie stays with the viewer long after it is over.  At times I actually felt the dampness of the scenery... most of all it explores the regions of the heart- through the innovative music and the body language of Hunter.  A film not to be missed by those who appreciate good story and good filmaking.  Thanks Jane Campion for this classic.,10,49,74,9 November 1998
"Girl, Interrupted"," Sanity is a tenuous state
","Angelina Jolie does a tremendous job portraying an agressively mentally ill patient.  Her performance reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cucukoo's Nest. Wynona Rider is fragile enough to fall under the stronger girls domination, but when she learns to stand up to her the whole course of the movie changes. Not since the classic Snake Pit have a seen a movie that showed what its like to be inside a mental institution.Great movie- a little hard to watch when Jolie's character is browbeating the weaker girls.",6,0,0,10 July 2000
There's Something About Mary," watch out Mary!
",Every now and then I like to watch a movie just for the fun of it and Something about Mary qualifies as mindless fun.  I laughed so hard I could forget my worries for the day-- and as usual Chris Elliot was a nut. I also liked that that the good guy won in the end. More movies should be this carefree and fun.,9,0,0,29 December 1998
Life Is Beautiful," Hope is the name of the game
","Life is Beautiful tells a story of what a man will do to save his family. Robert Benigni is both a clown and a very clever man who devises a way to protect his son. The whole movie was very uplifting except for the end.  The scenery is beautiful except in the concentration camps.  I don't know where Italian Jews were quartered, but that makes no difference, the story is the main thing of this movie.",8,1,3,17 July 2000
The Red Violin," Music and science in perfection
",I was intruigued by the title of the movie and I am glad that they waited til near the end to reveal why it was red. I liked how the movie wove together the tarot readings and the different owners of the red violin and I also liked how it was all again brought together at the auction.  I don't mind reading subtitles- that made the parts of the movie that were in Germany and China and Italy more authentic.  The music was very good and the story that most touched me was that of Kaspar Weiss the little boy with so much talent and such a weak body.  A very good film- I also enjoyed the directors other work abou Gould- he has a knack for typing music and stories together.,8,0,0,24 January 2000
Shine," Music is the universal language
",I was so mesmerized by this movie I forgot to watch the Derby. All three actors who portrayed Helfgott were astounding.  And when the Rachmaninoff piece played I couldn't take a breath til it was done-- the power of it washed over me.  The whole film portrayed the power of talent over the deprivations of love. Rarely has a movie about music done such a good job of showing the magnitude of strength required to please the muse.,7,1,1,3 May 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," There's a thin line between sanity and insanity and he crossed the line
","Jack Nicholson uses his talents for manic characters well in this movie. Louise Fletcher is stone cold and evil and an equal match for Nicholson. The whole movie from start to finish makes you wonder how you would react to such a situation.  I like the twists and the turns in the movie especially one the with Indian chief.  Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito and others round out this great ensemble movie about life in the mental ward. Cucukoo's Nest sets a standard for how mental institutions should NOT be run. Nicholson as R.P, McMurphy portrays one of the most memorable characters from literature. A must see movie.",9,1,3,10 July 2000
The Green Mile," A man may be more than he seems- both good and bad
","Despite the 3 hour length, this movie held me from start to finish. Everything was pieced together well- from the plots of the guards to the final revelations.  Tom Hanks was great as usual and Mike Duncan as John Coffey really gets the soul of his character across on film.  The writing was so good you either loved or hated a person- there was no inbetween- Billy the Kid and Percy were truly despicable.  Michael Jeter's character touched me as did James Cromwell as the warden.  Great acting, great writing and a very well put together film- it deserves some awards.",8,0,0,28 December 1999
The Waterboy," Underdog tops the heap!
","I love an underdog- and Waterboy is lower than the belly of an underdog. Normally I avoid inane movies but I needed to entertain a teenage girl for the evening while the boys played pool so we went to see Waterboy... and I hate to admit it but I enjoyed it too! I love Kathy Bates and couldn't wait to see what she served next- snake, whole gator and frog muffins! Jerry Reed was appropriatly mean and Winkler nerdy... and I loved the football scenes-- whoever did Sandler's stunts is a terrific blocker and tackler.  RAh rah sis boom bah ( the cheerleaders were a hoot) for Waterboy!",Null,0,1,30 November 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," As Pandora knew with hope we can survive anything
","I went in to give blood- the staff was watching this.. needless to say several orange juices and cookies later I was still at the blood bank, laughing and crying with the staff.  This is a remarkable movie for its subtlety- I like the fact that no one ever knew Andy was digging a tunnel- I like how he tells his friend to look a certain place if he ever gets out- and I like the message of hope for those who feel hopeless. Stephen King outdid himself with the story and Robbins and Freeman do wa wonderful job with the script they were given. Just to see the words ' brooks was here' and then 'so was Red' add those little touches that makes a movie great. A movie that deserved more accolades.",9,0,1,27 January 1999
Platoon," War changes everyone
",I lost three friends in Vietnam. When my friend who was green beret came home the summer of 1967 he described the war to me. This movie has everything in it from the night watches to the drug activity. My friend went back for a second tour and died in 1968.  Charlie Sheen plays everyman in this film and he watches how war makes some men heroes and other animals. Bereger and Dafoe are good examples of how men change.  Oliver Stone has done a great service by depicting the war as it really was.  In my opinion this is the best Vietnam movie ever made.,9,0,0,30 May 2000
Blow," Cocaine destroys lives
","Having worked with addicts in the past in a treatment center, I have seen this story first hand.  Johnny Depp does a fine job portraying the type of character that got involved with the whole scene.  It is a dirty world- a lot of my patients were desperate people.  This movie does a good job showing the deception and dangers of the profession.  The movie also shows how everything that touches these people gets destroyed or lost.   I would reccommend that parents make their children see this- it would to a lot of good to keep kids off drugs.",7,0,0,22 September 2001
The Deer Hunter," One shot kill
","Unlike a deer who cannot prevent his own death, in the Deer Hunter the friends can but they choose not to.  This is a powerful statement about the effect of war on men-- some get stronger, some get weaker and some never recover.  The ensemble works well here- Deniro as the strong one, Savage as the wounded one and Walken as the one who is destroyed.  The Russian Roulette scenes are the most powerful ones in the movie.  A tour-de-force of film making showing the Vietnam era in a small industrial town.",7,1,2,20 June 2000
The Sixth Sense," Sometimes love transcends all
",This is one of the most remarkable movies I've ever seen. Osmet deserves an award for the way in which he plays Cole a boy who can see dead people.  The writing is excellent- building up to the surprising climax. I liked that Bruce Willis was low-keyed enough to let Cole be the focus of the movie.  The plotting was thoughtful and slow build up draws you into the boy's terrible gift- but a rare gift it is.  Everyone who likes well made movies should see this.,10,0,0,14 August 1999
Gladiator," What we do today affects eternity!
","I have always loved movies that deal with ideals like love, hate and revenge.  This movie has all three. Russell Crows does a great job playing the slave that gets revenge and frees his men.  As my boyfriend said as we were watching the movie- life is fight or die.  Rome its rise and fall have always fascinated me.  This movie embodies both the good and bad about the Roman empire.  As a whole the move held my attention. The stunts were great and the music too.  I am glad that I rented it.  I plan to watch it several more times.",8,0,0,3 April 2001
The Wedding Singer," Romantic comedy that passes muster
","Whoever would have thought that Adam Sandler could be both a romantic and a comedic star at the same time.  I thought this was a light but nice movie because Sandler was so nice to some of the people at the weddings.  Of course the theme of boy loses girl and gets a better girl is overdone, but it fits here because Julia is as nice as singer boy.  The music is great and I laughed really hard at Love Stinks and the song her wrote and sang to Julia.",7,1,1,17 November 1998
