Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No Criticism - Just Thoughts...
","Who could ever resist the power of the well-known prologue followed by the well-known ,Star Wars' theme combined with the well-known ,Star Wars'-logo entering the screen? Certainly not me. The struggle for the premiere tickets was worth it. The first 30 seconds of every ,Star-Wars' movie create a kind of adrenaline rush that other movies seldom deliver. I got sucked into the story right from the start, checked back in to reality after the curtain closed, and went home with the ,Imperial Stormtrooper'-theme banging in my head. Wait a second...the Imperial theme? There goes the neighborhood.I went to see ,The Phantom Menace' a second time, without the hype of a premiere and 100% hardcore-fan-audience-vibes around. Now what does it say about a movie if the warmest moment happens with  R2D2 entering the screen for the first time, bringing back that  good old family-feeling? Obviously something works extremely well, if a metal can with wheels becomes a beloved friend through moving pictures. On the other hand the emotional depth of the film cannot be that big, if a moment like that sticks out as much as it does.  While in the old ,Star Wars' films you had characters like Han Solo, Darth Vader or Princess Leia, in the new one not much charisma is offered. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor both suffer from what I would call the ,Luke Skywalker' effect, though the creation of the not so perfect Jedi Qui Gonn Jinn definitely is a point in  the writing that stands out. Credits go to Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Pernilla August and Samuel L. Jackson who is able to create charisma and presence within the few moments he appears. Yoda is always welcome and Darth Maul has a short but memorable part. The duel between him, Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gonn Jinn is one of the best moments in the film. John Williams' composition and the choreography of the lightsabre-fight create a truly powerful moment. The computer animation of course is impressive but I feel that it still lacks some heart and soul. Jar Jar Binks so far has not convinced me -in fact the escape from Jar Jar Binks planet has its lengths- , only  the rough blue salesman on Tattoine gets the credit (!). Probably that is connected to the direction of this movie that might have been better, especially concerning the relationship between Anakin and his mother. For the story I would have wished more. The first part could have gotten to the root cause of everything. Where does the emperator come from, how did the bad things all get started, etc.But let's not forget that we're talking about the first episode. The first act, so to speak. The exposition. Since I find ,Return of the Jedi' far more thrilling than ,A new Hope' I can't say how much I'm looking  forward to see episode II (episode III is more than words right now...). Everything now is in place, therefore ,The Phantom Menace' can be considered a good exposition that is -to some significant extent- able to stand alone as one entertaining film. And in the end of Episode II or III  there might be a new Han Solo, a new Princess Leia, a new Chewbacca, a new theme to remember. So everybody go and see this movie. Get fascinated by the wisdom of Yoda, the theory of the force and the darkside and make George Lucas what he deserves to be: richer and more appreciated than he already is. For the future I politely ask to see better writing and direction, but whatever happens: ,Star Wars' is ,Star Wars', George Lucas is George Lucas.And by the way, if You feel uncomfortable with all the ,sci-fi' hype surrounding you, remember: it's just a fairy tale with knights, queens and princesses...and the good side that wins...",6,0,1,21 November 1999
The Matrix," This One Will Last
","'Forget about the screenplay, it's all about the effects', they said.When I went to see the film at an exclusive midnight premiere I didn't know anything about the film. 144 minutes later I decided to never go to an exclusive midnight premiere again. The punishment was the knowledge that I would not be able to see the film again until its official screening one full week later. Somehow I survived.The story is mind-blowing and discusses a lot of essential questions about reality, everyday life, who each one of us is and who decided it that way.The protagonist, Thomas Andersen, not really satisfied with his existence as an average employee, finally gets the contact he had always been seeking. A group of ,matrix-resistant' individuals share their knowledge about the ,matrix' with him and furthermore tell him that he was chosen to put an end to that fake reality.The exposition of the story and the characters is great. The film starts within the very first second but still leaves the viewer unsure about what ,really' is going on. Is Thomas A. Anderson only dreaming? Or is he really ,Neo'? Is ,Neo' more than just a night-life name? Is ,Neo' Thomas A. Andersons true identity? The way the story unfolds is thrilling and the turning points come with good timing. One of two weak points in the story comes when the writers-directors must get Neo to confront his antagonist. Trinity at that point has to play the poor part of bringing on the delay. The way we got to know her throughout the film makes it anything but convincing that she would start long talks at that rather delicate moment.Whoever wants to criticize Keanu Reeves for his acting probably has a problem with actors that don't show that they are acting while they are acting. He's not in flirtation with the audience or the critics while he's performing. He's too busy doing a great and extremely convincing job. I have never been a fan or something so please consider me as neutral. Lawrence Fishburne is the most charismatic Morpheus I could ever imagine, and the rest of the cast is the perfect choice also. Carrie-Anne Moss handles the extremes between the cool ,matrix-trinity' and the sensitive ,reality-trinity' impressively well. Stock music rarely works in movies but when Rage Against The Machine hit it after Neo flies away in the end, something just works.I don't see ,The Matrix' as bringing on  easy answers. Every answer is followed by a question, and ,the one' in the end only becomes ,the one' because he chose himself to become ,the one'. Nothing more, nothing less. While the matrix is all clean and colorful, reality is dirty and cold. The parts of the dialogue who deal with essential questions (like 'what is the matrix') are brilliantly written and convincing -apart from that other weak point that irritates me, concerning the machines and how they got the power. I suggest you go and check that for yourself ...It's surprising to see deep-thought-subjects being discussed in a ,mainstream' Hollywood movie -especially at that length. Since the Wachowski Brothers had troubles to get the project financed, it might not be that ,mainstream' anyway. In fact, at least the outlook of the film is ,avant-garde'. Ground-breaking camera-technology and breathtaking choreography of the fighting scenes team up with innovative direction. Neo's ,wake-up' scene in the incubator, the showdown or ,the white room' won't be forgotten so fast.Since the first human being was walking on the planet, there have been speculations about what is real, if or how that might be proven, and what kind of consequences that might have. Therefore not too many themes could be more classical than the one of ,The Matrix'. But it's not only classical, to some it might be scary: it invites us to see parallels in our world, igniting questions about who -based on what kind of legitimacy- makes all the rules and how much power each of us has in that game.The choice of the theme and the way the theme is presented is what truly makes this film the first film of the next millennium. It already has entered movie history.",10,2,4,21 November 1999
