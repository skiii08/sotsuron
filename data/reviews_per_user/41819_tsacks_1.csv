The Legend of Bagger Vance," Better than the sequel
","Shameful! ninny ninny I have never in all my 28 years on God's green and pastoral earth been witness to such a travesty as the aforementioned NINNY of a film! I was shocked! And so was my wife! We expected a pleasant enough film about a Bagger named Vance but all we got was poppycock and bullhicky! I've never been so embarrassed in all my life and you should have seen my wife blush! A crimson hue, no less!A disgrace! Is he making fun of us?! What does he take us for?! A cat on the roof could make a better film than this! I'm no chump! Worthless! I would never genuflect in front of this director! Never! Atrocious!",10,0,1,9 October 2012
