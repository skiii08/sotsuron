Casablanca," The acting or the cinematography?
","I can not tell what it is that made this movie so good. Was it the smoke filled rooms barely lit, and the strategic lighting used to build the mood, or was it the great performance by Humphrey Bogart. Every scene seems like it was deliberately thought out where every piece of light and every extra sound would come in to form a perfect setting. Also the casting seemed perfect for the movie where if someone else had played any of the main characters the movie would not have had the same feeling as it does now. I think everything together made this movie as good as it is.",9,1,1,20 October 2018
