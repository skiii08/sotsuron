Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," only very occasionally funny
","I've been on the floor with laughter quite a few times when watching Ali G on TV, and given the generally ecstatic reviews of Borat, I had high hopes of this movie. While there are a few good gags in the first half (e.g. the feminists' reaction to Borat/the kids' reaction to the bear), most of the film is simply a succession of puerile teenage pranks and/or variations on 'you've been framed' TV humor: present unsuspecting people with a weird situation and film their reactions. If your idea of humor is, for instance, to enjoy watching two stark naked men wrestling on a bed and then racing around a hotel, still stark naked, and laugh at the surprised/shocked/amused reactions of the onlookers, you'll enjoy this movie. But of you like humor that contains a little more artistry and nuance, stay well away. Oh, and as for the supposed social commentary, this is very very lame. Everyone knows that there are some narrow-minded, bigoted people in the US (as there are in other countries). The movie could have done something creative, and funny, with Borat's encounters with them, but instead there only a few brief scenes like this, and they're just facile.",1,1,3,13 April 2009
Gremlins," what a difference 36 years make!
","I saw this movie in the cinema when it came out, and my friends and I thought it was uproarious fun. So locked in quarantine I suggested to the family we watch this, and 36 years later it really comes across as a B-movie, and a bad one at that. The exposition, the time during which nothing of note happens, is at close to an hour far too long, and the acting is bad and none of the characters are particularly engaging or interesting, so it truly is boring. When mayhem breaks loose the movie gets funnier, but actually, the action is very undeveloped and uninvolving, and by this stage is fully played for laughs, losing some of the menace that could have made the movie more interesting. Our 2020 teenagers were not impressed.",3,2,5,7 April 2020
Bolt," Different movies bolted into one
","This is three entirely different movies bolted into one. The extended opening sequence shows Bolt as the superhero in a sci-fi TV action programme, with lots of shooting, explosions, creepy characters and military hardware, and is far too scary and aggressive for young children.Then there's an extended Bolt-in-Hollywood section, with lots of nods to the adults, in which virtually everyone is cynical and extremely unsympathetic, while Bolt with his delusional pumped-up ego also was hard to warm to. The (in-)jokes simply weren't funny, and everything left such a sour taste in the mouth that I switched the movie off after 38 minutes... my two kids (10 and 7) didn't protest, which says something.I later watched the rest alone to be able give this movie a fair review, and discovered the lengthy cute though also rather predictable middle section, which is suitable for younger kids, but probably would bore the over 10s. The end section is a kind of Frankenstein attempt to bolt all elements together, and in doing so tries to be all things to all people, and rather predictably failed. The movie is beautifully drawn, but the story simply does not hold together, and only the hamster provided some laughs.Finally, is it just me or is an obsession with military hardware and uniforms and violence beginning to creep into all American children's' movies? The relentless exposure of kids (and adults) to military-style footage, costumes, weapons, communication, language, action, etc implicitly legitimises war. IMDb's Parents Guide section, with its endless lists of 'facts' without providing any context, also has has become totally useless in warning us which kids' movies glorify the military and violence, and which don't. 'Arthur Christmas' is another example: no warning whatsoever that Santa's exploits are presented like a military operation, complete with flak jackets and the lot.",3,4,12,8 January 2013
The Pursuit of Happyness," A stupid, hypocritical, depressing movie.
","So at the very end of the movie, after spending well over 6 months in movie time making wrong life choices and selling his soul to The Man and suffering greatly and being partly responsible for enormous suffering of his son and wife, The Man finally decides to give Chris a tiny piece of the big money cake. There's no creativity, no light, no brilliance, just suffering, submission, and hard work. And this is supposed to be an inspiring morality tale?I had great hopes of this movie, and throughout was willing myself to love it, despite its extensive longueurs and the fact that Chris kept making very questionable decisions. The suffering was relentless, and I kept hoping that it would all make sense in the end. It didn't. Chris did not make it big by inventing something, by being original, by taking the path less traveled. No, he made it big by buying wholesale into the capitalist American dream, where only money and hard work matter.I should have known right at the start that this movie wasn't going to be a social critique, despite the gritty images. The dreadful sentimental music was a dead give-away that that the grittiness was all surface, and the heart of the movie was one long justification of a sick system: the idea that anyone can make it if you work hard enough. This myth is one of the many sicknesses of the American system, because the fact is, only the odd person makes it in this way, because the system is dramatically skewed in favor of the already rich.The only thing that makes this movie watchable is Will Smith's performance. And as you get dragged along by this, for nearly 2 long hours, all the time waiting for a moment of transcendence, of redemption, of inspiration, it only becomes obvious in the very last minutes that the movie has its heart entirely in the wrong place.Intelligent perspectives could have been given on the fundamental unfairness of the system, on race, and on other things. But in the end, the only things that matter are money, and the way to get it is by sucking up to The Man and working harder than anyone else. It leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. What a stupid, empty, depressing movie. Ugh.",1,1,1,24 April 2020
