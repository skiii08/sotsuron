Deepwater Horizon," A dramatized documentary about the disaster on Deepwater Horizon with spectacular visual effects driven action
","Deepwater Horizon isn't an action movie by definition. I would much rather call it a dramatized documentary of the incident.The first half of the film despite it's lack of action is still very meaningful as it takes it's time to properly set up the characters so that when bad stuff starts to happen you can really care about them. It also does a great job building tension by showing all the necessary precautions not being taken in order to save money as oppose to avert the disaster. All of it is done through some of the most mesmerizing editing I have seen all year.Once the inevitable disaster finally happens we are in for some of the most intense action sequences this year has to offer. I admire Peter Berg's direction of it. One wide shot of a huge explosion, a quick look at the outside world responding to the situation and after that you are looked in with our heros. What I appreciate the most about Berg's direction is the fact that at no point he ever lets the explosions outshine our heros. They are the ones that are always in the foreground, they are the ones we should care about.Which brings me to my one small issue I have with the film, though the more I think the more I realize that it's probably just me who went into this film expecting a bit too much of an action movie then what this film actually is. So basically soon after the disaster strikes the action doesn't go on for very long, or at least I felt like it didn't. But let me emphasize again the action that I did get was nothing less of spectacular and I will gladly take quality over quantity. Once again, I don't think I have seen or will see a film this year with better visual effects, sound design and editing (maybe Rogue One).Deepwater Horizon tells a brilliantly executed story of a struggle workers went through on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that April in 2010. A perfect follow-up to the first collaboration of 'The Bergs' (Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg), Lone Survivor, which if you liked but found it somewhat disturbing at times, then Deepwater Horizon fixes all that and you nor anyone else should waste no time before seeing this film. It's one of the best of the year, period.",9,2,5,1 November 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A reason there is WAR in Star WARs
","The most important thing to note about Rogue One is that this is not a Star Wars episode, nor it should be. Rogue One is more than anything a war movie in a Star Wars universe.Knowing Gareth Edwards is directing it, one thing was certain: this movie will look damm good. Well that would be a massive understatement. Rogue One is a perfection in visual effects, cinematography, sound design, action directing, really technically this movie is gold standard and something that every other film period should aspire to match, despite this being a near impossibility. The only exception is one of the two motion capture characters, which is only in a shot for like 4 seconds and that's it. Gareth Edwards is to be praised for his work on this film. This is easily one of the best directed Star Wars and 2016 movies.This film does such a magnificent job at just not letting you feel sit comfortably as there is a war raging across the galaxy. It's unlike anything we have ever seen in other Star Wars movies. Our main protagonist Jyn Erso, which by the way was portrayed beautifully by Felicity Jones, is not some who am I, adventure hungry heroine like Anakin, Luke or Rey, nor are the rest of the characters of which we don't learn much, since they aren't meant to look as heroes but as normal people who got caught in this messy situation.Another praise-worthy aspect of this movie is that Rebellion is also forced into morally ambiguous actions in this desperate time. This is perfectly portrayed through a character of Cassian Andor played terrifically by Diego Luna. On the Empire side of things, Ben Mendelsohn did such an excellent job playing Director Krennic, you honestly feel for him.Speaking of characterization, the one issue I have with this film is that after the opening sequence the film does drag a bit for the rest of the first act, though it does have moments of brilliance in the mix. After that the movie is pretty much perfect. It also addresses and forever fixes a problem Star Wars fans had for decades and turned it into an in-joke in a very satisfying manor.The second act is great, but the third act... This is where you are in for some of the best action Star Wars has to offer. And once again it's not a cool lightsaber fight or anything like that, it's a dirty realistic war sequence, where the stakes are high, if they don't succeed it's game over. It's definitely on the closer to the R rating side of PG13.Oh, and yeah, Darth Vader isn't a whole lot in the movie, but towards the end he has the greatest Star Wars moment since, 'I am your father'. More memorable than anything in Return of the Jedi, prequels or The Force Awakens (which I loved).Everything about this movie is just so different, not just in comparison to Star Wars, but against the whole Hollywood norm. It sucks you in this dark and tense world where nothing is for granted, not even your life or peace and who would've thought that it's Disney to do it. The characters never asked to be heroes, their selfless actions and willingness to sacrifice everything made them that.Just before I sign off, I just have to say that the chemistry between Jyn and Cassian was executed flawlessly. They remind me a lot of Cage and Rita from Edge of Tomorrow. At first they view each other as a troublemakers, but through the course of the film they both realise of the greatness in each other and it all pays of in one of the most gut- wrenching finales there are.And without spoiling anything, the way the film ends is great, once again very much against the Hollywood norm, but just so fitting to the rest of the movie as well as to A New Hope, which you will never see in the same light as you did before. Rogue One gives gravity to the events in that movie. Just hang in there through the first act and let your mind be blown by the end. And after the credits roll just say to yourself 'this is a Disney movie'.'Rogue One, may The Force be with you.'",9,3,8,2 January 2017
Oblivion," A stunningly beautiful, mind twisting sci-fi thrill-ride. Just don't watch trailers.
","As I said, the biggest problem with this movie is the fact that trailers ruin so many other-wise completely unexpected plot twists. And since I advised you to stay away from those, I feel like it's my duty to tell you what you need to know about the film before going into it. Here we go. Earth got invaded by aliens, we won the war by ruining it with nukes and now we are getting ready to leave it and Tom Cruise's character Jack Harper, who is one of the last few people still on Earth, is tasked with defending the final stages of preparation of our departure. That's it. Very briefly that's all you need to know.This movie does have a slow build-up, introducing you to our two main characters of Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough, followed by a mind-blowingly beautiful reveal of the world they live in and their job in it. Immediately you can tell that something is not right in this world, that there is something greater going on and I adored this aspect of the film. You also get to see some cool action sequences that mainly introduce you to the so called scaves, the renegades of an alien army that attacked us.Now it's time to talk about by far the best thing about this film. Cinematography and visual effects. They. Are. Mesmerizing. The gorgeous desolate wasteland in an awe-inspiring wide shots (often notably shot in camera) and completely seamless CGI make Oblivion one of the most beautifully looking films I have seen in my life. Let me emphasize this... CGI is completely seamless. There are so many instances where I just can't tell if what I'm seeing is real or visual effects. When the CGI is so good that you can't tell that it's CGI, that is praise-worthy. There is always that one shot that makes you go 'oh, that's CGI'. There is not a shot that is even remotely close to that in Oblivion. Same goes to Cladio Miranda, once again proving that he is one of the best cinematographers we have.The structure of the story is so that you can learn and discover new things about the past and the events taking place prior to the world's desolation through flashbacks and this is where we get to my one very slight problem with the film. Though these flashbacks are very meaningful, they sometimes take you by surprise, often during a sequence that you were already really sucked in. But they by no mean break the immersion or hinder the storytelling, is just that they often happen when you didn't expect them. This is the only reason this film doesn't get 10 out of 10.Also, if you ever feel that other characters besides Tom Cruise are kind of underdeveloped just wait until the grand reveal that wonderfully concludes the film, while leaving a good number of thing ambiguous.Oh, and yeah, the score for the film from M83, huuuhhh... wow.Overall I adored this film, it's one of the best looking film I've seen, pristinely directed, well acted, mind bending, meaningful... and it leaves us wondering what will be the next visual treat we get from Joseph Kosinski.",9,4,5,7 September 2016
Watchmen," The most stylish superhero film ever made
","This review is based on the three and a half hour ultimate cut of the film.For decades now superhero films have been considered strictly as entertaining movies and not something to be considered an actual art. It wasn't till one of the greatest filmmakers of our time Christopher Nolan stepped into the genre with his Batman films that made people realize that big budget blockbusters can also be an intellectual pieces of art. This is Zack Snyder taking a shot at it.The film opens up with what is one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen, setting up a mystery that the protagonist Rorschach is trying to solve. In only a couple of minutes Snyder was able to set a tone and atmosphere for this dark and bleak world with some truly awe inspiring cinematography with slow-motions, brilliant sound design and intense and violent cut-throat action. All of the above remain excellent through out the entire runtime of the film. Since then the film slows down considerably however due to its three and a half hour runtime that does not hinder the amount of action in this film. There are some truly great performances in this flick as well and the first one I have to mention is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He. Was. Phenomenal. And easily the best part about the film in a good way. You truly cared about his character. But not just him. Patrick Wilson once again proved that he is very underrated actor. He had a great chemistry with Malin Akerman who otherwise played a less likable character in Silk Spectre IIBut really what sets this film apart from other superhero movies is the artistic neo-noir element and Snyder's signature direction. The visual storytelling in this film is truly mesmerizing. This most definitely is not your standard by the numbers superhero blockbuster, this is almost an art-house neo-noir thriller story told in a vain of an action flick. It all concludes in a perfectly fitting and disturbing ending that will keep you quiet for the rest of the evening. For this film Zack Snyder truly deserved a title of an auteur. It's easily his best work. I have yet to see a more stylish and artistic superhero film then Watchmen. Not a film for anyone, but that makes it so much better for other like me.This is also my very first review that I have ever written on IMDb, as I feel not enough people have paid a proper attention to this masterpiece. This is what happens when brilliant filmmaker that is Zack Snyder isn't dictated by for money greedy studios.",10,3,6,29 August 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Nearly no movies came out since it's release that surpassed this sci-fi action adrenaline thrill ride
","When I originally saw this film when it got released I got obsessed with it for months. By the end I had a near high. To this day there has only been a couple if any films that surpassed Edge of Tomorrow. This is one of the best of these action and sci-fi combined movies of all time and quite possibly the best alien invasion movie...ever, honestly. So what makes it that way.First let me say this... This film never, ever, thinks of it's audience as a bunch of idiots, there is never that unnecessary scene that tells you everything you already know. The exposition is kept to a bear minimum and when it does happen, you wanted it to happen, because it's simply the best way to explain some way to complex concepts. Plus, let us not forget that we are watching a summer action blockbuster here, not Mulhollad Drive.Next, in terms of action, this is one of the best action movies of this decade. Doug Liman does not use his shaky Bourne's style for this flick. There are many beautiful long wide shots of practical and gritty action with some jaw-dropping stunt work.But really what elevates this film to it's glory is not the spectacular action, nor it's bizarrely original idea of reliving the same day over and over again, but masterfully written characters.Best characters are those that you can look at the beginning and at the end of the film and they are completely different. That's the definition of Tom Cruise's character of Cage. Emily Blunt's character, Rita Vrataski is to this day my favorite 2014's female character. She is not in this film just so Tom Crusie can save her every two minutes (if anything it's the opposite). She never appears as an object, she has a clear role, she has to be there. The chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt is excellent. You need to keep in mind that Tom knows her for days weeks, but for her it's the first time every time. There is also no unnecessary romance between them. It's very subtle and when it does occur it only furthermore improves the film.Another thing that could hinder this film but ended up being utilized brilliantly is the fact that the entire movie is just a repetition of the same day, but because they went to the comedic aspect of the situation it works wonderfully for the movie.And without spoiling anything, the third act, while different from the rest of the movie, made me sweat harder than any other film I can remember.I do not have a single flaw with Edge of Tomorrow. Because of it's unparalleled originality and pristinly written character by Christopher McQuarrie and other writers, this is a perfect sci-fi action flick in every way possible. Edge of Tomorrow absolutely deserves the highest rating in 10 out of 10. It's one of the all time greatest sci-fi films.",10,2,5,6 December 2016
