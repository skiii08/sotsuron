Source Code," Groundhog Day but bad
","While it isn't the worst thing to put on when your bored, it isn't great and just feels like Groundhog Day but bad",4,0,2,16 April 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Its... fine
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the type of film that when you first watch it, its great, best Star Wars movie yet. However, the more you re watch it, the more it begins to worsen until its just another bland movie to come from Hollywood.",4,4,9,16 April 2020
Knives Out," How did the director of TLJ direct this?!
",Knives Out is a really clever movie and you suspect everyone. Everyone gives a great performance and the screenplay is perfect. Cannot wait until the sequel,9,3,6,16 April 2020
The Prestige," A masterpiece
",A masterpiece. There is not a single second that doesn't make sense or is a contrivance.,10,1,1,16 April 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Its fine
","While Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is not a great film, and not nearly as good as its predecessors, I can agree that it is better than the next films to come out of this watered down franchise and it can be fun at times but still leaves you disappointed.",5,1,2,16 April 2020
Toy Story 4," Great animation, crap movie
","While the animation is gorgeous and the voice acting is great as usual, Toy Story 4 unfortunately fails as a film and a sequel to one of the best trilogies ever. The film attempts to justify itself by bringing back Bo Peep, however it is still a very pointless sequel and should have either never even been made or have been another short.",3,1,1,16 April 2020
The Lion King," A great story turned awful
","The Lion King is a very emotional story, so the best direction Disney and Jon Favreau thought to take it would be live action animals which cannot show ANY emotion on their faces. It is a basic destruction of character. I laughed out loud when Scar said he saw the fear in Mustafa's eyes when he killed him, because how can you see ANYTHING in those eyes other than pupils and the other mandatory things to seeing. The stage play showed more emotion in their eyes and I was sitting as a distance so that I couldn't even see their eyes",2,2,3,16 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A mess
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to fail not only as an addition to the Star Wars franchise, but as a sequel to The Force Awakens. What promised to be a fine trilogy of films, turned into a tug of war between two directors- Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams, with Bob Iger, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney putting in a load of crap into the rope. It was because of The Last Jedi that made me decide that the sequel trilogy or any of the the Disney Star Wars canon isn't canon. The eighth Star Wars film fails on almost every level.",2,7,9,16 April 2020
The Dark Knight," A Masterpiece
","After reviving the seemingly dead Batman franchise, Nolan attempted a sequel to his 2005 film, and he did not manage to make it on the same level as Batman Begins, he soared past that level and made one of the greatest films ever made. The Dark Knight is what effected the superhero industry ever since its 2008 release.",10,0,0,16 April 2020
Avatar," Stunning to look at but nothing else
","Avatar is famous mostly because of its revolutionary CGI, however it doesn't have much substance story wise. While it is visually stunning, Avatar doesn't give anything else except spectacle.",5,2,4,16 April 2020
WALLÂ·E," A Masterpiece
","WALL-E is one of those rare films that was really relevant when it came out, but the more time progresses, it becomes even more relevant.",10,1,1,16 April 2020
Finding Dory," Fine
","I never really liked Dory in Finding Nemo, though she was fine in it and I could stand here. She was a slightly charming character. However, not charming enough to make a full film about. Unfortunately, this sequel/spin-off of Pixar's classic does not deliver enough to be held next to Finding Nemo. But the animation is great as usual and I do like many of the characters and at the same time, it is very emotional and delivers a fine experience at the end of the day and isn't just something to put on to entertain kids for two hours, its good for adults too.",5,0,1,16 April 2020
Arrival," Fantastic
","In 50 years, people are going to look back at films that came out in this generation and Arrival is going to be the 2001: A Space Odyssey of the 21st century",10,0,0,16 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Just bad
","The Dark Knight is one of my favourite films, and I want to like this film, I do, but I just can't. I envy those who love this film but I can't. The Dark Knight Rises is not just disappointing because it is a bad film, but it is disappointing because it comes off the coat tails of the 2008 masterpiece.
Unfortunately, I cannot talk about this film without going through some of the huge plot holes, so spoilers I guess.Nolan did not want to make three Batman films, he only wanted to make the two, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, however Warner Bros roped him back in to complete the trilogy. It is quite apparent that Nolan didn't really want to make this film. There are the obvious problems with the script, like the infamous time skipping from when Wayne escapes the prison to managing to get to Gotham extremely quickly, and everyone has talked about that so I'm just going to skip it.Now, is everyone in Gotham an idiot? I cannot believe for a second that anyone would believe Batman, the protector of Gotham, The Dark Knight, would have killed all these people and Harvey Dent. At what point has anyone seen Batman with a revolver? Surely no one would believe that Batman killed Dent nor killed anyone, especially seeing as he left Joker alive.The Dark Knight Rises has much to many things packed into it's two and a half hour run time.I don't think that anyone needed a sequel to The Dark Knight, so this film does just feel like a contrived, over packed mess of a finale to a pretty good trilogy up until this point. If you do like this film, I am very jealous, but I just couldn't enjoy this film. I suggest you rewatch the film if you enjoyed it because I doubt it will hold up to your memories.",3,1,4,16 April 2020
Signs," Pretty good
","I actually really like this film. Sure it isn't as good as the sixth sense, however I just like it for some reason. I hate some of the stuff in it though, like the mother saying Joaquin Phoenix (who is great in it) to swing low as if she was some carrier of a message which I'm not sure I like. The aliens coming to a 90% water based planet when their weakness is water seems really stupid. But I really think it is a suspenseful flick and really enjoyable.",6,0,1,16 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Needs to be rewritten
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens brings us back to the captivating galaxy far, far away, however perhaps not in the best way. While the film is fine in total, the script should have perhaps been through a few more redrafts before being put to the big screen. The Force Awakens does manage to re-introduce us back to the world and it does that fairly well but I cannot ignore the blatant problems with the story, one being that the rise of the first order immediately takes away the victory of Return Of The Jedi. A decent addition to the franchise, and in no way as bad as the prequel trilogy, but still quite flawed.",3,14,16,16 April 2020
