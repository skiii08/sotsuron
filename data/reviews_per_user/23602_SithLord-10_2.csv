Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Greatest Movie of All Time!
","Now most might disagree with me on this being the greatest movie ever have to realize the fun factor of this film.  Sure, the acting isn't the greatest, the directing is slightly shady at some times, and some of the dialogue was bad.  However you can't deny the joy of watching this film in the theater. For 2 hours and 10 minutes I was sucked into the Star Wars Universe and thought of nothing else.  Some felt disappointed with this film about the lack of how Anakin would turn to the dark side.  You have to realize that this is part of a trilogy and not all the questions will be answered.  Also, critics complain about there not being enough evil. Well, this was a more peaceful and happy time in the galaxy and the lack of evil will make it even more painful when you see how depressed the galaxy becomes in the control of the Empire.  And Jar-Jar being a racial stereotype is one of the most outrageous things I've ever heard. He is a Gungan, an ALIEN! All in all I give this movie a 10 for pure enjoyment value",10,0,0,28 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 2nd Greatest Movie of all Time
","This movie is the greatest of the original trilogy and in my eyes is second only to Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.  This installment has emotion, action, plot twists and is a pure joy to watch.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
