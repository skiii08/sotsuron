Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Blade, Vampire D, Let the Right One...
","I have to say this movie is one of the strangest vampire films I have ever seen. Now in a way I can understand how some might see that as complimenting. But I don't think this vampire film is of note. It's not the best vampire film or the worst. What's so strange is obviously the Abraham Lincoln aspect.When I say aspect, I mean aspect. The title being split Abraham Lincoln:Vampire hunter is not surprisingly fitting. On one hand this movie is about a vampire hunter. And on the other it's about Abraham Lincoln. In truth this is a movie about a vampire hunter. The writer of both the book and screenplay Seth Grahame-Smith seemingly thought making the hunter Lincoln, made things more interesting but had little interest in actually making it even a little bit convincing as a fantasy. That is to say the Lincoln aspect is completely a gimmick.The fact this film has little to do with what we know of Lincoln is probably not surprising to anyone. But like I mentioned before simply as a vampire hunter film, this one isn't very good. The introduction to the film and Lincoln as a vampire hunter felt like a run through. It seems the writer and director knew they we covering over-used ground and instead of doing something different, they just speed things up.Despite the pacing causing me to be withdrawn, I did find the director Timur Bekmambetov and the editor William Hoy created interesting transition techniques from shot to shot and scene to scene. The transitioning certainly made the overall film more effective, but it did not save the film. Another strength in the film was the cinematography. It had the expected nights basked moonlight, sunrises and sunsets that are essential in vampire films. But overall the look of the film was engaging and artful. I thought the overall custom design was pretty good as well.The acting wasn't bad for the most part, Grahame-Smith didn't give them much of a chance to give a performances of note. I will say that visually Benjamin Walker pulled off being Abraham Lincoln. But does he pull of being Lincoln? I think he does as well as one can be expected to,considering.This movie is of some worth. This is due in no small part to the production designer, art director, set decorator, custom designer, and cinematographer. I think Timur Bekmambetov, probably most known for directing Wanted, shouldn't be written off either. Bekmambetov's two vampire movies Day Watch and Night Watch has gotten him a lot of attention as well(I haven't seen them but they are well regarded by many creditable vampire film aficionados). To be honest I think the one who should be spotlighted for this movie being an ineffective vampire film is the writer Seth. He is new to the screenplay writing game and it shows. Not to say he is talentless. I think this project was a bit to ambitious and it was too easy to go wrong. I won't go into the narrative faults but there are plenty of holes and one key thing we learn about the vampires is thrown out the door in the climax. Maybe if this film had dropped the gimmick, which is what the Abraham Lincoln aspect is, and made a movie about a vampire hunter during the same time, we could of had a far more interesting film on our hands.Oh yes, in the summary/header I put three alternatives for those looking for good vampire films. I listed Blade and Vampire D because those are good vampire hunter films as is John Carpenter's Vampires and their are others. I put Let the Right One In because that is a newer Swedish vampire film that is truly worth watching. The American version Let Me In isn't bad either. But if you have been searching for good vampire films you probably have already seen the ones I listed. But not to worry Let the Right One In proved the foundation made by the original film Nosferatu is to strong to be destroyed by this vampire fad lead by the Twilight Saga.",5,8,16,9 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Why so soon?
","Why so soon? Many are asking this and the answer is simple, money. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man's made too much money for Sony to give up on Spider-Man once Sam Raimi and his cast dropped out. It was decided to revamp the spider-man franchise by starting a new; hence Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man.The movie starts with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as a child and his parents leaving for some unknown reason. Then we move to Peter as a high-schooler and of course very curious about his father's work and his parent's disappearance (they have been missing ever since leaving him as a child). Peter lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen).Peter finds his father's old briefcase. Which is how the cross species research is introduced and he learns his father once had a partner named Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans. So Peter seeks him out to get answers. He finds the building where he is working and sneaks his way into a tour group. He actually steals a name tag of someone in the tour group, which in most films would raise an unanswered question, what will happen to the guy who had his name tagged stolen, won't that lead to security coming to tour group and finding the impostor? This film answers it and I won't ruin how. At this building Peter is bitten by a fictional spider that the scientists have been working on. He leaves and the next day he wakes up and is suddenly super strong and has no control of it. This I really enjoyed and appreciated. First it was funny to watch, but I saw it as a more realistic take in comparison to the original movies way of going about someone who suddenly gains strength on a gargantuan scale. So Peter goes to school and shows off on the basketball court getting revenge from a bully who he roughed him up earlier, Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka). Which leads to a talk with the principle and Uncle Ben has to come to the school. More importantly after talking to the principle, Uncle Ben reveals to Gwen that Peter has a picture of her on his computer as they pass her in the hall. This leads Peter to asking Gwen out, well kind of. That scene is well done; it captures the awkwardness of high schoolers and trying to act cool and so busy.But unfortunately the different techniques they us to make the actors pass as high schoolers doesn't quite work. It's probably because Andy Garfield is 28 and Emma stone is 23 (just maybe). But of course most actors playing high schoolers in movies are older than 18. In the original Spider-Man Tobey Maguire playing Peter and Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane didn't pass as high schoolers either. Which is why I thought it was very smart that the original had the majority of the story take place once they had graduated from high school. But in this remake they did not go that route and the entire story takes place with them in high school. Which means no Jonah Jameson, too bad he was a great addition to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies. Although it's my understanding that the entire cast agreed to not be involved in a spider-man project without Sam Raimi anyways.Despite being too old, Andrew Garfield is engaging and convincing in his display of emotions and as spider-man. Having Peter be a skater-boy was a smart choice in making him more engaging to present day teenagers. And there is a very entertaining scene with him testing out his new abilities while skateboarding. Emma Stone does a good job as well. She and Andy were a cute couple in the film. I will say there a couple of scenes that take their awkwardness together a bit too far and it becomes off putting.That had little to no significance though. What was significant was the pacing. In the first half when they are covering the same grounds of the original, pacing is fast. To keep people from getting bored with what they had essentially already seen 10 years ago in the original I suspect. The pacing then slows, the overall shot run times increases in the second half. It made the second half fell drawn out and slow at times. And I'm not one a viewer that has little patience and just wants things to blow-up. I think it was just the rhythm that gave the drawn out effect as well as maybe some needed excluded scenes.That was one of the weaknesses of the film but there are many strengths. Amongst what I already mentioned I found the visual effects to be impressive and the overall entertainment value was good. I liked both how the characters Ben and May were handled and the acting of the characters. I think this film was an effective spider-man film. Too soon in my personal opinion though. And a second film is in the works. I will say I liked this one enough to check out the next one.",7,0,2,22 August 2012
Prometheus," Filling a recent void. Besides Cabin in the...
","Filling a recent void. Besides Cabin in the Woods, sci-fi horror seemed to of been on vacation lately and Prometheus fills in a big way. Now as many know, this movie is what they are calling a 'distant prequel' to the Alien movies. Which is to say this movie is in the same world and is connected in story but not directly. There would need to be more films made to fill in the distance in the stories. Which may very well happen.So if you are a fan of the Alien Movies, especially Ridley Scott's Alien, you are probably wondering if you will be let down. Well if you look at Prometheus's cinematography I doubt you'll find any problems there. The movie is visually outstanding and a foreign world is most successfully created. Not to mention despite the dark cinematography and it being shot in dim 3D, Prometheus is never to dark. Smartly they shot the movie with high key lighting and darkened the movie later in editing. Not only does Prometheus's cinematography do Alien justice but so does the technique usage for the intensity and horror. Although the overall character development was slightly lacking, I still cared about the characters and what was happening. This is due in no small part to the effective pacing and camera technique. Even if you didn't know Ridley directed both Alien and Prometheus you would be able to guess they are directed by the same person. The movie is very much made in classic sci-fi style. But it's in the narrative that some may be a little disappointed. I wont go to much into it to avoid spoiling. But I will say there were some wholes and the narrative had little in common with the original Alien. To wrap up the biggest difference in one word, I'll use 'Creator'. That's all I'll say but you will completely understand once you see it. Which I do recommend. Not only because it is highly entertaining, surprisingly intense and visually stunning, but as a sci-fi horror it's a success.Note: For those who are wondering about the Predator Alien connection made in the AVP films, it seems Ridley is not interested in it.",6,0,5,13 June 2012
