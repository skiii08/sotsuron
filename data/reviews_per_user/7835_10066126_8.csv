Casablanca," As Time Goes By
","Where is the appeal of this film.  Why after so many years does this film stand out from the thousands of films Hollywood has produced over the years?It is the embodiment of sentimentality. Of love, sacrifice and nostalgia. One cannot deny the poignant dialogue.  Full of wit and charm.  Characters that look and feel their part.  Even today, so many classics after, this beautiful film clearly shows all the elements need to capture the right mood in film.  Anyone who does not agree should honestly ask themselves 'do I really love films?'",10,1,1,12 December 2001
Fight Club," Brilliant!!
","This clever and artistic assault on your senses is arguably David Fincher's best work yet.  It is surely not about mindless violence as most viewers would lead you to think, but the best of what I will call a sub-genre of 'male angst' like the likes of American Beauty and Scorcese's Bringing Out The Dead.  The acting is spot on, thanks to the magnificent Edward Norton together with Brad Pitt.  The camera techniques, frame for frame are very cleverly put together and the excellent cinematography give great depths to the characters struggle and confusion.  David Fincher, known for his moody and disheartening films has created a true and clever social commentary on how far our so-called 'modern day' living can take us.  Great work!",10,0,1,17 May 2000
Memento," Fiendish!
","Now for the sake of those who have not seen this film, I'll try not to give it away.This cleverly constructed film stars Guy Pearce as a man who cannot form new memories after his wife was killed wherein he received an almost fatal blow to his head.The film takes the viewer through a labrinth of cleverly and strategically placed twists and turns as the lead character with his memory problems tries hard to fit the whole puzzle together using polaroids of the people he meets and places he goes as he cannot trust any or to say the least, himself.It is beautifully shot in harsh colours and black and white to signify his mood and confusion and to add to the viewers confusion, it starts from the end and works its way through to the beginning.  But this is not too migraine inducing, as the director cleverly explains every new twist (which you get every 10 minutes or so) by 'telling' you what part of the narrative you are at.What you might find the most amazing is that this film brings out several questions; Since he cannot remember anything that happens to him, who can he trust?  Even after he finds his wife's killer and revenges her death, he wouldn't remember it anyway.At the end of it all (which is the beginning)  everything you thought you knew about the story is laid to waste because...How reliable is YOUR memory anyway?Chances are you'll be trying to piece it all together months after you've seen it.",10,0,0,2 March 2001
"I, Robot"," rubbish!
","I can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction. Forget the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot-holes. This wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.What a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we've had Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director). This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list. Truly awful.",1,61,121,11 July 2005
Gone with the Wind," Of All Time!
","Although Gone With the Wind might not be the best film of all time, it certainly is the greatest. Being the first real blockbuster film, I was surprised to see the amount of negative reviews and comments by some imdb members.  Others going as far as saying the film was full of film cliches. 
But in 1939 when the film was released, cinema was still in it's infancy and cliches did not exist then, this film created a lot of them.  The best way to look at this film is in the historical context in which it was created. The technical aspects i.e. the use of colour, soundtrack.  I think this film has never been done better. Even though the performances might seem old-hat to our modern day sensibilities, they were spot on then.Plus one cannot deny that it does have some of the greatest lines in motion picture history!!",Null,0,0,5 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," What!!
","Funny how a film like this should reach the top 250.  When I read about the treatment of this film about a year ago and that it was a Bruckheimer production;  I kind'a knew what to expect.  In an age of political correctness etc it's a shame that they can get away with making what I call nothing but a contemporary 'Zulu'.  Portraying the natives as nameless, even faceless adversaries, stinks like some pro-Vietnam propaganda film of the late 60's.Yes the production values were breathtaking, but that was not enough to cover up for the fact that this was nothing but a 'God Bless America in the face of adversity' trash that we have to put up from Hollywood every year. It did feel like some half-arsed attempt to justify a war against terrorism ideology.  Maybe I am being to hard on it but in the present state of international affairs, this weak film from one of my best directors, reeked clumsily of flag-waving to say the least!",Null,0,0,22 January 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," A true modern day classic!
","To begin with,  The story is pretty well cliched.  Like most prison dramas hope and struggle seem to be the element that put the plot together.  For once this is probably the one time that such a cliched plot actually worked. I have personally seen this movie over 20 times just to figure out how and why it works so well.  First of all the story is deep and thought provoking. Morgan Freeman's voice over narrative lets you see it through his eyes (the movie is really about him).  The acting is flawless the whole picture is shot as a true epic.  This is one great film about friendship and hope that does not dwell to much on pathos and mindless sentimentality.  A true modern day classic!",9,0,0,17 May 2000
Am√©lie," This is how it should be done
","The cute French film is really a tribute to those glory days of feel good Capra-esque movies.  Too bad in today's cynical world this is considered a bad thing.  Fortunately, the director doesn't let that get in his way.  The result is a well-crafted, sentimental, heart-tugging, brilliantly scripted and shot treacle-laced fairytale.What struck me the most was its complete refusal to end, like all Hollywood films of the same sub-genre, with a message sending or lesson learning knowingness.  It's just plain and simply great to watch and ponder on the fine and lovely world of Amelie.",10,0,1,6 March 2002
