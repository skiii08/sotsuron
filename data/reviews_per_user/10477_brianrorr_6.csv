Blade Runner 2049," Excellent movie due to its atmosphere, music, and mystery theme
","I will be fully honest and say I disliked the original Blade Runner. I only saw it recently, a few weeks before the sequel Blade Runner 2049 came out in theaters. The original's plot was so hard to follow for me, with extremely random clues being given to Harrison Ford's character to continue the mystery along and somewhat random action to keep the tension high.The sequel does not have these flaws, in my opinion; the mystery was solved logically and with steps that one could follow and was invested in Ryan Gosling's character's desire to find the answer to this mystery. As well, the sequel had gripping action scenes with good choreography and tense moments, putting the main character's life in serious harms way. His injuries felt real and difficult to manage, I wanted him to survive and felt Ryan Gosling carried the story well. I liked his rational and extremely focused personality, showing little emotion, and yet I felt his character wrestling with his identity and what it means to be human vs. an artificial human or replicant.It was amazing to be immersed in this world and I honestly *loved* that the movie was so long and drew out the scenes to let me think and predict how the mystery would unfold and most to bask in the atmosphere the movie painted. I loved the atmosphere, the dark dystopia and details that convinced me this world could be real.And I did like that there was a computer program or simulation that Ryan Gosling fell in love with, a wife personality that was not real yet thought and remembered, without having physical form. I appreciated being challenged by the movie to what in life matters and what in fact makes humans indeed humans and inherently valued. One of the few things I did *NOT* like about this movie was its sex scene and myriad of naked women they threw in the movie. They focused too long on the replicant 'born' when introducing Wallace's character....I don't want to see anyone's breast or butt, I never like nudity or sex scenes in movies or TV. I feel that's a sacred place for husband and wife to have together, not to show to the world especially continuously and so randomly like in this movie. The sex scene, though not shown but lead up to, between Ryan Gosling and the prostitute replicant/Ryan Gosling's computer wife was appropriate I feel to show Ryan Gosling had developed a deep connection to another being even if that being was not real and only artificially created. Is love valuable even if it is temporary? Is life valuable? These questions are inherently asked I feel and that scene, even though I could have done without the slow pace, had its place to ask the audience the question, what is love. The music was the icing on the cake for me~ It took the original's theme and style and made it completely appropriate and not overused in the sequel. I liked the music in the original, I loved the music and how it was used to create emotion and tension in the sequel. Sick~~An awesome movie, I would definitely watch again mostly for the mystery feel, music, and a refreshing change of pace to slow a movie down and allow its themes to sink in. Great job +1",8,2,8,14 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good Star Wars movie, I genuinely enjoyed the story and characters
","I just rewatched Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace today as a 24 year old, after first seeing it as about a 10 year old. I genuinely enjoyed watching it and especially loved seeing the beginnings of the Star Wars franchise's plot unfold. I'm not ashamed to say I cried at one part, the progression of the story of Anakin growing up as a slave, being recognized as an almost force of nature so strongly connected to the force, being encouraged to leave his planet and mother to be trained, and ultimately starting his path of pain and sorrow. I think Qui-Gon did not foresee Anakin having such a difficult life and wanted to believe he would bring balance rather than pain to the galaxy. However, Anakin's life never really having stability and his desires to be having never being met hit me hard, I'm not joking. The Star Wars franchise can indeed be entitled 'The Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker,' and this movie The Phantom Menace sets the plot up so well that Anakin had to go through so much struggle to bring balance and it was difficult to digest imagining that he was *destined* to suffer almost, willed by the Force to destroy the Sith even by helping destroy the Jedi Order and what would inhibit the Jedi from ever defeating the Sith. Watching the movie unfold and observing how Darth Sidious tried to manipulate, successfully, nearly all the events that took place was incredible. I give major points to George Lucas and his, I assume, team of writers, I believe they did a great job in crafting the story. As for Anakin's acting, I'm surprised to say I thought it was good for his place. He is a ~10 year old child and I think for a child actor, he did an extremely good job. I liked the scenes most of all between Anakin and Qui-Gon, he seriously listened and learned from Qui-Gon which most children may not do. I give the film an 8/10, it deserves it, definitely for that last fight scene...probably the best fight scene in all of Star Wars, for myself anyways. Obi-Wan having that energy in his lightsaber duel with Darth Maul after Qui-Gon was nearly dead was amazing, GREAT choreography! Sick~ Long story short: this was a good movie ^^",8,7,9,31 December 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not a Star Wars movie and just bad
","Rogue One isn't a terrible movie, but in my opinion it is bad. It has very few characters which I cared to learn more about after their initial introduction and in the end, I cared about nobody's death. The pace of the movie was far too quick with an extremely saturated cast of characters. The first 15 minutes I literally laughed out loud as a new planet was introduced on screen every 3-4 minutes with a name I was not interested to remember as it was a place I had no connection to, and never would. I didn't know anybody's name or care at the end because so much was thrown at me in 2 hours and I didn't love any of the humor/backstory of the cast. Jyn was relatable as her parents protected her from the Empire and her mother died to save her. However, I thought her motivations for the rest of the movie as an adult were strange and unexplained other than wanting to find her father for answers. The BEST part about the movie was the spaceship battle in the third act of the movie; I was in awe at how good the action looked and sounded. I thoroughly enjoyed that....then got cut back to characters dying on a beach like Saving Private Ryan.....why? This is not Star Wars, this is terrible.The most confusing character was Saw Gerrera (I had to Google that name, I didn't hear or remember the name even while I was watching the movie). What was his relationship to Jyn and why should I care about his movement or town or? What? Why is he weezing and Forest Whitaker talking like that? It makes the expositional dialogue even harder to understand as the movie in introducing characters are such a rapid rate, I can't remember anybody's story or why the main characters are moving from one planet quickly to another. This was suuuuch a bad character, I shed no tears as he died and I quickly realized 'Ah, everybody is going to die at the end, aren't they. Makes no difference to me.'And here comes, in my opinion, the worst aspect of the movie, in that I feel the movie never had to be made. The whole premise, from how I observed the story, was to explain the engineered weakness of the Death Star by Jyn's father so that Luke and the Resistance have an explanation how they could topple the Empire in A New Hope. Who cares? Because I definitely did not. You are supposed to suspend your disbelief when watching fictional movies and the thermal exhaust port on the Death Star was OBVIOUSLY a deus ex machina for Luke to begin his path towards power and learning to become a Jedi, for Anakin to meet his son and ultimately restore balance to the Force by killing the Emperor. Are we next going to explain why Death Star II had a flight path from the outside to the core, so that Lando could destroy that Death Star now? I don't think so, because the audience bought that such a movie trope needed to be there so that the story could keep moving.Please do not make more movies like this, with characters rapidly being introduced then dying with little emotional weight, with planets rapidly being cast on screen then forgotten as they are not visited for very long, and please forget about explaining small details in the Star Wars story and instead create new intellectual scenes in the Star Wars galaxy. Create new characters separate from the main conflict or a long ago back story to the Jedi/Sith conflict. People care about Anakin Skywalker and his story, about the Force! Not side stories with ultimately little meaning. Just my thoughts. This movie gets a 5/10, maybe even lower if I would see it again. Oh and I liked the Tarkin CGI and thought he was a good character, however I thought the Leia CGI was unnecessary and almost symbolism for how not needed this film was in the Star Wars saga.",5,3,8,28 February 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Pretty good, but underwhelming after Civil War Introduction
","I thought the film was overall fairly good, with some great scenes in between quite a bit of lackluster scenes. It definitely felt very.....high school, which I guess it was going for since Spiderman is a highschooler. The first 15 minutes were downright boring and disappointing, possibly some of the worst intro to a villain and protagonist in Marvel movies yet. But then the film picked up! And when Peter Parker was in the Spiderman suit, the energy was high and humor on point!! I loved Spiderman's quips at the bad guys on the ferry, perfect humor amidst fighting, and what Spiderman would do to make fun of his opponent, keep things light. I loved that.The villain however felt quite bland and not scary. Only until you saw him kill his henchman with a gun, vaporizing him, and then later when fighting Peter and destroying the pillars to drop the ceiling on him, those were great moments and defined the villain as threatening. I did like that Peter got his suit taken away by Tony Stark, I appreciated they emphasized that Peter must be a hero, with or without the suit, and he proved that.Overall, good movie and set up for the future. I hope the directors for future Spiderman movies give him a better villain, have less scenes in Peter's high school, and work on the jokes so they are wittier.",7,0,1,8 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The weakest link in the story of Anakin Skywalker & The Jedi
","Attack of the Clones definitely has some flaws, although it has many redeeming qualities that bolster the movie to be good. As this is a personal review, this is my subjective opinion. Feel free to disagree. I found the characters of Count Dooku, Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Darth Sidious/Senator Palpatine to be strong supports for the story. They together explained the motives for the Jedi Order and the Sith Lords in trying to prevent civil unrest/war in the galaxy and on the opposite end, trying to begin this civil unrest and use it to create an army for the Galactic Empire and take control over the Jedi and the galaxy. The backbone, however, of the entire story rests on Anakin and Padme's love story and their relationship that leads Anakin to *choose* to go to the Dark Side.The idea of the love story is great, I feel! Two young people, individually devoted to a cause that restricts their freedom and opportunity for romantic love. Anakin is restricted by the Jedi Order's culture and rules, having attachment linked negatively towards leading to the Dark Side, in my opinion because the Jedi do not understand how to control love and emotions so they rather wish to leave all attachments behind. Padme is held back by her commitment to politics and being a senator, unconnected politically with the Jedi and their desires. These two have committed themselves to a cause at an early age, Anakin around 10 becoming a Jedi and Padme as a teenager becoming Queen of Naboo, at they have had ample time to ponder about love and the prospect of not experiencing that in their life. But the execution is so unconvincing :\ Anakin's whiny tone and irrational dialogue takes me out of the movie and does not convince me that his character would so blindly reject the Jedi culture and destroy his/Padme's life by falling in love with her. Padme's acting is better, she has weak dialogue in my opinion on Geonosis when stating she loves Anakin....for some reason, maybe because he's whiny. Her first kiss with Anakin started the love story horribly, I felt, as the kiss came out of nowhere for Padme. She viewed him as a boy and I did not see any romantic attraction of Padme to Anakin before the kiss and barely any after until Geonosis. Long story short, the love story falls very short for me in this movie. Luckily, I believe the love Anakin and Padme have for each other in Revenge of the Sith, so the love story is redeemed in light of the whole saga of the Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker, how love made him turn to the dark side to save Padme and is a convincing reason he chose to turn and later, chose to kill the Emperor out of love for his son, Luke.I did absolutely love the music of the film and the special effects. Seriously, it is amazing to see the starships of the Trade Federation, the Kaminoans, the Jedi, Jango Fett...etc. as well as the views of planets from space. Amazing Star Wars setting and atmosphere. John Williams is on his very high 'A' game in this movie, I very much enjoyed the Anakin/Padme love scene music being on point with the movements on screen, giving the love story some sort of emotion and believability from the soundtrack. And the return of Duel of Fates I believe when the Clones arrive on Geonosis is an amazing touch. Williams is the best movie composer, no question.Good movie, though I think it is my least favorite out of the 7. Pretty good the least favorite gets a 7/10 as its score, as I can watch this movie and enjoy the good points enough to be able to ignore the bad. Thank you Lucas and team for creating the link between the beginning and end of Anakin's Jedi story! It makes sense as a whole, though not so much in the love story details. Oh well! Lightsabers, Yoda wisdom, and epic music make up for everything ;)",7,1,1,10 January 2017
Black Panther," A great movie that calls all humans to rise above resentment
","An interesting movie, with a very different and thought-provoking balance between tribal African tradition/culture and modern technology and thinking. The movie does a great tribute to African culture that they have African dancing, songs, language, and honor for loving one's people. I loved the action, especially the great choreographed fighting by the Black Panther. King T'Challa is very mature, as very much seen in Captain America: Civil War, where he refuses to take revenge upon his father's murderer. It is there we are introduced to the mature hero that I feel Marvel needs. I seriously think Black Panther, along with Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor give a moral foundation for this Marvel storyline.What I loved most however was that the movie called all of us humans, though mostly black people in my opinion, to let go of resentment from the past and elect to help others even if you may not gain from doing so. King T'Challa at the end of the movie addresses the United Nations, and boldly states that it is his and his country's goal to represent how all humans should treat others, by building relationships and forgiving one another, by thinking like one tribe. This is powerful stuff!! Tribalism plagues our world, in real life as well as the Marvel movies, dividing the Americans from the Middle East, the superheroes from each other, black people from the rest of the world as Erik Killmonger was preaching to the Wakandans when he killed T'Challa and became king.Does encouraging black people to kill white people, to kill everyone who is 'lesser' to them or who enslaved them solve the problems of resentment and tribalism in the world? No. It continues the cycle of hatred that we are all stuck in. I'm sorry if it is too bold to say, but all people including black people need to imagine themselves as one tribe, the human tribe, and let go of any resentments holding them back, as Black Panther rallies everyone to do at the end of this movie.I loved that message and really give major props to this movie for boldly saying that we humans can and need to create one global family, one tribe, or we will all perish and kill each other.Great movie, I recommend anyone to see it.",9,1,2,13 September 2018
