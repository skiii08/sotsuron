Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Well worth watching this fun movie - give it a break!
","My wife and I just watched this movie on DVD, and I can report that we both enjoyed our viewing. This is significant in and of itself, as my wife as rule does not enjoy action, supernatural and/or horror movies - all of which categories you could make a case that this film fell within. I think what made the movie enjoyable is that the fiction became somewhat believable played against the historical context which most people have at least some familiarity. I kept thinking to myself during the film that the premise that Vampires defined Lincoln's actions as well as the politics during the dark period of slavery in America, was as good a premise as any other historic biographical. Quite frankly, I find that most of the purported true biographic films so misrepresent fact that they might as well be works of fiction. Was the movie flawed? Of course it was, but the other reviewers who totally trash this film based predominantly on their assessment of the movie not being true to the book are foolish. I did not read the book, probably never would have as it is not my type of novel; however, the movie should be rated and evaluated wholly on its own merits. The movie was fun, fast-paced, and absolutely different then the same old recycled story lines and remakes. Just watch and enjoy.",7,2,3,20 May 2013
Woman in Gold," Good Story - Terrible Casting
","I liked the movie and it tells an important story; however, throughout watching the movie I just kept asking myself - why Ryan Reynolds? Let's be honest, he'd be more believable as the poster boy for the Hitler youth movement than as his role playing the Jewish attorney Randy Schoenberg. I'm not suggesting that you have a Jew play a Jew, but Reynolds was so out of character that in my opinion it detracted from the film. Perhaps they thought by have Reynold's as the male lead, they'd attract a larger audience. I guess we'll never know one way or the other.",5,2,4,15 April 2018
