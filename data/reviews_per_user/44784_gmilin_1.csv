The Blair Witch Project," If you are looking for a scary movie...look elsewhere.
","If you are looking for a scary movie...look elsewhere. There was more laughing in the theatre I was in than screaming. Actually, there was no screaming, gasping, or jumping out of seats. The film reminded me of an episode of MTV's 'Road Rules' gone horribly awry. The actors do a fantastic job of making the documentary-style movie appear realistic; but, the movie never reaches the level of becoming the least bit unnerving. As a study of how fear and uncertainty can affect otherwise confident people...the movie works very well. As a horror or thriller...it fails miserably. $7.00+ better spent elsewhere.",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
