Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Well filmed, well acted, well done!
","Not too often have I come across a film so highly anticipated, and walk out the theater actually having enjoyed it more than I expected. Kill Bill Volume 1 was so over the top, so over stylish, and oh so very good that I had to doubt myself if Volume 2 could live up to the first. Now granted, we all know (or should, before basing judgment) that this is really one long movie, essentially chopped in half. The first half being action and set up, the second half being the conclusion and character building. I was relieved to find the second half being what I just said. The directing by QT just goes to show that he has to be one of the finest writers and directors of our time. The dialouge in and QT movie, in my opinion, sets his flicks apart from the rest, and he does not disappoint here. The finest part being the ladder of the film, with the conversations between The Bride and Bill. Also here is something we aren't too accustomed to from a QT movie... sentiment. I couldn't help but smile as I left the theater. All things considered, from the few action scenes, to the beautiful scenery, to the well-written script, KB 2 more than lives up to the reputation that the first movie set. I loved Kill Bill Volume 1 for everything it is, and I love KB 2 even more for it being everything that KB 1 was not!",10,1,2,17 April 2004
