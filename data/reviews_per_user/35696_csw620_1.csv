First Man," Unremarkable
","I understand that in reality, the Gemini & Apollo space capsules were probably dark as they are depicted here, but if you're making a movie let us see a little of them please. I'm glad I've watched several other renditions of this story, or I would have been lost, as there is so little dialog. I understand Neil was a private man, but we need a little story here. Many other people that were part of this story who could have done the talking.",5,0,1,28 October 2018
