Sucker Punch," Surprised and impressed by Suckerpunch.
","I initially expected to see a movie about meaningless action cluttered with sexy hot girls in tight clothing. Yeah, there are sexy girls in tight clothing doing very suggestive moves but the movie is far more than that.There are many layers of reality we are confronted with.Perception is key. Baby Doll and her friends see the world in layers of reality where they have to follow a mission to achieve their goal. The mission is achieved but not in the way one would predict, which is where the movie surprises and delights.Every time a step of Baby Doll's mission is travelled she is reminded that she has everything she needs to get it done. No judgement, no fear. Just do it.Yes, there are people whom we come to care about. Some die. The feelings of loss is real on every level of perception.Intellect and reasoning is present. As is the action and determination to realise the goal. Freedom.In the end we gain a new understanding of freedom and free will. Guardian angels are real, though not in the ways some would expect.I bought the DVD and watched the movie at the cinema.No regrets.Thank you to all involved in this movie for an excellent story.",9,9,11,29 March 2019
