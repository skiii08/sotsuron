Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as critics say - not as good as we wanted
","If you're a Star Wars fan as am I you'll like this film but it's tough to love it (at least on first viewing).  The film simply tries to give so much it doesn't let you step back and appreciate it.  Key characters don't give you a chance to love them and the characters you do like aren't on screen enough.  It certainly had the highest of expectations which didn't help and it isn't as awful as critics would make you feel.  You should see it, but don't kill yourself if you're a fan of Star Wars to like it.  Not every episode is going to be something you cherish forever, and I certainly won't be with this one.  Lucas has pushed technical and visual things very far, now it's time for him to reclaim that storytelling magic he had once before...",6,0,1,19 May 1999
"Monsters, Inc."," Story counts
","I've seen a number of reviews about this say Toy Story I & II and Shrek were better.  They were in many ways - especially more laugh out loud funnier. However, this story is much better in some ways - it's a tightly told tale that moves well.  In fact it's a wonderfully told story which it has heads and tails over all three of those movies.  Were it not for the gags, and other good laughs in the prior three I'd say Monsters was better.
In terms of the animation - the animation is awesome, quite smooth and very subtle.  For lack of a better word the animation becomes almost non-existant.  You forget it's a computer animated film, and you sit back and sink into the story - and except for a need for better absolute laughs - nothing else dissapoints.",8,0,1,4 November 2001
