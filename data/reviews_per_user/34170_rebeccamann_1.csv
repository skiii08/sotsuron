The Longest Yard," Thought it was a pretty good movie
","I went to see 'The Longest Yard' opening weekend and thought it was good! I have seen both and liked them BOTH in different ways. That was the whole point of remaking this movie the way they did. The first one was a pit more serious and that is what i like about it. This one was lighter as if it were 20 years later...with a cast that meant it to be amusing. If you want a step by step remake and expect it to be the same as the original with this cast and crew.. well.. you will be disappointed. There are parts in this movie that make you think and are less 'light' so to say, but Chris Rock and Adam Sandlers characters draw you in. Hollywood remakes will either make you love them or hate them, in this case I LOVED it.",10,1,3,1 June 2005
