The Legend of Bagger Vance," Nice, easy, feel good movie
",Picking this movie apart has been done by many but I loved it -- and I didn't expect to like it that much. I am a senior citizen but I love Will Smith and Matt Damon and think Charlize Theron is most beautiful and elegant. I am not a golf fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is soft and comfy and I hope everyone noted only one 4-letter word. Hooray!!!  It's not Citizen Kane but it is very watchable and I would recommend it to non-golfers also.  Will Smith is a delight - when he wants to be soft and gentle no one else can touch him. The young Hardy was a great choice and Jack Lemmon (uncredited) as the older Hardy was perfect. What a classy person Jack Lemmon is. All of the actors seem to be right for the part they play. I give this movie a 10 because it made me feel good and it should be viewed for what it is and not what someone else wants it to be. Watch it and just revel in the scenery and the niceness of the whole thing.,Null,0,2,2 June 2001
