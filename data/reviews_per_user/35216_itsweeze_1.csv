Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," One of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.
","Abe Lincoln Vampire Slayer is nothing short of a masterpiece. The cinematography alone is enough to make me recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates being visually amused. Every scene is so shockingly detailed that occasionally I found myself paying more attention to the floating dust particles than the movie itself, which was incredibly impressive. I remember how excited I was to see that Burton was a part of this movie, because then it was guaranteed to be the work of art that it is. While still being somewhat historically accurate, the story is interesting with twists that I hadn't anticipated. The action scenes were so original and intense that they had me stunned. I literally was in awe (eyes wide with a big smile) at the brilliance of every sight. My expectations for this movie were dangerously high, but I was still so impressed that I wanted to stand up and applaud. I had so much fun that I didn't want it to end, and I will go back to see it again and again. I passionately recommend this movie to everyone that is capable of appreciating it.",10,9,12,24 June 2012
