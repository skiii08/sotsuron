Blade Runner 2049," Worth watching but....
",Had slow periods that were dragged out without much happening. Not as good as the original but worth watching.,7,0,2,28 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Lost it's way in the middle and no real ending.
",This movie had great potential and very good acting but the foul language was too much. Then the liberal biased BS started and never stopped. Why ruin a good movie with your biased opinions? When was this movie taking place? Newer type cell phone says at least 2000's but the police department was more like 1960's or earlier. I just felt this movie was all over the place and never figured out where it was going. But it is exactly what Hollywood likes so if you are into that.,4,11,17,28 December 2017
