Blade Runner 2049," So very slow.
",It's a movie made today but with the same flaws of a movie 40 years old. The plot in the end feels incomplete and the questions unanswered in the first movie remain still in this one. The visual and the acting are the high point of this film that still is worth to watch.,6,4,7,30 March 2020
First Man," visually stunning
",Good movie about Armstrong and the moon landing. I was surprised by how affected I was by this film. It was so intimately and beautiful and humanly filmed.,8,1,1,1 April 2020
Rocketman," I probably would not have liked it as much.
","I really wanted to love this movie because I absolutely adore Elton John, but I just found it to be another story about the struggles of a rising artist. On the opposite hand, I still managed to like it. I think that it was creative and carried a great story no matter how cliche that might be. The thing that makes me like this movie is that it surrounds a friendship, which I do not think I've seen in any other struggling artist movie. Without that part of the plot and the musical approach to it, I probably would not have liked it as much.",6,0,0,18 March 2020
Gravity," a visually cool movie
","Gravity is a beautiful movie and good experience when watched in the cinema regarding the outstanding realistic CGI, it shows us the endless emptiness and silence up in space. However, the weak plot, acting and dialogue makes the movie very boring",7,0,0,2 April 2020
Fight Club," Best movie!!!
",A great movie with an insane plot twist. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are brilliant together.,9,0,1,21 April 2020
Darkest Hour," Great film.
","I absolutely loved it! the speeches of churchill are a thing that i love, plus the actor who interprets him made an excellent job capturing his essence!",10,0,1,30 March 2020
Inglourious Basterds," It's a good movie
","Fun movie about plotting to destroy the nazis. Brad Pitt as a commander killing nazis is one of his greatest roles. From start to finish, it is a blast.",8,0,1,25 April 2020
Argo," Suspense. Real. Enjoyed this movie!
",Great casting choices and gets you biting your nails down to your knuckles without using over the top action,9,0,0,18 April 2020
The Notebook," This movie is beautiful
","Love does not have so many excuses. If it cannot be fulfilled, it can only show that love is not enough.",7,0,0,9 May 2020
Bloody Sunday," Good true story
",Great movie in the style of 'you are there as it happened'. Just returned from Ireland and toured the town of Derry. So sad to know what those poor people endured back during The Troubles. Glad to see peace returning. Derry is a beautiful city! And so were the people we met there.,8,0,0,19 April 2020
Us," This movie should never have been made.
",This movie should never have been made. The only reason it did was because Peele won an Oscar for Get Out and they threw him this deal with no script. The twist at the end is so obvious that I just don't understand why this is getting so much praise. It's mediocre at best. Don't believe the hype; the Hollywood machine needed this movie to be good to get longevity out of Peele but it really is a big miss/mess. Don't even bother. Just rewatch Get Out and hope Jordan remembers how to write.,2,6,9,16 March 2020
The Danish Girl," Beautiful Movie
","Amazing performances by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. This is an incredibly emotional movie. There were also some scenes which due to the way they were arranged, made it feel they were comic. Nevertheless, I loved the final scene,",8,0,1,28 March 2020
Knives Out," phenomenal job
","Overall the cast did a phenomenal job acting out their characters. As with most detective/mystery movies, there are some twists and turns in the plot that will surprise the audience. One gripe with the movie is that the movie made it quite obvious who we, the viewers, are supposed to hate. The wealthy family was greedy, entitled, arrogant, conniving, and a whole host of other negative attributes, while Martha, the representative of the lower class, was warm, heartfelt, caring, and kind.",8,2,4,17 March 2020
The Irishman," The Irishman is another crime classic by Scorsese.
","A relic of a past era in cinema, The Irishman finds Martin Scorsese and company at some of their best as they justify the prolonged runtime and find some new heart in previously visited themes.",8,2,4,17 March 2020
Spotlight," Amazing performance
",Powerful and absolutely perfect storytelling. One of the best true story-telling movies.,9,0,0,25 March 2020
The Hateful Eight," Superb! One of Tarantino's best!
","I liked this movie a lot more than most people did. I understand how viewers see it as boring and anti-climatic as it is slow at times. However I thought this was one of Tarantino's funniest movies. A very long movie carried by great characters, unique who-dunnit plot, and as always perfect dialogue.",8,0,2,28 March 2020
"I, Tonya"," Well made film!
",This movie was much better than I had expected. Interesting and entertaining throughout.great film about abuse and a national story where the Narrative was bad,8,0,0,30 March 2020
Crash," An entertaining film about racism
","Though it can be preachy and a bit overwritten at times, Crash is still a wonderfully honest and intricate examination on modern racism bolstered by an affecting score and editing, and a tremendous ensemble cast.",8,0,1,11 May 2020
BlacKkKlansman," good movie
","Though I enjoyed this film a lot, the end completely pulled me out of the movie.",7,3,7,1 April 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," this movie is great. funny, dark, and very interesting.
",One of the best black comedies in history. And relevant even today. Probably will be as long as there are nuclear bombs.,10,1,1,19 March 2020
Suicide Squad," Boring.
","Not gonna watch is again.No plot, no memorable characters",4,0,0,23 March 2020
Life of Pi," A seriously serious and great movie
","I didnt realize how much of this movie wasnt real. I knew that they didnt have a tiger there, but that almost everything is CGI is awesome, because you dont see it. It seems real although it isnt. The techniques are so far these days that you could just animate movies that look like movies with real people.",9,0,1,18 April 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," pretty good movie
",Great performances.Fascinating movie with great main actress who can carry the whole story. The story is also interesting and unique.,10,0,0,20 March 2020
American Sniper," Not a well done film,
",Not a bad movie.but not excellent either.This movie fails to find its balance and therefor fails to find its true emotional potential. Bradley Cooper shines but at times the movie plays out more like a video game than reality.,7,1,30,22 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Fun and enough nostalgia
","Queen's music is the best,I enjoyed this story. I learned a few interesting things about the band and the lead singer. Also, it highlighted their music well. I'd forgotten they had all those songs and how different they are from each other.",8,1,2,31 March 2020
Justice League," A few good scenes, but very strange to see batman among a bunch of aliens and CGI.
","To tell the truth, the best thing to watch in this movie is the first four minutes. You can really feel the despair of the world after losing Superman. But the later style began to look different.",6,1,7,9 May 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," great
","Not only a bright start, it captures what the book wanted to show: action, pain, war, hate and amazing journeys with the perfect storytelling that Peter Jacksom wanted.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
The Revenant," Survival movie, pretty good
","A long film that feels arduous at times; but the road for revenge has incredible direction an dcinematography that's gritty, bloody, dirty and, above all else, cold with amazing performances by DiCaprio, Hardy and company.",9,0,0,27 March 2020
Bridge of Spies," movie based on a true story
","It's worthwhile enough, but one of those films you know you'd never want to watch again. Hanks plods through and is effective, but isn't that the same for most of his films?The story is as flat as my chest.quite smooth",7,0,1,25 March 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," great characters and amazing animation
","Visuals are amazing and mind-blowing. The story is quite good (but original). It's just an amazing experience, but only good when watched for the first time.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
Silver Linings Playbook," Wonderful script with an optimal composition of the actors
","When I saw the movie.I gave standing ovation to the actress .They really did a great job , especially Jennifer and Bradley they were outstanding in the film.The story has a good meaning that life doesn't go according to plan.Highly recommended!.",8,0,0,18 April 2020
Dunkirk," This movie is awesome to watch.
",The cinematography is beautiful and the storytelling is fascinating.Gripping and visually spectacular from start to finish. Nolan's most coherent and satisfying film to date.,10,0,0,20 March 2020
Dallas Buyers Club," Great performances and a great story made this movie enjoyable to watch
","Very good insight into the early discovery of AIDS and the drugs available. The FDA are arseholes, its all about money and they've not changed much since. If it wasn't for the guy the films about then so many would have died sooner, including himself",8,0,1,2 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," This movie. Average.
","Quite a mix. At times pretty good, but at several points some pretty unpleasant behaviours are ignored, as though inconsequential. And then there's the extensive scenes of no interest to anyone except small children, who probably shouldn't be seeing the carnage and death that pop up not infrequently.",7,0,0,23 March 2020
No Country for Old Men," Fantastic film
","Outstanding, gripping suspense yarn. Javier Bardem's performance is epic. My only complaint is the abrupt ending that leaves you disappointed.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Toy Story 4," Not as good as the previous ones.
","Toy Story 4 was an entertaining continuation of the series, but didn't quite resonate with me the way previous installments did.",7,0,0,17 March 2020
The Favourite," Too long; not very engaging
","It had its memorable humor. Olivia Colman was brilliant! It just wasn't a striking and profound movie. It failed to movie me emotionally, it failed to intrigue me. It felt at times bizarre. It felt like I wasted my time watching the film since I couldn't take anything from it.",6,1,1,31 March 2020
Django Unchained," A great movie. Leo & Waltz at their best
","Jamie Fox gives his best acting performance of all time in this incredible, memorable and dazzling film. I have seen this film many times and it still leaves me speechless every time I rewatch it. it's very bloody and dark and therefore may not be for everyone but if you can handle it this is a must-see film.",8,0,1,18 April 2020
Get Out," boring and filled with holes in the script,
","Not really a very deep story, although there is a way through the movie, it jumps to a very weird ending with the highest point of nonsense when his friend comes to get him.",6,1,3,30 March 2020
Frozen," i like it
","Disney used superb special effects, music, and art to create a beautiful ice and snow world for us. The development of the plot is matched with the character modeling, and the character image is three-dimensional and vivid.",9,0,0,14 March 2020
Room," Exceptional, breathtaking
","Truly amazing acting from both stars, emotionally gripping all the way through, writing that feels real; masterpiece",9,0,0,25 March 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Soool goood.
","A stunning piece of art, it was a truly beautiful film. Something about it emotionally grips you and sticks with you. Timothee Chalamet should have won best actor for this film",10,4,8,20 March 2020
The Hurt Locker," Interesting Plot, great Acting, Nice story
",Great example of a movie with no specific story line that still ends up a very immersive experience and manages to really flesh out the characters,7,0,0,25 April 2020
Ex Machina," Not terrible, not great.average
","A lot of great points and a lot of places where you can think about the future, but at times I was just not having fun. These parts are few but noticeable.Slick indy futurism. Takes itself too seriously. Trys so hard to be genuine that it seems fake.",7,0,1,28 March 2020
Lincoln," Spielberg master piece & some superb acting.
",You forget Daniel-Day Lewis is acting. Probably could have been a few minutes shorter but ultimately deeply moving and a magnificent achievement.,8,1,1,18 April 2020
Big Hero 6," Eh, not bad, not great either.
",Pretty average movie. There isn't anything very unique or remarkable about the story.,7,1,3,22 March 2020
Brave," I thought the story was weird
","Considering this is the Disney princess after Rapunzel, this movie is quite lacklustre.",6,0,0,18 April 2020
Logan," great
","It's a good ending, Superheroes are also human beings, and they also have birth, old age, sickness and death. Wolverine in his twilight years is really with tenderness in the fireworks.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
"Girl, Interrupted"," great small drama
","Though it maybe isn't the most complete look at mental illness, it is packed with great actresses - and even if their roles are predictable, i can't think of another film that's already done it quite like this.",7,0,0,19 April 2020
Avatar," Stunning
","An amazing movie.Enriching and metaphorically relevant premise, beautifully displayed.",9,1,1,25 April 2020
La La Land," beautiful shot scenes.

Up," A funny movie
",Very fantastic the villain is super amazing my favorite character being Brad Pit's Character my favorite part is when they keep shooting Hitler even after he died,8,0,0,25 April 2020
Where Eagles Dare," A great war film
",Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. Exciting war movie Set up escape for captured prisoner from Bavarian castle high atop mountain using cable car. Long; could have been shorter. Plot was confusing.,8,0,0,19 April 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Nice
","It has crispy visuals, good crafted songs and good cast.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
Les Misérables," Ehhh
",Les Miserables is a movie stuffed with great music and a great plot but feels stretched out and at times loses your attention. The acting is good for the most part and the dialogue is very well written. The set design and costumes are also very convincing. Unfortunately it falls short of its great potential with a long runtime and characters that you can't tell the difference from most of the time. Good but not great,6,0,0,18 April 2020
Thor," Thor is good, but not great.
","It has bombastic action and compelling performances, but the story lefts something to be desired.",7,0,0,6 May 2020
The Shape of Water," An original idea executed shallowly and carelessly.
",Undeniably beautiful but lacking character development with too many archetypes. The movie spends too much time on its blatant messages and too little on actually creating an investing story.,6,3,9,30 March 2020
Crazy Heart," good movie
","This movie solely belongs to Jeff Bridges due to his witty southern charm and creative music that he brings to the screen. There are a couple familiar themes here, but Crazy Heart delivers enough substance to not only entertain, but inspire as well",7,0,0,25 April 2020
The Green Mile," Its not just a movie its a piece of art.
","I think it's difficult to make a good-looking suspense film. Although it's nearly 200 minutes long, it doesn't feel lengthy and memorable.",8,0,0,29 April 2020
Arrival," good movie
","From the beginning I knew my destination, and I chose my route accordingly. But am I working toward an extreme of joy, or of pain? Will I achieve a minimum, or a maximum?",8,1,2,21 March 2020
The Blind Side," A good movie
","I thought it was a beautiful movie highlighting how people can be wonderful to each other. The actors did a splendid job and writing is quite good. I can see why people would either love or hate this movie. To me, I felt I could connect with the characters and story.",7,0,0,25 April 2020
Parasite," excellent
",Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.,9,2,2,16 March 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A good but not a great film.
","It did have some inventive camera angles and cinematography.A story about an actor who used to be a famous comic book movie star. Michael Keaton is just a wonderful actor, i hope he does more small but awesome roles like this.",8,0,2,22 March 2020
The Big Short," Almost perfectly done.
","Amazing movie. Entertaining and educational at the same time. Every American should see this film. It was marketed as a comedy, but in fact it is a very intense drama, extremely well written, acted, and directed.",9,1,1,27 March 2020
Black Panther," Really boring and pointless
","A bland, Marvel superhero flick that critics and audiences have escalated into something it's not, e.i., a 'long overdue' and 'empowering' movie.",5,1,1,1 April 2020
Toy Story 3," All the Toy Story movies are pretty classic.
","We have to praise Pixar for reinventing for the 3rd time a movie without being repetitive. The plot has some twists and turns that will shock younger viewers, but not the older ones, the new characters are complex and intriguing and it as more thrilling scenes than any of its predecessors.",8,0,0,22 April 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Great movie.
","Waititi perfects the balance between making you laugh one moment and cry the next, or both simultaneously. Understandably, a movie about Nazis and the Holocaust is going to divide critics. However, the director shows the idiocy of the Nazi ideology. It will sit comfortably next to Spike Lee's Blackkklansman, raising questions about identity and acceptance that are deeply relevant today.",8,0,0,6 April 2020
Her," like it
","This movie shows why Joaquin Phoenix is such an amazing actor - he has incredible range. In Joker, he was brilliant as an intense, disturbed villain and in Her he is brilliant as a completely different character. Scarlett Johansson has only a speaking role but her interaction with Joaquin's character makes this one fascinating film. Unpredictable and thought-provoking.",8,0,0,2 April 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Visually stunning
","It is a fantastic action film filled with spectacular visuals, sounds and score. The movie is missing an impactful story to be an instant masterpiece.",8,1,1,25 March 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Great movie.
","Amazing cinematography and acting from Andrew Garfield! Must watch! Watching this I felt like I was there, laughing and crying with the characters, making this real and unforgettable.",10,1,2,23 March 2020
The Social Network," Excellent movie! Great performances by Wahlberg and Bale!
",An enjoyable watch and well done is all aspects but some of the details are inaccurate to the real life events and that's what lets it down,8,0,1,22 April 2020
The Martian," Amazing and inspiring. Great storey and well acted by all involved
",Thoroughly entertaining! Damon brings a very likable character to the screen that the audience will root for. The Mars sequences are visually stunning.,8,0,0,27 March 2020
The Fighter," Wonderful performances
",The fighter is a great boxing drama with great acting from Christian bale mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams along with a great story,8,0,0,22 April 2020
