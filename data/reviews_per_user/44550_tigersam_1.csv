Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Astonishingly up to date yet true to the Star Wars theme.
","George Lucas has created an excellent story to the early years of the Star Wars saga. He has carefully constructed the characters in the greatest traditions of the theme and entwined them in a storyline that is both easy to follow and very enjoyable. Having seen the film whilst on holiday in Canada, the frustration from having to wait the six weeks before it is shown in England is almost unbearable especially as I want to tell everyone about it but have managed to contain myself thus far. The use of the up to date special effects is excellent as it is not too apparent whilst watching the film that special effects were used as you become totally engrossed in the story. The scene with Anakin leaving his mother would bring even the most cold of hearts to ache for him. However the impending relationship between him and Padme (Queen Amidala) will obviously help him come to terms with that.In summary of the film, I would like to say that both times that I watched it, I felt a great sense of enjoyment and immersion into the story therefore a big hand should go to its creator, Mr George Lucas.",10,0,0,4 June 1999
