The New World," pretty scenery
","The New World is about Captain Smith and Pocahontas, how they came to meet and fall in love. The hard times the first settlers of Virginia had and how they eventually rile dup the Indians. How Pocahontas married Rolfe and then discovered Smith was still alive. If you're looking for fast pace and action, go somewhere else. If you're looking for a dramatization of certain aspects of historical events, then this is for you. There was a great deal of narration rather than dialog. I guess you could say it was a touching film, but the females in my family didn't particularly like it. Beautiful scenery, but not all that interesting.",5,2,6,24 September 2006
Mission: Impossible III," slow starting action film
","MI3 is another in the MI franchise that has many components of the previous MIs. Cruise does what he does best by running and jumping and smashing everything around him in an effort to save the girl and catch the bad guy. Cruise gets married and turns into an instructor but is drawn into a mission to save one of his trainees that got on over her head. Does he save here and get away? Cruise's wife knows nothing about his real job, and gets sucked into the story. Some good special effects and nice camera work with the same old dialog and menacing henchmen. Pretty good casting and storyline. If you're looking for an action movie that starts out kind of slow and ends with a bang, this is for you.",7,0,0,20 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," horseplay
","Lucky#Slevin is about a bad men who do bad things. It's good to see mobsters get it, they should all be put out of our misery. The movie smacks of The Jackal with Willis playing a soulless hit man. Freeman and Kingsley playing mob kingpins. Hartnet and Liu playing innocent bystanders. The film starts out in 1979 with a hit on an inconsequential gambler and his family. Later you find out what that's all about, but its not too hard to guess. Excellent cast and acting. A couple of rough editing sequences and cheesy dialog make this almost a dark comedy. The game is the Kansas City Shuffle and the twists are OK although not too surprising.",8,1,4,12 September 2006
Se7en," disgustingly good
","Seven is about two detectives, one old school, and one new school, who are placed on a homicide case together. Things start to get very strange as the killer turns into a serial killer with a definite pattern. After the inevitable whining between the new partners, they start to actually do some good work together. The murder themes are the seven deadly sins and each murder is executed according to one of the sins. Some good special effects and really disgusting scenes make this film not one for the kids. I've watched this film several times because each time you pick up more visual effects. They finally capture the calm and cool killer who plays on the younger detectives frailties very well pushing all his buttons while the old guy tries to keep things from escalating. The twist at the end is well worth the rest of the film. If you don't like sick and disgusting mutilations, stay away from this film.",9,1,2,17 January 2007
12 Angry Men," A tale of America
","A wonderful and biting tale of average America. 12 angry men is a story about 12 jurors in post trial deliberations regarding the fate of a young ethnic man for the murder of his father. As the story unfolds, we get to see how each juror decides guilt or innocence in a true testament to the intellectual diversity of 50s America, and indeed present day America. I can give current names to each juror from people I know personally. Made prior to Bill of Rights reforms and Miranda rights, the way people make decisions on guilt of innocence is timeless. Stereotypes, ethnic hatred, past fraternal experiences transferred onto the defendant all masterfully depict human frailties. In the end one lone voice of reason tries to Socratic-ally make the jurors look within themselves to identify the flaws in their decision making process. Innocent until proved guilty, the human condition, society in general is on trial here. This movie has a place in everyone's collection. This is real life.",10,0,0,6 August 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," fun family film
",Ice Age the Melt Down is a great animated family film. There are plenty of gags and it keeps you laughing most of the time. The awe factor is pretty high during the whole film. Many of the voices are well known and cast with some care. Some other choices would have probable lent more to the dialog. Its about a small herd of animals living in a small valley that get wind that the glacier they live by is going to burst with a huge water surge killing everything in their valley. They march to the other end where they have been told there is a boat that will save them. What happens in the end is very nice. A fun film for the whole family.,9,1,1,24 November 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Great work Ang Lee
","Brokeback Mountain is a remake of Same Time Next Year replacing comedy with social commentary and replacing Alda and Burstyn with two gay cowboys in an era that chooses not to understand. I didn't pick this film up until now because I really wasn't interested in the plot. I heard the Ang Lee was a great director, so Starting in 1963, two young cowboys start a relationship and then hide their love for each other over 20 years. They get married to women, have children, function as heterosexuals, and meet at brokeback mountain periodically over the years. You'll need to watch it to find out how everything turns out. Many cliché reactions and scenes riddle the film as they try to keep in the closet. Little mention of the Neanderthal reactions most other people have, but you get the impression they are always in fear for their lives should they be found out. And rightly so in the backward areas of the country they live in. While I personally couldn't watch the few gay love scenes, the story had a great deal of emotion and the characters and situations were very believable. An excellent film that has very high marks from me for everything.",10,15,19,25 December 2006
Silent Hill," It's pitch black on silent hill
","Silent Hill had just enough transitions to keep it interesting. I stopped playing video games shortly after Atari Asteroids came out, so I only had other films for comparison. Radha Mitchell (Rose) seemed to be in the dark most of her last few movies, going from holding a bottle of glowing slugs up for light in Pitch Black to hold a lighter up in Silent Hill. Mitchell did a great job in a film that must have taken a lot of effort. She looks good, even covered in blood and screaming. Mitchell is in the same league as Bruce Willis in that they both suffer well on screen. Medium fast pace along with a strong cast, some wonderful camera work, a few twists, and good special effects helped this film through a pretty stale plot. I wouldn't pay to see it again in the theater, but I would by the DVD.",9,0,1,23 August 2006
Nacho Libre," slow but funny
","Nacho Libre is about a tubby kid that grows up in a monastery/orphanage. He likes wrestling from the get go and spends his time pretending to wrestle by himself in the graveyard. He later tries to become a member of the clergy. He decides to wrestle for real and develops a character called Nacho with a mask to hide his identity from everyone because wrestling is forbidden. A very cute Nun comes to the monastery and he falls for her and she for him, or so it would seem. Eventually he gets good enough to wrestle the best in the town. A funny movie, but slow moving at times. If you like Black, then this is a good movie for you.",7,1,3,27 November 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," good funny film
","The Devil Wears Prada is about a fierce managing editor that hires a fresh faced assistant into indentured servitude and verbally whips everyone around her. At first the assistant resists the peer pressure to conform to the subculture of the taffeta worshipers in a niche society of fashion demigods, but then succumbs and makes a go of the fashion industry as a profession. Great acting takes a predictable dialog and story into the realm of good comedy. I would have flipped off the devil woman and told her to find a real job after the first 10 minutes of her outrageous diatribes. A technically good film and worth a watch because of the acting.",7,1,2,15 December 2006
Over the Hedge," 8 and over
","Over the Hedge is a wonderfully funny movie more oriented to children over 8. In the store I've seen some very young children going for this film and there are some questionable phrases and scenes. But other than that, the movie is an A1 accomplishment for the cartoon filming industry. Even if you don't recognize the voices, you can tell they are seasoned actors because of the excellent inflection, tone, and cadence. While the plot isn't the most intelligent one you could think of, the delivery is great. The cartooning is also top notch with very few shortcuts in the design. A great movie for everyone over 8, maybe a little scary for those under 8.",10,0,0,24 October 2006
She's the Man," She's definitely not a man, but a good actor
","I've seen a dozen movies like this stretching back to the b/w era, so I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was funny, well acted, and directed very well. Viola is a tom-boy soccer addict who has a twin brother musician named Sebastian who takes off to London for a few weeks to try and be found, while Viola covers for him with their divorced parents. When Viola's soccer team is cut at her school and the boy's team, including her now ex-boyfriend Justin, won't let her play, she takes her brother's place at his school and joins the boy's soccer team  the arch rival to her school's boy's soccer team, to show them all she can play. She has to avoid all the guy stuff that would reveal her gender while falling in love with Duke, and then her brother comes back to help complicate things. All the usually suspects and situations are there, but the fast pace and fresh interactions in the movie keep it from dying a painful death. It's not meant to be believable, it's meant to be good clean fun  and it is.",9,1,2,22 July 2006
Saw III," another in the saw series
","Yet another slasher film Saw 3 is the latest in the Saw series about a dying man turned serial killer trying to teach people the meaning of life. One man is challenged to save the people who killed his son and the judge who let the killer off on a technicality. A brain surgeon is tasked with a brain operation on the master mind knowing that if his heart stops, she get blown to bits. The ending may be a surprise to most. Worth watching if you liked the others (Ratings: Bad=1; Average=5; One of the best=10); Acting=05; Plot=06; Scenery=07; Character believability=07; Continuity=08; Dialog=05; Directing=08; Casting=07; Special effects=07; Overall Rating=07",7,0,1,2 February 2007
The Transporter," Top notch action
","A fast paced movie about a retired Special Forces man who parlays his nontraditional talents into a tidy living transporting anything that can fit into his BMW, but the transport must also meet his long tested set of rules. This 007-like role can only be played by a Brit, and Statham does an excellent job. An action film that doesn't have much meaningful dialog, but just enough to make the characters interesting. I love the dry humor, and pun filled lines. After breaking his own rules, you see very well choreographed and exciting fight scenes  albeit not very believable  that's not what this film is about. Good, relatively clean, fun with some nice twists as the transporter tries to return to his simple lifestyle.",10,1,3,12 August 2006
28 Days Later...," Unique
","A slightly campy rendition of the typical zombie film. The thing that sets this cult classic apart from other zombie films is its quick transition between fight/flight horror and every day concerns. Humor works its way into the script at key moments to let the viewer know all is safe for the time being. Just when you think all is safe, a dream or noise will bring back the fear and expectations of horror. While many non-brits will think the movie boring or disjointed, I think this type of film making has a bright future. No longer are film makers forced to keep the suspense or horror up for the entire length of the film, but the transitions back and forth are problematic because of the lag time the view experiences. Is this really a horror moment or something else? It takes some mastery to get that right for the majority of the viewers, and I think this film does an excellent job of that with its portrayal of the fast moving more animal like zombie. Another unique feature is the transition from human to zombie. At ten to thirty seconds, it leaves little time for decision making and adds to the immediacy of the situations.",10,1,2,6 August 2006
Cars," wonderful world of Disney
","Cars is another in Disney's wonderful series of animated shows. A movie for everyone about a race car named Lightning McQueen that finds its way to an off the beaten track town of Radiator Springs on route 66 that was all but destroyed when the interstate came through. All the towns customers now bypass the town and there's little left for the inhabitants to do accept cherish their own company. Late for the big race, Lightening McQueen is stopped for speeding and accidentally destroying the town. While doing community service the Lightening McQueen falls for the town and its inhabitants. He finally finished his community service just in time to get to the race. What happens next is why you need to watch it.",10,0,0,8 November 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," xmen and women
","XMEN The Last Stand is another in the xmen franchise. A last stand of sorts for some of the mutants and humans in an epic battle. A great deal of time is spent setting up the story from previous episodes and introducing mutants. Many having powers that would make them gods in a lesser time. A cure for being a mutant is found and a strange mutant child is discovered that cancels out mutant powers when they get close. Xavier tries to keep things from getting out of hand as Magneto tries to stir things up. As humans offer the cure for being a mutant, some look at that offer as a hidden agenda to exterminate the mutants. The epic battle is well done and is less bloody than one would expect to keep below the R rating. Nicely done and worth watching.",8,0,1,14 October 2006
The Illusionist," very good and suspenseful
",The Illusionist is about forbidden love between the daughter of an aristocratic and the son of a cabinet maker. The boy and girl fall in love at a young age and are forcibly separated. The boy goes off to learn illusions and the girl grows up to become queen. They meet years later at one of his performances and rekindle their love. They find themselves in a no win situation as the emperor's spoiled brat of a son imposes his will on everyone. Can tragedy be turned around and how can it possibly work out for the couple? The is a great chic flick with just enough guy stuff to make it for all audiences. Class A film all the way around with good performances by all.,9,0,1,25 January 2007
World Trade Center," well made and highly emotional
","World Trade Center is about two of the port authority police caught in the collapse of the world trade center. They arrive at the site not understanding the magnitude of the event and proceed to flee into an elevator shaft while the first tower collapses. They are almost buried alive, but wind up in the most protected place in the area. The remainder of the film keeps a very high emotional level while the stranded policemen and their families relive key life moments of their lives and struggle to remain optimistic. Some closely associated people's lives are also briefly shown, like the Marine who found them, and the Sheboygan Wisconsin FD that came to help and serve brats. Aaaah, Sheboygan brats. The question during the whole movie is can they survive. A well made movie with heavy emotional content.",8,2,5,16 December 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," slow but heartwarming
","A slow moving film with a great deal of heart and personal meaning. Based on a true story of a Kiwi that overcame the odds and through his indomitable personality to make the record books. The casting could not have been better, being an Anthony Hopkins fan, I feel no one else could have as effectively played the starring role. Most of the movie deals with cultural nuances and the nontraditional life of Burt Munro (and to some degree his dead brother Ernie of all names). Burt is a single minded man's man, and he will not accept defeat in any form. Not so much a film about personal strength, but more about intelligent perseverance in the face of stogy, life smothering, man made rules. This is on my multiple times each year watch list.",9,0,0,12 August 2006
Invincible," feel good film
","Invincible is about fired teacher and part time bartender Vince Papale who after his divorce in 1975 tried out for the Philadelphia Eagles football team. He made the cut and with a little help from a coach that liked his style did the pro dance. This is a real feel good film about raising yourself up from the dumps into a place of notoriety. While I like Mark Wahlberg, he seemed a little too starched in this one. Perhaps more of a planet of the Apes style would have been better, but that's the director's issue. Of course some spots were a little slow because the emotion level didn't meet the situation. If you liked Rudy and any other underdog film, you'll like Invincible. A class A film with few technical problems.",9,0,0,29 December 2006
The Descent," Good shocker film
","Descent is about a group of adrenalin addicted UK women who take a caving trip to hillbilly country in the USA. They start out the caving after a wild night of partying and everything seems to go just fine until there is a cave in that blocks the entrance. Then they find out they are in a cave no one has been in before. As they try and find another way out, they find they are not alone in the cave system. The humanoid inhabitants seem to have been in the cave for a very long time. And they are not vegetarians or mushroom eaters. The film is spent with the women kicking cave dweller ass while looking for an other way out. One of the women lost a child and husband at the beginning of the film, but that didn't seem to take a very prominent role in the film. They could have done without that part. Technically a good and exciting film with a relatively short intro to the characters. A nice film to watch in the dark with a large bowl of popcorn.",9,1,3,26 December 2006
Inside Man," Wonderful
","Inside Man is a nice film about a bank robbery, hostage taking, and a little bit more. The movie starts out in an interesting manner; the star tells you the - who, what, where, when - of the film up to a certain point and then lets you see how it all happens. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington do a very fine job in this film along with Jody Foster and Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe. There are many twists, turns, and hints that giveaway some of the ending. A great combination of multiple story lines and flash-forwards that give the film a slightly different format. Owen and his crew enter Plummer's bank and take everyone hostage. While Washington and Dafoe try to catch the robbers and save the hostages, Plummer (a man with a secret) hires Foster to convince Owen to leave that secret alone. Foster calls in some favors from some powerful people that hinders Washington from catching up with what's going on. Can Washington catch up, save the hostages, and grab the robbers? A top notch film destined to be a classic.",9,1,2,11 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," good show
","The DaVinci Code is another wonderful Howard movie with a superb cast and excellent screenplay. The chemistry between the actors makes the film a true epic of emotional platitudes. Everything about the film is technically of classic magnitude. The film is about the idea that there is a bloodline of Christ through Mary Magdalene as Jesus wife who has been protected by a secret order of the Templar's and attacked by the patriarchal traditional church through the Opus Dei sect of self mutilators. If you can get past the not so obvious heresy in the whole idea, it is an interesting movie filled with proof of concept and very likely a good amount of embellishment. Still, there is nothing wrong with calling this film a must see. I understand the Christian fundamentalists gave Dan Brown death threats just like the Muslims and Rushdie.",10,2,5,17 November 2006
Man on Fire," A great action/body count film
","Man on Fire is about Creasy (Washington) an ex-special ops type who is hired to body guard Pita (Fanning) by her parents Sam and Lisa (Anthony, Mitchell) in Mexico. Creasy does fine until a group La Hermandad headed by corrupt Mexican cops grabs Pita and then intercepts the ransom effectively killing Pita. Creasy declares war and goes after them all with the help of his friend Rayburn (Walken). A good plot and screen as well as musical scores keep the film moving moderate to fast. The experienced cast pulls you into the story and keeps you there. If you like a good body count film about revenge with some moderate gore and mutilation, go for it. Otherwise, try some Disney.",9,0,3,27 August 2006
Step Up," following in others footsteps
","Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.",4,31,52,1 January 2007
Click," comedy with a soul
","Click is about an architect that almost wastes his life at work rather than with his family. A modification of the film A Christmas Carol, Sandler meets the angel of death and visits various points in his life to see the good and the bad in the choices he made. The moral is, live your life as if every day was your last day and keep close the people that mean a lot to you. You never know when they will be gone and every minute gone is one you will never get back. A very well made film with a classic plot and a chance for a do over. Sandler has gone from completely annoying comedy for the sake of a cheap laugh to good solid comedy with a soul. Bravo for this relatively clean, but slightly suggestive comedy for those over their mid teens.",9,1,4,14 October 2006
V for Vendetta," Must see
","A compelling movie with a strong message for current times. In the not too distant future a government uses fear of terrorism, disease, and chaos to keep people in line. Anyone not true to the party line is traitorous and is eliminated. These messages are timeless and have occurred numerous times in the history of mankind. V is the current definition of a terrorist that uses his strengths to try and convince the people of his country to repel the insidious leaders that have implemented a fascist regime. A few simple story lines are all that is necessary to bring the characters to life with a strong script and impeccable acting. How many people would it take to expel fascism and take back a country from evil wearing the garb of faith and armed with the power of governance? How many people are brave enough to choose freedom at any cost? Can individuals find the will among themselves to rise up?",10,3,6,5 August 2006
