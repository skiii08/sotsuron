Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Total Garbage
",Without a doubt the new additions to the Star Wars saga are the biggest load of trash ever made. Sterile characters and actors accompanied by mediocre effects which doesn't say much compared to the breakthrough Lucas made with the original star wars. Lacks life and can barely be watched. A Shameful prequel to three great films.,Null,0,1,8 January 2004
A Bug's Life," A brilliant film
","Without a doubt one of the most brilliant made. Definitely entertaining till the end. Everyone's a critic about everything, that's life, but if you can do better than that yourself then put up or shut up. Pixar has put up over and over again and the Disney / Pixar combo has done wonders. Top marks 10/10 for a great film. Good work Pixar.",10,0,1,4 January 2004
