The Rock," Great action film!!!
","This was a fantastic film that should be seen by all. I am an action-film fan, and this was by far one of the greatest action films I have ever seen. With great special effects and action, great acting, and a comic-book style story that is intriguing in all its aspects, 'The Rock' should be seen by all. Ed Harris plays an angry, determined ex-General from the U.S. military who fought in many wars and was respected by many people from high positions in the government. However, he has radical views and believes that the U.S. government never supported American soldiers who fought overseas and returned home and received no rewards for their sacrifice. To prove his point, Harris directs a group of former Marines who steal several chemical missiles from a weapons depot and plant them in an isolated spot that would be hard to invade: Alcatraz Island! What better place for a base of operations than a deserted island with an unused prison? Harris and his thugs threaten to launch chemical missiles at San Francisco Bay (which could kill hundreds of thousands instantly) unless he and other former marines are paid $100 million by the U.S. government. Since when does our government bow to the demands of terrorists? Whether global jihadists or angry domestic troublemakers, negotiation with the enemy is not an option...Nicholas Cage is a young FBI chemical-weapons expert who is sent along with a group of soldiers as well as Sean Connery (a life-long prisoner who is sent in with the soldiers because he knows the layout of Alcatraz, having been the 'only prisoner there to ever escape'). They plan to stop Harris from firing his missiles but they are met inside the prison by an ambush of heavy fire (remember, the 'terrorists' here are well-trained, decorated former U.S. soldiers) and many are killed. Alone and planning to save many innocent lives, Cage and Connery plot to fight until they win over the prison's occupiers and save America from bowing to terrorist demands.... This film was fantastic and was a great action film, running along the ranks of 'Air Force One' and 'Face/Off'... Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...",8,3,3,20 June 2005
Requiem for a Dream," Wow.... twisted, sexy, brilliant...
","'Requiem For A Dream' was quite a film. With only the knowledge of 'people choosing their own path to happiness', I decided to see what this was all about. I was quite surprised by my own similarities with Harry but put them aside, I was able to look at this film from all points of view, whether from the view of characters or the audience.Harry is quite a character... dealing with thoughts on the future, his relationship with his best friend (Tyrone) who also believes in 'making it big', his girlfriend, and his frail, overprotective mother who has her own dreams of weight loss and a television appearance on her favorite contest show. He sells drugs to support his own habit but remains quite a positive character throughout the film, perhaps an 'underdog' who wins sympathy as though he has faced discrimination... Does his 'girlfriend' really love him? Is Tyrone committed to him? Does his mother care about him as well? Will she listen to him as he begs her to give up on her prescription weight-loss pills that eventually lead to her odd behavior, paranoia, and hospital placement? He is facing all odds and wins sympathy... 'Requiem for A Dream' is a fantastic art film that combines reality with visions and dreams... I plan to read the book soon as this film was both inspiring and entertaining. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...",9,0,1,30 June 2005
Minority Report," An edge-of-your seat Spielberg extravaganza- SEE IT!!!
","My only regret is that I did not get to see this film in theaters as I wanted to when it was released three years ago... I enjoy Tom Cruise and even more Spielberg films so this was, of course, a must-see for me. Taking place in 2054 Washington D.C., Tom Cruise is a police chief who heads a 'Precrime unit', a brand-new police unit with futuristic technology that allows them to discover precisely when, where, and by who homicides are going to be committed. This technology is much appreciated as it began to decrease D.C.'s massive homicide rate and eventually left the city without a single murder in six years. Using mind-readers called 'pre-cogs' (referring to the pre-cognitive), this police unit catches future murderers before they commit their act.... imprisoning them but leaving their victims unharmed. Considered 'flawless' by the U.S. government, there is an occasional disagreement about a specific crime that is supposed to take place by one of the three mind-reader 'pre-cogs'... This disagreement by the mind-reader is referred to by the government as a 'minority report' and is deleted, in order to keep up the idea that this new precrime system is flawless and works without doubt. However, this small flaw becomes a very big problem when Tom Cruise (himself the unit's chief) is accused of murder himself... when one of the pre-cogs has a flaw and it is not exactly 100% certain that Cruise does in fact become a murderer but the 2/3 suspicion of him by the pre-cogs is enough to have the entire D.C. police unit crawling through the city for him...This film soon becomes an exciting action-packed chase that involves Cruise constantly running from his fellow police officers as he tries to find out who framed him in a system that is supposed to be perfect for preventing murders. This film was great and I loved it and I think you will too. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...",8,1,2,20 June 2005
Se7en," Wow... all I gotta say
","At first, I was a little hesitant about taking time out of my life to see Seven. I mean, I am a busy person... but this film was well worth my time... Perhaps the best Brad Pitt film that I have seen, this film involves two detectives (Pitt and Freeman) going after a delusional killer (Kevin Spacey) who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, lust, etc... Spacey takes pride in his killings and leaves clues for the police, similar to 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz when he murdered six women in New York City in the 1970's ('Summer of Sam'= another great film)... This was an intense thriller that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish...Movies generally take a lot to keep me interested, and I am generally a fan of comedies and action flicks. But Seven was different.... it was a fantastic thriller that kept you thinking and waiting to see what happens as Pitt and Freeman chase down the barbaric killer who feels that he is doing 'God's deed'... This film is a must-see!! My only regret is that I had did not see it until 10 years after its theatrical release... Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...",10,19,32,20 June 2005
Face_Off," Fantastic action film
","What a great film... I am an action-film fan, and this film was a great way to entertain the audience with our favorite stars from 'The Rock', 'Broken Arrow', 'Pulp Fiction', and many more... together!!! In the film, John Travolta plays an FBI agent who is hunting down arch-terrorist Nicholas Cage. Cage is in control of a very violent group of thugs and he is accused by the FBI of many violent acts of terrorism. He is not Osama bin Laden or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi supporting global jihad and personally beheading innocent hostages with a dull knife, but he is still quite a vicious man. After Cage is captured by Travolta and his crew, he is obviously facing a lengthy prison term... The only problem is that the rest of Cage's organization has not yet been infiltrated by the bureau! What better way for Travolta to get 'on the inside' than by coming Cage himself?So doctors perform a complicated surgical operation during which Travolta receives the face of Cage and his body is surgically operated on so as to appear quite similar and pass off as Cage himself. Travolta has so 'become' his enemy Cage that he even fools Cage's closest family members and 'friends' and even has to serve part of Cage's prison term before he breaks out. Once out of prison, Travolta (now wearing Cage's face) has to not only find the real Cage (who has stolen Travolta's face as well and escaped from the hospital where the operation took place) and take him down but also get closer with Cage's group for important information and convince his own family that HE is the real Travolta, not Nicholas Cage the murderous terrorist whose face he is wearing. This film is an slam-bang thriller from start to finish that should be seen by all film fans whether you really like action as I do, or not.

28 Days Later...," Wow! A horrifying, survivalist-type thriller that is GREAT
","This film was fantastic. I was expecting something along the lines of a combination of 'Resident Evil' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' but this is quite different from that description. Yes, it involves a terrible disease that leaves its infected victims as blood-sucking, mindless zombies who pray on the not-yet-infected and yes, it involves a group of survivors who are left together to fend for themselves. But it is quite different from Resident Evil (no comic-book or video-game type plot here and no explosives or automatic weapons) and is a much more thrilling 'survivalist-type' film than 'The Day After Tomorrow'.An awful virus is spreading through the streets and cities of Great Britain. Soon nearly everybody is affected by this deadly disease that turns its victims into zombies, who are quite noticeable and different from normal people due to their odd/rapid body movements, their blood red eyes, foaming at the mouth, and their inability to communicate with normal people unless they are trying to bite them. A small group of survivors manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe. They do eventually make it there, but what can stop zombies (who are mindless, blood-thirsty and have nothing to lose) from invading an army base? Are the survivors and British soldiers safe? Or will they soon become zombies themselves?This film is quite scary and exciting and perhaps one of the best British films that I have seen from modern times...

Cinderella Man," Very good boxing drama
","When I first went to see this film, all that I knew about it was that it starred Russell Crowe and it was based around the life of a boxer. Of course, it ended up being much more complicated than that.Russell Crowe is James Braddock, a boxer rising up from the bottom in 1930's New York City, during the peak of the Great Depression. After several fights (including one in which he breaks his hand and loses his boxing license), Braddock attempts to get financial assistance and he and his wife are in danger of having to send their children away due to the fact that they may not be able to support them in such a difficult time. However, Braddock is offered (even after his loss-of-license) yet a chance for one more fight for $250... he not only wins the fight and the money, but he is propelled back into the dramatic world of boxing (not to mention the betting/gambling based upon its fights) and media spotlight. He eventually rises to the top and finally becomes the prime opponent for the current world heavyweight boxing champion, Max Baer. Renee Zellweger does an excellent job as playing the reluctant wife-of-a-celebrity and caring mother of several starving children.Overall, this film was great. It was much better than my other favorite boxing film, 'Undisputed', and it was, to put it simply, a masterpiece that made you feel as though you were on the frontline of the boxing matches and gambling scene of the 1930's. While it could get boring at times and was somewhat long, this was still a great film that I recommend with pleasure to all.
