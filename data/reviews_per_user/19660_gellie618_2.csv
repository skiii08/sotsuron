The Ring," The Kaballah of the Ring
","'The Ring' contains secret esoteric information, that everyone has a right to know.There was a Bible story left out of the Bible about a King, a Scribe, and a High Priest who went to the ruins of a another King's Temple, found a well, descended into the well, and in there discovered the 'lost word'.This 'lost word' in the sound of a cylinder sounding like the word 'whine' and 'fine', and 'line'. I cannot spell it in Hebrew here, for, that would be counted as incorrect spelling which wont go through in this forum system.But, the 'lost word' in an ancient language adds up to 61, and the number of the apartment is 601, the 6, 0 the ring, and then the 1. The same word is the (wont go through) word for well, ring, eye, and nothingness.This same sound was the meditation sound used by a meditation system popular in the Sixties. Only sincere looking members were given this 'lost word'. By meditating on this sound you experience a taste of nothingness, which is very refreshing. It is the heart of every pleasure. The Oriental radical for heart is the serial number 61 radical.The name of this movie is 'The Ring', the well was important in the story, the girl, 12 years old at the time, had her long black hair covering one eye, and revealing the other one eye.The girl's name, I don't even think the girl's name would pass through this spelling sensor, the girl's name means 'a guardian' in (wont pass); but, this movie originated in (wont pass), and the (wont pass) name for it means 'Happy Apple Horse'. In the one substance, energy, motion can only be in closed circuitry, that there be something to move out of the way and fill in behind. Rings are preferable, and the push to undifferentiated con fluently in cylindrical formations.Cylinders promote a fast polarity cancellation rate, called a fast entropy production rate. Fast entropy production rates bend time space globally leaving the rigid orthogonality of flat time space behind so that all that involved gets a tenuously indistinguishable from that which is called 'spirit'.In such a field the body is able to snap back to its original health template, curing disease, and even renewing youth.

A Clockwork Orange," 'A Clockwork Orange II - An Aeon of Failure'
","The 'Clockwork Orange' treatment was actually done by putting the victim into the 'transpersonal' of 'perinatal matrix three' (Hell) with large doses of LSD. See hp://www.allotropic.com for definitions.Dr. Stanislav Grof replaced LSD with allotropic breathing, but, allotropic breathing has to be voluntary, unless it is forced involuntarily like by crucifixion.In the 'Clockwork Orange' treatment the victim is forced to watch violent films while under high doses of LSD. What happens is that the victim then body switches backward and forward in time experiencing the torments of all the people in the film as real as life.In my case, it didn't stop there. I body switched into everyone I had ever seen. It seemed like a thousand years to me, but I was told by a Greek professor who is in the Greek Orthodox Church, that in the 'aioniu automates' (eon of failure) the eon is only a hundred years.The original Greek words, 'aioniu automates', eon of failure, was translated into English, 'eternal damnation'. You may wonder, what happens after the one hundred years? I have always gone back and lived it over, but different ways, vaguely remembering what I did wrong the last time around.If I go back again, but my deaths have always been 'unnatural', if you get my drift, I will get my inheritance back, that I lost this time around, by a failure of the guardianship system.Knowing that crucifixion also causes this. Christ, knowing everyone who ever was or will be, IS in every one of us. This explains how He atoned for our sins by His crucifixion.(Due to the spelling censor, words had to be distorted to get through.)",10,12,19,19 August 2009
