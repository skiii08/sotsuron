Sucker Punch," The best movie you'll hate
","This movie is fantastic. From a filmmakers point of view it is an artist practicing their craft in its full potential. The movie has theme, texture, a social influence, feeling, and power. This is the sort of thing that an auteur can take and realize to its full potential. Zack Snyder is not dumb. If I have one thing to say about the movie it would be this -Zack Snyder (and a few hundred others) made something pretty cool and you should see it.There seems to be this idea that Hollywood as an entity fails to create anything new. Sequels are constant and the remakes come in multitudes. Suckerpunch is something new. Remember people, new is good. Change is cool.There is also the idea that Hollywood promotes common society beliefs. Things like patriarchy, fitting in, and capitalism. This movie goes against some of these things. This is probably a good thing. For those who fight for it, life has a flavor the sheltered will never know.",8,6,11,29 November 2013
The Greatest Showman," Escape to the greatest show
","The Greatest Showman is the most perfect movie to come out of Hollywood in recent years.I don't mean that it was my favorite, and it perhaps not even reach into my top 10. There are many movies that I hold dearer for their flaws and quirks.That said, everything about the greatest showman was polished to perfection. The sets - magical! The broadway production - on the mark! The story - sensational!The biggest hint of its success was the nonstop train of tension which seemed to switch tracks constantly. There was racial notes, generational divides, and multiple love stories. However, most movies would struggle to pull all of these together into a single theme. Which sets up the question, what is The Greatest Showman's greatest theme?My answer would ultimately be escapism. There is a certain meta-aware aspect of this. The movie experience is our modern circus, and we go to escape a diverse and multiplying set of tensions outside the theatre. The true value of the Greatest Showman is pulling us away from constant and evergreen struggles like race relations, progressive vs. regressive powers, and finding love.And it succeeds.",9,0,1,24 January 2018
