United 93," Impressive
","I just finished watching this and was left pretty amazed. This film sizzles with raw energy from the first frame to last. The cast of unknowns and hand held cameras creates a feel as if you are there in the plane with the passengers. The cuts back and forth between the various flight control centers also feels very real, probably because many of the people in those shots actually do that for a living, they aren't just actors.I know many people would not want to watch such a film because it reminds them of the tragedies that occurred. Sure, it makes you think back to where you were that day, what you were doing and how you felt. But, to see this film gives you a new perspective on the situation. To see how real people were trying to deal with this as it was happening. As the passengers tried to overtake the plane, there is inspiration that flows.It strikes a raw nerve, but it remains very respectful. Did Greengrass know exactly what was happening on the plane, of course not. He was able to create enough of a story to make sure that people would have a portrait of what they went through as well as respecting their memories. No one should be insulted by the portrayals of the passengers on board. He tried to make them look heroic in the face of terror.Just an impressive film. I do not think I will need to see it again. Once is enough as it left me emotionally drained, but one viewing was worth it. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,14 November 2006
12 Angry Men," An Excellent Look Into the Jury Room
","12 Angry Men, I first saw when I was in law school a few years ago.  I was blown away by what I saw.  From a cinematic point of view, this movie has everything.  The performances are top-notch, the writing is tight and fluid and the direction makes the viewer feel as if they are juror #13 actually sitting in the room.From the legal standpoint, this movie should be shown to potential jurors to better understand what it is they are to do once they go into the jury room. Obviously, a jury like this one is a defense attorney's dream, but the vision of how jury deliberations play out has never been more wonderfully recreated than in this movie.The remake that was made a few years ago was good, with fine performances by everyone, but the original is always better.  12 Angry Men, set entirely in one room for the duration of the film, with the jurors being the only actors seen on screen is one of the best dialogue driven films ever made.  The characters and their traits come out through the deliberations, but we never learn the names of any of them, except in the last moments of the film. It is not about the characters, it is about the dialogue.  I have yet to see a movie that can mimic this brilliance.",Null,0,1,19 January 2004
