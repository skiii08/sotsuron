It," So close being really amazing
","I'll start with pro's and con's and later elaborate-Pro's -I like this kind of horror. They don't scream and jump on you every second, it's abrupt. Sometimes with silence, sometimes it builds up, when you least expect it (like after Bev smashed her father's face), and yeah, sometimes they do scream and jump.The CGI is quite good most of the timesThere is actual character development and somewhat of a storyIt's really relateable and silly - All of those awkward teen moments. Makes ya giggle and remember.The villain is quite quirky and fun.Con's -When the CGI isn't good, it's horrible.There is lack of character development & screen time for Mike (the farm kid), the Jewish kid and the fat kid. (And richie, I literally forgot about him and remembered after writing a whole other paragraph, which is a bad sign for the character.) All the rest got a proper treatment.The characters dynamics got messed up and wasn't even that good in the beginingThe ending.Elaboration-I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But I just couldn't.Mike. The farm kid. 
The actor was great and underused. They didn't give him enough screen time to actually make him a character. He is basically nothing more than an idea for a character.Character dynamics. 
Once everyone got mad and scared over Billy the protag and split up- Something felt... Missed, abrupt, odd, as if it wasn't supposed to happen. All the character dynamics that was there initially (the fat being awkward with bev yet they are both somewhat flirty for example) was gone and we were left with 3 characters that actually do some speaking and action - Billy, Bev and the Placebo/Broken arm kid. The rest might as well have died or dissipated and there would hardly be any difference.The love triangle.
The fact there is a love triangle is already bad. Billy, Bev & Fat kid. And honestly? I rooted and wanted the fat kid to be with Bev, and not Billy the protag. Hell, they teased for it right in the beginning of the movie, and with the post-card! It was the perfect. classic underdog kind of character that has redeemable features against his outer appearance (like standing against the bullies when they pulled the knife, which was great. And the fact he was smart as hell yet quirky, with his love for music.). There was no context or buildup for Bev & Billy aside of Billy hitting on her awkwardly. Suddenly, she only goes to hug billy for the rest of the movie??? And even after the fat kid kissed her and she found out HE sent the post-card- two minutes later and it's as if it didn't happen.
The kiss at the end drove me crazy mad and annoyed the HFIL out of me. The End.
Aside fromt hat horrendous kiss, the ending itself was quite... Underwhelming and not very surprising. They hinted all of the movie that fear made the clown strong, but the characters shouldn't have dished it out for the audience. Show, don't tell. And Georgey, why is he dead and the rest of the kids aren't? There was no need to bitter-sweet this if it doesn't make sense. 
Lots of potential. But nothing more than that- Only potential. Most of it not used.",5,1,2,27 July 2018
G.I. Jane," Best female protagonist
","This is how I love my protagonist. Badass, hardass, and above all, struggling. Throughout the film, our protagonist struggled- Against her own biology, against her social status and even against politics! The struggles, her outstanding evolution throughout the film, the support cast, it's all very well executed. Usually, female protagonist will always fall for a man throughout the movie and it will usually have a major part in the plot. Well not here! Her connection to her lover did not change almost anything (in regarding the general plot), which is great. No 'lovey dovey mushy tushy' sh*t! It's all her. No 'power of love', one of the worst tropes in movies.Still, it's not a 10/10 movie. Everything was intense, but at a certain point nothing is intense. It reached it's peak and stayed there- No cool down or another, higher peak. Cons: At a certain point it's not exciting as it first was. The finale wasn't that exciting either. Plot feels too simple at times.Pros: Great acting Best feminist propaganda I've seen in years Funny, wholesome and badass moments. many of them (and maybe too many)",7,3,5,1 December 2017
Us," Giving it a 7 purely for the perfect beginning
","Just like in 'Get Out' - The beginning to the mid is absolutely amazing, but from the mid onward it just falls flat and scatters.The beginning was perfect. Absolutely perfect.
'Who's there?'
'You-hoo'
Like, come on. Why couldn't they keep it up?!The beginning-
Scary, heart aching, tension, interesting, well filmed.
The premise is quite good. 'Girl allegedly finds her doppelganger and gets ptsd, years later to find out it was true, and even truer than she thought.'
Her daughter talks about conspiracy theories, something that SHOULD have been talked about a lot more later on and more dwelt in. Alas, they don't in the middle of the movie, something that really makes the film scatter off.
The beginning was truly a piece of a quality horror film.
10/10The middle-
The movie starts taking itself less seriously, but way less seriously.
They add jokes while being in the most horrific situations, like;
'You can take the boat for all I care'
'Dad, no one wants the boat'
While they are all crying and shivering of fear. Like, come one. You see how silly it is?
I figured out they were going to have to kill their own doppelgangers, because come one it's pretty obvious, and the ways they did it were good and interesting but... The movie lost it's 'scary'. It turned to some action film (not a bad one, mind you) instead of a horror.As a horror film, it's a 6/10, but as an action/thriller it's an 8/10.The ending-
The worst part. In short - A bloody X-files movie. I'll give credit to the beginning- They hinted that the tunnels are still being used, but the lack of talk and dwelling on conspiracy theories made the ending fall flat - It came out of no where. A huge twist with almost nothing to indicate about it. Only the text at the beginning, but it's a bad kind of hint. A hint that's literally provided on a silver plate instead of being in the movie itself. Might as well given out fliers with the text before entering the cinema.
No (or bad) hints = bad huge twist.
Same goes for the mother twist- It even contradicts literally everything the dop-mom said, about how she was born in the facility and never knew warm food and all. And they didn't show that she was brainwashed after being kidnapped or got her memories erased, there was no indication for that in the film so it's just bad writing from here on out. I did notice the mother's growling and violent behavior early on before the twist, and I thought to myself 'Wow, the mother's character developed to a protecting lioness!' only then to destroy the image with the bad twist of 'she was a violent clone all along' - Something that absolutely contradicts the early phases of her character in the movie.
4/10.I give the movie a 7 only for the beginning and the potential it had.",7,0,0,29 June 2019
Suicide Squad," I honestly wasn't disappointed.
","Why I wasn't disappointed? because it's a DC movie. *might contain minor spoilers*So, today I went into the cinema fully aware it's gonna suck. BUT! I just didn't know how much. I'll make it short. The dialogue is cliché The story is cliché The story at times didn't make sense There were too many ideas & characters thrown together at the same time so it didn't make sense and really didn't do anything.. 'Solid'- as if the movie is a few incomplete movies. Plus, they didn't need these many characters. Almost no character development. Cliché *Spoilers* The Joker (which I didn't really find this interesting. Yeah, here and there's a bit of a nice joke but that's it) did not contribute IN ANYTHING regarding to the plot except for the exposition. Hell, all he did in the movie is to make it a bit longer and a sad attempt in the end to show there will be a second movie or some kind of sequel.Another character is the climbing guy. I don't even remember his name. WHY THEY NEEDED HIM!? ALL HE DOES IS TO DIE. You can even tell he is not going to live because he is the only one in the s.squad to not have exposition. If he had one it would have made his death more surprising and interesting.The Australian and the Japanese girl added nothing. They made almost, if at all, no change in the plot. So did the croc-guy. And the human-torch had 1 thing to do in the movie - Become another super-powered being so he can stall the bad guy and get redemption.Do you realize that if the boss-woman hadn't made the suicide squad in the first place, the witch thingy wouldn't have happened? OH AND THE WITCH THINGY!The 'Villain'(????). No actual motives except 'yaarrggg I'm evil'. She builds a weapon. OK. What the weapon does? NOBODY KNOWS AND ITS NOT EXPLAINED PROPERLY (If at all). The worst part- They had to have a happy ending so the girl that the witch took over still lived in the end.They should have taken 'Civil War' as an example for a good movie with a huge ass cast. Throwing away un-eeded characters, cutting scenes that are repetitive or just un-needed and making a better and more realistic dialogue and a villain with a clearer motive. (Despite that the villain in civil war kinda sucked.)",3,2,4,9 August 2016
Taxi Driver," I was bored.
","The movie just didn't touch me at all.
I couldn't sympathize with the main character due lack of cause- What caused him to be the way he is. There are no flashbacks and almost no hints except he was in the marines and got an honorable discharge.
Beyond that, the description for the movie includes the young prostitute. The problem with her is that she just... Doesn't fit being in the description at all. While being foreshadowed and shown in the start, she only held meaning and importance in the end, when our main character found where to put all his anger and frustration at. At the 'company' she was working at, all because his assassination failed miserably. 
Except of frustration and anger and mental stability, there wasn't much to our main character. He had the Hero Complex, he thought himself to be a hero like in the movies. He had anger that fueled the complex. 
Beyond that- What's to him? Who is he as a person, aside of the complex and anger? What does he like? What was his dreams, aspirations? 
He's not that much of a character.
I don't see this as a masterpiece. It's the first time I disagree on a movie that is known as a masterpiece by almost anyone who watched it.",6,2,4,15 August 2018
Get Out," So close to being perfect. But also so far.
","It had two, MAJOR flaws. One of them is subjective, one of them is objective. I'll start with the objective one. The first flaw, is just a plot hole. (Hence, an objective problem). When Chris was tied to the chair, he came out with this idea of using the cushion of the chair as ear-plugs. It's clever, I will admit. But the problem is... How the 'other side', the villains, didn't know he did this? Obviously they had implemented a mic. That's a given, since he talked with the blind guy on the TV. But the problem is, that they heavily hinted they planted a camera too. After all, the TV switches on and off when he awakens and drops, which means they SEE him. So how didn't they see he plugged his ears shut? 'Security guard not noticing the camera ex machina'?The second problem, the subjective problem, is the massive race bait throughout the movie, which even contradicts the villain's evil plot! The villains were painted in the beginning as 'really really white' and 'racist' and 'Never seen a black before' or 'they is kinda racist man'. But eventually, we find out they AREN'T actually racists, but they abduct people based on fashion ('Black is in fashion now') and needs (The blind guy just wanted Chris's body to see like Chris for his gift in the art of taking pics). In other words - The whole beginning to the middle of the movie was one huge race bait.EDIT:I thought about this movie some more, and I realized more flaws. For example, right at the beginning - The black guy walked around the neighborhood KNOWING bad stuff are going around. Then he sees a suspicious car. Will he run for it? NO. He's gonna wait 'till the villain comes out and kidnaps him.Beyond that, the other major black-character was annoying. It felt like they wanted to do comedy, but the humor was meh at best. They should have stuck to their dark tone from the start to the end without trying to spice it up, which effed things up regarding the tone as a whole. And lastly, it's not 'horror'. It's a thriller. Or a psychological thriller. But it's definitely not horror nor comedy.But still, overall, I had fun it was good. I don't think I'll edit it again.",6,1,3,3 June 2017
Kick-Ass," Excellent film
","A really good film. Shows us how hard, weird, and funny it would be to try to be a superhero in real life- From scratch. Not radioactive spider, or somekind of alien heritage. The acting was good, even very good despite the comedic nature of the film (Since comedy films usually don't have believable acting). I would have given 10/10 if they had focused a bit more on the subject of 'I'm weak, what should I do?' In the film instead of going just 'Kickass', since in the film Kickass meets HitGirl and Big Daddy and realizes he is a super- noob. A bit of training session or at least self-defense sessions for our MC would've improve the film. And the ending was a bit over the top unlike the rest of the film. I think they could have done a better ending with the explosions they wanted to finish the film off. (I wont say exactly what the ending is, because I don't want to spoil it but it involves unrealistic explosives)Great film, I advise to everybody to watch it. Acting is very good (For a comedy film), the story is nice and doesn't feel too slow or fast (Although the exposition might not be THAT interesting for everyone and it will feel like slow story progression, but I enjoyed it.)",8,0,0,26 August 2016
Logan," Truly, my favorite Wolverine movie.
","It's not 6, but more of a 6.5 - Definitely not a 7. I'll just straight up write the pros & cons -pros-Amazing action scenes. The best I've seen in any 'wolverine' movie. They were intense with good pacing, excellent camera work and a lot of creative moments. (The grenades, the clone). Plus, they added to some of the action VERY dramatic scenes (Like with the person who hosted them, after Logan fought his clone).A dark tone which is very intriguing since they executed it nicely.Interesting plot (But there will be a related con). It starts off as vague, and as the movie progresses, as any good movie, it unravels the layers of the plot and the cause\purpose\destination. (Or all three of them)Intense, dramatic, emotional moments that just might bring a tear to your eye. (But a related con will show up)Cons- (Contains major spoilers)The plot. As much as it was interesting and creative, it didn't deliver for me. The main goal of our characters was to get to a place that just might not exist. But we don't get closure about it. In the end of the movie, we don't get to see the main freaking goal of the movie! The destination! The most crucial thing, and we don't get to see it! Is the destination in the comics truly fake and made up, or it's a hint to a real Eden, safe place, a haven?! The good dramatic scenes. Again, just like the main plot - No closure. We don't get any closure in the relationship of Logan & the professor. (spoiler) We get a short moment where the professor acknowledges and finally understands Logan... But alas, it was a freaking clone that ended up murdering him, hence Logan (and us) won't get the closure we so much wanted. Only a hinted, or half assed one. 2 more examples of ruined scenes: (spoilers)1. Laura holding Logan's hand. He ruined the moment with a fit of rage. How I think they should've handled it: Let him stand there for a few moments and just collapse, instead of having a childish fit and then collapsing. The fit painted Logan as a child instead of a grieving & angry adult. 2. When Logan and Laura talked about him staying behind, he talked with the vocabulary & complexity of a 7 years old. Dull 'villains'- They were interesting, but barely presented. I wanted some back story, at least about the mercenaries. (We did get a short summary about that evil doctor guy, so there's that).And one last thing... HOW IS THAT CONNECTED TO THE MESSY TIMELINE OF THE XMEN SERIES!? It's after 'days of future past', or 'what if days of future past never happened', like seriously, wtf?",6,4,9,1 June 2017
Limitless," It started good, but... (minor spoilers)
","The beginning got me hooked. It was great. Lots of philosophical things, like in Mr Robot, which I REALLY LIKE. But as the movie kept on going, I got bored and bored. Nothing new was happening. Just the expected. I expected him to get rich & successful, and he did. 30 minutes left and I can't finish the movie.With this sort of drug he just went to be successful as a businessman, and not fulfill his dreams which he got screwed by and was poor because of them? Nah, just 1 book and lets do something else. EVERYTHING he wanted, and he wasted it on things that without the drug he can't have. Like being smart.The main character is stupid. I can't be sympathetic towards him. He was the cause of his on demise in his life. His gf breaking up with him bc of the drug is also very expected. I gave it a 6 only because I like the cinematography. it would have been a 5 or 4 because it's JUST SO DULL. They could have cut SO MANY un needed parts and 'fast forward' some of the plot to keep it interesting.",6,0,0,15 January 2017
Warm Bodies," I have no clue why people like it.
","It was awful. Hell, the word 'awful' doesn't even begins to describe how I felt watching the movie.It's like 'what if deadheads wasn't funny and it's ending was stretched to the whole movie'.Cheesy, uninteresting, bad special effects & action scenes, idiotic solution to the whole mess. 'Make zombies feel emotions and they'll turn human yeehh' NO. Know what? I would have accepted the solution if the movie would have executed it well. But it didn't. God awful movie.You'll like this movie if you're a 13yo girl with 'pale guys' fetish, or something of the sort.",1,3,6,1 April 2017
Law Abiding Citizen," Could have been so much more amazing.
","First of all- The film is amazing. I recommend EVERYONE to watch it. BUT, it could have been much more amazing. First of all, the first half of the film, is a 10/10. The problem is that suddenly, it turned to an other film, a similar film- but not what it was in the beginning. In the beginning we say a revenge story + teaching the good guys how to actually be good. Then... It became a super spy film? The whole 'nice loving father' image shattered in light of new information which broke the plot.And in the end, how did they find the bomb? HE FORGOT THE CLEANING EQUIPMENT OUTSIDE THE ROOM OF THE BOMB. It's a retarded answer. The film makers made him too smart so they had to make a plot hole. It doesn't make sense he'll do it because he didn't leave almost ANY trace most of the times.Those are the only bad things in the movie. Two major flaws. But aside of them- The film was GREAT.",7,0,0,27 October 2016
The Island," Scarlet johansNO.
","The lead actor, the main character, IS GREAT. You can empethise with him, his actions make sense and overall he is very like-able.ON THE OTHER HAND. We have Scarlet's character. Unlikable, annoying, isn't really adding ANYTHING to the plot. Hell, her acting is so freaking bad... Which is surprising. When I saw her name in the title (In our TV we sometimes see 'featuring: x' so it can intrigue people with their fav actors), I thought 'Hey, this might be a good movie. Is she the main character? I hope so!' And then bleehh. She was a support, and a bad one while we are at it.If they just had picked a different actor, the movie could have been so much better. This movie deserves 8 AT LEAST. She made me want to rate it 6 but it's too harsh. Now, for the plot. I won't give in too much of it- It's just good. Hell, it's an adaptation from a book, and if the movie's plot is that good, just imagine how good the book is! Very recommended movie (if you can bear Scarlet's acting)",7,0,2,22 January 2017
