The Blair Witch Project," Innovative yet retro-horror film is the scariest film in years
","There was something about those horror films of the seventies and early eighties set in the clandestine corridors of backwoods country.  Maybe it was the eerie rustling of the wind or the lifeless autumn leaves that provided the feeling of death and isolation.  This is the setting of The Blair Witch Project - a film that is based on the premise that it is the discovered footage shot by a team of amateur film makers investigating a piece of Maryland folklore. The team entered the woods and never came out.The most refreshing aspect of this horror masterpiece is that it understands the strength of subtlety.  This film more than any other in recent memory, exploits the power of suggestion and invokes the hidden fears that could only crawl from the darkest corners of our imagination.  It seems that the horror genre has been inundated with movies driven by special effects of late.  These films have forgotten that horror movies by nature are supposed to be, above all else, scary.  They should make our hearts jump and our skin crawl.  The Blair Witch Project does this.  It scares with its simplicity - using children's voices in the night, wooden figures hanging from twisted tree branches, and prolonged periods of darkness.Among truly scary films of the recent past (Black Christmas and the Exorcist are two), The Blair Witch Project is at the top.  Hopefully this film will remind horror filmmakers that the unknown is, more often than not, more terrifying than anything that can be captured by a camera.",10,1,3,30 April 1999
American Pie," You'll never look at Apple Pie the same way again.
","There's really nothing spectacular about American Pie other than the fact that it really is funny as hell. I found myself in a state of general disbelief in several parts of the film (namely the opening scene and the now infamous pie scene which both featured humor at Jason Biggs' expense). Yeah, this movie is Porky's with better writing and more heart - but hey, so what? Who didn't love the Teenage Sex Comedy genre when it was on top years ago? Alright, movies like Meatballs Three sunk that ship (and rightfully so) but now the genre (as they all seem to do) has returned with a bang.Looking back on those movies from the eighties, the realization occurs that they just weren't all that funny. American Pie is very funny. There were points while watching Pie when I couldn't hear most of the follow up jokes to the big gags because the audience was laughing so loud. The characters (both male and female) are certainly likable enough even though it's not clear whether there is a future star amongst the young actors (though Biggs deserves something for his self-deprecation). However, proper accolades must go to veteran comedic actor Eugene Levy who is simply brilliant as Jim's straight-laced dad. It is their hilarious and at times very touching relationship that really shone through for me. Call me crazy but if there is any justice at the Oscars this year Levy will get a supporting actor nomination. But, alas, we all know that comic actors seldom get the nods they deserve from the academy (Murray got wrongfully slighted for Rushmore last year in my opinion).Overall, American Pie is perhaps the best Teenage Sex Comedy of all time. So, if you're starved for a delightful romp or if you've ever been to band camp",8,0,0,6 August 1999
