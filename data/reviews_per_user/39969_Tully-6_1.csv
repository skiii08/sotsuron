The Blair Witch Project," Truly Horrible
","Over-hyped is the only word that describes this movie experience. The film introduces you to three college film students who the viewer never feels any remote attachment to.  The lead female role is so annoying that the audience laughed as she shrieked in terror.  The film tries too hard to establish the authenticity of the footage, meaning you get a lot of out of focus close-ups of the grass or the never popular blank screen.  Of course this is a creative and original idea, yes its amazing it was made for such petty cash, but who cares if the movie isn't entertaining.",1,1,3,3 August 1999
