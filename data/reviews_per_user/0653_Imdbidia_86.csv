The Lobster," Unique but slightly disappointing
","Yorgos Lanthimos has the great virtue of looking at our modern world with great insight and dissecting it for us. He turns the insight into a metaphor, and presents the freakishness of our society in essence, for what it is, not or what we've come to accept as normal. In this film, Lanthimos reflects on the pressures that single people have to endure in our society: why are you single? why haven't you married yet? You should date and mate a person like you (meaning, your own social class, race, country, tribe, religion, age, etc.). You should allow somebody else to decide what's best for you (your parents, the group, or the algorithm of a dating site). You shouldn't (mustn't) have sexual relationships with your partner until you marry, or you should have meaningless sexual contacts until you marry. All of those things are societal and cultural, not natural, they treat the single person as an object to manipulate. All of this pressure and questions are analyzed in the film but with a detached mind, masterly, so you might ask, what has this to do with reality? The answer is everything! This is an intellectualizing exercise about reality, the reality of being single in the present day and world. The script is very original -- unique. The actors are all good in their roles, especially having into account the material they've been given. The mood is also great; there is this 70s sort of vintage cold vibe that really suits the story. Some of the scenes in the film are great, as well; my favorite ones being the getaways of the singles to the city, the visit to the supermarket, the flamingo in the middle of the forest, or the group of singles taming their libido with dance music in the middle of the forest. You might find others more of your liking. There are plenty of odd scenes, dialogues and images, some of them really gory, and not my taste, but really impacting. A few things annoyed me in the film, and most of them come from the direction and the script. 1/ I can appreciate the intellectual exercise, but I wasn't able to empathize with any of the characters. The script didn't take me from my head to my heart; a frigid world with frigid characters, even those supposedly in love. I couldn't care about them, unfortunately. 2/ The script is too rigid. The actors had no permission to improvise and develop their characters, something that would have give them depth and humanity. The actors were repeating sentences as robots, and that was what felt like. I'm sure that is intentional but, again, if you don't touch my heart, I won't give a dam about the story. 3/ There are a lot of outdoor scenes in the film, yet the cinematography is grim and alien-like. I thought of the way the forest was incorporated into the story of Fahrenheit 451; the forestry and city in this film are not hostile or beautiful, more flat than anything else. I found they lacked on cinematographic and narrative treatment to incorporate them into the story. It might be intentional, but it didn't work for me. 4/ I was expecting dark deadpan humour and found deadpan horror, so that was a bit of slap on the face; the horror took me aback, and I didn't find enough funny elements, more absurd and grotesque ones. This is one of those films rarely produced in English, certainly an European film because I find difficult to imagine a film like this being produced in the US: elitist, daring, merciless and ruthless. Unique film-making for sure, mentally satisfying, but also disappointing and emotionally frigid to me.",8,2,3,4 March 2017
The Avengers," Boring 1st half, great 2nd half
","I'm not a traditional comic turned into movie watcher. I do have a tendency to watch those films that seem to catch my attention in the trailers, are recommended by friends, like the Avengers, or have high ratings. Not being a super-hero comic film devotee, for a super-hero movie to work for me has to be basically entertaining, engaging and fun. And, if possible to have a good combination of at least a few of the following elements: > Good script. > Great action scenes. > Fantastic production. > Good actors. > Good acting. > Great sense of humor. > A great music score. This movie ticked off a good deal of this boxes, and that happened mostly in the final hour of the film. THE GOOD. > The production of the Avengers is top notch. Great settings, suits, spaceship design, and alien images. > The last half of the movie is what I expect from a super-hero action movie to be and it has a great tempo, awesome action scenes, spectacular fights and alien creatures, and is full-on fun and engaging. > Jackson, Hiddlestone and Evans are good in their performances, but I personally liked the freshness and natural acting of Paltrow and Gregg in their very secondary supporting roles. I love seeing kick-ass female characters, and Johannson seems really fit for that sort of roles, and she nails her character in that super-tight suit. > Some of the dialogues and scenes were witty. THE BAD. > Painful tempo and too long. I felt bored to the core during the first half of the movie, which goes for over an hour, with boring pretentious dialogues not much happening, and scenes that don't add anything to the film. I stopped the DVD frequently because I was struggling to keep my attention focused. > Hemsworth was a pain to watch when he had to deliver his lines no matter how hot, and Downey Jr always plays the same role no matter his character, something I find very annoying. > Thor had a quite heavy Australian accent but his brother in the film Loki had a very British accent, although, of course, they are from planet whatever. Shouldn't they have had at least a neutral unified accent? > The film is set in a sort of near future, with flying ships and very developed technology, but we see the Police and some of the characters using simple shotguns; this incongruity rests credibility to the settings of the film.THE LOL. The only thing I found hilarious in the film is Ruffalo's transformation into Hulk and some of the scenes related to the Hulk. Seeing the Hulk with Ruffalo's face was like seeing Hulk with Micky Mouse's face. Ruffalo has very sweet facial features, seems to be a very sweet guy, and usually plays tranquil man roles. This was a fluffy huggable Hulk. I was really LOL. The dialogue between him and the old man when he falls into a warehouse are hilarious, but that was intended. OVERALL. If you are fan of Super-hero comic books and films, you are going to enjoy and love this film no matter what I say; that's great and totally respectable. If you are a lover of good films, no matter the subject, this film is entertaining overall, has a great second half, but you will struggle to get there without feeling uninterested due to the unfocused direction, the poor dialogues and the extra-long unnecessary footage.If you overcome the first half, congratulations, you have made it to the Avengers' red carpet of action galore.",6,1,2,1 April 2017
Sucker Punch," Good concept and visuals, bad movie
","Sucker Punch is the story of a group of problematic teen girls (Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie and Amber) trying to escape a mental institution for girls where they are abused and exploited by its director Blue Jones.The start of the movie is very promising. It tells the story of how Baby Doll, the leading character, gets to the mental institution. It has a good narrative and terrific music, and, in fact, looks very much like a well-made video-clip.This being a Fantasy film, you expect the unexpected and you are already open to unbelievable things to happen; however, to swallow the lot, the story needs to have an internal logic that makes it organic, and you rarely find that here beyond the opening sequence and the thin line connecting the different day-dreams. The day-dreaming scenes, are very entertaining, because, well, they are supposed to be day-dreams in which anything is possible. However, once again, thee whole seems like an extended video-clip pastiche, one moving to a different one.The movie has a great concept and succeeds at creating an unique an bizarre Universe that mixes themes and aesthetics in vogue in modern pop culture (a mix of early medieval, Gothic, traditional Japanese, the 1920s and 1950s aesthetics). The special effects are great,and the action scenes are terrifically filmed, and always powered by a terrific music. However, the script is so thin, the characters so superficially drawn, the nonsense so obvious, and the pretentiousness of some scenes (the end for example) so patronizing that you cannot ignore them.The acting was good on the part of the always convincing Oscar Isaac as Blue Jones, John Glenn as the Wise Man, Jena Malone as Rocket, and Amy Cormish as her sister Sweet Pea. The rest of the cast is OK: Emily Browing as melancholic Baby Doll, Vanessa Hudgengs as Blondie, Jamy Chung as Amber, and Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski. The rest of the cast seems to be more a group of extras passing by, despite the cameo of Jon Hamn.I loved the soundtrack, but there is barely a rest from it. Although the lyrics of the songs are directly related to the story, the intensity of the music is overwhelming and numbing. This is a movie and you expect the music to be at the service of the story, not the opposite! The fleshy flesh wasn't necessary in the story, to be honest, and it is a bit of a perverted old man's fantasy. Sorry Snyder! I found unnecessary the characters being dressed in sluttish dresses the whole time. They could have carried on the story with the girls wearing jeans and t-shirts outside their dancing areas. Insulting are those moments in which the focus of the camera goes on some of the girls' bottoms!At the end of the movie I felt that the great imagination, potential and actors have been wasted by a poor direction and that Snyder is your man if you want to get a super-duper video-clip not a movie.The DVD has a bonus of 4 animated short films directed by Ben Hibon (Feudal Warriors, The Trenches, Dragon and Distant Planet), which complement the day-dreaming scenes. They are good visually, full of potential, but too hurriedly done, and with paper-thin plots provided by the same director, not by the animator. You can have wonderful animation, but if you have a poor story, the rest is a waste of time, money and talent. If you cannot do something well, don't do it at all.An action packed film full of fantasy, big fights, silly stories, and girls in sluttish dresses. A movie mostly for hormonal teenagers.",4,2,5,21 August 2011
The Hangover," A comedy that is actually funny
","One of the funniest comedies of the last years.A group of friends get together to spend a weekend in Las Vegas at a bachelor party before the wedding of one of them. What happens the morning after their first night in Las Vegas, where none of them remembers what has happened, the future groom is missing, have a baby to take care of, and a tiger to get ride off , is the beginning of the adventure.It's one of those Hollywood comedies that uses well known comedy elements and gives them a an original irreverent twist.I think it's a great idea that we don't know what happened during the night at all, so the craziness of the day gets the spectator intrigued and enjoying the development of the crazy events. I loved the last minutes of the movie in which a sliding photo presentation tells the viewer in images what really happened that night, putting everything into place and placing all the pieces of the jigsaw in their proper space.The actors are all terrific, funny, charming and believable in their colorful and archetypal roles. However, are the script and the movie director the ones to be congratulated as it is thanks to them that the comedy is fresh, truly funny and engaging without falling into vulgarity. Moreover, and despite being a comedy full of men, this is not an Alfa-male comedy. The result is a cheeky irreverent and daring male comedy that will enthuse both men and women.I had an awesome time, and I really laughed, which doesn't happen that often with comedies lately.",7,4,6,9 February 2011
Deja Vu," Great fun
","A very entertaining action cop story with a time-travel approach (butterfly effect and temporal paradox).The acting is OK, nobody shines especially in the movie, not even Denzel Washington, but the script is interesting enough to keep you hooked till the end.I found the movie enjoyable mostly because it was unpretentious and the time-travel part is very believable and easily explained to the viewer. No mambo-jumbo or deep meaning.Good action scenes, persecution scenes, love at first sight, whodunit, catch the thief, all nicely mixed up and presented.",7,2,4,3 March 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Old story, great script, funny movie
","Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, a fat clumsy Panda, son of a noodle shop owner goose, who loves Kung Fu and dreams of being a Kung Fu hero and finds himself being chosen as The Chosen One to fight the evil forces and a renegade who threatens his village.The animation, an action comedy, is good and very lovable, but nothing remarkable. The story is predictable, the message 'believe in yourself no matter what' well known, and the characters stereotypical. However, the script is great, very engaging and funny, the main characters and the performances of most voice actors are so good that you soon forget the flaws of the film and fully immerse yourself in it.The film is highly indebted to Jack Black's performance and self-deprecating humor, which really suits the personality of Po. At the end of the movie one wonders, what came first, the Panda or Jack? Also brilliant in their dubbing are Dustin Hoffman as the cranky teacher Shifu, Randall Duk Kim as the wise spiritual old tortoise Oogway, James Hong as Po's goose father Mr. Ping, and Dan Fogler as Zeng.The other characters, despite being important, are mostly action figures and don't have many dialogs, but the voice actors d0 a good job too: Ian McShane as the renegade snow leopard Tai Lung, Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as the Mantis, Lucy Liu as the Viper, David Cross as Crane. Angelina Jolie's voicing of Sexy Tigress is very bad; she sounds as if she was reading something without acting; she should have made the effort, as her character has only a few lines, or the directors demand more from her.This is one of those unpretentious movies that, even if you don't fancy to watch, will certainly entertain and amuse you. Great time and fun for everybody!",7,1,1,13 February 2011
Train to Busan," Utterly entertaining
","Train to Busan is an uber-entertaining action-packed, not-a-minute-of-rest Zombie Korean movie. No time to get bored, the zombies are like rats coming out of nowhere, with a healthy appetite for human flesh, and our heroes are bunch of normal good people stuck on the carriages of a train heading to the city of Busan.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which has nothing to envy to any of Hollywood zombie movies. The film might pass as an American film except for the message, because the message is definitely not Anglo-Saxon culture is Asian culture - individualism sucks, you care and you take care of your people, your don't just look after yourself, that is egotistical and inhumane. You are an hero for the love of your people not a hero per se. On the other hand, as always happens on this sort of movies, one questions who is more savage, the zombies, who became so against their will, or the humans not infected treating other human beings inhumanly out of suspicion.The actors are good in their roles but the beautiful girl Soo-An Kim is really the best of the lot. Her face is uber-beautiful, but without her mix of innocence and her dramatic qualities as an actress the film would have not worked or been so impacting. One really believes that what is happening to her is real. I also loved Yumi-Jung as the pregnant fragile Seong-kyeong, and Eui-sung Kim is excellent as the quintessential baddie Yon-suk.The main downside of the film is not what is in the film, but what is not in it. What was the origin of this zombie outbreak and how was controlled? That is never properly explored or explained. I could forgive the first question, but the second I thought it was unavoidable. Original? No. Good, Yes. Entertaining? Very. Satisfying, just partially.",7,3,5,12 March 2017
Inglourious Basterds," A WWII movie, Tarantino's style
","Another entertaining movie by Tarantino.The strong powerful music, the use of 60s's-style typing and tempo, the visually explicit violence, and the 'inspiration' in other people's movies are all Tarantino trademarks and, therefore, they're present in this movie.The script is not as brilliant as Kill Bill, and reminded me more of Reservoir Dogs in its tone and style, but the film is truly entertaining, thrilling and captivating sometimes, obscure and pointless some others. It has, I think, the playful mood of a war movie that I like, the Great Escape. And that's great.Most of the main actors are well in their respective roles. I especially liked the actor playing the Jews-Hunter Nazi (Christopher Waltz), the actor interpreting soldier Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), Diana Kruger, and Mike Myers in his little cameo. Brad Pitt is OK in his role, but too much facial gesticulation for my taste. Just the opposite happens to Melanie Laurent, too hieratic and emotionless in her role. Some of the secondary roles and actors are almost a caricature, as the movie oozes a cruel sort of humor, but the actors are not especially inspired.A paradox. There are not good or bad people in this movie, all are nasty in different degrees. The 'basterds' are extremely violent and inhuman, which somewhat dilutes their good intentions, fighting against inhuman people. If you are as cruel as the most cruel person, you are not better than that person, even if your principles and aims are very different. I think that is extremely well depicted in the role of Zeller, who shows to be a lovely soldier, who, despite killing 300 soldiers, was not that happy about that. Instead, the 'basterds' were justifying their extreme random violence. The Jews/hunter is very clever and likable, more than any of the 'basterds' who are less clever, more naive and idiotic than this man. This is a confusing message, although reflects very well the idea that in war everybody is inhuman, despite ones having more reason or principles than others. The film, moreover, exploits some stereotypes, too.I consider an error the presence of Hitler at the end of the movie, and what happens to him. It can be understood as a projection of a Universal psyche, as most people in his senses would have liked him killed by his own body-ward, or, even better, by a Jew - He deserved it after all. However, that did not happen, and that fictional license rests credibility to the movie storyline, which is not bad.In many scenes, the violence is justified, but in others is not. I know that this is quintessentially Tarantino, but I think that, by treating all moments with so much explicit violence, the tone and tempo of the movie somewhat gets diluted; if Tarantino had dosed the violence in the film, leaving to the dialogs some of it, the spectator would have been less overwhelmed visually.Saying this, I really enjoyed the film, kept me entertained and wanting more.",7,0,4,9 February 2011
Coraline," Lovely
","The story of a family who moves to the countryside, the unhappiness of the city-girl daughter, and her immersion in an alternative world where her family and the world are just what she wants and what she misses in her real one.The animation and atmosphere are awesome, as well as the whole aesthetics of the movie. Although the script is predictable, it is original and dark in the right amount, so keeps the viewer engaged. I loved the design of the garden of the alternative world, the family of neighbors in the real world, and the fight against the witch, and the decomposition of the fake world into a nothingness that is white. The script also has a few cheeky things for adults, too.It is a good movie, very entertaining. Pity that the script was a little too simplistic.",7,0,0,12 February 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," Utterly entertaining action movie, but an odd Star Trek
","The last Start Trek movie I watched was about 15 years ago or so, so I watched this one as a stand-alone movie, without knowing what the previous new generation Star Trek films were about or the story was coming from. Well, surprise surprise, the movie was utterly entertaining and engaging. It was so enjoyable that I didn't even check my phone once.Overall, the story is a deviation from what Star Trek used to be, more a galactic battle than an exploratory trip. The philosophical exploration is almost absent from this film, nothing that makes me ponder, wonder or reflect. And the little thing there, is nothing new, original or worth noting. I didn't mind it because I truly enjoy action Sci-Fi films, and this is a good example of the genre. I liked that there is some sort of exploration of Mr Spok's character, his motives and inner life.It was great to see a few familiar faces that I always love to see on the screen: 'Robocop' Weller, 'Hot-Fuzz' Pegg, 'Sherlock' Cumberbatch, and all-round-actor Greenwood. Pegg is hilarious as Scotty, and adds the humour and wit that the movie needs. Cumberbatch is perhaps the best of the lot, as the ice-cold intriguing Khan. Zachary Quinto is also good as the robotic not so robotic Mr Spok, and the rest of the cast are all right in their respective roles. There is a great cameo that you don't want to miss if you are a hardcore Star Trek fan.The production is great regarding interior design, city landscaping, robotics and special effects. Very sleek overall. However, it failed to me in two fronts: the dressing of some of the Enterprise crew, who seemed to be wearing active-wear more than any futuristic clothing. The second, some of the alien characters looked pathetic, like humans wearing rubber masks not real aliens.There a few things that really annoy me in Science Fiction, because if they are there, I don't think the director, producers or writers are taking the viewers seriously. Science-fiction is fiction, for sure, but there are things that cannot change because, basically, that is impossible, those are the laws of Nature and of the Universe. One of those things is going to a planet called Kronos, which is not in our Galaxy, with a different atmosphere and environment to Planet Earth, and see the characters going out of the spaceship breathing normally. The other is thinking that a person who is exposed, unprotected, to humongous levels of radiation would come alive or could be revived using whatever.If you don't take the story too seriously, this is a terrific action film with an entertaining story, great wit and visually spectacular.",7,2,5,23 January 2017
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fantasy movie old style
","An enjoyable movie perfect for the whole family.It is an archetypal fable for children, full of children heroes, wondrous creatures, a beautiful nasty witch, a king lion, magic, battles, good and evil, adventure and action. The movie is entertaining and visually charming, and the visual effects are not overwhelming and do what they should do - help to present the story in a believable way instead of becoming the star of the movie.All actors are OK in their roles, especially Tilda Wilson, believable as evil witch, and the young Georgie Henleyhe as the youngest sibling, whose face and expression reminded me of Judy Garland when she was a child. Really, her face conveys so much magic and tenderness, she is so expressive, that the role really suited her, and gave the movie that magic innocence that it needed.",6,0,0,16 March 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," Enjoyable, but completely overrated
","An Argentinian film directed by Juan José Campanella that tells the story of a retired public lawyer, Bejamin Esposito, who starts writing a novel about one of the most intriguing cases of his past: the rape and murder of young wife Liliana Coloto, and the investigation, with his colleague Sandoval and superior Irene, that led to the capture of her murderer.The acting is uneven, poor sometimes, with the exception of Guillermo Francella who is terrific as the drunkard but insightful lawyer Pablo Sandoval. Soledad Villamil and Ricardo Darin have a great chemistry on camera, but not much dramatic emotion can come from them as the script has the love story as a background to the murder investigation, so their feelings are mostly showed indirectly. She plays correctly Irene, a high-class judge, a beautiful rich inaccessible girl. Darin shines in his portrait of the lonely old retiree looking for clues in his life through remembrance, more than in his portray of the young Esposito; however, he portrays with constriction and sensitivity the soft looser that Esposito is. The script tells us widower Ricardo Morales is an emotional wreck after the death of his wife, a man still in deep love with her, but Pablo Rago's performance rather shows emotional frigidity regarding the death of his wife, his grieving, and the search and capture of the murderer. I found Javier Godino's performance over the top as rapist Isidoro Gomez, although I think it is what the script requires from him; in that regard, it is not his fault.I do not mind flaws in a script if they are well integrated in the story, and if the movie compensates them with other positive elements. However, there are so many and evident flaws here that one cannot ignore them. 1/ The first is the fact that the way a man looks a woman in a photo can lead to anyone to suspect he is a murderer; to be honest, if this is the case, Esposito could be a potential murderer, too, if we take into account the way he looked at his adored Irene in the photos taken in her pre-wedding party. 2/ When Esposito and Sandoval are at the house of Isidoro's mother, the old lady returns, her dog starts barking at them but she does not suspects anything, and, even more, OMG the back-door is completely open for them to run! 3/ We are told who is the murderer and that he loves a specific football team, so Esposito and Sandoval go to the next match, the stadium is fully packed, but they manage to find Isidoro 10 feet away from them; not only that, the lawyers have convinced the Police -one assume Argentinian Police had much free time at hand at the time and would consider the proposal sane- to be there to capture the murderer. 4/ Most of the movie is set in the 1970s, when a military dictatorship was ruling Argentina, a system that allowed the Justice System to act in a certain way; but if you are not familiar with Argentinian history many of the events/attitudes in the movie wont make any sense to you. 5/ We know who the murderer is quite early, before he is even captured, a fact that kills the suspense very soon. 6/ One would expect that whomever sent the group of assassins to Esposito's apartment to kill him would have provided them with a photo or at least an accurate description, so the question of the assassins in the movie is completely redundant. 7/ The end of the murder case is good, but still, too delayed and lost in a mix of themes explored at the same time; on the other hand, the end of the romance story is a bit unbelievable, 'I solve the mystery and I overcome all of my securities with this woman' sort of thing. This, and much more, makes impossible to call this movie a masterpiece, unless you are blind.Said this, the movie has a wonderful warm retro mood and tones, a beautiful interior photography, a simple unfulfilled romance story, an intriguing plot, a very interesting ending, and good performances by Darin and Francella.The film it truly overrated.",7,1,7,21 April 2011
Hot Fuzz," A comedy that actually makes you LOL
","Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a hard-core cop in London, whose job is pretty much his life, but he founds that he has been 'promoted-demoted' to serve in the small village of Sandford, populated by sweet and too-relaxed people. His partner Danny Butterman, a local, is the contrary, an obese cop who dreams of the action he sees in American movies. The job is killer-boring until a series of apparently accidental deaths start to happen.Think 'Midsummer Murders' mixed with 'Die Hard', add lots of spoof-like moments, parody acting, crazy twists and turns (although the mystery is not as predictable as you might think), and, more importantly, lots of English wittiness.It is the settings, the dialogs, the script (by director Wright and actor-writer Pegg), the humor, how well (un)matched the characters are, and the great performances of the all-star English cast: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, and Martin Freeman among others.One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Unpretentious. Fresh. Entertaining - A comedy that actually makes you laugh. Bingo!",9,2,3,21 May 2011
Home Alone," A classic that doesn't lose gas
","This has become one of my favorite Christmas films over the years.This is a classic that has everything to please children and adults: with a killer mix of adventure, comedy, melodrama and embedded moral. The main thing, to me, is that the Christmas spirit is there, so the rest just clicks into the puzzle easily. The movie is predictable, of course, but that is part of the charm you expect from a Christmas story, unless you are watching an horror movie or a proper adult comedy.I loved Macauly Culkin when he was a child. He is brilliant in this movie. He fuses with his character in a way that is difficult to separate the two, showing the great actor he was even at that age. The Good Son would would highlight his maturity as actor, so he is not a pretty face here. Macauly and his character Kevin looks angelical but is far from being an angel; he has a good heart, has an insight into what is good and bad, is ready to be advised by wise people; at the same time, Kevin is also creatively ruthless with the baddies because, well, they brought it upon them and deserve it. Despite Kevin being alone, this is a choral movie. It wouldn't have been the success it was if it wasn't because the performances of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, who are brilliant as the mischievous yet naive baddies. Daniel Stern is especially funny, and has one of the best on-screen yells in movie history. I don't want to forget John Candy's secondary role in this movie, who is deadpan funny in one of those garrulous characters that were one of his trademarks. Roberts Blossom is also great as the lonely grumpy old neighbor. The rest of actors were believable in their respective characters as well.Home Alone warms my heart and cheers me up every time.",8,1,1,5 January 2017
Spotlight," Sensitive intriguing approach to a sad story
","Spotlight is a sad and fascinating movie to watch. Sad because it deals with the systematic abuse of children by ministers of the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, this story is nothing that happened just in Boston long ago. Just a couple of weeks ago, an Australian royal commission revealed the same systemic abuse in Australian Catholic churches and boys schools, with higher levels of pedophilia, and similar polices of cover-up and/or disregard for some of the children's complaints. As one of the victims says in the film, 'we were not only raped physically, but also spiritually'.The movie is really intriguing because the focus is mostly on the research carried about by the five people of the Spotlight section in the Boston Globe. This is not an anti-Catholic film at all, or a film against Catholics, but an exposé on how the high spheres of the Catholic Church didn't get rid of the abusers and did nothing to protect and support the children and families abused, ignoring the most vulnerable among the community when they were most in need. I found the whole research process absolutely thrilling. I'm a historical researcher and I know how laborious and demanding research is, but also how rewarding and mind blowing it can be. I loved the fact that the film shows the impact that the investigation had on three of the journos involved, as they were raised Catholic.All the actors do a great job and are convincing in their respective roles. I especially liked McAdams, Ruffalo, Crudrup and Tucci. However, this is a choral movie, and the chorus sings wonderfully in tune. The cinematography and atmosphere are excellent, and the music is absolutely wonderful.The main downside of Spotlight is that the research story becomes a bit flat at moments. A bit of more narrative digging would have lifted up the tone of the movie. 1/ I would have liked more victims' voices being included in the film, and also the details mentioned in the letter of a mother to Cardinal Law being brought out more prominently into the story. 2/ I would have liked having a few of the abusers profiled; we are just hinted the case of Ronald Paquin. 3/ I would have liked to dig into why 'Tempo' decided not to follow lawyer Mcleish's letter fifteen years before, and why nothing was done when a victims association provided the newspaper with tons of material, way before Baron took the newspaper over; was it lack of interest? He didn't believe the claim? There were more pressing editorial matters? Why specifically such a horrendous case was just ignored for fifteen years or so?Overall, Spotlight is a very good movie, with very good performances, great atmosphere, and very balanced in the way it approaches such a delicate and horrible subject.",9,1,2,18 February 2017
My Neighbor Totoro," A portrait of magic in childhood
","Another beauty from Ghibli Studios and Hayao Miyazaki.My neighbor Totoro tells the story of two young children -Satsuki and Mei- who move to the countryside with their father to a new house to prepare the arrival of their mother from hospital.The script is simpler than Miyazaki's other movies, but it is tremendously enjoyable and captivating despite its flaws. In fact, this is, perhaps, Miyazaki's sweetest movie ever, as it is captures the essence of being a child, with the innocence, naughtiness and magic that surround it. We see the simple things that make children happy: playing with little things, imagining things, the thrill of moving to a new place and making new friends, siblings' relationships of dependence, love and hatred, and the magic that innocence can create. Anybody can remember special moments of his/her childhood when watching this movie.Much of the appeal of the film are the characters of the two little girls and their neighbor old 'grandma nanny' to whom the viewer feels immediately drawn, but also to the quirky plush-ish characters of Totoro and friends. The dubbing of the actors in the Japanese version is excellent and really honors the characters and makes them even more adorable.Not less important in the movie, is the fantastic drawing of the Japanese scenery, so beautiful and emotionally connected to the story. The landscape, and Nature, play an important part in the movie, and, as in other Miyaki's films, the themes of the magic in Nature and the power of being in harmony with the environment are also explored here.A delightful movie for children and animation lovers in general.",8,0,1,22 February 2011
Juno," Overrated, still nice
","A nice enjoyable movie.The good thing about this film is that the pregnancy of adolescent Juno, around which the film revolves, is not treated in a judgmental moralistic way. It just happened and Juno deals with it her way, which is a little bit odd, as she is. It is truly rare that such a big issue, as teen pregnancy is, is treated in such a fresh and open minded way. That's great.The dialogs, especially Juno's and the ones she has with her parents, are excellent, but the script shows up and downs regarding the story in general and the dialogs of other main characters. The roles of the future adoptive parents are stereotypical and predictable, although respond to human reactions that we find in real life.The performance of the supporting actors here is excellent, and both the actors playing Juno's father and step mother are great, sincere and believable in their roles. The same re the actor who plays Juno's boyfriend, who I found adorable. The roles of the adopting couple are not that good, and the performance of Jennifer Garner and the actor who plays her husband are mediocre, sometimes over the top, which unbalances the overall tone of the film.Ellen Page is a talented young actress, and her quirky character goes well with that quirkiness she has as a person. I think that her nomination for an Oscar was excessive as her performance in Hard Candy was far better and more complex and demanding and she was not nominated. But she definitely has talent.I loved the little songs that percolate the whole film and the golden tones, which welcome the viewer into a warm story, family and characters.However, reviews and critics have overrated a movie that time will show did not deserve a 9!",7,0,4,16 March 2011
Match Point," Nothing new, pretentious at times but enjoyable
","Match Point is a UK-USA-Ireland-Russia Co-production, mostly shot in London, and directed by Woody Allen.The story revolves about a love triangle between young retired tennis player turned businessman Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers), his wife the sweet good-hearted rich girl Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), and the bombshell struggling actress and Tom Hewetts' girlfriend Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson).This is one of those stories we have seen brought to the big screen many times, a Hitchcock's theme in a way, the love triangle, the crime, the coward who prefers his boring loveless wealthy life to start afresh with the woman he dreams about. The first scene of the movie is very philosophical and it is a good premise of the drama that will unfold:The man who said 'I'd rather be lucky than good' saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.Luck is more important in life than you can ever expect, and it is always unpredictable and fanciful. In fact, the story is all a story of a very good luck for Chris's character, especially at the end. However, this is a romantic psycho-drama with a predictable plot, so the interesting premise gets diluted very soon. In other words, the movie is too mundane to be philosophical, and pretending the contrary is... pretentious.The film is shot in a very fresh way, has a nice bright artsy atmosphere and hints of Allen's sense of humor (especially in the policemen's conversations at the end). The actors do a good job in their respective roles, although this is a mini-coral movie. Meyers has a good chemistry with both Mortimer and Johansson, and he's able to portray with believability the double face of a cheater, and also the difference between love and passion. Emily Mortimer shines as a very believable sweet bland woman who is blind to anything she does not want to see. Johansson also shines in her femme fatal role, which she always nails.The soundtrack is formed for a mix of modern and old opera arias. Carusso's old records are intercalated in the middle of the movie to highlight the actions of the characters. Modern performances are played while the characters attend performances in the theatre or hear some records.The movie has a nice feel about it, is well filmed, decently acted, and has a good direction. However, the movie does not add anything new to the genre, is too predictable, has a poor script and important flaws in the murder story. A bit dull but enjoyable the same.",6,4,5,10 February 2011
Crash," Great movie that will stand the pass of time
","Who said that the Oscars movies can't be independent and good quality? Crash is an example of that.A single event in somebody's life can have repercussions in many others. That is the point of departure of this post-modern holistic view of human interrelations and of modern American multicultural multiracial society. A portrait of the always bleeding American society and of the depths of human spirit.Crash is a choral film in which each main character mini-story links to the others in an organic way. Moreover, is not a movie with good and bad people and roles, as all characters are deeply human, therefore, both shown in all its splendor and misery - sometimes disgusting, reproachable, racist and violent, some others heroic, tender, kind and good. The story has action and introspection at the same time, and the main characters are wonderfully drawn and played by all actors.The movie, moreover, offers a raw unadorned image of American society and social groups - a society full of anger, violence and fear. Nobody is free from it - Rich or poor, immigrant or native, leftist or fascist, victims or executioners. But, again, the characters are not good or bad, are good and bad depending on the circumstances.I loved the fact that some of the developments of the story made made me question assumptions and prejudices about people. In fact racist people can show non racist behavior and vice versa. Some people preach anti- racism and them behave in a racist way. Heroes can be villains and vice versa.The director did a great job at creating unity and giving harmonic pace and sense to the emotional physical and cultural chaos in which most characters live. The movie makes you think, but it is entertaining and approachable, emotional and thinkable.A great movie that will stand the pass of time.",8,0,4,16 March 2011
Horrible Bosses," It made me laugh
","Who hasn't, a certain point in time, wanted to see a horrible boss dead? Or at least wished them the very worst, like dead? :)) Guilty. The script takes on the challenge, creating work situations with which many people can identify, and with feelings of frustration, despair and revenge that we have all had but never carry out, of course. We need the fantasy, and this movie is the fantasy.This is not a comedy that reinvents the genre, it is not a witty movie, or white humour, is every-day humour with all the stereotypes and nuances that we want in a movie when we want to LOL at ease.The movie succeeds because it has a classic funny script with formulas that work in comedy and, especially, because the cast fits like puzzle pieces and there is chorus working to make you laugh, instead of a hero comedian trying you to get his/her humour. I especially liked some of the bad bosses :)) Kevin Spacey as the psychopathic posh boss, and the biggest surprise to me was Jennifer Aston; I'm not a fan of her at all, but she she is great as the sassy horrible dominatrix dentist boss.I had a great time watching this film. Perhaps because I didn't expect anything, not even laughing, and found myself really doing so.",7,0,2,7 January 2017
Shutter Island," Beautiful thriller with a few flaws
","A classic psychological thriller based on Dennis Lehane's eponymous novel.The movie starts with the arrival of detectives Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule at the Ashecliffe Mental Hospital on Shutter island to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando from her isolation room, and narrates the twists of the investigation, in which Marshal Teddy will find himself personally involved.The film is well acted, especially by Di Caprio as Detective Teddy -in a role that he plays with great easiness and believability- and Michel Williams as his sensitive deceased wife Dolores. Ben Kingsley (as Dr. John Cawley), Max von Sydow (as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring) and Mark Ruffalo (as Chuck Aule) are all correct in their performances.The plot is not especially original, somewhat predictable, but it is well carried out. There are a few flaws and inconsistencies in the story, but, overall, it is very engaging and enjoyable, thanks to Scorsese's masterful direction, Di Caprio's performance and the artistic team of the movie. The mood is excellent, and mixes the feeling of the noire films of the 1950s with modern themes. The oniric images are truly beautiful and intrinsically connected to the story, and so are the special effects used in them.A very entertaining thriller, with a few flaws.",7,0,1,10 February 2011
Tangled," Sweet and Witty
","Tangled is a free adaptation of the traditional fairy-tale of Rapunzel. A fairy-tale romance and adventure movie, but also a coming of age story in which Rapunzel leaves the too-oppressive maternal womb to discover the world and herself. Follow your dream and leave your child discover the world for herself are the two main messages of the film.The animation is terrific, very beautiful and colorful, but more eye catching than artistic I would say. However, the scene of the flying lanterns is just magical, extremely beautiful and inspiring, as well as the drawing of some of the forest backgrounds. The main human characters are great, very witty and lovable/hate-able. I found horse Maximus truly hilarious, and the chameleon very sweet wise and naughty at the same time. I loved the fact that the animals don't talk, still they have their own personality and communicate with their owners in their own way.The cast really shines in this movie, and I loved the fact that they were not the usual superstar actors doing the dubbing. Mandy Moore is great as the very sweet, forward and naive Rapunzel. Zachary Levi is cheeky and sweet in his impersonation of the rascal outlaw Flynn Rider. However, the Oscar goes to Donna Murphy, who is brilliant in her role of villain, and she is immediately hate-able as Mother Gothel; she is the epitome of a witch, and one of the best witches ever created by Disney.Alan Menken's score and Glenn Slater's lyric have to be praised, as they really give the movie its soul and mood. Unforgettable is the song 'I have a dream', sung by a bunch of ugly looking outlaws, which has great lyrics and melody. This is one of the most lovely scenes in the film, too. Also brilliant is Gothel's song Mother knows Best, that sums up very well her selfish approach to motherhood. The singing by Moore, Levi and Murphy is great.I found some important flaws and miss-messages in the film, that are clearly noticeable, even for a child, and that were unnecessary. The first one is the physical appearance of Rapunzel's queen mother. She looks much younger than her husband, almost his daughter, and also looks like Rapunzel's older sister, not her mother. It reflects and shameless portrays the obsession for youth of modern society regarding women. An old man does not have any problem in showing his age, his wrinkles and whitey hair, actually that makes it more respectable. On the contrary, an old woman has too look young, unwrinkled and have her hair colored to be likable as an old woman. That was very disappointing.The second flaw in the story is the fact that, despite Rapunzel living alone, isolated, incarcerated, never putting her feet out of her tower until rescued by Flynn, she's not only able to swim but also to dive! Are we all fools or what? The third flaw is the marriage thing. The princess is rescued by the prince, but she is has turned just 18, has no experience with other humans, and less with boys, she would be almost a savage, but she is totally civilized and, even worse, she is getting married at 18! I wondered by the script changed many of the quintessential elements of Rapunzel's primitive story and did not dare to do the same with this part. They could have simply omitted Rapunzel's age, or draw her in a more womanly way (she looks like a 13 year old in the movie not a 18y.o.!) and nothing else would have mattered, as the final marriage would have made sense.Despite the flaws, Tangled is a very entertaining, fun and sweet movie for the whole family, full of action, adventure and sense of humor.",6,1,5,9 April 2011
Doctor Strange," Entertaintment with capitals
","I'm not into superheroes comics or movies at all. I haven't read the Dr Strange comic ever either. I watched the trailer of this film at the cinema and I thought it looked too cool to let it pass. Besides the caliber of some of the actors involved in the project was a great sign that his wouldn't be yet another Marvel movie with more visuals than substance. Gladly, my hunch was good.Not having read the comic, I cannot comment on whether the adaptation to the screen is good or not. Thus, this review is just about the movie. Doctor Strange is utterly entertaining and has the right mix of drama, adventure, humour, philosophical teaching, character exploration, wow effects, goodies and baddies.The visuals of the movie are spectacular, and they are at the service of the story, not just to wow us with fluff. The styling, coloring, wardrobe, and city landscaping are awesome.To me the philosophical spiritual exploration of the main character is perhaps the thing that enjoyed the most, watching a prick transform from selfishness and narcissism into a person with a mission that transcends himself and puts himself at the service of others and of a greater cause, and that is done through inner hard-work catharsis. I found the British wit displayed in the film great!All the actors are believable in their respective roles. I especially liked Mikkelsen, Swinton, Cumberbatch, and Benedict Wong in this order. However, all the cast does a great job and are believable in their respective roles.Please stay for the full credits, until the very end, because there are two extras there that you don't want to miss.Entertainment as it should be.",8,3,5,16 January 2017
Corpse Bride," Sweet and Funny despite the Title
","A stop-motion comic-horror-romance musical directed by Tim Burton, which has all the elements and icons of the Burton's quirky universe.The movie tells the story of Victor (Johnny Depp), who is in love with a shy sensitive Victoria (Emily Watson) and finds himself married to the lonely Emily the Corpse Bride (Elena Bonham Carter) due to the release of an old spell. He'll have to find the way to leave the underworld and his unwanted dead wife, and return to the real world to marry sweet Victoria.The movie mixes the moods of the classic Charles Dickens's novels and the 18th-19th century horror stories, and is sprinkled with a great sense of humor and a few winks to the adult viewer. The colors and backgrounds are beautiful, with a mix of the dark bright colors and precious quirky design that characterizes Burton's design.The characters are physically well designed, his personalities well constructed and brought to live, and they are very witty and charming with those English and Scottish accents. The dubbing is excellent and helps the characters to come to live; you won't recognizer the famous actors behind the characters, which says a lot about the good job they do dubbing them.The musical numbers are brilliant and funny, hilarious sometimes.A very entertaining engaging animation movie for both adults and youngsters - Very sweet and funny despite the title. A classic of the stop-motion animation, perfect for Halloween.",9,2,2,10 February 2011
Lion," Loved this film
","I absolutely loved this film.If the story was not true and amazing per se, this film would still be good. But the fact that this is a real person's story really blows my mind. The story made me reflect on the longing we all have for knowing who we are and where our roots are, and also about how we have to integrate the harsh parts of our past into our lives to have healthy adult lives. This story is so moving and so wonderful, that I don't think is possible to hate it.I loved all the actors in the film, some of whom I don't usually like it. I loved Patel's heart-felt performance and he really deserves all the accolades and the Bafta he won; and let me tell you, he is finally playing a man, and really he looks so hot in this film :). Nicole Kidman provides us with a honest mature believable performance; I wouldn't say deserving of an Oscar nomination, but very good nevertheless. Pawar, the child who plays young Suru, is truly amazing; such an small kiddo, and so mature in his acting. Rooney Marah and the other actors were correct in their respective performances as well.This being a real story, I was really pleased to have real footage of the real people behind the story, and some details of what happened to them.The main downside to me is that we get no background story about what happens to Saru's family after he disappears. We are not presented with their despair, heart-break and the actions they took to try to find Saru; of course, we can imagine that, but a bit of details on that front would have rounded up the story and the film.Lion really did it for me.",8,0,2,10 March 2017
Oblivion," Amazing visuals, OK film
","I love Tom Cruise in action + science fiction movies. He is one of the few actors who seem to believe those futuristic roles and is usually great in this sort of films. That being the case, I was looking forward to watching this film.From the production and design point of view, this is a fantastic film, spectacular scenery and camera takes, very sleek futuristic design and a great atmosphere. Unlike your usual galactic out space story, this is not dark or cold, but very light, airy, bright and beautiful. The story starts very promisingly, but soon deflates because the script starts to wander unnecessarily and is not organically presented to viewers, who will feel in a constant state of What the Heck? once the action starts. The plot, albeit intriguing and original, is not well developed for the big screen, and it is not clear enough, does not have a good tempo, it does not build up properly for the ending, and the editing contributes to the narrative confusion, when, in fact, the script is not that complex. Personally, I think Andrea Riseborough is the best of the bunch in this film; she carries most of the intrigue, drama and confusion of the story with her acting. Cruise is good in his role, although not as convincing an brilliant as in the film he would shot the following year, Edge of Tomorrow. Olga Kurylenko is really sweet as Julia, and Morgan Freeman OK as the scavenger Bleech.This is an enjoyable film with amazing visuals and, a priori, intriguing and original script, but the story is poorly told, the dialogues not especially inspired and the acting just all right. It could have been super-duper, but it is not because amazing visuals rarely make an amazing movie by themselves.",6,5,8,28 April 2017
Little Miss Sunshine," Fresh, fun and meaningful
","A road movie about a dysfunctional family trying to take the little girl to a beauty pageant interstate. An incredibly fresh, witty and enthralling movie with freak and quirky characters, brilliant dialogs, great performances by all actors, and a story that is never boring.I want to highlight four elements that make of this film a great one. The first one, is that a dysfunctional and somewhat/sometimes freak family is depicted in a non-judgmental way. They epitomize the dysfunctions that most families, called normal have. The viewer feels that the family is freaky, but at the same time as normal. There is a lot of empathy in the way the movie shows them to the viewer.The second element is a subtle criticism of the ideal of the American dream and of the self-help tools addressed to turn anybody into a famous rich person. The character of the father -so well played by Greg Kinnear- epitomizes the bullshit that these messages can have, pushing us to fight for success no matter what, following recipes that usually lead to failure and fracas, for which they don't provide any recipe. The mother --played by Toni Collete- is instead the voice of common sense, and a much more successful person in that regard.The third element is the very cleaver non non-confrontational criticism of child beauty pageants. The script poses a rhetorical question, what happens to the little girl going to the beauty pageant being the answer,one with which the viewer agrees without hesitation. The question is, what is freakier, a beautiful child sexually dressed wearing slutty make up who poses and moves in an adult way, or an innocent girl who sings and dances to a raunchy song that she does not understand?In fact, it is what happens to the little freaky girl what shows that the family is not that freaky after all, and that appearances are always deceiving. The family does not push the girl into the contest, does not force her to dress or behave in a certain way, does not dress her as little prostitute, does not expect anything from here, just supports her the whole way, even when everybody turns against her. The other parents, the 'normal' ones, appear as real freaks after all, projecting their frustrated dreams and aims into their little kids, tools to mask their personal failure. All of the sudden, the dysfunctional family is just normal, warm and caring, the others just the opposite. Not that dysfunctional after all.Finally, the movie gives us so many iconic images that imprint our retinas with strength -- The pushing of the van and the music, the girl singing 'super freak', the escape from the hospital, among many others.The movie could have been pretentious, obscure, too simplistic, unclear, but it is nothing of this. You have a great time at watching this movie, but it makes you think. What else do you want?!",8,1,3,16 March 2011
"I, Robot"," Not very Asimov, but great entertainment
","This is a fun action futuristic movie loosely based on some ideas and characters present in several short stories by Isaac Asimov.The Good The depiction of a real and possible future in year 2035. It is a version of our current world, but a little more stylish and technological, with an increase in the use of robots for household chores (similar to those being developed by Robotics at present), fancy cars (similar to those prototypes we see in modern automotive fairs), very fluid and well designed highways, and spectacular skyscrapers. You won't see a over-the-top fantasized world, just the same people with similar clothes and a similar world, which gives great credibility to the story.The special effects are good, especially the design of the old and new robots. Robot Sunny, one of the main characters of the movie, is indebted to Alan Tudyk's voice and facial expression for making it believable and so unique.Will Smith brings great energy to the film, which make the action so enjoyable. Moreover, he worked hard to get his body in shape to appear in his underwear - unnecessary and hedonistic, but still very enjoyable.The action part is extremely entertaining and dynamic, so very engaging for the viewer. Not a moment of dullness or bore bits.The Bad Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan don't have much chemistry, and none of them, nor most of the supporting actors, shines for his acting in this movie. That wouldn't matter if the script was good and the dialogs decent, which is not the case.There are too many stereotypes in the characters of the movie, and in the robotics part, with many ideas copycatted from old classic Sci-fi films. There is no depth in the story in regards with 1/ what makes robots develop human-like behavior despite/thanks to their programming, and what makes them to be sociological oriented, and 2/ what makes us humans and our society so unique, and inimitable 3/ what is the limit between androids and humans.The persecutions against Will Smith are impossible to believe, he being attached massively and surviving everything that is thrown and done to him. That's fun, but that doesn't help a movie that already has many flaws.I confess, I tremendously enjoyed the movie, and I had a great time, but the movie is mediocre and does not offer anything new and fresh to the genre. If you are an Assimov fan, or you are looking for robot metaphysics, you'll be disappointed.",7,0,0,3 March 2011
Disturbia," Adaptation of Rear Window for teens
","A pretentious twist on Hitchcock's classic Rear Window but adapted for teens. Although entertaining and funny at times, the movie is simplistic, predictable from the beginning, and without the right amount of mood and the proper tempo to make it believable as a suspense/horror film.Shia LaBeouf plays convincingly Kale Brecht, a 17 year old high school junior who is in home-detention after a few mishaps at school and, out of boredom, starts spying his neighbors, especially the middle-aged suspicious neighbor Robert Turner, played by David Morse and Ashley, and his hot neighbor, played by Sarah Roemer, who also becomes his love obsession and friend in spying. Aaron Yoo is Ronnie (Kale's crazy best friend). Among the adults, Carrie-Anne Moss well Kale's mother Julie. None of the actors really shines in a movie with OK performances.One of those films that you enjoy on DVD at home in a rainy day.",5,0,1,10 February 2011
Dark City," Retro-futuristic moody movie
","A very engaging retro-futuristic movie, with a very original philosophical story, charming characters, great music, and an intriguing convoluted plot by Alex Proyas. It mixes film noir, sci-fi and action to create a world where the night never ends, its inhabitants have no past, and their present is as schizoid as the city.The film tells the story of Jon Murdock, a man who awakens alone in an hotel room without knowing who he is, but finding himself persecuted by the Police for crimes he doesn't remember committing, and by a group of weird people who want to kill him.--Visuals-- The movie is very stylish, with two different worlds masterly designed. It was a very good ambiance, effective miniature sets, moody colors and lighting, and a wonderful wardrobe. It has many cinematic influences: German expressionism, film noir of the 40s-50s, Hoper's night scenes, and touches of other eras all mixed up in a creative and harmonic collage.Dark city is, indeed, a very dark city where the sun never shines, with dense layered cityscapes that change every night, and a a toxic atmosphere. The city is dominated by dark tones of green, yellow and beige with some colorful elements used as a contrast, with soft blurry textures; on the contrary, the world of the Strangers is sharper, shinier and more metallic, with a predominance of dark bright blues, greens and blacks. All the scenes related to what happen at 12am are very oniric, too. In fact, an oniric feeling permeates the whole film.The special effects in the movie are at the service of the story and, therefore, perfectly integrated. Good for the 1990s.--Themes-- Although the movie did not get good reviews when first released and was accused of being just a an unsubstantial, the movie's plot and storyline reflect on philosophical matters without being pretentious or pedantic. The story, in fact, is an version of the allegory of the cave by Plato, and poses some interesting metaphysical questions: Is the world the way we perceive it? Where is the human soul located, in our heart, our memories, or in our thoughts? Does the place where we live influence what we are? How does the past define the self? Moreover, there is an exploration of human reaction to the processes of alienation and dislocation, and modern urbanism, or the differences between societies dominated by the willpower of the community as a whole, or those in which the sum of individuals is predominant, just to mention a few elements.Proyas was very interested in the book on schizophrenia written by Paniel P. Schreber, a 19th century judge who suffered from dementia, who gives his name to the doctor in the movie. At the same time, some of the the things that happen in the movie are just a reflection of the paranoid dementia behavior that Schreber mentioned in his book.One of the best things of the movie is the fact that the plot is structured in a way that the viewer and the main character are unwinding the mystery at the same time, at the same pace from the same point of view. This makes the movie very engaging and entertaining.--The acting-- All actors are convincing in their respective roles: Rufus Sewell as Jon Murdoch, Jennifer Connelly as Emma/Anna (she still had flesh on her bones, and looks stunning in this film), Kiefer Sutherland as the freaky Dr Paniel P. Schreber, William Hurt as the engaging Inspector Frank Bumstead (this sort of roles really bring out Hurt's acting), Richard O'Brien as Mr Hand, and Ian Richardson as Mr. Book, among others.--The small letter-- I think that the fact that some things are not properly explained, or just not brought to discussion make the movie even more intriguing. For example, how did the citizens arrive at the city? When did that happened? This allows the end to be credible and have a closure, which is a new beginning. However, this is not the case of all the events related to John's childhood, why and how the memories were put in his head and then removed, and the direct involvement of the Strangers in that.--The Director's Cut-- I think that viewing the movie differently would be viewing an incomplete movie, not only because some of the things that happen in the movie are perfectly explained in the director's cut, but not so clear in the original, but also because the movie indulges in artistic filming and shots, which were all removed from the theatrical release.A very original and entertaining movie with stunning visuals and excellent plot, that will remind you of the Matrix sometimes, although it was released a year before the later.",7,0,1,14 February 2011
The Machinist," Thought-provoking moody film
","The Machinist is a psychological thriller directed by Brad Anderson, based on a script by Scott Kosar, and produced and shot in Spain after most American production companies rejected the project as weird.Trevor Reznik hasn't slept for a year, he barely eats, and has become a loner. He founds himself at trouble after a work mate loses his hand because of his negligence, and a plot against him, involving a mysterious cocky man called Ivan, unveils. His only comfort is the company of two very different women: beautiful single-mother and bartender at the airport's coffee shop Marie, and rough sweet-and-sour prostitute Stevie. Who is Reznik, who are the others, and, more importantly, which are the answers to the hung-man post-its he founds on his fridge every night? Although this is a Suspense film, the plot succeeds more at questioning the idea of self-identity than at building up a thriller. The movie is both an analysis on the need of sleep to have a healthy mind and on the power of our unconscious to define, redefine or distort the way we see us, both physically and psychologically. In fact, Reznik's story is just a quest to respond to the question, Who am I? When the question is answered, all the pieces of the story come together in an emotional closure puzzle.I did not notice that the movie was not shot in Los Angeles but in Barcelona, although, to be honest, there was something out of place in it or awkward about some scenes, like the smallness of the space related to the scene related to the cross lights with Marie, or the atmosphere of the Police Station. Still, the atmosphere and lighting of the movie are fantastic.Christian Bale is unbelievable as the insomniac paranoiac steal worker Trevor Reznik, and one wonders why he wasn't nominated to the Oscars that year. The fact that he bothered to get so thin, a walking skeleton really, shows how committed (or crazy) he is about acting. The viewer has to be thankful, though, as his decayed physique helps his character and the movie immensely. Bale just doesn't act, he psychologically splits himself to become Reznik. And anything he does in this movie is believable, raw and authentic.Bale's counterpart Ivan is played by John Sharian, who is cheekily disturbing in his performance. You hate him immediately, physically, the way the moves, the way he dresses, the way he smiles, still, there is something appealing and warm about him. I think his performance and his physique add even more interest to the theme of Raznik's quest for identity. Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Jennifer Jason Leigh are correct as Marie and Stevie, respectively. The rest of the cast are all believable in their respective supporting roles.The main flaw of the movie is its predictability in certain areas, so the tempo and building of the thriller resents it. The viewer immediately knows that Reznik is having mental problems, so, at a certain level, you are pre-disposed to anything crazy or out of the ordinary to happen. In other words, the surprise factor is somewhat killed before starting. The movie is full of clues to understand Reznik, which is great, but they are overly present sometimes. For example, the time of the watch when Rezkik is with Maria is used repeatedly, so this part of the story is killed mid way. However, the movie succeeds at not unveiling who Ivan is until almost the end, so the viewer gets what expects in a suspense film. I would have liked the same with regards to Marie.This is a terrific movie, with a great atmosphere, a thought-provoking script, and a brilliant performance by Christian Bale. The Machinist is one of those multi-layered stories and movies from which you get new details each time you see it. A modern classic.",8,2,2,21 April 2011
The Intouchables," Excellent film
","The Intouchables, despite the title, really touches viewers' heart without being corny, pitiful or tearful. This a comedy that does keep your mouth on the silly-smile mode from beginning to end, because it's funny, it makes you laugh, but is not vulgar, cheesy or cookie-cutter made. The directors and scriptwriters juggled all the dramatic and comedic elements beautifully, and nothing is too much, too less, or so-so. The dialogues and situations are brilliant at times, very candid frequently, and really genuine at times. I found myself totally absorbed by the story and by the interaction of the two main characters.This movie would have been different if the cast was not as good and credible as they are, from the supporting roles of the troubled kids, to the upper-nose relatives of Philippe. Yet, François Cluzet & Omar Sy carry the weight of the story, and they are brilliant. Not even for a second I saw them as actors playing a role, but as Philippe and Driss. Besides, they have an amazing chemistry on camera and on this resides, for the most part, the charm of the film.The movie is beautifully filmed, with lovely indoors and outdoors scenes, and a wonderful lighting. It captures well the real Paris: the wonderful elegant areas of central Paris where the bourgeoisie lives, but also the very poor and marginalized banlieus of the periphery where most immigrants live. However, the aim of the film is not that of showing those dramatic differences but, on the contrary, to show how human connection is possible no matter your origin, it can be possible and magical despite, a priori, thinking that would never happen. It does not matter your social class, your gender, your past, your culture, your family or your ethnic background. The score is beautifully poetic and quintessential Ludovico Einaudi. If you have ever listened to any of his musical pieces, you will immediately recognize the music in those progressive repetitive a-la-Philip Glass soft wanderings of the piano. Just wonderful.My only criticism to the film is that we get to know Phillipe's character quite well by the end of the film, but not so much or as much that of Driss. We know that he comes from a troubled impoverished immigrant family living in a poor suburb, but we don't know much about him, the person, the man, what his dreams, fears, longings are, or what he was doing before the story began.The Intouchables is a mesmerizing, heart-warming and very funny film. The fact that is based on a real story, and not just a feel-good script, gives it a layer of depth that would otherwise not have.",9,0,2,24 April 2017
Ratatouille," Very entertaining
","The story of a rat chef struggling to break into a French restaurant kitchen full of humans.The visual and technical creative brilliance of the film is indisputable, and, from that point of view, is one of the best Pixar movie to the date. Unfortunately, the virtuosity of the animation is not matched by a brilliant script.The script, despite being entertaining, can be complicate for kids and not engaging enough for adults. The pacific living between rats and humans is an utopia and nothing is going to change that, so the start is non-believable. Then, the fact that the rat controls the human is again impossible and therefore non-believable. That is so because for that to work the rats would be able to communicate with humans by word. However, that part is real, as rats do not speak human language. So there is a mix of real and unreal things that never mix well. Better do all fantasy or all veridical, not half half. In fact, the story lacks of the internal logic that Pixar uses to make believable their characters. The dialogs are OK, but there is not enough humor, there are archetypal characters and situations, and looks like a movie targeted to school- holidays children. Nevertheless, it is a very enjoyable entertaining movie, pure eye candy, but closer to Disney than to Pixar's spirit.",7,1,1,8 February 2011
The Lego Movie," Lego on steroids
","The Lego movie has an imaginative original story, great characters, dialogues and message. The story mixes a bit of surrealism, absurdity and child-like stories and mixes it with a bit of super-hero stuff and a bit of social critique. The dialogues are funny and witty. The narrative is perhaps my favorite part of the film.The animation is excellent, however this is not the sort of visuals I enjoy. I say this because the film is visually overwhelming, too much happening on every scene, too many figurines in each scene, too much is too much. Besides, the movie has no tempo or pace, or the pace is just run run run -- Lego on steroids. So I watched this movie with some sort of visual anxiety if that can be said. Unfortunately, it is not just a bit here and there, it is from beginning to end, so I felt it was an exhausting watching despite me liking the story overall.The same story, the same Lego pieces, with a bit of more air and a different pace would have produced a rounder more enjoyable film, at least to me.The Lego Movie tries to remind us all of how important is to play with toys, to develop our imagination, and how being silly is actually quite smart at times. Playing with toys has no rules, no limits, it can be as silly or senseless as you want, as long as you are having fun, all is possible.",6,0,1,5 January 2017
Underground," Comic approach to the drama of the Balkans
","Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica.It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Buñuel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and époque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century.The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years.All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody.Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face.Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the 'island' really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great.Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group.Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series.I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others.Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other.Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.",8,12,15,22 February 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Terrific!
","Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made.",9,127,182,15 April 2011
Enchanted," Utterly enchanting
","Disney is back, in full bloom!A very entertaining and funny family movie, with a story that will engage and amuse both adults and children. This is, of course, a movie about prince charming, but twisted, satirized and modernized. The movie mashes up all the archetypes of Disney fairy-telling and old-glamor musicals and revamps it by using a contemporary script and modern New York settings.The movie departs from a 2D old-Disney-style movie, from where princess Giselle, prince Edward, servant Nathaniel, Hip the chipmunk, and Queen Mother Narissa will jump into New York, with their nonsense talking and schematic stereotypical behavior. In the human world they meet Robert Philip, a single lawyer good-hearted man who doesn't believe in romance or fairy-tales, and his young daughter Morgan, a lonely girl who wants magic in her life.Amy Adams is truly terrific as Giselle, with the innocence, matter of fact behavior, and warmth that you can expect from a fairy-tale book character. Her face is very expressive and makes you believe anything and everything; she's is also great as singer of most of the songs in the movie. In fact, it is thanks to her that the movie is believable and carries on so well.Really great is Timothy Spall in her Woody-Allen-ish Nathaniel, twisted between his love to the queen, his duty as his servant, and his increasing personal worry about self-love. Perfect in their roles are child actor Rachel Covey and Susan Sarandon, whose powerful physique is perfect for her role of witch-queen. Patrick Dempsey plays McDreamy once again, but, Oh well, his role suits McDreamy. The same can be said about a cartoon-ish and very handsome James Marsdem.I loved the musical numbers, so very much in Mary Poppins and Sound of the Music's style. I loved that the different types of animation and special effects -2D, 3D, animal, and book style-, very cute and perfectly integrated in the story. I surprised myself laughing out loud and smiling wholeheartedly during most of the movie, which is the movie's merit.A modern classic from the best possible Disney.",8,1,1,3 March 2011
Gone with the Wind," A very modern old classic
","Gone with the Wind is one of those few movies in which you don't have to offer a synopsis, as it has one of the most famous stories and some of the most iconic images and acting in Hollywood history.The script is a little bit soapy, that's the truth, but wonderfully portraits female resilience and friendship, the complexity of love relationships, the hardships of life and what it takes to overcome them.All actors are great, playing with empathy their respective roles, all well tuned and directed. They played the roles of their lives in this movie, some of their best performances in the movie. You believe them as the characters they play, they fuse in one and take you on an emotional ride. The colors are just wonderful, eye candy, they don't make them as beautiful these days! The dressed, sets and interiors are glorious, and even the fake sunsets are artistically done. Even if you don't like the story, the film has an overall quality and craftsmanship that goes beyond what most blockbusters have nowadays despite their extraordinary budgets and special effects.The movie was shot in the 1930s, but it has a more modern feeling than many movies made in the 1940s or 1950s. I never thought I was watching a movie made at the beginning of the 20th century! The movie is still engaging, mermerizing, entertaining despite the long footage. Old Glamor, the best kind. An unforgettable movie for all the right reasons.",10,2,3,16 March 2011
District 9," Sci-fic renovated and that's entertainment
","A brilliant sci-fic movie. Something that makes the genre proud, but explores new ideas and narrative, and offers a story that is clever, thrilling and entertaining. It had to be a non-Hollywood director, a South African (and some 'Kiwis' too) to come up with such a good story and cast.The narrative of the film is great as the film is presented as a documentary that tells the story of the leading character in the past, with the colors and realistic use of the camera of documentaries, but still developing a fictional story that is presented as real. The use of the faded ocher colors it helps to convey realism and past tense, and gives credibility to the whole setting. This has been done before but not, as far as I know, for a sci-fic story.The main character is superbly played by an unknown (at least to me) Shartlo Copley, who has has done a tremendous job playing with credibility a demanding character that goes from being a naive a little bit jerky soft-mannered public officer to an action fighter.If you want stunning star special effects this is not your movie. This is a movie in which those effects are powerfully developed but subtly and realistically integrated in the story, which is what matters here. The aliens are greatly designed, especially their language, character, social structure and biology, points that are all relevant to the story, never self-indulgent. The director has done a super-job in directing a movie that could have been cheesy or comic (in the bad sense) irrelevant and unsubstantial, but is nothing of that. We cannot forget Peter Jackson's production and the creative team in New Zealand either, who deserve a great praise for supporting such a great project!My main problem with the movie was the setting, the fact that the spaceship stops over South Africa and the relationship that the locals establish with the newly arrived. Don't take me wrong, I think it is great that a country that is not the USA or an Anglo-Saxon country is chosen as a set of a movie; that's great! It is also true that the setting is perfect to explain many of the social reactions that we see happening in the story. My concern has to do with the fact that the movie, involuntary demonizes South African society and black people in general, and Nigerians in particular, who are portrayed as a despicable subhuman group. All of this was unnecessary, truly. Imagine how much verosimilar the storyline would have been if the setting was an invented country in which the social groups are not from a certain known country, just humans. Unintentionally, the script has done something that I usually hate in Hollywood movies - that is, that the bad guys are most of the time black, dark color and/o foreigners from non Anglo-Saxon societies and the hero a white man.The personal relationship between the leading human and alien characters vaguely reminded me of the one shown in 'Enemy Mine', although both movies are quite different in story and narrative.I loved the last scene of the movie, really tender and full of hope. I would say that the movie was left open to a sequel, which I would definitely welcome.Sci-fic fans will love the movie, and lovers of good movies in general, too.",8,3,10,16 March 2011
Cars," Amazing Visuals
","In a world inhabited by locomotion machines and cars, the little abandoned town of Radiator Spring languishes until it receives the visit of a posh race car, Lightning McQueen. His stop and meeting of the old- style cars living there will change his perspective on life and on what he wants to achieve.The mate drawing of the landscape and town settings is magnificent. The cinematography and shot angles used to film the story are truly artistic. The design of the cars is equally impressive regarding animation, colors, texturing and lighting. The night scenes in the open field are among my favorites, so beautiful and realistic. The whole film is a long wow in that regard, and you feel like clapping to those big artists working for Pixar in this movie. In that regard, the movie deserves a 10.The voicing of the characters, done by A-list actors (Paul Newman among them, in his last acting role before passing away), is extremely good, very charming and effective, as the viewer really feels that the voices match the cars' personality and bring a big cozy feeling to the movie.However, all of this is not enough to save the movie, which suffers from an absurd point of departure, stereotypical script and characters/role models, and a childish storyline feeling in general. This will delight children, guaranteed, but will not engage enough most adults. I thought that Pixar had lowered their storyline standards and made a movie that would suit more Disney's requirements. No wonder that Disney bought Pixar little after the movie was released.An enjoyable movie for kids, with spectacular animation and eye candy colors to be enjoyed by all.",6,6,8,8 February 2011
Mr. Nobody," Amazing Film
","Mr Nobody is the story of Nemo, whose possible two life lines and three love stories are alternatively presented.The movie is well shot and the cast members convincing, especially Jared Leto (as adult Nemo), who is always perfect in this sort of odd films and roles. Also excellent are Toby Regbo (15y.o. Nemo), Juno Temple (15y.o. Anna) and Sarah Polley (depressive adult Elise). Diana Kruger (as adult Anna), Rhys Ifans (Nemo's father, Natasha Little (Nemo's mother), among many others, are OK in their respective roles.The visual effects are wonderfully understated, very well blended with and at the service of the story. The theatrical movie sets, the rich colors, the different hues attached to each different life path, the wardrobe, and the lovely music -which mixes some old classic tunes with pieces specifically composed for the movie- create an ensemble that is very easy on the eye.However, Mr Nobody is a great movie mostly because of its subtle but profound reflection on Human Nature, Human behavior, free will and the meaning of life. The movie reflects on questions like - what makes us what we are? Why we act the way we do? Is free choice a key element to be happier? How does other people's choices affect our choices in life? The philosophical, psychological, and metaphysical questions posed are sometimes explicitly mentioned, while others are hinted and expressed through the story as a whole, each different life line story in particular, and through Nemo and the other characters' behavior. Among others, some of the concepts presented here are: Butterfly effect, Principle of Entropy, Schrodinger's Cat Paradox, String Theory, The Pigeon's Superstition experiment, The Nature of the true self, Free will and fate, The linearity (or lack of) of Time, Quantum Physics and parallel universes.There are other movies that reflect on the effect that personal choice and randomness, free will and determination, and the butterfly effect have in our lives. Just to mention three, just remember Sliding Doors, Run Lola Run, and Cloud Atlas. However, they do not have the clarity and depth that Mr Nobody does.The ending of the movie is truly intriguing, and some of the discussions in IMDb are really fascinating. My interpretation of the ending, is that the whole movie is a prediction seen by unborn Nemo of what would happen if Nemo chose the parents he chooses, not what happens after choosing them. The choice starts at the beginning of the film, not when his parents separate. There are many elements that would support this, especially the fact that title of the movie is Mr. Nobody should be ringing some bells in your ears! Mr. Nobody is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking film I have watched in a long time. Perfect for Philosophy classes, and for oiling the creases of your brain in those days in which you feel them a bit rusty. Mr. Nobody is one of those movies that linger in the back seat of you mind for days, long after you have watched it. 'No choice is still a choice' is one of the statements presented in the movie on which I have been pondering for days. Would knowing your fate help you to make a choice? Is one of those questions that made the same to me. The film is full of statements and questions that will keep you thinking, for good.",9,2,3,28 March 2013
Bolt," Lassie has a Truman show's syndrome
","Bolt is Walt-Disney animation feature that tells the adventures of Bolt, a dog actor, and his quest to find his master after a series of events brings him to the other part of the USA.The story uses well-known traditional stories, a dog going back to his owner after traveling hundreds of miles, and the story of a character that believes the world that surrounds him is real and not built to make him believe so. In fact, you find the same elements in the old classic Lassie, and in the modern classic The Truman's Show. In that regard, Bolt is a revamped Lassie with a Truman's syndrome. These elements are well mixed and twisted to create an original, enjoyable and humorous adventure of love, faith, and identity.I found the first minutes, with puppy Bolt adorable. Then, I was quite irritated with the first minutes of the action movie, until the original story starts. So, if you don't feel appealed by the James-Bond-ish persecution, just wait a few minutes and give the movie a chance.The characters are very likable, especially Rhino the overweight excitable hamster, masterfully voiced by Mark Walton, the mater-of-fact but helpful cat Mittens, voiced by Susie Essman, and the several groups of pigeons that appear in the movie, which I found hilarious. Bolt's sweet confused character is voiced by an almost unrecognizable John Travolta, while sweet Penny is voiced by another unrecognizable Miley Cyrus. In fact, all the dubbing is terrific.The animation is very good, especially the gorgeous mate-painting backgrounds, which portrait with accuracy and lyricism the diversity of the USA's landscapes, and make the trip through the country real and believable. Some of the details of the vegetation are just amazing, as well the landscaping layout, house architecture, the colors, and a magnificent lighting. The drawing of the leading characters is just OK, a little bit chunky and lacking in detail and limited movement for both Bolt and Mittens. However, the ensemble is very good, and the dubbing helps tremendously to make the characters come to life.An lovely family film with great animation, entertaining plot, characters and soundtrack",7,3,4,13 February 2011
Frozen," Modern Disney, finally
","Frozen is one of those animated movies that delights adults, small children and every age in between. I don't know what the secret is, but my niece was a fan of the movie and of the characters when she was 2y.o.a., Frozen being the only movie she was able to sit in front of, from beginning to end, without getting up or getting bored. Frozen has had the same effect on children all over the world. There are many reasons why this move has been able to enchant adults and children alike: 1/ This is a version of the traditional folk-tale of the Winter Witch. It doesn't matter that the story has been significantly modified, the mythological elements live in the psyche of all us, humans, and when they are matched outside, magic happens. Ask Joseph Campbell. 2/ The movie has a good combination of comedy, drama, romance, adventure, archetypal characters, and some funny 'pets' we all love straight-away. 3/ We all want to believe in magic, and there is plenty in this movie. 4/ The animation is excellent. 5/ The movie is very entertaining but it also has substance. As an adult viewer, the narrative, the quality of the soundtrack and the character composition are the main things for me not to get bored or disinterested. Frozen pleased me on all of those fronts. I thought that this was a very un-Disney Disney movie, or said differently, old-style fab Disney not the more commercial Disney of the last 25 years. One of the things I loved the most in Frozen was the update of both the male and female archetypes, both finally brought to the 21st century. The crappola of other Disney female characters was wed-out, so this is a movie with strong, independent, stubborn clever women, who are also human beings, imperfect and able to learn from their mistakes. The figure of the prince is also updated, a prince perhaps doesn't have a crown or a title, or is not even Mr Perfect, it is a good-hearted man who cares for his lady. Frozen is one for the first truly modern Disney movies. It shows that Disney is able, when they want, to produce outstanding memorable films as those I grew up with. For that to happen they have to stop considering children idiots. I found that impression confirmed when I watched Zootopia, also a great animated film. Overall, Frozen is great.",8,3,9,13 January 2017
The Lives of Others," A German movie about what does mean to be free
","This is the story of the wiretapping performed on a successful writer and his actress wife suspected of being involved in subversive thinking, writing and activities, by spies from the Stasi Espionage Corps in Socialist Germany.This is the story of a good man and how acts of kindness make a difference in other's people lives. This is a story that shows that 1- freedom of artistic expression allows Society to progress and evolve. 2- You cannot judge a book by its cover. 3- Sometimes you have to take action, do something, to save other people's lives, and by doing so, redeem yourself from your sins. 4- Our intimate and personal life is directly connected to what happens in Society and Politics, even if we sometimes forget something that simple (and important).The leading actors who play the Captain of the Stasi (Ulrich Muehe), writer Georg Dreyman and his actress wife Christa-Maria(Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck) are OK in their respective roles, although this is a movie in which the story and its message weights more than the actors performance. However, some of the supporting actors are terrific.My only little complain is that the change of mind of Capt. Captain Wiesler isn't properly explained, and, realistically speaking, seems improbable that such a thing could happen, especially because this sort of people would be ice-cold and brainwashed. What triggered that change seems not explicitly explained in the film, although subtitles are sometimes very misleading and the original dialogs give specific details. To me, there is a double explanation for his change of mind. 1/ the honesty and principles of others (in this case, of the writer) change those who don't believe in anything or anybody (in this case the leading spy). 2/ The power of Literature (and of the freedom to chose what to read)on the human spirit - the prohibited books that he start reading move him and produce his inner unlocking and liberation.The movie is slow, with an in-crescendo tempo that keeps you glued to your seat. It is very personal and intimate, but also very political and social. The mood is terrific and the ending superb.",9,3,4,12 February 2011
The Incredibles," Great fun
","A great hero action family movie that lives to expectations. Great animation, great plot, (black) sense of humor, family trifles, and great characters.The script has themes and projections of other superheroes movies, like Spiderman, Batman, or Spy Kids, among others, but all the elements are well mixed up, creating an organic original story that stands to the genre. This is a bunch of superhero stereotypes or deja-vues superbly reinvented. That's a merit of the director and of the script. On the other hand, the dubbing is really good too and very engaging.I also loved the tones and retro look with golden colors, and a retro- ish clothing and hairdos, and the general atmosphere of the film.Despite being an animation movie, you soon will forget that and immerse yourself in the story.",7,0,0,8 February 2011
I Am Legend," Entertaining but somewhat souless
","An apocalyptic terror-mutant movie that re-adapts Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name, and the science-fiction classic film of the 70s 'Omega Man'.The movie tells the story of the destruction of human kind by a virus, and the survival of just a few humans, some of them immune and some others mutated by the virus. Colonel Neville, lives and works alone in Manhattan with his dog Samantha, trying to find other humans, alone, lonely and with bouts of mental disturbance.The reconstruction of an apocalyptic Manhattan is realistic, wild, sad and beautiful at the same time. The running of wild deer and lions are just that something that completes the transformation of the city into a wild space, still not the wilderness we expect from apocalyptic dark movies. That's great, not going mainstream to depict something that has been depicted visually in a certain way gazillion times. The empty wild city of 'I am legend' is eerie despite the sunshine and the clarity. There is uncertainty, familiarity, mystery, abandonment, and desolation. It really sets the mood of the movie and makes everything it happens believable. In fact, I would say that, in this movie, the setting is another actor.The story of the virus apocalypse and its effects on human kind are simply told, but are well depicted and narrated. Despite the fact that most of movie is just Will Smith and the dog, we can praise the script to give mystery, intensity and interest to the movie.Will Smith is very good in his role, playing alone most of the time, with great dramatic intensity. He shows that when a script demands some seriousness, he stands to the challenge. His problem is that, most of the time, he chooses roles that just showcase his own self not the actor he can be. This is not the case here, as Smith is physically and mentally transformed, and plays well the lonely human-contact longing Neville in a desert Manhattan.There are special effects in the movie, but they are well integrated, and what is spectacular is not the effects but what happens in the story. The bunch of mutants are really scary and almost human.I found that the time frame was not believable. I mean, that much urban destruction in just a few years? Or things that are not explained: How does Ann know that there is a colony of survivors, where it is, etc. if she keeps moving? Or, when Anna and the boy went to wait for Neville at the docks, and he did not appear, why they did not go hiding to protect themselves from the mutants? They were just there, at the right moment in the middle of the night. How did Neville know the percentage of immune, mutants and deceased? This, just to mention a few details.The animation shorts, which complement the story (in the DVD) are quite interesting as give us glimpses of what might happened in another places of the world, and in different circumstances, when the virus spread. Especially good is the story set in India, which is very gore and truly terrorific, and, I confess, I had difficulties watching. They are much terrifying that the movie.There was an alternate ending for the movie, which I would much preferred (at least for what I've read), but is not the one finally chosen, which I found to be done in a hurry.",7,0,0,3 March 2011
Gran Torino," Completely overrated
","Gran Torino is the story of the friendship between Walt, a retired soldier and widower, and a Laotian family living next door, and the struggle of the youngest siblings not to be swallowed by the street gangs in town. It is an ode to peaceful coexistence and the right to have a better future, a non pre-conditioned racial one.The story has all the elements to be successful, since it has a lovely story of interracial friendship, initiation to maturity, migration, and of good people who want to live in peace. I liked the history of the Laotian neighbors as depicted the reality of immigration and survival in a new racial and cultural environment.I loved the performance of Ahney Her as Sue and Bee Vang as her brother Thao, which are very expressive, sincere and sensitive. I liked the sub- story of the punishment that Walt gives Thao to pay for his fault. I also liked the unexpected end, an example of sacrifice for the welfare of others, which surprises the spectator because the film is quite violent, even the poster seems to indicate that.These good elements were not enough to me because of the tempo of the film, which doesn't't have a crescendo or doesn't demarcates what is important from what is superfluous. The story sometimes gets lost in the superfluous, forgetting those elements of the story that were more interesting and important; for example, all the sub-stories of Walt's family don't add anything to the story or serve to draw Walt's character better. Some characters are badly drawn (Walt, for example, looks like an ailing Dirty Harry, a repetition of past roles) while others are too stereotypical and predictable (such as the Asian boys band.)The film is just OK. I thought it was a commissioned one, the kind of film that some directors have to direct to make money and finance more daring projects.",6,6,12,3 March 2011
Shrek the Third," The weakest link in the series, still entertaining
","The third installment of the Shrek Saga shows an unhappy king-to-be Shrek, who starts a journey in search of Fiona's only cousin, Arthur, the second in the throne line, to bring him to Far Away so Shrek and Fiona can devote themselves to a quiet family life in their muddy swamp. However, Prince Charming has found the perfect plan to get the throne, convincing all the loser fairytale characters to become an army in search of their own happy-ever-after.The old characters are still as lovable as always. Some of the new ones are also very well drawn psychologically, especially the nervous insecure new age retired professor Merlin, beautifully drawn, with great movement and almost human in appearance. The drawing of the backgrounds is really stunning, detailed and funny regarding the names of shops, street signs, etc. The same can be said of the theater stage that Prince Charming prepares to become the king of Far Away, beautiful and so creative. There are still some funny moments. My favorite ones are the one involving Snow White singing to enter the castle, Shrek's dream about babies, and Gingerbread's flashback on his life.Despite the great visuals, the storyline is simple, more for children than for adults. The script is not as witty and original as the previous two, and some of the jokes and funny situations are, in fact, a repetition or extension of others already seen in the previous movies. The movie has very poor reviews and I think they are just motivated by the comparison with the other two Shrek movies, which are far superior in quality.No doubt, this is the weakest link of the Shrek series However, as a stand alone movie, if you don't compare it with the others, is still a decent one.",6,1,2,14 February 2011
Ex Machina," Great psychological film
","Ex-Machina is modern classic that has many of the elements of the science fiction of the 1970s but the visual sophistication of modern CGI. Ex-Machina is above all a psychological drama full of tension that discusses three main themes: the implications of providing robots with artificial intelligence (AI), a discussion on what consciousness is and is not, and on the ethics of creating conscious beings.The ambiance is very cool, sleek and minimalist, with wonderfully stylish interiors and glorious natural green surroundings. The contrast works at symbolic levels, the house-bunker is also that place of the subconscious and of the psyche that the story explores, while the glorious expansiveness of the natural world seems that of the conscious and real living.The movie is intentionally claustrophobic, and is more a theatrical piece brought to the screen than a proper science-fiction movie. Dialogues are the essence of the story, not other planets, or special machinery, or toys. Beyond the robotics, and technological environment this science-fiction is quite mediate, something that might be happening now or in a very near future.Although I found some parts of the story a bit predictable, I didn't find the ending so. Like father, like son is a line that came to my mind when I saw the ending.All the actors are good in their roles. I thought that Isaac was terrific as the petulant manipulative genius programmer Nathan and Gleeson as the fragile sensitive programmer invitee Caleb. Vinker is also good in her role as the Ava android but, to be fair, not much is demanded from her in her role. Despite not uttering a word, I found Mizuno great as Kyoko, very expressive, with a mix of vulnerability, sexiness and danger that is very difficult to express without speaking.I found the movie very engaging despite the many dialogues and a great piece of modern science-fiction, understated in its visuals but very poignant in the content. Yet, somewhat unoriginal.",7,1,3,11 January 2017
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," An old jewel with a fresh message
","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a Miyazaki's animation feature based on his eponymous Manga. It is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which the land is divided in three remaining hostile kingdoms: the people leaving in the Valley of the Winds, the Pejites, and the Tolmekians. Nausicaa is the princess of the Valley, a especial young lady in tune with Nature, who respects and loves her people. The human kingdoms are always threaten by the Sea of Decay, an exuberant toxic jungle inhabited by giant prehistoric-like insects who react to human hostility with destruction, spreading the toxicity of the Sea to those who dare to provoke them.Nausicaa's plot is action-packet, original, with weird creatures, lovable characters and a great lyric soundtrack. We find Miyazaki's usual animation landmarks: 1/ European landscapes and undefined time appearance (in this case Swiss-like, with a revamped medieval atmosphere). 2/ Prehistoric-like creatures (in this case insects). 3/ A female heroine who fights like any man, but always has great femininity (Nausicaa always wears her red earrings). 4/ A heavy presence of catalytic women, presented most of the time as strong, wise, common-sensed and supportive characters (only the nasty princess of the Tolmekians contradicts this). 5/ A cute animal pet that is the hero's soul-mate and inseparable companion. 6/ A clear environmental and pacifist message and 7/ a wonderful detailed animation with subdued hues.The drawing is very inventive and with a great attention to the detail, especially brilliant regarding the depiction of the Sea of Decay and the underground land below it, which are utterly beautiful. The Sea of Decay reminded me very much in style and spirit of the backgrounds and Bosh-like vegetation and fauna of Planet Fantastic, but more elaborated, exuberant and compact in Nausicaa.Unlike many modern animation movies, Miyazaki's movies always have a perfect equilibrium between the artistry of the drawing/animation, on one hand, and the quality of the story, on the other. That is why a movie like this, made in the 1980s, is still as enchanting, fresh and though-provoking as it was in the past. The message of the film is that even the ugliest creature and plant has a purpose on earth, a purpose per se and as a part of the whole to which it is connected. The movie tells you that if you respect people and Nature, you get respect back, and that it is easier to live with yourself and the others if one understands and respect the environment. This is not my favorite Miyazaki movie, perhaps because it is too feisty for my taste, and because I thought the confrontation between the three kingdoms needed of more explanation than the the one provided in the film.This is a beautiful entertaining full-action movie, with a great environmental pacifist message, and Miyazaki's always beautiful drawing and magic universe. Please watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, as the American dubbing is too childish and far from the original interpretations.",7,0,1,23 April 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A love story and a reflection on the pass of time
","A wonderful movie that tells the story of Benjamin Button -a child born old and ailing who grows backwards into a child- who is abandoned at the door of a New Orleans Afro-American family, and his love story with a childhood friend.The movie is both a love story and a reflection on the pass of time in life, what is important in becoming old and in getting old,. However, the two main elements of the story get lost in the middle of superfluous sub-stories and scenes that don't add anything to the core of what the movie intends to be.The prologue of the movie, a short story tale actually, is brilliant as there is depth, abstraction and magic in it, and is the perfect and necessary setting to comprehend the oddness of the story that follows. The last minutes of the film are also fantastic, poetic and very moving, and the perfect closure to such a creative an original story.Despite being a wonderful love story, we have to wait about one hour for the proper love story to commence, and once it starts all happens in a hurry. The script is based on a short story, so there is not excuse for such a long footage, to wait one hour for the core of the movie to be displayed to the viewer. I think that many of the elements and sub-stories could have been chopped easily without the film suffering much. To put just one example, all the part of old Daisy agonizing in the hospital during the Hurricane Katrina, during more than 2 hours, is overly melodramatic and doesn't add anything of interest to the movie, as the only element that makes sense in that part could have been easily inserted in another way.Cate Blanchet is wonderful as always, very believable in his role as a dancer first, and ballet teacher then. Brad Pitt delights us with glimpses of his old self and acting brilliance in the first half of the film, when he's and old arthritic weird boy; it is not the make-up or the special effects, it is him, the actor, shining. However, once the character gets older and therefore young in the story, when we start to see Pitt in all his corporeal splendor, his acting suffers, Pitt's expression becomes forced and hieratic. It is as if Pitt felt overwhelmed each time his pretty face is the center of attention. That doesn't happen to Blanchet, who is magnificent all the way through.The supporting actors, mostly elderly, are also believable and delightful in their roles as residents in a nursing home. Also wonderful are all the actors who play the sailors. However, I did not like the actor who plays Button's biological father, Jason Flamyng, too stiff and average in his performance.I loved Tilda Swinton and Pitt in their short love sub-story, which is fantastic in mood, atmosphere and acting - 1950s Hollywood glamor recreated to perfection.The sepia-toned atmosphere and the cinematography are extremely beautiful. I found the special effects and 3D animation superbly blended into the actors' faces, especially the young Button and the young Daisy. Aging make-up is especially good on Pitt, not so much on Blanchet.A good enjoyable and original movie with great acting that suffers from the long footage and a script that doesn't know how to focus on the important.",7,0,2,9 February 2011
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Original story, OK animation
","An animated feature film based on the original children's book of the same title. It is the story of Flint, a geek and crazy inventor who invents a machine that turns water into any food. It is also the story of his fellow-citizens in a town surviving on the herring industry, and the story of Sam, a weather woman turned into a reported by accident.What I liked most is the script, which is very original and crazy. Despite being so, the movie script is well presented, developed and resolved; still, the script might be difficult for small children, but the visual imagination of the film is overflowing and will captivate them anyway. What interested me most in the film was just the food theme, how food abundance is depicted with its good and bad consequences.The film lacks of intelligent adult humor, the animation style is somewhat 'chunky' and unrefined (a retro look or a more contemporary one would have suited the story better) and it is not engaging enough in general. Is a good and enjoyable movie of the whole family.",6,0,1,3 March 2011
Grave of the Fireflies," Unforgettable
","The story of survival of two Japanese brothers, little Satsuko, a 4y.o. girl, and her brother Saita, a 14y.o. boy, at the end of the Second World War in Japan, based on the semi-biographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka.Grave of the Fireflies is one of the saddest stories and movies I have ever seen. It puts face to the the children in any war, those who lose everything and have left with nothing, those too easily forgotten and so easily neglected. What makes the movie sad is the verisimilitude of the story, that something like that happened and is happening any time that there is a war.The animation is marvelous, colorful, attentive to the detail, scenic and intimate, with a lyricism that only Ghiblin Studies are able to create. The drawing of the Japanese countryside is simply superb, and the same can be said of the drawing of the city environments and destruction; the best from Ghiblin to me. The atmosphere is great. The colors a little more saturated than usual from Ghiblin studio, and really precious. The music by Michio Mamiya is extremely subtle and beautiful, perfect for the story. The characters of the two brothers are wonderfully drawn and performed by the Japanese actors. Some of the intimate scenes of the two brothers are really magical, especially the ones involving the fireflies that give tittle to the movie.What is great about this movie is that, very soon, you forget that you are watching animation, as the story is so strong, captivating and engaging, that those drawn characters become real as you and me.A classic animation movie difficult to forget, soulful and marvelous in every possible way.The best animation film I have ever seen and one of the best ever made. No doubt. No perhaps.",10,2,3,22 February 2011
Brave," Beautiful Animation, Senseless script
","Pixar lost a bit its essence and idiosyncrasy when it was engulfed by Disney. Since then, every second Pixar movie we get can be labeled Pixar's in conception, ideas and originality. The in-between years are for movies like Brave, which follow a ready-made template with structured predefined characters, values and jokes that are very much modern Disney. This is, moreover, Pixar's fist princess movie ever.Brave's animation is amazing from a visual point of view: the colors, layouts, backgrounds, the rendering of the landscapes and characters movement, the camera angling, the 3D design and even the movement of the hair of Merida are spectacular. Still, a good animation movie, to be successful, needs of a good script with a sound story and narrative: what it tells and how it tells it are always more important than how it looks like. Brave's script -by Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi- is, a priory, a winner, as it mixes many European folk legends and human archetypes (like the ones we see in Anderson or the Grimm Brothers' tales) with modern attitudes and sensibilities. Moreover, Merida is in a way, a combination of all the successful past Disney's heroines. Thus, Merida is a redhead tomboy princess, opinionated and rebel, super-woman at every level, living in a Medieval Scottish male dominated kingdom that is brought up to be a queen.The film is entertaining and beautiful to watch, and some of the characters are very funny. There are many funny moments especially those involving the witch, Merida's triplet brothers, and the lady bear. All the cast of actors do a good job at dubbing their respective characters: Kelly Macdonald as Merida, Billy Connolly as Merida's father, Emma Thompson as her mother, and Julie Walters as the Witch. To be completely honest, Billy Connolly's dubbing always sounds like himself not as the character he plays. Still, Brave does not deliver beyond the artistic qualities of the animation, because the story sends contradictory and senseless messages to the children it targets. It feels as if the writing team had done bit and pieces separately, and then stitched them together without further adjustment and polishing. Being so, the movie can be labeled, depending on the moment, of feminist, sexist, retrograde, modern, advanced or conservative. 'Obey your mother' can be a revolutionary message in a world in which children are spoiled rotten and disrespect their parents, but going from there to deciding that everything mammy says is good for your future and that the tradition has to be respected no matter how senseless it is, it is a bit reactionary. On the other hand, the story tells us that you can be brave and daring, but until certain point - bravery is subversive, and subversion is not good. What?! Be brave and make your own fate, free will do exist, but fate is fateful and will crash you if you subvert the status-quo. What! What? What?!Too much is always too much. Brave is a beautiful senseless sermon that gets lost in its own wordiness and senseless preaching. It is perfect for small children, as it has lots of action and some funny moments that the little ones (and your inner child) will enjoy. More sounded boys and girl, our just your sound self, could get a bit puzzled at the moral of the story and the wordy ending.",6,0,2,1 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Most entertaining movie in years
","The Guardians of the Galaxy is just pure entertainment. The film mixes science-fiction, adventure and comedy in the right dose and concentration. It has great tempo, unforgettable well-developed characters you like or hate immediately and great music. The production is amazing: the special effects, architectural designs, ambiance, dresses, makeup, sound, and overall design are fantastic. However, that would be irrelevant if the script, the dialogues and the acting weren't good, but they are excellent.One of the things that contributes to the success of the film is how well the actors are cast for their respective characters, and how good he actors are in their roles. I loved Pratt as Peter Quill (a witty mix of Indiana Jones and Han Solo with whom I fell in love immediately) Diesel as the magical Groot (I would have never thought that I would like Diesel on anything), and Lee Pace as the super-villain Ronan (truly the best acting in the film). However, Cooper does one of his best jobs as an actor dubbing the very funny sarcastic grumpy but loyal Rocket, Saldana shines as the kick-ass sexy fighter Gamora, and Bautista is really charming as the word-literal sensitive brute Drax. To be fair, all actors, even the supporting ones, do a great job. This is a chorus movie in which everyone sings well and does what is supposed to do at the right time the right way.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most entertaining amusing unpretentious enjoyable films I've seen in the last years. Of course the movie is light, there is not philosophical approach to anything, there is not subtext, but the movie does to perfection what intends to do -- it does entertain you for over two hours and makes you forget that you are human and live in the real world. We are all the Guardians of the Galaxy. That is priceless.I had a ball watching this film. I hope you too.",9,3,6,12 April 2017
The Imitation Game," Amazing story and character, OK movie
","The Imitation Game tells an amazing story about an amazing man, the British scientist Alan Turin, one of the fathers of computer science. Overall, the film is very enjoyable and has, a priori, everything to succeed -- great actors, an interesting story, and a fascinating historical period. However, the production, direction, and script ruined it for me. I find surprising that the script won an Oscar, really unbelievable. The main flaw of the movie is the lack of focus. The historical episode and Turin himself are fascinating subjects. If you want to produce a two-hour movie, you have to choose what you focus on; otherwise, you'll get a movie that is flawed because is all over the place, like a scattered brain. That is, you focus on Turin the man and the scientist and tell his story from childhood to death and all his scientific breakthroughs, or you focus solely on the cracking of the Enigma code. The movie tries to do both things and fails, produces a clichéd and somewhat contrived version of Turin, and the cracking-the-code episode lacks dramatic tempo because the time to build it was used to tell general facts about Turin. I found the double flashback in the movie, really interesting narratively, but it doesn't help much to create an image of Turin that honors the multifaceted person and scientist he was. As a viewer, the film failed to move me and to engage me fully. The second flaw of the movie is the acting. Don't take me wrong, I think most of the actors do a good job with the material they are given, but only one of them fully shines: Alex Lawther as the young Turin, who is truly superb and believable 100% and he wasn't nominated for any Oscar! Having Cumberbatch and Knightly together in a movie is a real treat, but is their acting in this movie really great? The answer is No. Is their acting better than other performances of theirs in movies for which they weren't nominated to an Oscar? The answer is No!The third flaw of the film is the atmosphere. Not bad at all, but not good either, and full of cinematic clichés and scenes that were deja vu.It felt more for a TV mini-series than for a film. Overall, an enjoyable film with an intriguing character, a great performance by Lawther, but way overrated.",6,0,0,7 February 2017
Prisoners," Powerful reflection on taking justice in your hands
","Prisoners is a chilling film that has an unsettling music and gray tones that will tight your chest from the first minutes. Prisoners has also a great cast, intrigue, suspense, and a powerful reflection on some important moral issues. To me, the beauty of this film relies on its powerful reflection on the ethics of taking justice in your hands. When and why, if ever, torture is justified; my reaction is, as has always been, a resounding no. There is also the question, if you knew that you would save some people's lives by torturing a person, would you do it or be ethically excusable? My answer is a less resounding no. On the other hand, the story asks you who is worst, the person who kidnaps a child or the abductee's father who tortures somebody to save his child. Finally, if you know that somebody is taking justice in their hands and you don't denounce them or watch impassibly, are you as guilty as the perpetrator? The story of the investigation to find the missing girls was building up well during the first half of the movie. However, the second half is a clumsy pointless wandering that doesn't help to build momentum, it builds frustration. When we discover who the baddie is, the reasons behind his/her actions are so stupid that I couldn't believe that the scriptwriters had come up with a such a thing! Finally, I found a bit unfair that two girls disappear and the story is mostly about the Kellers' sorrow, not as much as the Birches' pain, and they seem to be not having any except for some few moments in the film. Regarding the cast, I thought all the actors do a good job overall. I usually love Gyllenhaal but I found he was just all right here, except for some sporadic sparks of his best acting; I loved his blinking tick, though. It was refreshing seeing Jackman playing something dramatic and very different from his usual roles; unfortunately, I thought he was overacting, and I didn't believe for a second that he was Keller, I thought he was Jackman trying to be Keller, which is something slightly different. On the contrary, Maria Bello really feels like she's a mother in distress. Viola Davis has that powerful mix of balanced sorrow and fragility that many people display when tragedy strikes. Paul Dano is just awesome as the mentally-challenged guy on which all suspicions seem to fall. I am surprised that Melissa Leo was nominated for an Oscar; she's good in the film, but not better than Maria Bello or Dano! A good movie, with a clumsy script, food for thought, and a Hollywood ending. I thought, if Koreans had done this movie, we have got a fair ending.",7,0,1,15 February 2017
Into the Wild," Mesmerising and Moving
","Sean Pean directs the true story of Christopher McCandles, a. k. a. Alexander Supertramp, a twenty-something guy who left behind family, money and a promising career and start a solo trip around the USA to collect money and prepare himself for a solo expedition to the Alaska wilderness. The script is based both on his personal diary, his sister's memories, and those of the people who Chris met on the road.Penn has surrounded himself with a group of great supporting actors, who are great in their respective roles. Emile Hirsch, the leading actor, offers a very powerful performance portraying Chris' free spirit and strong willpower with sensitivity and honesty.The two and a half hours of footage really flow because Penn tells the story in a very fresh and light way, without losing content and depth in the way. The use of the camera mixes the subjective and the objective point of view, offering different tempos who suit well the viewing of such a long movie.What does mean to be free? Chris knew what meant to him, and what to do and what to sacrifice to achieve freedom, to be himself. The overwhelming strength of Christ's spirit is superbly explored and presented to the viewer by an inspired Penn, who is true to the real wilderness of Chris' spirit, to the depths of his soul, without a mainstream teary approach.A mesmerizing movie and story that left me in awe.",9,0,1,12 February 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Unforgettable
","Eternal Sunshine is a philosophical analysis of the nature of love and relationships. It reflects very well the changing emotions associated with falling in love and the ups and downs of personal relationships, and how unnecessary it is to erase our emotional past to survive. None of this is said or discussed in the movie, as this is a metaphorical film that uses the visual narrative to approach these points.Eternal Sunshine is one of those movies that many people would see twice to fully catch all the details because the editing and what happens in the film is complex since there are three different time moments, narrated in not chronological order, sometimes overlapping each other. It is not a film for simple minded people or those who have to have everything digested and masticated before presented to them. This film needs of an attentive attention and mental involvement.Jim Carrey surprises every body with a role that shows what a great actor he is, and how versatile too. He's superb as Joel, a lonely insecure and depressed guy who tends to get involved with women who are the opposite, and how he faces love, abandonment, rejection, loneliness, companionship, etc. Also excellent (and outside of their usual roles) is Kate Winslet in her role as Clementine, a cheeky cheerful girl addicted to flashy hair dyes, who is attracted to boring men.The lyricism of the music, the surreal scenes, the poetic cinematography, the part of the movie showing Joel efforts to preserve the memories of the past he initially wanted to destroy, the fact that the special effects are no such a thing but camera tricks and the result of a meticulous preparation and tampering of the movie sets, adds even more artistic value to this unique piece. The director and the editor of the film really deserve a big praise, as the movie is indebted to them beyond belief.The only flaws I saw in the movie are the little romance mini-stories related to the technicians and doctor of the Lacuna Clinic, which do not contribute much to a film that otherwise would have been perfect, and the outcome linked to those actions could have been presented in a different way.I would not call this movie a comedy, but a light drama.Eternal Sunshine is a magical, unique and unforgettable movie. A piece of art, really.",9,0,1,16 March 2011
Avatar," Very entertaining action movie with great visuals, forget Philosophy
","A spellbinding animated adventure film with a simplistic script and predictable characters.The creativity and imagination of the film is undeniable, and the fantastic world of Pandora is creative, beautiful and artistically created and colored regarding Nature and Creatures, myths and mood.I must say that I found the animation, especially at first a little awkward, a sort of advanced video-game with improved facial and body movements. However, once you get into the story, and as the animated part gains prominence in the film, you stop seeing animation, and you see real characters and a real fantastic world. That is a credit to the director and creative team.I also loved the idea of a harmonious natural world where everything is interconnected, where the energy is shared. A little primal and indigenous Eden that is going to be violated and abused by human beings who believe to be superior despite their greediness and lack of respect to the environment. It is a metaphor of the inconsistencies of the modern world that ignores the environment and other humans beings to spread a system that is self-destructive. The whole philosophy and spirituality of the natives is very zen, really wonderful, and very well explained and developed.My biggest criticism of the film is the incongruity, so American, of defending the right to a peaceful and harmonious world through war. The fighting and war scenes are great, but, obviously, very violent, so that all the film's Peace message is betrayed very soon. The movie becomes a thriller, with good and bad characters, military leaders, defenders and attackers. My second criticism is that the story line and characters are predictable, which tones down the whole movie and makes it less interesting for the viewer who wants a little bit of depth and is not easily content with just wonderful visuals.I really enjoyed the film, because it is, mostly, an action movie, with fantastic enthralling action and war scenes, and super-duper visuals. However, it has a mix of meditation, romance, adventure, sci-fi, and zen premises that will captivate men and women, children and adults.A true blockbuster, and a landmark for movies to come regarding visuals and special effects.",7,3,6,22 February 2011
La La Land," Beautiful film but overpraised
","I am going to be honest. La La Land was getting into my nerves before I watched it after so much full-on publicity. I watched it just because it was recommended to me by a a friend who is not usually into this sort of films.This is the story of the artistic and personal struggle of a couple of young artists who fall in love at the wrong time, and struggle with the harshness of pursuing a dream, not making it, and having to find a way of life to pay their bills, and keeping the relationship. This is also a film about what-would-have-happened-if, A Sliding Doors sort of reflection. Indeed, the best part of it, or the one I enjoyed the most were the last 10-15 minutes of the film, which kept me crying for about 15 minutes non-stop. Emma Stone really deserves the Oscar, it is not that she dances (OK) and sings (OK), it is that her performance had a great coloratura; she shows an incredible dramatic register and versatility in this film. I liked Gosling as well, and he is a great dancer!, he also sings (OK) and plays (decently), but his acting was a bit more monochromatic. I know that the film has been praised as a musical, but I think is just a decent musical, not a good one. It is just that they don't make musicals like in the old times any more, and the first one that comes out is like wow. Was it wow? Well, no. The film mimics the style of the musicals of the 50s and 60s (on which I fed for years) but never gets to the level of mastery in the music, dancing, singing and production that those films had. On the other hand, I think this film has more value as a drama than most of those classic films, and that is what I enjoyed the most: the story and the acting (beside the musical part). All the musical numbers are enjoyable and well realized, but I wasn't wowed by them. Perhaps the thing that moved me the most was Emma Stone's singing at her final audition, and watching Gosling dance with such great style and easiness. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this musical is the ode to jazz embedded in the story. The conversations about what Jazz is, between Sebastian and Mia, and between Sebastian and Keith are really wonderful. The soundtrack is very good, needless to say. I enjoyed La La Land immensely, but I don't think deserved so many Oscar nominations or such an insisting pedant heavy publicity and praise. Good, yes, wow no.",8,2,6,10 March 2017
Up," Delightful Entertainment
","Up is a story of a forced friendship between Carl, and old grumpy retired salesman, and Russell, a lonely overweight Asian-American boy, and their adventure together.The animation is not as impressive as in other Pixar films, but the script is very charming, and you'll get hooked right away. I missed the story being a little more original and inventive, and having less stereotypes and predictability. Still, is a moving and funny story that will delight adults and children. Among my favorite characters are Kevin, the rare species of bird, (hilarious! which reminded me of the WB's Roadrunner!), the talking nasty dogs, and Carl's dog.The first 10-15 minutes of the film, in which we see the story of Carl from his childhood to the death of his wife, are superb. as they create a real emotional life-long biography of the character. That's, no doubt, the best part of the film with a difference.The short film that precedes the movie, as always happens with Pixar's shorts, is pure delight and humorous creativity.",7,0,1,8 February 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," More than you can initially expect
","I must confess that, initially, I wasn't that attracted to this movie, but after watching it I wonder why I wasn't! This is the story of Hiccup, a young uncool spaghetti-thin Viking guy, his toothless mysterious dragon, and their relationship and adventures.This movie is more than 3D animation and special effects. It is entertaining, funny and delicious to watch. The script is robust and original without being cheesy, the emotional drawing of the characters is powerful, the animation and color are great and very detailed (I was mesmerized by how real the hair of Hiccup looked and the wonderful design of the dragons), the action scenes are magic and marvelous (one feels that is really flying and in the spot, the scenes of training and learning truly delicious.The humor is not as witty and naughty as in the Pixar movies, but this is a funny movie without being simplistic, and the viewer laughs and smiles easily, almost without wanting to.I loved the Scottish accent of the dwellers of the Viking village, but I was shocked by the broad American accent of Hiccup and other kids in town. I mean, the fact that they are younger and different doesn't turn a broad Scottish into an American accent by magic. A softer Scottish accent could have been better and more credible. But this is truly me being picky.I loved the movie. When the movie ended I wanted more, as I was in love with Hiccup and Toothless!",7,0,1,12 February 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," The meaning of life and of Xmas
","This is one of my favorite movies ever and definitely my favorite Christmas movie ever. Although I'm not American, this was part of my upbringing, and it was shown on TV every Christmas, it still does.This is, foremost, a great movie, with a great direction, a great story, great performances, great tempo and atmosphere, a glorious BW and a classic old glamour Hollywood melodrama. It is of course, very sentimental, but also very philosophical.I love James Steward. He was the quintessential good charming actor able to convey goodness with his mere presence; he becomes his character here in a heartfelt performance. Yet, this is a choral movie in which everybody shines and everybody seems to be doing the same. I have always had a weakness for Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, but everybody is great and believable in their respective roles.This is a movie about despair, that reminds us that, even in our darkest moments, there is always something or somebody that will help us if we allow ourselves to be helped.This is a movie about being mindful about what we wish for, and about what comes from our mouth, about being grateful about what we have and not taking it for granted.This is a movie about the power of family and community, and about the power of being a good human being and how goodness, our goodness, impacts other people in ways that aren't always evident to us.This is a movie about the value of leading your life in an ethical way, because when you do, people notice, and respect comes by the hand. Finally, this is a movie about the spirit of Christmas. These days the festivities have become part of frenzy of empty consumerism, lack of empathy for the poor, and another holiday. However, when I watch this movie it brings me memories of my childhood when Christmas was a magic period despite my family not having many means. Probably because of what Christmas has become today, I find it more relevant for the new generations. It has all the magic and values that I would like my children, if I had any, to grow up with.The movie is very sentimental, of course. It never fails to move me. But it is not cheap sentimentalism. It digs into what the meaning of life is, and comes up with an answer that surprises because it is obvious and we have it in front of us every single day.Unforgettable.",10,0,1,21 January 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," An unintended comedy
","I loved the 1st movie of the series, so every time one of the Transformers movie is on TV, I make time to watch. This installment of the series has, a priori, a good starting point. The special effects are fabulous, both regarding the robotics, and also the real-life city scenes with fights.What made the first film successful, beyond the X-effects, was its freshness, a decent story line, sense of humour, good-timed action, and the acting was at least OK.The freshness is gone in this movie, the pace of the film is like a constant unattended spasmodic heart-attack and the acting is pedestrian on all parts. LeBeouff and Duzamel are not making themselves any favor, like cut from cardboard. Megan Fox should take some acting lessons because she is terrible in this movie, her 'acting' reduced to posing in tight pants and be the accessory of the other characters; that is not her fault, the lack of development of the character, but she is not even good at that. She was acceptable in the first film, so I don't know what happened to her in between. At least the actors who play LeBeouff's parents were OK.My first half an hour was a raw roar in crescendo. I was getting upset. Why? Pedestrian acting, impossible non-believable happenings in the story, poor stunts, poor development of the story, poor dialogues, lack of freshness, bad pace, and too much pretentiousness. A real put off for multi-million movie.Then, I caught myself laughing, not laughing because the movie makes you laugh, but laughing at the movie, because some things are so bad, that despite the gazillion dollars spent on this film, this movie felt like a B movie, actually a Z movie. There is fun in the Z. I found that if one watches this film as a comedy, it is way more enjoyable than if one watches it as a science-fiction adventure multi-million film. An unintended comedy. So I ended having a good time!",5,1,3,5 January 2017
Sausage Party," Love it or hate it
","Sausage Party has two immediate different reactions on people. Some people really love it and have a great time watching, me for example, and some other people are disgusted by it. No nah, no bah, no meh reactions here.The movie has all you need to offend people: sexual references, swearing, xenophobic remarks, religious negative clichés, blasphemy, explicit straight and gay sex scenes, drug and alcohol abuse, that and more. Like a compilation of subconscious repressed thoughts unleashed into the wild. Food porn gets onto a new meaning here, or perhaps not.The idea is ingenious, albeit irreverent, the animation is fun and perfect for the story, the dialogues are witty (plenty of puns!) and some of the scenes and dialogues are hilarious.This came out of the mind of some 'sick' people, for sure, thank you guys! It is very funny, gross funny. Not for children, not for sensitive watchers, not for people who don't like gross humour a priori.A truly enjoyable film if you are the target of the movie. Otherwise, you will be appalled. You've been warned.",7,2,3,5 January 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Action movie as best as it gets
","I loved this movie - the epitome of a good action movie, and a tribute to Cruise as action hero.The Edge of Tomorrow reminded me of Groundhog Day in its philosophical premises. It is a constant day repeating itself until the hero gets it right. The difference is that in Groundhog Day the aim of the story is to give time to the character to redeem himself, to become his best self and get a fulfilling life; so the repeating day is a personal intimate quest. The Edge of Tomorrow is more about the process of change itself, on learning of your mistakes, correcting them, trying again until you achieve your goals. Of course, if you are a video-gamer that is what you do when you play, but I don't think it would be fair reducing this movie to a on-screen video-game, because I don't feel it is.Tom Cruise is the quintessential action hero to me. He is always fantastic in action movies, no matter the quality of the script, as he is able to carry his characters with honesty and soulfulness. This movie is greatly indebted to him because, although the script is good, Cruise nails it; we are there with Cage, not with Cruise, if you know what I mean.I am not a fan of Emily Blunt but she is believable in this movie, but not a romantic counterpart to Cruise. She and Cruise don't have much chemistry on camera; they would make good brother and sister, a romantic couple, not so much. Yet, the romantic story is not the essence of the story, so it doesn't really matter.All the supporting actors are terrific. Frantic action and great special effects are two assets of this movie. The latter aren't there per se, to fill the gaps in the script and wow the spectator with fluff, they are there to serve the script and contribute to the overall story. That is how things should be in film making, but they are rarely so these days.The film is very entertaining, a great action film, one of those films that ticks all the wows one expect to find in a 21st century action science-fiction film, but more indebted in its premises to the mindful action movies of the 1980s.Pure entertainment and more than meets the eye in the story.",8,0,1,7 January 2017
Stranger Than Fiction," Entertaining and thought-provoking
","A lonely tax officer, Harold Crick, starts hearing a female voice that tells in a literary way what he is thinking and going to do. Trying to give himself a rational explanation, he visits a psychiatrist and then a professor in Literature What is happening to him and who is writing, literally, his life? Stranger than fiction is a modern fable about predestination and free will, about life as a our personal creation, and a reflection on the process of artistic creation. It is a retake a la reverse on Pirandello's 'Six characters in search of an author', but using just one character. The film is directed by Swiss golden boy Marc Foster and written by the screenwriter and film director Zach Helm.The movie has a terrific script and dialogs, characters very well drawn, and great acting. Will Ferrell will surprise you as Harold; we are used to his crazy over-the-top performances, but here he offers a very controlled and sensitive performance and completely transforms himself into Harold. The always believable Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as the lawyer turned into anarchist baker Ana Pascal. Emma Thompson is great as the neurotic insecure and perfectionist writer Karen Eiffel. Dustin Hoffman is also terrific as Professor of Literature Jules Hilber, who intrigued by Harold turns into a Literary detective and Harold's counselor. Queen Latifah is correct as Eiffel's PA Penny Escher; I found her character a bit unnecessary, but she does plays well what she is asked for.The movie is not only entertaining, but it is embedded with multiple ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions, that turn the mystery and the romance into something else. Some of the questions that came to my mind were: If your life was written like in a novel, and therefore you knew that you were predestined, would you still try to fight this? And if you did, would that make your life better and more meaningful? If it was in your hand, what would you prefer, dying young but having a memorable death or dying old but nobody knowing that you ever existed? Would knowing that your death is poetic, give more meaning to it? Would you rather know when you are going die or how? The look of the movie, is very clean, minimalist and stylish. The superimposing graphics and vectorial images help to make clear to the viewer what is happening in Harold's head and the sort of analytical and mathematical mind and approach to reality he has. They are terrific, very stylish, explicative and not invasive at all, just at the service of the story.Don't be fooled, this is not the sort of gag comedy you watch to have a big laugh. Is a witty comedy, not a LOL one.A terrific film, entertaining and thought-provoking.",8,0,0,24 September 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Utterly pretentious, mildly entertaining
","There is nothing worse that a simple fun oriented film and story that pretends to be an intellectual artistic exercise. I find this sort of pretense not only annoying and deceiving to the spectator, but also artistically contrapuntal as you cannot seat and just watch the movie for what it is. If you want to show off your feathers, better be real! Guy Ritchie, the actors and producers have insisted that this movie not only captures the essence of the original, but also reinvents it, but both statements are delusional. In fact, I thought that the TV series 'Sherlock' offers more artistry, inventiveness, interestingness and mystery that Richie's, it is true to the original but still adds elements of modernity that can be enjoyed by modern audiences.I have read the books, which I immensely enjoyed, and I did not find Sherlock in this movie, or at least the SH I had imagined when reading the books. Robert Downey Jr destroys the credibility and essence of the original character and turns it into an eccentric clown; he is funny, actually, but is not SH to me. Without a good Sherlock Holmes, the rest is not worth a penny. The rest of the acting is OK: Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong. and Kelly Reilly are Dr. John Watson, Irene Adler, Lord Blackwood, and Mary respectively. Robert Maillet was fun as giant Dreader. Eddie Marsan was unconvincing as Inspector Lestrade, though.The story is entertaining, as all SH's stories are, has some moments of fun and is visually stunning, full of action and special effects. I liked the visual style of connecting slow/fast motion elements (typical of Ritchie) with SH's deductive way of thinking, which makes clear for the viewer why SH immediately gets what is happening and what is going to happen. The digital recreation of London and the mood of the era are certainly impressive; I specially liked the slumdog sort of areas and shops, not as much the general views of the city that looked a bit oniric and cartoon-ish (video-game-ish actually) at times. This is an action-packed movie that relegates to a second place the logical deduction, pace and essence of the original books.Utterly pretentious, mildly entertaining, easily forgettable.",4,0,0,14 May 2011
The Secret Life of Pets," Enjoyable but forgettable
","The Secret Life of Pets is truly an enjoyable animation film that mixes those elements that work in any animated film to make it family friendly: good visuals, nice main characters, cuteness, adventure, clean humour, no hot topics, and overall fun. Besides, as this is not a movie about anthropomorphic animals, but about real pets and street animals, so it has the added flare of reproducing the behavior that some animals show in real life with humans, something that will delight pet owners.The voicing of the characters is perhaps the thing that I enjoyed the most, really great in all cases, Kevin Hart (Snowball) being my favorite character and voice in the film.The film doesn't have any hidden message, any moral teaching, or anything that will make it unforgettable regarding the visuals, the story, the idea behind the film, or the visual narrative. However, it is neither a pretentious film, or said differently, it does not pretend to be anything that is not an hour and a half of entertainment. And it does that perfectly well. Notice -- one of the pound collection vans has an advertising of the movie Sing at the rear!",6,0,0,11 February 2017
Finding Dory," Charming, funny with a great message
","Finding Dory is not only a gorgeous-looking animated film, but a really family fun adventure. It's cheeky, funny, cute, naughty, crazy and heart-warming. It is not specially simple or over the top, and settles in a happy medium that will please kids and a adults alike. Although this is a sequel to Finding Nemo, the story feels like a film on its own, and while some of the events and characters in the first film appear also here, Finding Dory would still be a great film even if the first movie had never been made.Finding Dory is not a film about being lost, is a film a about finding who you are and finding home. It sends a message that your family is not always just your natural family, but those who include you in their family, help and love you when you don't have anybody else and you are most vulnerable.The story also sends a very positive message to any kid who has a disability, learning problem, or is just different. Dory has a short memory span, yet that problem makes her take decisions rapidly and be fearless and resolute, lets her evaluate any situation rapidly and make the best of it; Dory needs of other people, but she is so devoted and caring, that anybody wants to help her when she's in need. The analogy for those kids who are different is wonderful -- those things that seem to be a shortcoming and make you different, might end being the source of your greatness, helping you develop great qualities, and make of you an unique lovable individual. No animated movie can pass the adults' test without having great characters and great voices. This is the case here. The characters are varied, funny, have distinct personalities, and the actors lending their voices to them do a great job at infusing them with life and soul. I enjoyed Ellen being Dory. She did a great job at infusing Dory with that charm and soul the character needs. Besides, Ellen's natural voice has those things that are quintessential Dory: naughtiness, innocence, excitement and child-like tones. I found baby Dory absolutely adorable and wonderful. Once Dory becomes an adult and Ellen's voice is more fully there, I couldn't but hear Ellen, not always Dory. I would have liked her voice to be a bit more twinkled or morphed so as to allow Dory to take Ellen over, if you know what I mean.My main criticism to the film is perhaps the fact that the story becomes inorganic when we see an octopus driving a van and a fish reading signs and driving signs. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought that somewhat didn't glue well with the rest of the film.The film comes together with the short film Pipper, which I reviewed elsewhere, and adorable addition to a great combo.Most enjoyable.",7,2,4,13 May 2017
Prometheus," Disappointing
","Prometheus wants to be a prequel (or at least connect) to the 'Alien' saga, including the stories narrated in the two 'Alien vs Predator' movies, so the story, in a way, has to fit the bill.Prometheus also wants to move away and go beyond those movies to create a saga and mythological world in which all the stories are included and embedded, but it has its own autonomy.Prometheus also wants to pose some philosophical, theological and ethical queries about human nature, the soul of androids, and the origin of life, very much in connection with many of the themes explored in 'Blade Runner'.Prometheus wants to provide the viewer with a science-fiction teleological mythology infused with philosophical and metaphysical queries... it sounds pretentious. Well, it is pretentious.I love action movies, but if you want to mix action with metaphysics, you better work hard on putting together a story that links well all the elements, create engaging characters that have an emotional background, are well connected, and have a purpose within the story. Most importantly, show respect to the viewer who is willing to believe anything if it has inner logic and makes sense.The film is very sleek, and some of the scenes are wonderful and unforgettable, grandiose and spectacular, as well as the special effects, especially those filmed inside the departure chamber, utterly gorgeously, if that can be said. The blue, golden brown and white-ish tones of the film are perfect for the story and create the right mood, from warmth to cold, both physical and emotional. The photography, mostly shot in Iceland and Spain, is beautiful, and the landscapes chosen really look out-this-world. On the contrary, I did not find Marc Streitenfeld's original soundtrack especially inspired, and it sounds like hundred other science fiction movies soundtracks.The male and female characters are unevenly treated by the story and the result is that the actors who play them, shine or not depending on it. Naomi Rapace is completely wasted as Elizabeth Shaw. She does her best at doing what is requested of her naive passionate and a-scientific scientist character - no acting would have saved it. The same can be said of Charlize Theron, whose talent is wasted in her role of Meredith Vickers, the intriguing ice-cold beautiful manager of the expedition; not much is demanded of her, beyond wearing styling super-tight clothes and moving like a supermodel on a catwalk.On the contrary, Michael Fassbender is brilliant as the quirky witty android David. David is the best drawn character in the movie because it has a sense of purpose, a background, an inner logic, and a well-defined 'psyche' and a soul that is missing from the human characters. Fassbender really brings his character to life, and gives him both mechanical and human color in movement, facial expression and performance. What a great actor he is.Guy Pearce is good and almost unrecognizable in his role as Peter Weylan, the patron and sponsor of the expedition. The rest of the supporting actors are just OK in their respective roles. They do what is requested from their roles, which is not much at times.Prometheus is a super-production that does not deliver what it promises. This is an action movie with amazing visuals and interesting premises that gets lost in itself. It is hedonistic at times, superficial and preposterous most of the times. The movie feels like a blockbuster made to utter wows; yet, the wows are never uttered because there was no previous thinking, the story and characters are just sketched, and the viewer is expected to disregard ridiculous events, completely unscientific behavior by scientists, and even the laws of Physics. Furthermore, Prometheus seems anchored in old philosophical queries that, despite still being valid. are presented as if the world had not changed much since the 1980s, science and technology were far less developed, and their impact on Society were less profound, and new queries were needed to be present for the film feel contemporary in that regard. There is a lack of focus in the project, and the result is a chaotic film, that is enjoyable at times, ridiculous and stupid others. Visuals and style are never enough to make of a movie a good one.The movie ends with unanswered questions, on purpose, as a sequel has to follow. Oh dear.",6,3,9,22 August 2012
The Iron Giant," Forgotten Jewel
","A 2-D animation movie with a great script, characters and old-style animation.The Iron Giant tells the story of the fall into Earth of an alien giant robot, and his relation with a naughty child who lives with his single mother in a small town in the States.The movie is set in the 1950s, during the cold war period and the space race, when aliens and robot populated TV shows and comics, and the imagination of the population. The movie is able to reproduce the mood and style of the era, even the animation style, but with all the improvements that technology has brought to animation.The characters are psychologically drawn with great talent, as it couldn't be otherwise by a Warner Bros's movie, and it is just them, their human qualities, what makes the viewer click with them and believe they are real. Moreover, the cartoons have a superb body movement, facial expression.The script is engaging and very entertaining, very funny and lovable. At the same time, the film address serious social and political issues in a simple approachable way, without lecturing: You are who you decide to be, if you respond to violence is your option., it is in your hands to make your own destiny no matter what your past is, your heart is always a great power to connect with others, no matter how different they are. Great messages to pass on to children.Eli Marienthal is terrific as the little hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is extremely lovable as his mother Annie (perhaps Aniston's best performance ever...),.Harry Connick Jr is very likable as the quirky Dean McCoppin, Vin Diesel very sweet as the 'brute' Iron Giant, and Christopher McDonald terrific as the annoying paranoid Govt Agent Kent Mansley. In fact all the voice actors are terrific, and the movie is never dull, but cheerful and full of life thanks to them.The Iron Giant did not have success at the box office when first released, due to poor marketing and a lack of promotion, but it has proved to be one of the most charming, entertaining and lovable animation movies of all times, to be put together with Miyazaki's and other classics of animation because of the quality of its animation and story.A classic for both children and adults",8,2,4,13 February 2011
Mary and Max," Moving and quirky adult animation movie
","A wonderful Australian independent plasticine movie that tells the story of a life-long mail relationship between an autistic old Jew Newyorker and a weird Australian girl.This is not a movie for children as it touches subjects that are complex and could be disturbing or difficult to explain to a child (alcoholism, social failure, mental disorder, bullying, death, homosexuality, suicide, etc.), the same elements that make this movie a wonder for adults. It is mostly a sad story about social maladjustment, but also the story of a long wonderful -and sometimes troublesome- friendship.The aesthetics and atmosphere of the film are wonderful, as so is the music. The main characters Max & Mary are really unforgettable and lovable, and also lovely the secondary ones. Especially funny are the animal characters, both pets and urban animals, which behave like animals but are very humorous. Moreover, there are so many little details and humorous winks to the spectator, that is just a pure joy to watch.What makes this movie so special is the story told and the selection of marginal characters, who are presented in a normal accepting way. They are 'weirdos', unglamorous suburban people, with mental and social problems who are wonderful because they are imperfect and human. The movie is full of emotion an the viewer feels moved and connected to Mary & Max almost immediately, and feels their failures, successes and worries as if they were not plasticine puppets.Three things would have improved the film enormously. In first place, although plasticine animation and shooting is very time-consuming and hand-crafted, a little bit more of lightness in the movement of the puppets, and a little bit more of definition in their facial expressions would have improved the look and feeling of the film. In the second place, there is too much narration in second person in the film, while most of the characters' speech is very limited. Finally, and directly related to the second, is the third person narration, not only too much of it, but also done by the wrong person (Barry Humphreis) and in the wrong tone, which I consider confusing and emotionally misleading as this is not a movie targeted to children at all. It would have been great that part of the narration was actually incorporated into the animation and turned into dialogs and 'acting' and presented in a less fable-before-bed-ish story narration.Said so, I think is a terrific animation film, whose story moved me immensely. It was a hit at Sundance.",10,1,3,17 March 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Underdeveloped, not erotic, but not that bad either
","There has been so much fuss about the book on which this movie is based upon, and the movie itself that I decided that I give it a try out of curiosity. Fifty Shades of Gray is mostly an exploration of erotic love and of relationship dynamics, which is what is shown most of the time in the film. Two people fall in love but there are important things that aren't provided by the other, things demanded by the other that cannot be easily fulfilled by their partner. The story is also about a girl growing up into a woman, i.e. a girl going from wanting to please to be loved, to a woman who has needs and is not afraid of letting the relationship go if those aren't fulfilled. The story also explores why some men, in this case Grey, are into BDSM, why do they need to punish women and have a dominating sexual relationship to get erotic pleasure. I thought that all those things are real issues that affect real people all the time. I've come across directly or indirectly with men who were very similar to Grey, a sweet well-mannered outside and twisted souls inside that were into practicing BDSM to feel 'a man'.For me this movie is nothing to be passionate about, in any way. I didn't find the movie as shocking or bad as some people portray it, but I found it underdeveloped: sketched story, superficial exploration of the characters, TV-film production not Big-Screen production, and not really erotic.The main point of the film is getting to know why Grey is into kinky stuff, but this is barely sketched because this is, clearly, the first of a series of movies, and it was clear even before the last installment came along.I thought that Dakota Johnson does a good job in the film, perhaps the best of the cast, and goes from naive girl to a woman in a believable way.I thought that Dornan was not the actor for this role because the character needed of somebody with more dramatic register and a bit of an edge. Dornan doesn't have it, unfortunately. I thought he would be great in a normal romance movie, not in this one.I thought the Dornan and Johnson have no real chemistry on camera and the erotic scenes didn't turn me on at all, which is totally anticlimactic. I remember, in contrast, how good Nine Weeks and Half was at exploring a couple's intimate relationship with eroticism. The art of the erotic is not in having a sex scene, it is in the way you construct that scene and, most importantly, in the way the two people involved in it seemed to be into each other and enjoying it. I felt that Dornan and Johnson weren't fully present there.To the puritans and haters I would say that there are few sex scenes in the film but not too many. That there is nudity but no full frontal nudity and no genitalia are on display. That this is supposedly portraying a BDSM relationship but it is actually showing more a BDSM fantasy that real BDSM. That even though the male character is dominating the woman character, they have fully agreed on advance on that being consensual. That although there are sex scenes, there are films that aren't portrayed a sex movies and have plenty more sex and rougher one and nobody focus on those things when commenting on the film. Finally, if erotic scenes and intimate relationships really worry you, or you cannot deal with them, don't watch the movie :).Overall, an interesting plot, never fully developed, not a good direction or production, but not as bad as I expected.",6,0,1,2 February 2017
Blade Runner," A masterpiece of the science fiction
","An outstanding Sci-fi philosophic and poetic movie embedded in a cop action story, loosely based in the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by Philip Dick.Blade Runner is a film about the possibilities of our near future, about the meaning of being free and of being human, about the relation between natural world and created world, about the redeeming power of loving whomever you want, despite any social constriction, among others themes. These themes, and the depth in which they are presented, are the element that place this movie over most sci-fi movies. If you miss them, you are missing the whole point of the movie.Blade Runner is also a visionary movie, as many of the gadgets and technical inventions shown there are a reality nowadays or are being developed (video-calls, Photoshop manipulation, biological production of organs, high developed robotics, etc.). The movie also envisions many traits of our 21st century world and society: fusion cuisine, increasing interracial mixing, a globalised technologically-dominated society, the pollution and unsustainability of our cities, among few others.The acting is superb and believable by all actors, especially by Rutger Hauer (brilliant), Daryl Hannah (in her best role ever), Harrison Ford (ditto) and Sean Young (in one of her best roles).It is one of those movies that everybody should see, as is one of the best sci-fi movies ever, one of the best movies ever, whose message and themes are still as fresh as they were in the 1980s.",10,3,7,22 February 2011
Monsters University," Great prequel but more for adults
","When I heard that a prequel to Monsters -one of my favorite animation movies ever- was coming to the screens, I frowned. I thought it was a matter of milking the cow for commercial purposes. I was wrong.Monsters University is a great prequel and a great animated movie. The script develops the characters in ways that make sense if you have watched the first movie, as one comes to understand why these characters become best pals despite being so different. If you haven't watched the first movie, this movie is still good on its own. I really like this movie, almost as much as the first, but for different reasons. Monsters Inc was very emotive, tender, very charming, very magical, unique, and as much for kids as for adults. Monsters University is obviously an expansion on the first, and reminds me of traditional American sophomore naughty movies (minus the sex) and the Revenge of the Nerds, films that I usually enjoy and find funny; so it is more for adults and less for children. If you don't like sophomore movies, well, MU might disappoint you.Overall, the film is very funny and entertaining, and the animation is wonderfully creative, with a great use of color and textures, great backgrounds, and lovely well-developed characters.The dubbing is great. Crystal, Goodman Buccemi, Mirren and the rest of the cast infuse their characters with life and one forgets that they are the ones speaking, something that not always happen in animation when well-known actors do the voicing and they aren't there, in the soul of the character.",8,0,1,7 January 2017
Deadpool," Fast, fun, furious and original
","Fast funny and furious, summarizes well the three elements that combined in the right dose make this movie such a success. Fast -- action packed at the right pace. Fun- Humour all over, witty humour, gross humour, cheeky humour, white humour, sexy humour, intellectual humour, smart-ass humour, you name it, it is in there. Furious - violent to the extreme, no concessions to the sensitive stomach, but funny violent if that can be said. The movie also has a great script, great characters, awesome dialogues, spectacular action scenes, amazing staging and production, great tempo, crazy fun credits, a good ending, awesome music (just when it is needed) and the right length. The result is one of those super-hero movies that will delight both super-hero movie fans and people who, like me, aren't usually into the genre or into super-violent movies.Reynolds really shines in his role of Deadpool, because, in a way, his personal humour is that of Deadpool, and the character fits him like a glove. I honestly think that all actors are perfect in their respective roles, really well cast.It is really refreshing finding a super-hero movie that doesn't feel cookie-cuttered, that addresses adults with respect, a movie that feels fresh and modern, that is not only entertaining but well filmed, well acted and well-rounded overall -- a super-hero movie that is actually very good.I'm looking forward to seeing the second installment. If it's as good as this, I am buying a ticket to see it in a theater, not on DVD.",8,2,5,9 April 2017
300," Great visuals, lots of action, and handsome men
","An epic drama inspired by the events of the Battle of the Thermopile, in which 300 Spartan soldiers fought to death against the overwhelming power of the Persian troops.I enjoyed the film immensely. I loved the comic aesthetics of the film, the intensity of the war scenes, and male 6-pack and thighs! Wooo Hoooo! :D There are many gory scenes, which I usually I don't like, but in this case they beautifully put together in the fighting scenes, and reflect well the dramatic intensity of the story. The 6-packs also help to digest them better :D I confess, though, that, I couldn't stand some of them. Too harsh for me.The depiction of the Spartan society was, although modernized and softened, quite good, a reflection of the severity of the Greek city-state and its people.The soundtrack is great and alternates powerful rock tracks used during the fighting with others of beautiful lyricism to match personal and romantic scenes. Actually the music reminded me of Gladiator's OST.I also liked the sex scenes, which were made with eroticism and class.The worst thing about film is that the dialogs are poor, and that the real story is turned into a bunch of Manichean actions and people - right and wrong, heroes and tyrants, black and white, freedom and slavery, struggle for freedom and peace by using violence and war. Does it sound familiar? Of course it does. That's a quintessential Hollywood theme to justify war and violence in most movies.It also caught my attention the fact that to distinguish some Greek people from others, the actors speak in English and Scottish accent. I found that shocking. They were Greeks! If we depart from the premise that their speaking in English is a cinematographic license, we can still leave the other people speak in English without any accent. The viewer will understand.It is an enjoyable film, perfect for men and women. Full of action and hot men. What else do you want?!",7,0,2,9 February 2011
Cube," Original thriller
","An original and thrilling indie Canadian mathematical and psychological thriller with some horror moments.A group of five people -4 males and 2 females- found themselves, like by magic, trapped in a cube-capsule within a gigantic Kubrik-ish labyrinthine cube, and are trying to escape from it. The presence of all the characters is necessary as any of their personal skills and personalities are going to be necessary to solve the mystery. Mathematics play an important role in deciphering how to get from a cube to another within being killed, and to escape from the big cube. The movie is claustrophobic, unsettling and full of mystery.The whole concept and idea is brilliant, especially if we take into account that was shot in 1998 and that is still refreshing and captivating today. However, the plot has important flaws. Who built the cube? Why was built for? Who keeps it running or it moves itself? Why were the members of the group chosen and not other people with the same skills? How were they taken to the cube? Who is responsible for this? Are they dreaming? Are they mice-like characters in an experiment? I found the general acting mediocre, with the only exception of Adrew Miller who is great as the autistic savant. Especially bad are Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, and Nicky Guadagni as Dr Helen Holloway, their performances really ruining the movie and the believability of their respective characters.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, so very entertaining and mentally engaging, but the flaws in the plot and the bad acting are too important not to consider them when rating it.",7,1,3,7 February 2011
Sin City," Best Comic Adaptation Ever
","In Sin City nobody is innocent, not even the Bishop, and they are going to pay for that.The movie is based, both the story and aesthetics, in the noir comic by Frank Miller, who is also co-director of the film,together with Robert Rodriguez; Quentin Tarantino was invited to direct one of the scenes. The movie intertwines four different stories, whose characters will cross paths at certain point: The Customer Is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard The movie is visually stunning and stylish. It looks and feels like a real noir comic, with camera framing and positioning typical of comic vignettes, as well as the use of high contrast B&W and chiaroscuro. The movie has wonderful black, white and sepia tones with cutout reds and bright colors, a technique widely used in Photography and drawing, but never used in movies before. The movie was completely shot using green backgrounds.The movie is heart-attack paced, with no a moment of dullness or rest. However, is not for the heart faint, as it is extremely violent and gory, very hard to watch sometimes. The fact that those being punished deserve it, does not make the violence easier to swallow.The characters are never dull, very human - never good or bad, but both things. Moreover, they are at very melancholic types, funny and merciless.The movie delights the viewer with terrific performances by a large group of A-listed actors. However, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson really shine through. Jessica Alba and Elija Wood, who are usually a bore, are terrific in their respective roles, too.The best comic adaptation I have ever seen.Entertainment and quality together. Brilliant",9,5,6,14 February 2011
The Ugly Truth," mediocre comedy
","The Ugly Truth tells the story of Mike (Gerard Butler) a host of a TV show of the same name, in which he bluntly tells single women that the crap of prince charming they believe in and the advice they get from self-help books won't help to get them a boyfriend. After moving to a new TV network, Mike meets his producer Abby (Katherine Heighl), who initially hates him, then tolerates him for the sake of the ratings, and ends becoming buddy with him to get her the love of her hot neighbor.The funny thing is that the script uses all topics and tips that self- help books offer to women, even though Mike states in his program that he's against them. In other words, there is an absolute incongruity between what the character of Mike preaches and what the script does. I could not be otherwise since this is a romantic comedy targeted to women. A pity that, by doing so, treats the viewer as if we were all blind idiots.The most daring element of the film is that it is a romantic comedy where sex and sexual vocabulary are explicit and unsweetened. Said, this, there is not one single nude sex scene (actually just one sex scene), and even the orgasm scene is more comic and tasteless than daring. More unexpected than daring I would say. If you want to do something really provocative go all the way, with all the consequences.The leading couple, played by the always charming and hot Butler and the ultra-feminine Heighel, has a great chemistry on camera. However, their individual performances are uneven. Heighel starts the film overacting and she's not believable in her role until midway the film. On the contrary, Butler has a surprising easiness for romantic comedies, and plays his role with charm and cheekiness; in fact, he's perfect for this sort of roles, although he seems to be choosing bad quality movies that don't showcase his talent, but melt it away.The film is entertaining and has some funny scenes, but is full of stereotypes both in the script as in the drawing of the characters, and mediocre acting overall, which really ruins the whole thing.",5,1,2,16 March 2011
Moon," Good indie old-style sci-fic movie
","A great British indie retro-sci-fic film that tells the story of a solar station on the moon and of San Bell, one of the caretakers, at the end of his 3-year contract.The aesthetics of the movie are very much the same you could find in classic sci-fi of the 1970s, with miniature lunar sets, clean white interiors and furniture. Even the robot is chunky and heavy, more emotional than functional, nothing to do with modern robotics. The lunarscapes are also very retro, with the use of miniature vehicles that do look real. It is a well-known setting by sci-fi lovers and very enjoyable to see reproduced. Even the atmosphere is classic, with that unsettling feeling of old sci-fi movies.Sam Rockwell really shines in his double performance, especially in the skin of the first character, showing what a great actor he is. The changes of clothing are minimal, but his performance really gives life to two different people. Really, this is a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. In fact, Rockwell makes the movie, as it is him who carries the weight of the story and makes it believable.Keven Spacey, the voice of robot Girty, is not especially inspired, though, as his voice is dull and plain and improper of a robot like the one in the movie, which is very chunky, heavy and not that developed. One would expect 1/ a more mechanical voice, if the robot is as it looks 2/ a more human voice, with more human inflexions and tone, in case the chunkiness is just apparent.The storyline is excellent, but the script and the mood of the movie get deflated mid way, as the movie does not have a marked tempo and the in crescendo necessary for the viewer to get excited and anxious towards the end. Although the story carries on very well, there is not enough tension and mystery to give the movie the little push up it need it to get a more rounder film.I hated the voice in off at the end, summarizing what happens at the arrival to earth... which I found a little bit cheesy and unnecessary, unless you want to shoot another movie departing from that.The DVD contained a short film 'The Whistle', which I found quite interesting, with good ideas and characters, but dull and with not enough dramatic and mystery tension.",7,3,10,25 February 2011
Happy Feet," Stunnig visuals, poor script
","Another visually stunning animation movie with a a poor childish script.What I loved about the film is the portray of how penguins live and move (scientifically backed), the main character -which I found adorable- and the character and physical drawing of the rest of the characters.Notwithstanding, the movie was mentally and emotionally un-engaging mostly because, despite the good animation, the nice colors and settings, the nice musical numbers, the movie suffers from a lack of 'internal logic', result of a hurried weak script.In this movie, I missed that departure premise that makes of most Pixar animation movies believable, no matter how crazy the story might be - The movie's initial premise has to have internal logic for the rest of the events to fall into place. However, this did not happen in HF. For example, in HF the depiction of what happens to the rebel dancing penguin and the attitude of the parents is completely human. So penguins are impersonating and reproducing human ways. That's OK if your target is children. You need more than that to engage adults. There are so many stereotypes, seen for the hundredth time in animated and non animated movies, that I felt disappointed.This is a Warner Bross movie, and I was thinking, WB animation characters of the past were absolutely brilliant, why is WB coming with this Diney-ish film? Still, this is a nice entertaining movie that children will love.",5,0,0,10 February 2011
The Nice Guys," Up and down up and down
","The Nice Guys has two of my favorite actors in it, so I couldn't let it pass, especially this being a comedy and action movie, something that Crow & Gosling rarely play.Perhaps, I was expecting too much, so I felt a feel deflated after watching this film. Overall, I found it entertaining, with some truly funny moments, but not always engaging, with a poor script and poor edition, and uneven performances.The Nice Guys revolves about an unlikely couple of funny private investigators, so if the actors playing those roles don't click on camera and they are not on the same page, the whole movie is affected by a domino effect. I felt that this was the case here, at times there was true chemistry between them, but none at others. Also, I found Gosling quite funny, but Crow not that funny. To this, you have to add that the dialogues go from plain and boring to witty and fun, some of the scenes are really great but others a bit bad, so it was up and down up and down like a carousel with mechanical hiccups.The film needed of a better script and edition, because some scenes were superfluous and didn't add anything to the story, while others seemed to be there for no reason, not well explained, like disconnected from something that was going to be explained but it never was. I liked the character of Holly and Angourie Rice is one of the best things in the film; however, I'm not sure that the character was really necessary.I was thrilled to see Bassinger in the film, but since this is a comic action movie you need a bit of a caricature of the heroes and baddies to make you laugh; her acting was good per se, but I don't think appropriate for the comedic tone of the film, probably because the script wasn't 'there' either.I found the production quite good overall, especially good for interior design and references to music and film culture of the 70s; however, I found some of the dresses and jeans not that 70s, like they didn't have enough flare! The same re some of the hairdos.I don't want to be hyper-critical, as I enjoyed the film overall, but it also let me underwhelmed and feeling that all the elements for success were there, but they were mixed in the wrong way.",5,4,8,11 February 2017
Sully," Great story, decent movie
","I was living in Australia when I watched this story, soon after it had happened. It was all over the news. I remember, still today, Sully's apparent calmness when talking about the event. This is one of those stories that one believes to be fiction and part of a feel-good Christmas film, but it was real, it was great, it warmed my heart, and it renewed my respect for pilots, who certainly are not just cool dudes in pretty uniforms.Knowing the end of the story is a tricky thing for a film that is not documentary and intends to build tension and interest in the viewer. Eastwood achieved that in different ways: 1-by just playing a non-linear story that does go back and forward in time; 2-by making us see Sully behind doors (his personal background with aviation, his emotional self with PSD after the events on the Hudson unfolded, his worries about his family future); 3-by creating a set of villains (in this case the NTSB investigators), and 4-by creating a situation that builds tension (the investigation on whether Sully's act of heroism was on the contrary a lack of judgment.To me, the main problem with the film is not what is in the film, but with what's not there. Sully is based on Captain Sullenberg's own memoir and, therefore, we see just one color. I would have loved knowing more about the co-pilot and his PDS, of which he also suffered, get to know some of the passengers flying on the film, seeing more about Sully's daughters' reaction to the events, seeing more details about the NTSB behind-doors investigation going on, and building a bit of more tension around that.The acting is good overall, especially on Hanks' part, who is able to convey Sully's real mix of his usual external calmness and the inner turmoil that he experienced after the event. I also liked Eckhart as his co-pilot,and Linney as his wife.I loved the special effects that reproduce the events on the Hudson as the landing on the river looks totally real not just special effects.Overall, this is a very enjoyable feel-good movie and story. Yet, the events being so well-documented and internationally well known, and so close in time, it is difficult to get overly wowed by a story that was, indeed, wow.",6,1,2,13 May 2017
