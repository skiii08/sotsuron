Ghost," I watch it over and over!
","This is one of those movies I watch over and over--no matter at what point I find it, I settle down and watch it. As another viewer said, this movie has it all--love, humor, violence-- and best of all, the good guys win! I think it's the best thing Demi and Patrick have done (I admit I haven't seen all their work), and I think Demi should wear her hair that way all the time--to me, it's much more becoming than her later long styles. I was so happy to learn that Whoopi won an Oscar for her performance--she was funny and scared and puzzled and all the things Oda Mae would have been. I've just reviewed the list of awards this film won, and believe it deserved every one of them. As the loathsome Carl, Tony Goldwyn should probably have won one of the awards too, because he did a great portrayal of the classic coward, the type who tries cozying up to someone to get what he wants the easy way, but has no way of coping with problems except to go kill someone or hire it done for him. I'm glad the dark spirits got him too! In all, a very satisfying movie!",8,4,5,18 February 2007
Pretty Woman," Nothing wrong with a modern-day fairy tale!
","I didn't really care about seeing this movie when it came out, but when I ran across it on TV, I immediately was caught up in it.  Not being a particular Julia Roberts fan, I was delighted to see how well she played the part of a modern-day Eliza Dolittle.  I enjoyed seeing how the two principals began to interact--not just billionaire and prostitute, but two people, each of whom had something to offer the other.  It's always good to discover that a movie I hadn't wanted to see turns out to be one I'll want to see again!  I see no problem with its being a 'modern day fairy tale' with no basis in reality--sometimes reality isn't all that great!",Null,0,0,25 October 1999
