Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellently crafted effects, choppy story
","First, let me make clear that I am not a crank or curmudgeon.  I love the Star Wars franchise dearly, and have done so ever since I saw the original 'Star Wars' (aka 'A New Hope') in 1977.To that end, I found much of 'Phantom Menace' enjoyable.    I gaped at the wonderful special effects as much as anyone else did.  On the other hand, I am forced--no pun intended--to admit that the story simply wasn't considered as thoroughly as it could have been.  It's not simply a matter of it being part of the Star Wars franchise, which is designed primarily to appeal to anyone from young children to people in their early teens.No, the problem is one that has afflicted far too many films in the '90s: Whenever directors have had the opportunity to take some time to develop characters, they insert style and panache instead.  This was the case with most of the characters in TPM. Even in the original Star Wars, I felt I knew and could empathize with the characters.  I gripped the edge of my seat during crucial moments.  There were only two scenes in TPM that qualified. Everything else looked too easy, since the director never allowed enough time or shots for suspense to build.I am disappointed in this film, but I am not one who believes it is terrible.  It's simply not *fulfilling* the way the original trilogy was. I didn't walk out of the theater feeling as if good had triumphed over evil; good simply beat evil.  There's a difference.I hope--even believe--that Lucas will do better in the next two episodes.",5,0,1,21 May 1999
