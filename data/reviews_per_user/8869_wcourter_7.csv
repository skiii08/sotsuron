The Blair Witch Project," Our group vote: One of the WORST ever!
",My movie-going group agrees on this one:  one of the WORST of all times! What a waste of film stock.  The 'F' word was used hundreds of times to cover up for a lack of having anything to say.  Those who think this one is any good at all have missed a whole lifetime of good scary tales done by the masters over the many years (before blood and gore started to substitute for a good plot and implied horror).  Go see 'BATS' if you enjoy being scared by a plot and a movie worth seeing.,1,2,3,20 October 1999
American Pie," Have a slice of 'pie'
","American Pie starts out slowly, and at first we thought this one was going to be a waste of our time and money, but as the characters were developed on the screen we got to know and like them.  We especially liked how they 'grew up' somewhat during their quest for the 'pie'.  Overall, the story hung together and our time was well spent.",8,0,0,30 December 1999
Doctor Zhivago," The Doctor Is In
","Please see this one for the cinematography, if for no other reason.  Then see it for the love story, the eternal triangle of loving two persons, each for different reasons.  Then listen to the music which flows over the scenes like a warm, moist blanket.  Finally, see it for the haunting memories of visual images it will leave with you - like the ice crystals on the windows in the middle of a Russian winter.  Enjoy......",10,1,3,30 December 1999
Toy Story 2," SOOOO much better than Saturday Violence....
","If only our children could have Saturday morning 'cartoons' the quality of this movie!  Rather than 'kill and be killed' they could be learning wonderful lessons in life as was done so well in 'Toy Story II'.  If more people would support films like this we wouldn't have to wonder why our kids grow up thinking that violence is the answer to every problem in life.  And it was a fun film for adults that can be kids at heart, too.  Please, keep these films coming.........",10,0,1,3 January 2000
The Hurricane," A Moral Tale, but not justice for all....
","Key Words:  Powerful / Poignant / Thought provoking / PloddingDenzel gives us yet another believable and powerful performance throughout a story that is otherwise slow and plods along.  He and the writers clean up the image of the real 'Hurricane' who was not nearly so lovable.  Not withstanding, this is a strong moral tale about how 'justice' can be so easily be mis-used and made to serve the greed and hate of those sworn to uphold it.Everyone missed one point that could have been made by this story - if Hurricane had been put to death rather than in prison for life, there never could or would have been the chance to release an innocent man years later. Think about it.  How many others have been railroaded into prison for things they did not do?  How many innocents have been put to death before another trial could have shown they were innocent?  It is scary to think about....See this one for the strong performance by Denzel.  And rejoice when justice, though long delayed, is finally his- and ours (although there is no indication that the ones who framed him ever suffered for their deeds, except if they had to watch themselves portrayed in this film).  And wonder why Hurricane (actually the writers) never worry about getting justice for the poor innocent boy who also went to jail just for being in the same car with Hurricane and never gave in to the pressure to say that Hurricane did the crime just to save himself.  Hurricane says the boy is 'my hero', but that is the last we hear about him.  If there was such an interest in final justice, a few words could have been left in to show they cared about getting that poor guy out also.....",10,0,1,17 January 2000
The Green Mile," Finally! A REAL Stephen King film.
","Finally! A Stephen King film that tells the same story as the book!  And what a story !!!!  And what fantastic characters!!!!  If you have the cash for only two movies this year, spend it on 'The Green Mile' and 'American Beauty', please.   Michael Duncan as John Coffey will tear your heart out as someone just too good for this cruel world.  Stephen King knows all the tricks to get you to love (or hate) his characters, and all film directors would do well to tell his stories exactly as written, thank you!  The audience was so stunned that they filed out in silence after the credits. Go see this one with someone you love, and hold on tight.....",10,0,0,13 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," AH, It all makes 'sense' to me now!
","Unlike most movies, the SIXTH SENSE will leave you talking about it for an hour after you see it!  My wife and/or I can usually figure out a movie's ending before it ends, but NOT THIS ONE! We were so impressed with the way everything that happened throughout all made sense by the end, and that all the little bits (the 'clues') throughout hung together to support the ending, unlike the 'flaws' in the plots of most so-called 'intelligent' movies these days.  And all of the characters were so well established.  We loved it. Please go see this one if you like to use your brain.",10,0,0,20 August 1999
