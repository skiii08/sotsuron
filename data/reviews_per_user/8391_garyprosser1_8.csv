First Man," An extraordinary, ordinary man.
","Trotted off to the pictures tonight to see this, the new biopic of Neil Armstrong, and came away very impressed.First Man documents Neil's life and career, starting with his role as a test pilot in 1961 and culminating on July 20th 1969 when he and Buzz Aldrin became the first and second men to take that small step (and giant leap) onto the Moon.Potential spoilers ahead (but you surely know the story):It's a story we all know so well but while First Man spares no expense or detail in documenting the missions undertaken by Armstrong and his fellow astronauts, its primary goal is to show the character of Armstrong the human being, the everyday pressures felt by him, his wife and his family and the place of Space exploration in a society that was undergoing seismic changes.Armstrong was, by all accounts, a very straight-laced, emotionally muted and methodical person. It is these characteristics that got him to where he did and Ryan Gosling, an actor who often plays characters that live within themselves (Drive springs to mind), is perfect here. Opposite him, Claire Foy continues to bolster her impressive CV, laying bare for all to see the pressures of being an astronaut's wife. Dealing with personal turmoil, she can't escape in the way that her husband can, isolated and trapped as she is while he uses his work as an escape.The film is slow-paced because it's not primarily an action film, it is an account of ordinary, real life people who happen to be doing extraordinary things, bankrolled by the richest government on Earth, in pursuit of a slain President's vision. When First Man does pursue the actual test flights and missions, however, it truly shines.The sense of claustrophobia, peril and stress is palpable for the viewer as we remain in the cockpit/capsule for the duration. When it hits the fan, there is no music, no outside shots of the craft; it all takes place inside the module in order to convey just how dangerous a situation the astronauts placed themselves in time and again. This wasn't Hollywood; this was real and the film is excellent at conveying that and if you needed any more convincing of the costs involved, there are plenty of funerals to hammer the point home.All of which culminates in the Moon landing, the reason Armstrong is one of the most famous and revered men in history, and the highlight of the film. After a typically tense and challenging descent (Foy's observation that NASA are 'boys building things from Balsa wood' rings true throughout), Houston hears that 'the Eagle has landed' and Armstrong and Aldrin set foot on the Moon.Here, Damien Chazelle does everything right; as the door opens, there are no great swells of triumphant music, no whoops and cheers. There's nothing but silence. Intense, complete silence like one would indeed experience in a world with no atmosphere. It's very powerful to hear nothing as you gaze out onto a cold, grey, untouched alien world and the entire Moon scene had me utterly transfixed.I've gone on long enough now but I would highly recommend First Man. I've read reviews slating it for being slow paced (it's a biopic of an extraordinary and yet ordinary man) and also for being nauseating to watch in the truest sense (you will feel like you've been through a washing machine spin cycle at times but that is what it was like onboard when stuff went wrong). It won't be for everyone but I loved it and I left the cinema feeling like I better knew one of history's great heroes and the team behind him.If nothing else, the scene on the Moon is cinema at its absolute best.8/10.",8,0,1,22 October 2018
United 93," Blistering cinema
","The events of that sunny Tuesday morning in September 2001 need no introduction. As the cliche goes, everybody remembers where they were on 9/11 and thanks to a million documentaries, YouTube videos and opinion pieces, we all have a detailed knowledge of what happened. Or rather, we all have a detailed OPINION of what happened and how events unfolded. While many accept the official account of the day, still more are moved to question the words of officials.Conspiracy theorists will tell you that the US Government were behind it, the CIA did it, President Bush sanctioned it; all to sway public opinion into backing military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are literally hundreds of expos√©s online that point to 'evidence'; where are the remains of the plane that hit The Pentagon? Why didn't the military act sooner in getting planes airborne? What brought the twin towers down when they should have stayed standing? Some of the questions posed by the doubters are valid and worthy of real debate, others can be safely dismissed as groundless nonsense and tin foil hat worthy paranoia.Where 'United 93' shines so brightly is that it doesn't ask any questions like this. It doesn't ask you to lean either way politically and it doesn't offer any opinions of its own as to the reasons for the atrocities. It focuses on the insurmountable truths of the day: that four planes, containing innocent people, didn't make it to their destination. What the viewer sees is an almost real time account of the doomed Flight 93, it's passengers and crew and those on the ground who attempted to make sense of the unprecedented events unfolding before their very eyes.We see the very familiar scenes (if you've ever flown with an airline) of boarding, of finding your seat, of placing orders for food; the usual hubbub that is involved in any flight. The crew attend to the passengers while the pilots go through their pre-flight routine while elsewhere, air traffic controllers fulfil the almost superhuman role that they do everyday. It's all so normal and you feel like a fly on the wall, observing both the process of flying that you are so familiar with and all the behind the scenes activity that you are blissfully unaware of. If anyone stands out, it's four men of Arab appearance but they stand out because we already know who they are. That morning, they don't stand out at all because, acting calmly and normally as they are, there is no reason why they should.And then, it all changes.From the moment it becomes apparent that flight AA11 may have been hijacked, the film becomes something else entirely. All routine starts to evaporate as confusion creeps in; what happens here? Who is in charge? Who needs to know what's going on? Then, flight UA175 stops responding. What the hell is going on? At Air Traffic Control, organised chaos starts to take over. Many of those onscreen are actual ATC staff (who were there, in real life, on the day) playing themselves and this masterstroke piece of casting is key to how real the scenes feel. At no point do you feel like you're watching actors act. The dialogue is technical, ordinary and devoid of the flourishes of a scriptwriter. The restrained panic is keenly felt and is then intensified when it becomes apparent that all is not right with flights AA77 and UA93. 'What is going on?', people ask in the same way we all did. Then, flight AA11 strikes the North Tower of The World Trade Centre and the film switches up again.Okay, so I could dissect the whole film but it's best just to watch it. Director Paul Greengrass has produced a masterpiece of film-making here; I cannot remember the last time I was so tense whilst watching a movie. At times, it was unbearable despite the fact that you and I know what happened. Flight 93 was intended for the White House but it never got there because the passengers and crew fought back.In this regard, Greengrass is using his imagination to depict what happened on that flight because, of course, nobody knows. We only have the mobile phone calls made by passengers to loved ones in their last moments to inform us that plans were being made to fight the hijackers. We don't have detailed accounts of what the passengers did but I didn't doubt even one thing that the film depicted. Ordinary men and women, sensing that they HAD to fight back to have any chance at all of survival? That's completely believable and the way the film had them go about it rang completely true. They did what you, I and anyone else would do when desperate times call for desperate measures.For a film to convey such tension and drama when the audience already knows the outcome is a testament to the filmmakers. 9/11 outstripped anything Hollywood could have written but this film is very un-Hollywood. There are no rousing calls to arms, no overblown depictions of fantastical heroism, no cheesy soundbites. The music is used very sparingly but when it is, it is incredibly effective. We don't get to know the back stories of the passengers and crew. Referring again to the fly-on-the-wall feel, it is as if we are a fellow passenger (or ATC member of staff) and all we know of those around us is what we learn in the moment. Like so many who watched this film, I asked myself again and again what I would have done. Would I have got up there and fought? Would I have hidden away? Would I have suddenly felt the need to pray? I don't know. Who really does? You and I have never (and almost certainly will never) be in such a situation but United 93 gets us as close as is humanly possible to being right there.At the end of the film, I exhaled out of sheer mental exhaustion at what I'd just seen. This film is extraordinary and not an easy watch but it's one I feel that you must see. You may well have done (seeing as it was released in 2006), in which case, watch it again. As a piece of cinema and for sheer emotional clout, it's the best film I've watched in a long time.9.5/10",9,5,7,4 April 2019
Dunkirk," Visceral and intoxicating.
","Chose to rewatch Dunkirk tonight for two reasons. Firstly, it was the last day it was available on NowTV and secondly, I wanted to see if it transferred well to the small screen, having seen it in the cinema first time around. Well, for the most part, it does.Christopher Nolan set out to make a film about the infamous withdrawal of troops that was as accurate as possible. Reading up on Dunkirk, it becomes clear that while historians and experts on the operation can and will find fault, many of these inaccuracies were either intentional in order to allow for artistic licence (the German plane liveries, the lack of real characters, etc), underplayed (the role of the RAF) or embellished (the role of the 'Home Fleet').The latter of the three can be read two ways. The popular image is that thousands of pleasure boats, yachts, schooners, tugboats and rowing boats, skippered by civilians, crossed the Channel and brought everyone home. The reality is that just 5% of the more than 330,000 who were evacuated from Dunkirk came home in such vessels. Now, that shouldn't be sniffed at; we're still talking about more than 16,000 men who may otherwise have died on the beach in France.To his eternal credit, Nolan recognises this fact and other inaccuracies. In interviews, he was at great pains to explain the need for a director to balance realism with dramatic narration and in this regard, I feel that he succeeds because Dunkirk is, for the greater part, a very accurate telling of those 9 days. It is also tremendously watchable, gripping and, though it feels like the wrong word, entertaining.The tension throughout is palpable. At Dunkirk, the men were sitting ducks waiting to be rescued as the enemy closed in on land and in the sky. We, the viewers, feel this sense of ominous dread throughout, interspersed with moments of intense action, death, pain and hopelessness as the seemingly impossible task of evacuating so many men slowly grinds into action. We feel the desperation of soldiers who just want off that beach, to be away from the bullets, the bombs, the noise.The noise. Dunkirk won Oscars for its sound design and sound mixing while it was also nominated for Hans Zimmer's score and rightly so. The audio is utterly integral to the film's sense of foreboding and dread and it never lets up. The screams of planes and men, the shuddering impact of the bombs, the stinging smack of bullets into metal and flesh; I vividly recall being in the cinema and wanting it to stop, praying for the noise to cease so I could think straight. Just imagine what the hell it was like being there at the time. Hell.Similarly, the score adds layer upon oppressive layer to the cinematic experience. Zimmer provides the sweeping orchestral score that underpins all great war films whilst making inspired use of an audio effect known as The Shephard Scale. Google it for a full explanation but in essence, this is an illusory effect achieved by stacking several scales on top of each other, all rising in pitch at once. As the high notes drop away, the low notes replace them, tricking the listener into thinking that the music is constantly rising in pitch. The effect, especially when the sounds of war boom over the top, is incredibly unsettling and brilliant. There were reports at the time of cinema goers feeing nauseous and even throwing up just from the soundtrack. Cinema doesn't get more visceral than that.Watching Dunkirk, one often feels like one is viewing everything through the eyes of a shell-shocked soldier. Dialogue is intentionally sparse (and sometimes feels a bit too corny, too 'Hollywood', when it arrives) and the action often feels like it's taking place over in the distance. That is until it roars up on the characters and the audience and suddenly, the fog of disorientation lifts and we are plunged straight back into the mayhem of trying to survive in dreadful circumstances.No one character is the hero. This isn't one man's story but an obsessively considered and thoughtful retelling of the whole incredible saga that was Dunkirk. It is open to debate what would have happened if Dunkirk had failed but if it had, we would have had a very different war. At the time, the British Empire stood alone against the Nazis. America hadn't yet joined the war and Russia still had a peace treaty with Germany. Surrender at Dunkirk, with the loss of 200,000 British soldiers, would have put huge pressure on Churchill to make peace with Hitler. Would he have done so? We will never know but in the aftermath of the miracle of Dunkirk, Britain was galvanised and Churchill would go on to make his famous promise:'... We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender...'As a historical retelling, Dunkirk is mostly spot on. As a piece of cinema, it is quite brilliant and frequently overwhelming. As a chapter in history, the real Dunkirk spawned a million heroes whose story deserves to be told as well as Nolan has told it here.8.5/10",8,1,4,27 June 2019
A Beautiful Mind," What's In A Mind?
","Didn't think I'd watched A Beautiful Mind. At first, I thought that maybe it seemed familiar because of its similar feel to the later films The Theory Of Everything and The Imitation Game. Misunderstood, awkward geniuses in elite institutions, struggling to find their place in society whilst engaged in a battle with their own brilliant (or, indeed, beautiful) minds; it's no wonder that I was drawn to this film because I've already seen and loved it.Sadly and also fortuitously, I don't have a mind like John Mash's so I was able to watch this film with new eyes despite having seen it and it really is remarkable. Whether or not it is as true to life as the other two films I mentioned (both of which, while brilliant, deviate heavily from reality), I don't know. What I do know is that I'm clearly drawn to and fascinated by those whose brains are wired differently from those of mere mortals. Nash, Hawking, Turing, Curie, Lovelace, Weeks, Da Vinci; these people see the world so utterly differently and beautifully that I'm compelled to want to see what they see, even though I never, ever could.Ron Howard won 4 Oscars for this film and it's easy to see why. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are exemplary in their roles as the Nash's and the film itself doesn't waste a scene as it tortures us and John with what is real and what is not. This is part biopic, part thriller, part mystery; all wrapped up in the mind of one remarkable brain. It is a blessing that John lived at a time where his conditions, to use a basic term, were at least attempted to be understood, albeit primitively, rather than him being locked away in a padded cell for the rest of his days.Such minds change the world if they're allowed to. The person in question might never be able to understand themselves or the world they live in but if and when the light shines through and they unlock whatever is lurking in the recesses of their capabilities, beauty and magic are released and the way we all view things is altered.Hawking's body let him down, the medical profession let Nash down and everybody let Turing down (look it up; it is a source of eternal national shame what happened to him after the war). Great geniuses are so often misunderstood and let down by those around them but we can only be grateful that these people's minds were allowed to shine so brilliantly and with such intensity for however long they did.A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful film about a beautiful man. We mere mortals are so lucky that such insight comes along once in a blue moon, even if they themselves must suffer so much. I just wonder if it has to be that way. All minds are beautiful but some are painted with a greater palette of colours.9/10",9,3,3,8 June 2019
American Made," Pure entertainment.
","I love films like this. Pure, unadulterated excess from start to finish and the fact remains that such films are usually based on true stories. For every ten million people who work dead end jobs, live from payslip to payslip and have modest ambitions, there are guys like Barry Seal.Spoilers Ahead!Guys who are offered an opportunity, grab the bull by the horns and end up smuggling drugs and people into the USA whilst smuggling weapons into Nicaragua, all whilst doing deals with the Colombians, evading the DEA and FBI and laundering more money than there is in Silicon Valley. Guys who are in bed with the CIA, Noriega, Escobar and everybody else. Guys who go from a modest salary to monopolising the local bank's main vault just for their money because they've run out of places to store it in their mansion.Okay, so Hollywood takes liberties with the truth for artistic licence and while this film really takes liberties, having read American Desperado and other books about the Medellin Cartel, Barry Seal's life is well documented and every bit as crazy as the film makes out. With such people, one wonders how the hell they survive day to day but eventually, everyone's luck runs out. Even if you do dodge 30 years in prison to work for the White House.American Made is gloriously excessive, brilliant fun and wildly entertaining. There's no complicated plot, subtext or layers of meaning to unravel; sometimes, all you need from a film is good old fashioned escapism and an insight into the life of a man who ended up getting community service when he was hoping, nay, praying for prison. For his own good.8/10",8,1,1,20 July 2019
Joker," Troubling, dark, engrossing
","Was never into the whole comic book thing (the last Batman I saw was played by Michael Keaton) but this film was sold to me on the basis that it's more a portrayal of one man's descent into madness than a CGI-fuelled superhero adventure.Comparisons with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy certainly helped (not to mention the presence of the star of both of those films, Robert De Niro), as well as the leading man, an actor of whom I'm quickly becoming a devoted fan, Joaquin Phoenix. With all this considered, I armed myself with the extremely scant knowledge of the Batman universe that I possess and off to the pictures I went.Well, what I and the packed cinema saw was an acting tour de force. I never saw Heath Ledger's legendary portrayal of the titular character but I really don't know how it can beat Phoenix's portrayal here. Admittedly, I think I'm right in saying that Ledger portrayed Joker whereas for most of this film, Phoenix is portraying Arthur Fleck and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. There's no denying that Joker is an intensely interesting character but for me, seeing the human behind the face-paint and his tumultuous unravelling is far more fascinating than the monster he becomes.Much has been made of how dark this film is and that is certainly true; how it is a 15 certificate is more a sign of the times than anything because this film pulls no punches. The violence is, at times, extremely graphic and the portrayal of a man so troubled is often deeply unsettling. All of which, set against a relentlessly grim Gotham backdrop, is utterly necessary to give the film the atmosphere and the feel it requires but I did wonder how this film will sit in a franchise that, while not explicitly aimed at kids, nevertheless appeals to younger audiences the way Batman always has. 'The Dark Knight Rises' was a 12A; Joker should really be an 18 and trust me, you really don't want to be taking your kids to see it if you want them to get a good night's sleep afterwards.What isn't in any doubt is the extraordinary performance Joaquin Phoenix delivers in the title role. He has always been a very dependable actor and has given some incredible performances over the years ('Walk The Line' and 'You Were Never Really Here' to name but two) but here, one gets the sense that he is throwing absolutely everything he has at the role. As well as a physical transformation (he clearly lost an awful lot of weight to attain the skeletal physique required), Phoenix brings a manic intensity to the part that is, at times, hugely uncomfortable to watch but is never anything less than utterly fascinating and absorbing.It is unnerving because even for someone like me who has such a flimsy knowledge of the Batman story, there is a strange contradiction in the sadness and pity felt for a character who one knows is going to become one of pop culture's great supervillains; a murderous madman who will come to thrive on anarchy, violence, death and destruction. For most of the film though, he isn't Joker, he is Arthur Fleck, a sympathetic character exposed to the violence, the mockery and the ostracisation that those on the edge of society suffer all too often. With what's thrown at him, it is no wonder that he eventually snaps and fights back in the most spectacular and public way.I might have got even more from this film if I had any interest in the comic book world but it says a lot about Joker that I was able to watch this as a stand-alone film and leave the cinema utterly mesmerised by what I'd seen. Director Todd Phillips' vision aside though, all praise has to go to Phoenix for delivering such a pained, intense, visceral and thrilling performance. In lesser hands, it could have felt cheap and exploitative but not here. I can't say either way whether this is a sensitive portrayal of mental illness but then again, Arthur's specific condition isn't explicitly defined and also, this is a fictional character whose defining feature, his greatest weapon, is that he is 'insane' (for want of a better word).Already, there have been debates about whether or not the portrayal is healthy and there are arguments on both sides. I don't know for sure but if nothing else, some good will surely come from increasing the spotlight on what it means to suffer from mental illness. The film itself, while set in a fictional city in an undefined timeframe, does touch upon issues that are seemingly timeless.The lack of funding or of proper care for those living with mental illness is explicitly referred to in the film and are highlighted as major factors in Arthur's continuing decline. The therapist who just repeats the same questions, the lack of funding for proper care, the constant mockery from those who don't understand; these are all daily battles waged by those living with mental illness. Of course, in reality, said sufferers very, very seldom reach a point whereby they turn violent (or indeed murderous) and wreak revenge on society. Their battle to be heard and to get proper care, however, is all too common.This is just one debate that the film will ignite but great cinema always does that and for me, 'Joker' is great cinema with a performance at its heart that surely cannot go unrewarded when Awards Season comes around. Certain scenes will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, debates will be had, lines will be quoted and meaning will be attempted to be extracted from what the viewer has seen. THAT is what only great cinema provides.8.5/10",8,6,10,15 October 2019
Whiplash," Drum roll please.....
","I've played guitar for 22 years, bass for about 19 years and drums for less than three. I'm pretty good at guitar and bass and intensely average on drums but this is probably because I have only ever viewed these instruments as fun. I never intended to set out to be the best there is, was or ever will be; I play them because I enjoy it and I can express myself through the strings and sticks. In this respect, I'm in the vast majority of players. Genius doesn't think like that. Geniuses are born with that certain something and then devote themselves to an eternity of practice, rudiments, blood, sweat and tears to get to where they want to be and then improve on that. Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is one such prodigy; a gifted young jazz drummer who has won a place at the esteemed Schaffer Music School and it is here that he meets Fletcher. Imagine if R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket was taking tips from The Thick Of It's Malcolm Tucker in the art of personal relations and then give him sheet music and the role of band conductor. That's Fletcher, a truly hateful character but one whom you buy into completely thanks to the performance of the always majestic J.K. Simmons and the fact that despite his monstrousness, one can see what he's doing. His plan is to wring every last drop of sweat and blood out of his musicians so that they may be the next Charlie Parker. He just chooses to do so through intimidation and terrific insults. He's happy to be the bad guy if it makes the good guy great. This is where the film succeeds so completely, in the at-times unbearably tense relationship between two men who want the same thing: perfection. Whiplash doesn't get everything right. There's a love story that feels as unnecessary as it is light and I do wonder if non musicians will get the same out of this film as players will because if you're a musician (and especially if you're a drummer), this film is practically porn. Teller is clearly a gifted drummer because as far as I could tell, what you see and hear are the same; the people on screen are really playing and it's spellbinding. That said, I think it's a film that will get past any concerns about it being niche due to the ferocity of the performances. You certainly don't have to like jazz and I hope you don't have to be a musician to appreciate fully this dramatic, tense and utterly terrific film. 9/10",9,0,0,16 August 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," So clever, so different, so brilliant.
","Finally got around to watching Birdman, not really knowing what to expect. From the synopsis, I wondered if this would be a superhero film in the Marvel/DC vein and those films, despite their huge audiences and rave reviews, just aren't my thing at all. I took a chance though and what I found was a film that is very good and a piece of cinema that is utterly brilliant.Alejandro Inarritu had made some fantastic films prior to Birdman (including Babel and Amores Perros). He would then follow it up with The Revenant, a film that earned a first Oscar for Leo DiCaprio as well as Best Picture and Best Director for Inarritu. That made it two Best Director Oscars in a row for him because he won the same award for Birdman and upon watching it, it is easy to see why.The film itself, as I say, is very good. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson, a somewhat washed up movie star who is writing, directing and putting on a play on Broadway. The play is beset with the kind of problems that probably affect a great many plays and all the while, Thomson's personal life is falling apart and there's the ongoing memory of the career he had that haunts him, not least by the voice (and appearance of his Birdman character and by the imagined superpowers that he once pretended to have.His urge is to make real art, rather than succumb to the wishes of his agent, rekindle his superhero role (Birdman) and take the easy money. This has to be a bit of a dig at Hollywood's propensity to take less risks than it used to. Why gamble on something original and different when you can just churn out another blockbuster, sell a ton of merchandise and make another $2bn, regardless of whether or not that latest franchise piece is even any good?The name, the characters and the actors will ensure that it's a box office sensation before anyone has even seen it because it conforms to a tried and trusted template. Riggan could be a part of that again but no, he wants to make art and in doing so, he risks losing absolutely everything.Keaton is utterly fantastic but he's not alone. Every actor in this film is at the top of his or her game and they are working so hard and here's why: when I say that it's a very good film but a brilliant piece of cinema, perhaps I should explain what I mean.It occurred to me early on and once it had, I was engrossed. Remember the single shot camerawork in Fight Club? Where the camera flies through a keyhole, swoops across the sky, through a window, down the barrel of a gun and into Edward Norton's mouth? David Fincher, Fight Club's director, also used this technique in Panic Room and Hitchcock was doing it in the 60's. Well, in Birdman, that same technique lasts for an hour and 45 minutes. We don't see a jump cut until the final 15 minutes of the film. The planning and direction, as well as the acting, that must go into composing such scenes and shots is only worthy of, well, the Best Director Oscar.Seriously, I'm not an expert, but imagine this. An unbroken scene, moving from room to room, unfolding in real time over as much as twenty minutes or more. As the scene progresses, everyone must be in position, ready to deliver their lines, knowing that if they get it wrong or screw up, the last ten, fifteen, twenty minutes has been for nothing and they must all go again. They can't say 'we'll cut it there and go from that last line' because the whole scene is in one unbroken take and therefore, the whole scene must be done again.Apart from the aforementioned sequence of jump cuts near the end (which portrays a dream sequence), the whole film is one unbroken camera shot. Even when time is moved forward to present a new scene, clever editing or time lapse is used and the camera doesn't move. There are no cutaways, cuts, fades, dissolves, screen cards or blackouts. The actors have to learn and remember huge tracts of script and get it right first time. Just like a play. Technically, this must be incredibly difficult because Birdman is a film about a play, acted like a play but shot like a film.Everyone here deserves full marks. The cast (Keaton, Emma Stone, the aforementioned Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis, everyone else), the crew (Emmanuel Lubezki also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography) and of course, the Director because Birdman is a compete triumph and an engrossing watch.Inarritu himself described the idea of a full, single shot film as 'almost suicidal' whilst remarking that he went with the idea because 'we live our lives without editing' and that's what he wanted to convey. Boy, he really did too.Birdman is an extraordinary film and one that I'd happily watch again and again. You should too.9/10.",9,1,2,11 July 2019
