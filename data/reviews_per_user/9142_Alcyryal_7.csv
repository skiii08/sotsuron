The Ring," The Scariest I've ever seen.
","I knew that this movie would be scary the moment I walked in. Maybe it was the TV spots saying this was the scariest movie since the Exorcist. Or the fact that everyone and their mothers was saying that this was scary. But after I saw this movie, I had trouble sleeping that night, and it takes a LOT to scare me. This movie scared me, and caused my girlfriend to sleep in her parents' room that night.This movie doesn't waste any time in scaring the living crap out of the audience. In the beginning, the film builds up to a climax when the phone rings, because we think someone hostile is on the phone and something will happen, but its just the girl's mom. All that tension built up to nothing. Then, all of a sudden, some of the freakiest things ever captured on film happen.The way this movie works is that this process is repeated so that the rest of the movie, the viewer is a nervous wreck. The film also surprises. The scene with the body in the closet that I still can't get out of my head. It was totally unexpected, and I nearly had a heart attack because of it.
Our imaginations get the better of us, and that is how this movie works. We imagine all these horrible things that are about to happen, and then they don't. But when we let our guard down, the horrible things we were thinking about happen. And it all culminates in the final scene. And that final scene is something so scary, that I didn't know things like that were possible.
I haven't seen The Exorcist, except on TV, but if it is scarier, then there must be some REALLY tripped out crap in that. This movie is definetly a must see.9/10(Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. This movie is NOT for young kids.)",Null,0,0,24 January 2003
The Ring," Incredibly Horrifying (MINOR SPOILERS)
","This, my friends, is the scariest movie I have ever seen. From the moment it began, I could sense the tension. From that point on, it was a nerve-racking, plot-twisting, mind-bending experience. Even though it was a full theater, and I was surrounded by the 'comfort' of my friends, I just about soiled my self at every single turn.This is how the movie begins: Two girls are sitting in a room, watching the TV. We hear of the videotape, a videotape that supposedly has its viewer dead in exactly seven days. One girl has seen it, and from there, strange things happen. And at exactly 10 PM, she's dead, exactly one week after she saw the tape.I have to say this movie works on tension. There are moments in which the tension is built to a maximum. The viewer is anticipating something, something terrible, and then, nothing. It also works on element of surprise, especially the scene with the girl in the closet (probably the freakiest dead body I've seen anywhere). In the end the movie is explained, we find out the mystery of the tape, and everyone lives happily ever after. Oh, how I wish that was the case. Oh sure, we find out about the tape, but there's no happy ending to this film. We find out just how the victims are killed in perhaps the SCARIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. What it is, you'll have to see for yourself. Here's a hint, it involves the TV.So, if you want to get away from phony slasher flicks(Valentine, Scream, Jason X), classic horror remakes (or re-FAKES, as I like to put it), or horror/comedies (or movies so stupidly violent, you're actually cheering for more blood and guts), then see this movie. It's the return of a lost art. That is a movie that will make your blood freeze.",Null,0,0,20 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Best Movie of the Year!
","Simply put. This film is nothing short of mind-blowing. Peter Jackson is a genius for being able to give life to the greatest epic in modern literature. Perfect scenery, camera angles, the right dialogue, everything in this movie is perfect.When I first saw the previews, I thought this would be another one those hyped-up-movies-that-turns-out-to-garbage movies. Then, I saw the movie. OH MY GOD. It was told in great detail. Everything I imagined from the book turned out to be exactly on target. The excitement, the suspense, the emotion, and of course, J.R.R. Tolkien's unforgettable and amazing story. It all came together to create The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring. I am dying for the next movie, and from what I see, No. 2 will NOT be another one of those hyped-up-movies-that-turns-out-to-be-garbage movies.",10,1,1,13 September 2002
Spirited Away," Stunning (Minor spoilers)
","'Spirited Away' is the story on a young girl, her parents, and their magical journey into a world inhabited by spirits from the living world. The parents, who have ignorantly taken food from the spirits, have been warped into pigs as punishment. Chihiro is left alone in a world that is foreign to her. Help arrives from Haku, who helps Chihiro find a safe place in the spirit world. Together, they try and find a way home for Chihiro and her parents. I had high expectations for this movie, seeing it in the top 50 of the Top 250 list on this site. But I had no idea that this movie would blow me away like it did. I hear some people complaining that this is a nightmarish movie that doesn't present a compelling story and is too scary for children. I think that they just need to open up to this movie and realize that this is competely different that what America is used to. The Japanese (even with such abominations as Pokemon, Power Rangers, Digimon, etc.) have such a broad imagination and such a unique way of story telling, something that is not often seen here in the U.S. In order to enjoy this movie, the viewer must open their mind and accept the world in which Chihiro travels to. The animation is nothing short of perfection. And the story is one of the best not only in the world of animation, but all of cinema. Chihiro begins as a sort of whiny little girl who complains about the major changes she is going through (She is moving to a new city). But the adventures she must endure in the spirit world change her. She begins to grow up and mature, while coming to understand the importance of selflessness. When Haku is attacked near the end of the film, she decides to put off everything else, even her parents, to try to save him.    This is a must for any movie collection. The Japanese have given us very good things and very bad things. This, however, is truly their gem.

A Beautiful Mind," Definetly worth my time (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)
","This film gives us a look into the mind of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician, and his endless battle with schizophrenia. Russel Crowe protrays John Nash with great detail, so well that I was able to believe that he was mentally ill. Director Ron Howard does an incredible job showing the frightening reality of this horrible disease by showing the audience what Nash was seeing. When the I learned the truth about what was going through Nash's mind, it shocked me, as it was designed to do. Ron Howard was also able to show one of the horrors of mental hospitals of old with the highly disturbing electroshock scene. It scared me to know that Nash had to endure this kind of torture(Which, by the way had no beneficial effects for the patient. It was used, in my opinion only for punishment).
Personally, I think that 'Lord of the Rings' was the better film, and should've won best picture. But this film was deserving as well. I also have to say that I am frustrated with those that say the Academy pick the wrong movies to win Best Picture('Forrest Gump' over 'The Shawshank Redemption'). If the Academy likes a movie better than another, then by all means they have the right to pick that movie to win. So 'A Beautiful Mind' comes out the victor in this battle for Best Picture. And it, like 'Lord of the Rings' is a great film. Absolutely deserving for Best Picture. It is definetly worth watching.A BEAUTIFUL MIND: 9/10",9,0,1,16 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Greatest of All Time
","Peter Jackson has done it. He has created a masterpiece, a landmark, one that will be treasured as a classic. The 70s had The Godfather, the 80s had Star Wars and Indiana Jones, the 90s many various films, such as Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Titanic, etc. but this Trilogy is our classic of the New Millenium.   Part of the Fellowship has been reunited for a time, but now war is beginning in Gondor. They split up, Gandalf and Pippin to warn Gondor, and the others to gather strength for the upcoming battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to Mordor and Mount Doom, with their deceitful guide, Gollum. The stakes in this film are raised off the charts. It is all or nothing now. Failure is not an option.   Jackson takes his audience on a whirlwind of emotions. He gives us suspense, excitment, horror, humor, sadness, triumph, loss, everything. Just like the Godfather Trilogy, this series has everything a movie-lover wants. The emotion is made even stronger thanks to the Special Edition DVDs that Peter Jackson has given us the opportunity to see. When I see the movies succeed, I always root for the cast, who gave it their all to make the movies a perfect as possible. I have to say that Peter Jackson has raised the bar for all movies in the future. It is my personal opinion that The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie ever made. Everytime I see a movie, this is the standard by which I will judge it. Kudos to Peter Jackson and the entire cast of The Lord of the Rings.

The Godfather," The Best Ever.
","This is the Quintessential movie. This is the film that has been chased by so many directors. This is the movie that acheives brilliance. This is the movie that has been spoofed more times than any other (except for Star Wars).The Godfather is a movie about family, as so the saying goes.
It tells the story of the Corleone Family, a big Mafia family engrossed in a rapidly escalating gang war of the different families of New York. At the helm is Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family. His sons, Fredo, Sonny and Michael. Sonny is deeply involved in the family business, and he's obviously the heir to the throne. Michael is the oddball. He's a war hero, and wants no part in the family business. But as events unfold, that changes.The acting is superb. The writing is the best I've ever seen in any film. I've just recently seen this movie in its entirety, and it's everything I've heard. I love this movie, and I think that it changed the way we watch movies. I think anybody who's anybody has seen this movie, and they too put it up on their top ten list. For me, this is #1.Final Rating: 10/10",10,0,2,20 September 2002
