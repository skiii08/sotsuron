Sucker Punch," A note on the extreme reviews
","This movie really impressed me. And then to say I saw it the first time in an airplane on a very small screen.Two days later i went to see it in the cinema as it was still screening. It impressed me 1000x more.You can't go around the (near) originality of the story that the movie is playing in the unconsciousness of the main character Babydoll. Reading most reviews here it's like most people never had an endless nightmare where you can't seem to escape from. These expressions of our deepest fears are masterly shown in this movie.This movie is in my DVD collection and I'll always treasure it. Depending on your mood you see and experience the movie in a different way, every time again. It's equal to what Dark Side of the Moon of Pink Floyd can do to you.Even if you are slightly in the mystical genre, you'll love Sucker Punch. If you feel like you didn't appreciate it, it's probably because you didn't scratched the surface enough to see the story behind the story.About the ending, there are probably as many interpretations as people who have seen the movie. That adds to its greatness.",9,1,3,28 November 2011
