Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Strange Tide
","I got a chance by a friend to watch this movie at the premier. And I am glad i did. On stranger Tides was just as good as the other pirates. Maybe even the best one yet.One thing that you will Understand early in the film, is that it is very different compared to the others. at the start it may seem a bit slow, but as you go further into the film it gets better and better by the minute. Johnny Depp is as good as always. i can NOT imagine anyone else playing this Role but him, he truly nailed it as always.A very good thing about this film is that there aren't many CG scenes, like At the world's End. it makes the films look and feel very natural. the performance by Geoffrey Rush and Penélope Cruz Are fantastic and would be very good if we see them in the future films. They are really lucky that the movie was rated PG-13. There are some mild Violence scenes which we never had in the pirates series. but I am not referring to that as a weakness. The mermaids were extremely Beautiful and nicely made, which i think was one of the best parts of the films.On the other hand Ian McShane's performance didn't really grab me. he seemed that he hasn't fit into the role. And was not as scary and powerful as the Black Beard should be.The Music fantastic as always by Hans Zimmer. it adds so much to the film's story and theme. I personally Can not wait until the next one is ready. Because it will always be as good as the first one.thats whats special about this, that it Never Gets boring or Old. Jack is Back,maybe not as powerful as ever, but with a new cast and new story and a new tide, brings a great deal of action to the series.So this is a MUST-SEE film of the year so far. so if you have any plans for the weekend, drop them, and get to the nearest Cinema!!Overall 9/10",9,26,47,17 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bill Condon saves !!
","I really had bad hopes ,going into watching this movie. when I watched Eclipse , I promised myself Never again. But under new circumstance, had to watch this. So lets get to the point. I really don't understand why everyone is saying that this was worse part out of the series. Eclipse was much much worse.The starting is slow , as usual. they spend too much time on the wedding and honeymoon , which makes sense because the book is split into 2 parts , therefore there is not much materiel to work with. This was the biggest mistake. Producers decided they wanted to make more money and risked screwing the movie which they almost accomplished.another thing was the acting , awful and cliché as ever. Kristen Stewart seems to have only one expression and looks like she is in pain all the time.BUT one thing that saved it or me was the pregnancy period which really worked well , and they were able to show Bella changing and dying to a fantastic level.also the bloody birth scene , which lots of people say that it was similar to the scene in pulp fiction.and the last weak point was the time between Bella 'dying' and then coming back as a vampire which was way to long and stretched. just to fill up the minutes.",1,1,8,27 November 2011
Skyfall," Pretty Good!
","I live in the UAE and the movie was released here today for some very fortunate reasons and i managed to watch it. First of all, it is quite different from your regular bond movie. there is certainly a lot more drama. it also have a quite personal story. even bond's past is looked at a bit. about his parents and where he grow up. I personally liked that. It gives him more of a human look. rather than just a killing machine. Second thing i want to talk about is the acting. I am now completely convinced that Javier Bardem is a genius. if I had any doubts before, now they're gone. he was amazing. easily one of the best villains on Bond. also I think Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond was the best one so far. he did really well. Sam Mendez's directing was a pure beauty. loved it. I recommend this to everyone. even if you have never watched a Bond movie. cheers.",10,9,27,26 October 2012
Argo," Argo : PoliticalJust Political.
","This movie was so horrible that I can't even begin to describe it.First, I'm going to break it down in 2 sections: the technical part and the historical aspect.The Story was a mess and cliché. Such stories have been done so many times that 2 minutes within the movie you are able to guess every event and turnover that the story is going to take: An Unknown CIA agent who has troubles with his wife and family goes on a dangerous, life threatening mission to save the lives of Americans. In the process, he disobeys a direct order, accomplishes the mission, comes back home and gets a medal for it. And he is reunited with his family. And everyone lives happily ever after. The end.That's the movie, summed up. And I can bet everyone can agree that it's a cliché and overdone story. Other aspect is the historical aspect. I'm from Iran myself (but I don't live there now) so I know exactly what went down. Let me start by saying that the movie in fact IS a true story but it's not the WHOLE truth. They managed to 'forget' some important notes that I'm sure lots of people noticed but chose to ignore it because of all the undeserved hype around the movie. First thing is that the U.S government could give up the Shah at any time and got the hostages back in a moment's notice. But they didn't. Why? Didn't the lives of 60 US citizens outweigh the life of a dictator who needed to be brought to justice? This was never mentioned. Secondly, the Canadians role; it's very popular among the people to call that mission 'Canadian Caper'. The Canadians had a HUGE role in this process. In fact they had the main role. They were the ones who issued REAL Canadian passports, they were the ones who arranged the flights and coordinated people within Iran. But we see their role cut down substantially to just the mere presents of the Canadian Ambassador. Thirdly, the movie fails to mention that the attack on the US embassy in Tehran was a result of decades of the US interference in Iran's politics and decision making; All the way from appointing prime ministers to staging coups. That's what drove the people to that point, and the film, once again fails to mention that. The film goes on to do what a typical Hollywood 'true story' does. Dramatize actual events and make it into a Hollywood film. and a typical Hollywood ending scene (which never happened in real) Once again, horrible, horrible movie. Rating 4/10 : Only for the visual effects and production design which was adequate.",4,84,119,12 February 2013
Lost in Translation," Should have seen it sooner
","Lost in translation is the story of two people who are stuck. At first glance, it appears that our two characters have a comfortable, rich life; but as the story progresses, we see that they lack the spark in their life.Scarlet Johansson puts up the performance of her life. Never before have I seen her act in such a delicate and touching way. Her emotions and her expressions are spot on during the whole film and she portrays a likable, smart, sexy character.Bill Murray is Bill Murray. He brings a fantastic comical side the story; one that's funny and sad at the same time. His performance is fantastic as always and draws the viewer into the character. The film begins with a really odd shot: Scarlet Johansson's ass. I personally thought it was delightful and its quite a nice surprises for the beginning of the film. All throughout the film, we see really nice shots of Tokyo and its landscape and the people. The language barrier that the characters of the story feel can be felt and seen by the viewers as well, so it gives that since of reality that we're really submerged in Tokyo's environment with the other characters. SJ's character is newly married and has moved to Tokyo with her husband who is a photographer. The issue here is that her husband is a work- orientated person. Therefore SJ is feeling lonely in a city where she does not know anybody and has trouble communicating because of the language barrier. BM's character is a famous Hollywood actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey Ad and get paid 2 Million dollars. But with all his fame and money, he still seems stuck and bored. It's an enjoyment to watch these two people find each other and start to connect and build a relationship. You better agree that it's an enjoyment, because that is pretty much all that happens in the film. The movie has a slow pace and all we get to see is this two people building a relationship. You might think to yourself: 'that's the most boring plot ever created' and you could be right, but I personally found a delight to watch and I can honestly say this is the one and only romantic movie that I truly enjoyed. Fantastic directing combined with fantastic directing gives you a 5 star film.",9,1,1,25 February 2014
Thor," THOR, maybe the Best Superhero in the last Decade
","I Live in the UAE so luckily I was able to watch this on the world Premier and I will have to say, it was Fantastic.I wasn't quite sure its going to be THAT good,but it lived up to my (and everyone else in the theater) expectations.The 3D wasn't anything Special. I mean i have seen much better 3D films that were able to beat this easily.The Acting By Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins was fantastically Beautiful. But on the other hand i didn't see anything special from Natalie Portman, who is by the way my favorite actress.A very nice element in this movie was the Humor ( which i Did Not see it coming). there are a few funny lines that made everyone laugh, which is a good thing because you don't expect it. at least i didn'tAnother strong point in this film is the directing by Kenneth Branagh. I believe this is his first Movie of this type. but he really nailed it. Over all, if you want to be entertained by one of the best Superhero movies in the recent years, head to the Nearest Cinemas and watch it. I assure you will not be disappointed.Rating 7/10",7,4,9,1 May 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Reality and Fiction; a little bit of both.
","I've been waiting for this film since Bin Laden was killed on May 1st,2011 and it was only a matter of time before it was ready.Let me give you a quick advice. If you're a fan of Kathryn Bigelow's work, you will most likely love this film. if not then there is a very big chance you wont.Kathryn Bigelow took on a big challenge. making a film about a story like this takes great effort. but in my opinion she was able to pull it off. she managed to show the events that lead to the killing of Osama Bin Laden in most natural way. there are many scenes of integration and torture which is what really happened but she did not shy away from that for the sake of politics.The best and the worst thing about the film is the take down scene. its the best mostly because of how the house was made. and the location. it is perfect. very similar to the real place. the worst aspect of the scene, is its slowness. you don't feel the importance of the mission. it just feels like another random take down.of course we cannot omit the performance of Jessica Chastain which earned her another Oscar nomination. although she was very good in her role, I don't believe it was as good as a Oscar nomination. there was times during the film that she just seemed...dull. you should head into watching this movie without any political bias. just watching for the sake of the story. not who really was behind 9/11 and all those sorts of story that's circling in the media. Overall, good movie. but that's all it is. a moviePS: James Gandolfini's role as Leon Panetta ( Director of CIA) was really good. looked just like him.",8,6,14,17 January 2013
X-Men: First Class," Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic
","This Movie is without a doubt THE BEST X-men and THE BEST prequel EVER made!!! and i ma not just making it up as a X-men fan, every thing about this movie was perfect. The acting By James McAvoy nailed his role as Xavier. And i also believe that Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic and beautiful.oh and Kevin Bacon... what can you say for Kevin Bacon?? The man was outstanding in his role.Until now i really wasn't a fan of Superhero films, but this really changed my mind.One thing that i wasn't so sure of , was the absence of Logan OR Wolverine. But 10 Mins into the film i totally forgot about him. and Again, the best prequel or possibly the best superhero film so farRating : 10 /10 for sure !!!!",10,6,12,2 June 2011
Fast Five," Maybe Too Fast !!
","Fast Five was exactly what I expected. Fast, lots of action and car chases.At some point events made no sense to me. and i think maybe the reason for that is the the new characters have no depth to them.But on the other hand if you are a fan of big car chases and explosions, you could have a lot of fun watching this.The acting was pretty good. Van diesel was my favorite as always. If watch the trailer you will see that its pretty much the same thing in the movie. i mean all of the important scenes are in the tailer.But this film is the best out of all of them. And it could be the best action film of the year.Oh, and if you are going to watch it, make sure that you watch the clip after the Credits !!!",8,0,3,7 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers: Lots of loose ends.
","First of all , you have to watch this film in 3D, and try to get to IMAX. THE best 3D so far, without a doubt. it was the best on IMAX as well, so if your looking for an entertaining film, this is for you !Now, we get to the important part, Getting rid of Megan fox: big mistake. I think everyone would agree with me, this was one of the items that made the film interesting,you take that away you loose big points.You look at this film , with this big cast like John Malkovich and Patrick Dempsey and you think that this could be something,but you can be wrong.The story and the characters, especially the new ones, are so shallow and simple that you cant get your head around it.plus lots of loose ends at the end, so much that i lost count during the film. not to mention too many new robots that you that you cant tell which is which !!! the only reason that you see an eight at the end of this 'review' is only and only because of the 3D, especially IMAX.Overall : 8/10",8,0,5,30 June 2011
The Social Network," Very Interesting.
","I don't think i have ever had this much fun , watching a Bio movie, it usually annoying and slow. you really cant believe how much you can learn from this film, before i watched it ( and i know i'm bit late) i always thought, well how good can it be ??? its about the guy who invented Facebook, so what?? But when i was forced by my girlfriend to watch this , i realized that how much i didn't know! and not just about Facebook, but also about how hackers work,or how companies and investors are only trying to rob you off !! By the time you get to the middle of the film, and that's when Justin Timberlake shows up, you get the real question : what is the right thing? and who do you trust? these questions might seem easy to answer at first,but don't be so sure...think again.The lines and the script in the movie is flawless and perfect, Aaron Sorkin did a amazing job and the Oscar is the least that he can get. This was David Fincher's best film since fight club ...i can even say better then that. the way that the camera moves, the attention to detail and pretty much every thing is perfect. Now we come to my favorite part : the acting. I have to be honest i'm not a huge fan of Jesse Eisenberg, i never was , but i really really have to give him a huge credit for this film, he was fantastic truly. pretty much all of the cast did a great job. Justin Timberlake did a great job playing a jerk. One thing that really did it for me was the Score and music, great choice of music , mixed with the talent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is one of the strong points of the film which really brings out the story , so good job to them. So to my personal believe , a near-perfect film. If you are a Facebook fan there is no doubt that you are gonna love it and if your not...well, you can learn a few things about how the world works. Over all : 9/10",8,0,0,27 June 2011
