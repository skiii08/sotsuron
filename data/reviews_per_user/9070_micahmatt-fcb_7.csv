Iron Man 3," Could have been way, way better, but was not thanks to Disney
","Iron Man 3. It should have been the final chapter - the big one - the one that makes people say 'wow, that was a satisfying series!' To be honest, this movie was like a mini-movie. It didn't feel like an Iron Man movie. There was no climax. This movie could have been the second film, but it wasn't a good conclusion to the hero we've come to know and love. Tony Stark is a fantastic character, but he didn't get his deserved justice in this final film.Let me elaborate. The characters in this movie strayed away from the realism in the first two movies. Now yes, the first two movies were comic book material. But at least all the things that happened in the movie were scientifically or simply realistically possible. The third got into superpowers. Iron Man isn't really a superhero. He's a man in a suit, much like Batman. As soon as Disney mixed all the heroes together in The Avengers, it was free license to do whatever the heck they wanted to. They no longer had to adhere to realism - something that hurt the films ultimately. But this is not the main point.My primary gripe with the movie is that the Mandarin was nothing like his comic book counterpart. The Mandarin was an epic character with charisma. He was dangerous and powerful. He could have been done well. But instead they ruined it by making Ben Kingsley play a fall guy. A cheesy mandarin double that would fit well into an Austin Powers movie. In fact, the portrayal of the flabbergasted actor revealed in the film felt like Sacha Baron Cohen's character, Aladeen in 'The Dictator'. Guy Pearce is a great actor. He is one of my absolute favorites. But Disney's portrayal of the Mandarin was not true to the comics. Come on, it's not like the realism thing was present anyway. They already had Tony Stark fight aliens from another dimension when they mixed Thor into it. So why couldn't the Mandarin be the same character as in the comic books? The Marvel universe is already becoming cheesy. Why not go full out and present the characters as they were written?Iron Man 3 could have been done better. They should have stayed on track with the Iron Man saga. But the movie felt like 'The Avengers - Iron Man', a spin off of the Avengers. This is not the way to go. I don't blame Marvel. I blame Disney.",3,2,5,17 June 2013
Suicide Squad," All that hype for such little delivery
","Suicide Squad was advertised as being the next big DC film. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. The editing was jarring, the music choices were inappropriate for the scenes (and it also was just playing back some of the most overplayed classic rock songs you hear every day on the radio), the acting was poor aside from Margot Robbie, and really the whole picture just felt like it was shot on a studio lot as a low budget movie. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in every area. Batman gets about 1 minute of screen time and Joker gets maybe 5. The trailers really misrepresented what the film was going to be and leaves you wishing you had spent your money on something else. For those who didn't like Batman vs. Superman, this movie is far worse. It's down there next to 'Batman and Robin'... you know, the one with Mr. Freeze and all the horrible puns?",2,3,6,15 August 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Disney fails again.
","Captain America was never a really interesting superhero, but Marvel went all out in pushing boredom. Marvel seemed to care so much about the boring stuff, they forgot that it was a comic book movie. They forgot about the flare of superheroes. If you want to see all the action in this movie, watch the trailer. The entire montage you see in the trailer is the only action in the movie, scene for scene. It was simply one of the most boring movies I have ever witnessed and is on par with the Pearl Harbor movie starring Ben Affleck. The only difference was the main character wore tights and had a fruity-looking shield. If you like this movie simply because it has 'America' in the title, your argument is invalid. No amount of pushing patriotism will make this movie good. It's like trying to argue that a brick is tasty because it is red like an apple. Marvel should have never sold out to Disney.",3,1,1,17 June 2013
Man of Steel," Don't believe the nasty critics.
","So far, Rotten Tomatoes with all of its 'Acclaimed Critics' is wrong. This is a very very good movie. It deserves way better than a 57% (which is where it currently stands on that site). The user reviews on the site still show that the average movie goer rated it basically the same as on IMDb. Go see this movie. It is by far the best Superman film there is. The prude critics can just wallow in their negativity for all I care.The plot was excellent. The origin story was small, which is great. Everyone already knows the back story. We don't need to see it done again and again and again and... The villain earns respect from the very first scene. All of the actors did a spectacular job. The costumes were top notch. The only thing negative I have to say is that the action was happening so fast at some points, you couldn't be sure what you were looking at. Some scenes were zoomed in to the action so close, it was just a blur on the screen. But that's my only complaint. Worth seeing, worth buying. Do it.",10,1,4,15 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," THANK YOU, DISNEY!
","Star Wars was my entire childhood. When the prequels came out, I thought they were wonderful, regardless their flaws. I was also hugely disappointed when George Lucas said that he wasn't going to do any more films after Revenge of the Sith, arguably one of the best Star Wars movies.The year is 2017, and The Last Jedi, the third Disney installment of Star Wars. I have to say that this movie is just as good as Empire Strikes Back. The film takes time to build up to the final act. It's a movie that respects the fans and brings a whole new perspective to the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. YES it has its problems, but at no point in the film did those problems take me out of the movie. I just remember that it's made by flawed people who are trying to make a great movie. I would say that they succeeded. If you love Star Wars, you'll probably like this movie a great deal. It's very different from all of the other Star Wars movies. It's an emotional roller-coaster that doesn't stop until the credits roll. GO SEE IT!",8,0,3,17 December 2017
Rio," Not great. Not good. Bad? Maybe!
","I love animated movies. But when I went to see this, I was really disappointed. It wasn't a well put together movie. The voice acting was just OK, and the story left much to be desired. I found myself asking the question, 'Why does this movie exist?' It's your cookie cutter, every day ordinary poorly done movie. The art was good yes. But the story was greatly lacking. The characters were shallow and it just felt like an opportunity to use big name actors for a quick money grab. Not a good movie. It's the kind of movie that you would expect to be playing on a small TV on low volume in the back of a doctor's office waiting room. I'm surprised they are going to make a second one.",4,1,1,20 February 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," One of the best superhero films ever put on screen.
","I saw Batman v Superman finally. I absolutely loved it. I even loved Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, which I didn't expect. He put a totally new spin on the character and it was amazing - pulling every string with cunning precision. Ben Affleck is officially the most bad-ass Batman to ever be on screen, even better than Keaton. I couldn't believe a movie with so many explosions could have such a well developed story and character depth. I for one loved this movie. The only complaint I have is that there were sometimes so many special effects on screen near the end, that I couldn't tell what was going on. Other than that, great movie. I give it a 9/10.",9,4,9,22 April 2016
