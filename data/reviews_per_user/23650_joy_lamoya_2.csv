Black Swan," Don't push it!
","You can love or hate Black Swan, but certainly it won't be just another movie. I have to give that to the director, who tries hard (REALLY hard) to show a very sick girl in some sort of beautiful light.Personally, I found the movie too self-aware and pretentious, pushing the buttons of this unstable main character (Nina, played by Portman) in such an obvious way that it's almost annoying. Sure, a huge amount of pseudo-intellectual viewers are going to find it genius, but in the end, Aronosfky just directed a very elegant version of Saw.Nina was sick to begin with, pressure didn't crack her at all. We don't have a story; we have a train wreck. Portman did an awesome job like most of the cast of the movie, but the plots urge of being a masterpiece just ruined it from the beginning. The movie shouts out loud 'I'm cooler than you and you should praise me for that'. I'm not sure if it is the script or the directing, but someone is trying just too hard.Photography was beautiful in a green-ish kind of way. It's cold and uncomfortable in the beginning, but it gives a nice atmosphere for the concept. The screen just lightens up when Kunis (playing Lily, Nina's fellow dancer) appears: She's just a breath of fresh air in a suffocating movie. I'm guessing that that's the idea, but you know, not even a great performances can save a film that lacks humbleness.",4,1,2,17 June 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Get ready to crack in a enjoyable bloodfest
","Slather films don't really care about the reason of murders just for the sake of gore. This film does the exact same thing in the most hilarious way: A bunch of teens are dying in the woods for just no reason at all, and Tucker and Dale (the sweet and utterly confused main characters, played by Labine and Tudyk) are just freaked about how sick it is.My absolute favorite character was Jesse Moss' Chad, whose sanity and logical thinking went for a walk in the forest and never came back. You see this guy just loosing it, running through the woods with an axe and you can't help but to compare him to a non-French Beauty and the Beast's Gaston. I hadn't heard of Labine before, but he had me the second he tried to pick up Allison in the gas station, like a giant teddy bear. I always love how Tudyk delivers just the amount of acting you need to know he's just plain awesome. Together, they were brilliant.It just looks bad, the FX are not ever there and still is genius. You can't help to laugh out loud! Just plain and bloody funny, with emphasis in bloody.",8,1,2,17 June 2011
