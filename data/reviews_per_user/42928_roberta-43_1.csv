Marie Antoinette," A Political Foray. LA Press Screening.
","It can be said that it is more a film regarding epitomes of music, fashion and other style trends, all notable and great for the teen demographic and tasteful indulgences, however, I saw strong undercurrents of direct political prevalence, (esp. in regards to our state of current affairs in this country). Which makes this little film a great cocktail for the young and fashionable in America.I would sum it up as a portent composure, a delectable bon-bon, in which we see the suddenness with which the peoples' ridicule of the excessively wealthy can abruptly actualize itself upon them as an effective death-wish. The phrase 'Let then eat cake.' may, or may never have been uttered by Marie Antionette, but it is no less prevalent than her innocence (or ignorance. your choice phrasing in dialect), affirmed when she was quoted as saying on the scaffold after accidentally stepping on her executioners foot, 'Pardon me sir, I did not mean to do it.' Tragic indeed, was her mindless excess in the face of her starving compatriots, a quality that was so fostered by the position she was born into that she wasn't even aware of it, but all the more so...shouldn't some one have tapped her on the shoulder at some point in her life of excessive binges? Prior to the tug of the guillotines release, one would think even her executioner, looking down upon Maries powdered neck, and especially after hearing those epic last words, would question what it was all for. After all, that same neck was at that turning point, a bicameral region to be symbolically dissolved, and where, a thin line was to be drawn upon to affirm the rights and reasoning of the impending eminent, democratic decision makers of the following era. It's destruction commanded, her delicate neck was no less a symbolic icon, in the motion and gesticulation of it's speech, than it was when it held the delicate mind of a 38 year old child queen. On the scaffold it was still a prop in a show for the people.A story to be paralleled as a heed our own as Americans, as we are so consumed with petty grievances of our upper-class, that we neglect the more eminent discussions which should be held in direct regard to our own frivolous behaviors and habits consuming valuable limited resources, ... lest we be discarded as a lesson to a more promising, more prevalent, and less compromised global youth.",Null,3,8,30 September 2006
