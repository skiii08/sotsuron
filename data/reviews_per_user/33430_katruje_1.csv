Requiem for a Dream," Remake of Reefer Madness
","No spoilers here.I haven't seen this movie in awhile, but I remember that it was well done. That is, technically, the film is well made.However, watching this movie makes me think of the old 50's propaganda movie Reefer Madness. This one is updated and more graphic. The story-lines are impossibly gruesome, as if drug use can ONLY end in the absolute worst outcome possible. It seems as if the director never had any experience with drugs or drug users, and based the story on what was presented to him by his high-school health teacher.I just can't take this film too seriously given the way it deals with the subject matter, which is entirely amateurish (or government sponsored?).Also, I posted this because I feel the movie is given far too much credit. It's not a bad movie, but there are so many BETTER movies out there....",4,1,3,19 October 2006
