United 93," Fiction story
",this is a great movie when you think for once this is not a movie base on a true story. The real events is far more different then the reality. I m very sorry for those who lost theirs relatives and friends but one day you will know the real story of this tragic disaster. Same things for the others planes and the world trade center. Too bad that those actors and actresses doesn t even know what is happening in their own country. If i was the producer or one of the actors in this movie i would certainly send all the money i earned doing this movie to the ones who have to suffer for the rest of their lives. I am saying that statement for you to open your eyes and please stop believing everything you hear and see on television.,8,2,5,6 September 2006
