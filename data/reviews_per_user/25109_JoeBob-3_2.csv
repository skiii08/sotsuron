The Blair Witch Project," Uneventful movie experience
","Waited with deep anticipation to see the Blair Witch Project.  How disappointed I was when I finally saw it.  It is not terrifying at all.  I was literally waiting for the terror and there was none.  I found the movement of the camera distracting and the long bouts for darkness dull. Wish I could say I loved this movie, but, I can't.",2,0,2,31 July 1999
The Green Mile," Movie of the Year
","Once again, Tom Hanks has made the movie of the year.  This time he is part of a great ensemble cast.  Can't wait for his next film... he's really on a roll.  Great story, great cast, thoughtful, intelligent, adult movie.",10,0,0,10 December 1999
