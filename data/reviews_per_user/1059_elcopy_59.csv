The Blair Witch Project," The overrated witch project
","Seriously folks: Other than the clever idea of making this film look like a documentary, Blair Witch's story is as amateurish as the camera work. We spend a lot of time seeing the story building for the final moment when the filmmakers dissapear. When that moment finally arrives, it's just too vague to come to any conclusions or interpretations.If you're the kind of person who doesn't scare very easily of the dark and weird noises, you'll find Blair Witch interesting, but not quite the stuff that makes you lose your sleep. The only thing I found scary about the movie was its publicity. Avoid the hype (if you can), if you want a better experience.",3,1,4,19 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An embarrassment
","Finally Lucas' juggernaut arrived, and after seeing it, boy do I want those couple of hours of my life back.I still don't understand how this film didn't get a G rating (maybe because of the trade dispute plot was a bit 'mature' for kids?). With a few exceptions, everything in the movie is just plain dull. I found it difficult to stay awake through the whole thing.Almost all the great reviews you read for 'Menace' are from people brainwashed by the marketing (you'll see most of them will defend it with the same 'this is part 1 of 6' argument). Since I don't trust the level of intelligence of these people (hey, you don't have to trust mine either), the review I'd really love to see is Kevin Smith's: a genuine fan of the series who's also a great director (Clerks, Chasing Amy). Kevin: If you read this, send me a note.Anyway, who cares? This movie will still make more money than god, no matter what people think about it, and that was its purpose in the first place.",1,18,36,13 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Relax. It's only a movie.
","Lucas is getting old. And so is his imagination. The Phantom Menace is not a terrible movie. It isn't even a bad one. The problem is: it's a Star Wars movie. Which means it has to stand next to classics like the original Star Wars (10/10, my score), The Empire Strikes Back (10/10), and The Return of the Jedi (8/10). And there's where it fails.The cutesy factor -which almost ruined Return of the Jedi- was a sign of things to come. Boy, is this movie cute. From the ready-for-action-figure Gungans characters, to the stupid Federation droids (which look like something between a duck and Calista Flockhart), to the future Darth Vader, known now as Macaulay Skywalker, or something like that. The result is a kiddie movie, which, would've been okay, if the original Star Wars series were kiddie films in the first place.On the other side, the film visuals are astonishing. There is no doubt this will end up as the best especial effects film of the 20th Century. Unsurprisingly, the John William's soundtrack is also worth the ticket price alone. Pity the plot isn't as state of the art as the rest of the film. Just compare Phantom Menacescenes with similar scenes from the original series (and believe me, they are many), and you'll see how superior the previous ones were. Another sign thatbigger doesn't always mean better.But, hey: It's Star Wars, and therefore you MUST see it, right? Lucas deserves to light his cigars with thousand dollar bills! And I'm evil because I say phantom menace is only a flick. How dare I to say such terrible things? How can I be so ignorant? Well, it's just my opinion",1,2,5,24 May 1999
Catch Me If You Can," Catchy!
","So what in the world made Spielberg chose this topic for a film is beyond me. Just while watching it I realized I was actually having fun. This movie isdefinitively a crowd pleaser which should score Spielberg and the stars in it some deserved box office dough.Every critic in the site may talk about Hanks, DiCaprio or Walken, but the real great performance in this movie came from no other than John Williams, whoproduced his best movie score in more than 20 years. Catch Me if You Can'stheme is a fun, jazzy tune that is worthy of other tunes of the era this movie takes place, like Peter Gunn and the Pink Panter. It's been a long, long time I saw people walking out of a theater humming the main music piece of a movie. Ideclare John Williams the comeback of the year.Spielberg is a great story teller. This movie makes up for his mediocre, butvisually stunning Minority Report, Hank's overly soggy Road to Perdition andDiCaprio's messy and self-indulgent Gangs of New York.",8,1,1,29 December 2002
Shakespeare in Love," In love with Shakespeare.
","Not really the best movie of 1998, but a very well done crowd-pleasing romantic comedy.The performances are nothing to rave about, but they're nice, if not adequate. The story about William Shakespeare suffering of writer's block and overcoming it after finding a muse eliminates the overall dullness most associate with period pieces, and is a fresh, more human look at the inmortal writer.The overall result is a satisfying film that'll make you feel good about going to the movie",3,1,4,5 April 1999
Dawn of the Dead," So good, it's scary
","I saw the original 'Dawn of the Dead' many years ago. The only thing I could remember was that it was a George Romero movie set in a mall in the Midwest and it was the original post- apocalyptic zombie movie which inspired movies like '28 Days Later' and videogames like 'Resident Evil 2.'Even though most remakes I've seen have been horrible, with a few exceptions ('The Birdcage', 'Ocean's 11') I decided to give this a try to refresh my memory. And boy, this movie is good.The original 'Dawn of the Dead' was smarter, but this one succeeds gloriously in other ways the original didn't.Spoilers: The first scene of the chaos is incredible, the scene of the pregnant woman giving birth is a zillion times scarier than the original, and the diseased fat lady who looks like was taken out from a scene from the movie 'Seven' is the scariest thing I've seen in a movie in years. The chainsaw scene -a horror movie staple- is done here flawlessly.Add the tons of gore, a cool soundtrack and a great idea to begin with, and you have one of the coolest, scariest movies ever. This is how a remake should be done. Don't miss.",9,0,2,1 April 2004
Hostel," Perfect Horror Movie
","There are scary movies and there are horror movies. Hostel is the later. What do I mean by horror? A movie that makes you flinch, that's uncomfortable to watch and stays with you long after you see it. The movie starts like the garden-variety scary movie in the vein of 'Scream' and 80s slasher flicks, but by the last half it becomes pure unadulterated horror. The director did a pretty good job taking us from the cheesiness to the terrible cruelty you experience later to its unrealistic, but satisfying Hollywood ending. Many people will say the Hollywood clich√©s will ruin what could have been a classic, but I think when the subject is so disturbing you need a little movie magic to lighten up things. When the movie ended, the most horrible thing I think I experienced was not watching helpless, trapped people being tortured like if they were in the deepest stage of hell, it was thinking these things are happening somewhere in the world right now. Not in Slovakia, where this movie does what Borat did for Kazakhstan, but in places like China, Iran and Cuba (where Americans are likely doing it too). There are some parallels between sex and violence in the movie, but it's easy to forget if you only want to watch it as face value. There are too many clever things done for those who want to read between the lines. One last praise, I think it was pretty clever not to subtitle any foreign language. It adds to the experience, which in the end is to make you uncomfortable in all levels possible.",9,2,4,20 August 2007
The Notebook," Chick Flick Alert!
","Remember 'Titanic'? A syrupy love story on a doomed ship which turned out to become the most successful movie of all time? (it won a pile of awards and made a yet unbelievable amount of money). Well, take away the doomed ship, and the cool visual effects, amp up the syrup and what do you get? 'The Notebook'!'The Notebook' is basically the same old poor-boy-meets-independent-rich-girl story. Like in 'Titanic' you see beautiful scenarios and an epic love story. It works because you actually care for the characters. You may even feel inspired after seeing it. But like in the ship movie I just mentioned before, days later you scratch your head and realize it was the corniest thing you've ever watched and the performances were unintentionally funny.Men: Don't watch it with your girlfriend on Valentine's Day. It's just asking for trouble.",6,4,12,5 August 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A 30 minute episode stretched too long
","Yeah, it's hilarious, yeah the kick a**. Yeah, you can see even better storylines of South Park for the price of basic cable or a movie rental.When I went to the theatre I wasn't expecting the earth to move, and that's maybe what everybody else is doing. Yet, it's still not a good reason to pay for this. Basically the movie is the standard South Park cartoon with some filler in it (like the singing per instance). During the final minutes the laughs are more scarce which proves my point. The 'F-Word' jokes are funny the first 3 million times, but then they become annoying. Add up a very tasteless sexual relationship between Saddam Hussein and Satan, and you got yourself a cartoon that is better worth waiting for it to come on video.",5,0,2,12 July 1999
Coffee and Cigarettes," Bad habits, worse conversation
","At its best 'Coffee and Cigarettes' is a fun premise, with a constellation of stars with hip characters in hip locations. At its worse 'Coffee and Cigarettes' is the worst improv you're going to see this side of amateur drama school.Despite good stories by two old working class men and mafiosi, and great performances by a wide range of actors, comedians, rappers and rock stars, you'll be bored to tears with at least three-quarters of the whole movie. Some guidance by the director wouldn't have hurt. At least the most boring stories aren't that long.This is a hipster film that had the potential of becoming a pop culture phenomenon. See it if just for thinking of all the possibilities that were missed.",3,8,17,21 June 2004
X-Men," A mutant of a superhero movie.
","Why people are so glad the X Men movie didn't screw up?Because there was so much room to screw up. Thankfullythe screenwriters and the director avoided it.X Men used to be my favorite comic book when I was a kid.Then Marvel Comics started milking the franchise, comingup with a new mutant comic every couple of months or so.By the last time I read it, there were so many mutantsscattered in so many different titles, I lost count, and myinterest in them.So, as almost everyone else, I was a skeptic when the reelstarted. My skepticism didn't last long. The movie deliveredto both readers and non-readers. I was impressed the character development -with the exception of Cyclops andStorm- and the action were so well balanced. There was areal good story brewing beneath it all.  Seeing how thesepeople are feared and rejected because of who they are, ismaterial enough to leave us thinking how is this happeningin reality. But the thinking was left behind for summerthrills. This movie had a lot of unexplored potential, but thenagain, it had a lot of chances of being just a silly fanboyflick. Bring on the Sequel! (And let's hope Cyclops has alittle more time for his character to develop).",9,0,0,15 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A sign of things to come
","The Return of the Jedi is the movie that shows the first signs that Lucas' creative well was starting to dry as the merchandising finally corrupted the Star Wars universe.The movie starts promising with the rescue of Han Solo from his nemesis Jabba the Hut. After this, everything plotwise goes downhill. It seems that they really wanted to end this thing, but didn't know how. They didn't know how to fit Yoda into the storyline, so they kill him (He seemed perfectly healthy to me and all of a sudden, he's dead). They didn't know what new evil could the Empire come up with, so they throw us a recycled, uncomplete, Dead Star to blow up again. And finally, the hated teddy bear like Ewoks whose only purpose in the movie is to sell more toys. Darth Vader's redemption was too nice, too easy, too fast. Fortunately some very exciting action sequences (like the 'bike' chase scene) save the film from being a cutefest.16 years later, George Lucas releases his god-awful Episode 1 The Phantom Menace which resembles more the shallowness of this film than the good points.Jedi is still a great movie, but unlike the previous two, can't stand on its own.",7,0,1,13 June 1999
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Ingenious, thrilling, action packed
","An old-school espionage thriller hiding in a superhero movie. The casting of Three Days of the Condor star Robert Redford, is no coincidence. Imagine a superhero from the era when everything was black and white, good was good, evil was evil. Alas, he is now living in a time when things are not as clear, and he becomes more paranoid as the list of people he can trust starts to shrink.It took me several years for me to review this movie to see if it was going to age as well as I thought, and it has aged even better. The elevator scene that had me at the edge of my seat in a movie theater in 2014, is now iconic. I expect this movie to be referenced in the future the same way we now reference classics like Die Hard.",10,0,3,3 June 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Ingenious, thrilling, action packed
","An old-school espionage thriller hiding in a superhero movie. The casting of Three Days of the Condor star Robert Redford, is no coincidence. It took me several years for me to review this movie to see if it was going to age as well as I thought, and it has aged even better. The first movie established a hero of the past, idealistic, where the lines of good vs evil were clearly defined. This movie sets the hero in a present where those lines blur, and the more you find out, the less you can trust the motives of the people surrounding you. Captain America is indeed, living in a time where the forces his generation fought in Europe and the Pacific are now controlling the highest levels of power, openly and in secret.The elevator scene that had me at the edge of my seat in a movie theater in 2014, is now iconic.

Full Metal Jacket," Two movies for the price of one!
","I remember when I saw this movie so many times I knew every line by heart.Every single scene became memorable. Even the Vietnamese prostitute scene,made later popular in the 2 Live Crew song.Before Saving Private Ryan this used to be my favorite war film ever. Now ranks #2. Each half of the film is like a complete different movie. You can watch the first half, turn off the tape, and get already an all time classic. The second half unfortunately lacks of private Pyle and the drill sergeant which are the best performances. However, as many Kubrick's films, this one has survivedgracefully the test of time.",9,0,0,16 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," What a Pile of Dooku
","I had to wait a couple of weeks until all the fanboys entered theircomments and actually see some rational ones from averagemoviegoers like myself.My two cents is that the movie is entertaining. In its genre is morecomparable to box office flop Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within thanto the so mentioned original Star Wars Trilogy.Special FX: The digital actors in the film failed miserably to replacepuppets and guys in costumes we've seen in other sci-fi films. Themix of real actors and digital actors made the movie look like aglorified 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', rather than the realisticeffect they wanted to achieve. That distracted me too much fromreally enjoying the film as it was meant to.The Story: A surprisingly boring plot kept me from enjoying thereally well crafted action scenes. Some scenes didn't ad anythingto the plot.The acting: I praise the actors for at least making the effort to uttersuch terrible lines with a straight face. The dialog is anembarrassment. Specially those written to push forward thenon-convincing love story. I've seen B movies, soap operas,ambulance chaser's commercials and even porn films with betterdialog than some seen in this movie.In all, there are so many better films out there that will never get thehype of this franchise that you won't see. Still, it's not a waste oftime. Most fans say it's better than Episode One: The PhantomMenace. Then again, that terrible movie is not a hard act to follow.",2,7,13,10 June 2002
Fargo," Yah go girl
","Movies like these come once in a blue moon. Since I can't see a single flaw in Fargo, I'm safe saying this movie is perfect.The performances, the story, the scenarios, the characters, are so believable, absurd and unpredictable you'll swear this movie is real life (the movie claims is based on a true story). Every second in Fargo is a highlight. The cruel Midwestern winters and its people are portrayed so accurately it's scary.Definitively a must see. Movies can't get better than this. Bravo!",10,0,0,17 April 1999
Fargo," Flawless
","Fargo is one of the best films of the 90's.  For me, one of the top three of the decade. Most of the actors in the movie gave the best performances of their careers here (including Buscemi and Macy) and the Coen brothers, who could have their place in history justwith Raising Arizona (surprisingly not in the IMDB top 250 at the time of this writing) have here their best film ever.I do not recommend this movie to everyone though, because most people won't get the absurdity of some situations, the very noir comedy or the violence. What I loved about this film is how absurd and unpredictable it gets as the story progresses. It all escalates to a messy, violent climax, that somehow is damn funny.Whoever gave The English Patient awards for best film of 1996 instead of this one is an idiot. I can understand why not everyone liked this film, but still, it was the best that year.",10,0,0,20 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," More praise (like if it needs any)
","I thought no movie on earth would live up to the hype this moviehad. Fortunately I was wrong. It was awesome. I'm in my late 20'snow and this is the first film that reminded me of early work fromSpielberg and Lucas. I felt like a kid again, and it's been a longwhile I had so much fun at the movies. The shortest 3-hour movieever made. I never wanted it to end. I wanted to be forever stuck inMiddle Earth. I'm going to be the first in line when the Two Towerscome out.

American Beauty," Award-savvy film
","American Beauty: Dramedy about a man living through a mid-life crisis, whose infatuation with a teenage girl serves him as a wake up call to do something about his comfortable, but less than perfect life.After reading other IMDB user reviews, it was not surprising to find people already predicting award for this film months away even for nominations. Don't get me wrong: I loved American Beauty. But why the same type of award talk don't go to films like The Matrix or the 6th Sense? Simple: The Academy Awards gives priority to genres like period pieces, family dramas, and in another time, musicals, while ignoring genres like horror, action, science fiction and mystery, no matter how well crafted these films could be. Other than The French Connection and Silence of the Lambs, I don't remember Oscar leaving this pattern.American Beauty however, gets bold with scenes of masturbation, child corruption, drug use, adultery, child abuse &#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;and murder. I have no problem with this when the scenes are done as tastefully as in this film. My problem comes when a jewel like Kids gets grilled for its almost equal bold contempt, while Beauty is praised.Let's wake up and smell the roses audience.",4,1,3,30 September 1999
The Battle of Algiers," Dangerous if misinterpreted
","This film is a masterpiece. Its production value makes the film as compelling and believable as a newsreel. The storytelling is flawless.But it can give viewers the wrong impression that terrorism is an effective method of resistance. After all, the story ends with Algeria winning its independency. It can also give the impression that torture and brutality is an effective weapon against terrorism. It can be seen in the Middle East today that neither side wins in this type of war.This is a powerful portrayal of the birth of modern terrorism and it is perhaps more relevant today than it was  40 years ago.",9,2,5,22 February 2004
The Patriot," I liked it better when he was wearing a skirt.
","The problem with the Patriot is that patriotism is not whatdrives Gibson's character to war, but revenge against hisextremely, unnecessarily evil nemesis.The Revolutionary War is just an excuse to display a typicalgood Vs. evil match. The good guys are extremely good,family smooching people. Even politically correct with theirblack neighbors! (Oh my. Makes me forget it took the country they founded 200 years to get to that point!). Thebad guys are incredibly evil, family-less automatons. In conclusion: This movie has the historic equivalent of thewesterns where the cowboys were defending their lives against the evil murdering Indians. If there's one thing thatwill have your money's worth is the eye-popping battlescenes. See Braveheart: Another Mel Gibson movie with epic gory battles. There's far more patriotism in it than thisone, and will make you want to yell 'Freedom!'.",4,0,1,30 June 2000
Pearl Harbor," The script that'll live in infamy.
","Pearl Harbor may be victim of its own hype. The promotions thatbombarded the media as merciless as the Japanese attack,showed cheesy shots of children playing with planes that I sawbefore on the last 15 minutes of the movie Armageddon. My lowexpectations were met accordingly. Though the jaw-droppingrecreation of the attack of Pearl Harbor is worth the price of theticket alone, the movie was sandwiched with a story worthy of ascreenwriting 101 class. It all came down to money. To make thegamble they made with the budget less risky, they softened anddumbed down history, so the desirable audience of the samebraindead teens that make MTV so popular could watch it. Theblurry camera that was shamelessly used in scenes to mask thegore was laughably ridiculous. The acting was worthy of a TVmovie of the week, at least they kept a straight face saying theirgod-awful lines. The real life characters, not surprisingly, werebetter scripted than their fictional partners, what makes mewonder what'd happen if they based the whole story more in facts.Pearl Harbor would've been a great movie several years ago,before Saving Private Ryan raised the bar on war films. World WarII movies of decades past had the same cardboard stories andcharacters, but they were fine for their time. At least Michael Bayentertains us with the boomfest, and proves no other moviedirector blows up stuff better than him. The moral question is that ifthis real life tragedy should be made into a pop corn flick with lotsof explosions. If you want to see another World War II movie full ofpossibilities, but ruined with a cheesy love triangle, walk to the endof the hallway at the multiplex showing Pearl Harbor and catchEnemy at the Gates.",3,0,0,29 May 2001
Resident Evil," A videogame flick that doesn't stink.
","The fact that the movie is based on a videogame hurt the movie at the box office because it turns off mainstream audiences. But all the stinkers based on videogames, like Street Fighter and Super Mario Brother, or mediocre attempts like Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider, had a problem with the translation. Resident Evil in the other hand is a very cinematic videogame, which makes it a natural for a movie translation.Just to say that a couple of things from the videogame would have helped this be a much better movie. Unlike the videogame, the movie environment looks too clean and bright for the horror factor. If you've seen films like 'The Sixth Sense' you know than an eerie atmosphere makes the movie scarier tenfold. The camera anglesfor the videogame which makes a sense of uneasiness, are very scattered through the movie, and the techno soundtrack, though good in the action scenes, is annoying at some points.The combination of horror, science fiction, and action is not an easy task for any film, which is an effort worth of appreciation for this film. The plot is also interesting, and original though it borrows from other action and horror films.I hope somehow this movie makes up for the cool box office reception on video and by word of mouth. The R rating didn't help, but it was right for the story.",5,0,0,14 April 2002
Saving Private Ryan," The price of Salvation

Everything we fear about war is confirmed true in this movie. The question is, do you really want to experience war?Technically, the movie is flawless. The story about a platoon trying to retrieve the only surviving of four brothers in WWII France takes a second place behind the brutal battle scenes, some of the most impacting in the history of movies. Some scenes you won't be able to forget, maybe for the rest of your life. So be prepared. Do not pay attention to it's R rating. Ryan's an NC-17 a",10,0,0,7 April 1999
X-Men: The Last Stand," Singer's Mistake
","If -like me- you liked the first two X-Men movies, and lowered your expectations for this one because of Bryan Singer's departure, you're correct.Simply put, the director's switch was a bad move for both camps. I don't think Singer will add anything to Superman we haven't seen before and Brett Ratner can't keep up with the expectations set on the former two X-Men Movies.Didn't help the plot tried to grab more than it could chew on. Too many story lines and too little time to develop them all. Main characters die and lose their power without adding drama or urgency. Other characters are introduced without a backstory. The one that has some backstory (Angel) is almost a cameo. With this movie, one of my fears from the comic book came true: There were so many mutants at one point I lost track of them. But, Jackman and McKellen carry the movie as they did in the other two. Fortunately.Add also the poor decision of giving up more story development for bombast. This movie mainly goes for apocalyptic, and totally unrealistic fighting scenes between the good guys and the bad guys, as if trying to show off the big budget the movie had for special effects.Yet still, it manages to entertain, so it's not a lost case. The problem is, with Ratner the focus is on entertainment, when Singer focus is on delivering a message first. And that's the main difference between this X-Men movie and the other two.",7,12,25,29 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Towering
","If you expect to see the continuation of fantasy saga of Epic battles of Good Vs. Evil, a hero struggling against  the powers of darkness, decent not-woodenacting showing at least a bit of emotion, exotic and mysterious locations,Christopher Lee playing a memorable villain and at least one believable digital character... forget George Lucas and his miserable attempt to win back hiscrown in the field he once ruled. This is it. The Two Towers is an expectable of such overwhelming force, you'd shed a tear of pure joy as one of the (evil) movie characters did in one of the manymemorable scenes. I can't even decide which is my favorite. One thing which will keep this movie for being properly praised other thanannoying Tolkien geeks with its inaccuracies, is that it doesn't feel like acomplete movie. Its beginning looks as if you entered the theater five minutes after the movie started, and the ending doesn't have the chapter-closure felt in Fellowship. Yet movies can't get any better than this. From the scary scenes at the swaps to the heartbreaking love story between Aragorn and Arwen. Gollum is the first CGI character in a live action film I can say has a soul. This has to be one in my opinion, of the best movies ever made.",10,0,0,23 December 2002
Million Dollar Baby," A great movie I can't recommend
","This movie is a piece of work. Acting, direction, cinematography, pace, subject matter. Everything is just perfect. But I still hated it. Why? It's one of the most depressing movies ever made. If slitting your wrists ever crossed your mind, do not see this.Watching the final half is painful to the point of masochism. More so when Eastwood, Swank and Freeman deliver some of the best performances of their career. Clint Eastwood will be remembered for two things: As an actor, the ultimate tough guy. As a director, a man who learned the craft of storytelling with a mature, sophisticated style. ' Million Dollar Baby' and 'Mystic River' are his first one-two punch of great movies since 'Unforgiven' and 'A Perfect World'.",7,8,17,23 December 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Why bother?
","Unnecessary, redundant, pointless. I don't know what's the deal with Hollywood, but remakes aren't cutting it. Burton already has the equally mediocre and equally pointless 'Planet of the Apes' remake on his resume. This movie premieres in a summer where other 70s movies like 'The Bad News Bear' 'The Amityville Horror' and 'The Longest Yard' are being brought back for no reason other than Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas.Doesn't mean 'Charlie' is a total disaster. It has many things that are possibly better than 'Willie'. But, if you have seen both, you can imagine anyone asking this question: 'Why bother?'. Honestly, I was bored in the middle of the movie. I didn't leave the theater because I try to watch a complete film no matter what, but nothing could fix the feeling.I can tell Hollywood that I read, and there are plenty of good stories out there yet to be told. If they have the courage to go for the next original hit, instead of giving people the same old stuff because it is already proved successful, they'll see the audiences erode. I am one who has bowed not to see remakes anymore after the release of the (second!) remake of 'King Kong'.",3,1,4,24 July 2005
The Insider," Is it newsworthy? Maybe it was really news to us.
","Cigarettes are bad for you. Tobacco companies are evil. So what else is new?Don't we all know this? The big revelation about this movie is that bigcorporations hide behind their money and our legal system to do whatever they please. Something everybody already knew as well. Is the media controlled bycorporate interests? Just see TV programming, tailored to every advertiser'sneeds.That's why probably when this story really happened few people cared. It took Hollywood to spice it up a bit, and making it interesting. Great job by Michael Mann. Pacino and Crowe terrific as martyrs trying to expose a truth so obvious to us. An epic as Mann's former movie Heat, but in different ways. The bestthing about Insider, is that it makes you stop and think, what you alreadyknow, but never analyzed so closely.

The Graduate," With honors
","It's a comedy, a drama, a love story, a sex story, a story about youth > discovering the complex adult world, a story about taboos, about confusion and determination, about infidelity. It has at least one thing you can relate to personally. Yet the real genius of The Graduate has nothing to do with all of it.The genius of this movie is that every single scene hooks you up to the next. Each one leaves you wanting to know what follows. The watchability of this movie is timeless. Every single moment could easily be the highlight in any other film. No other movie I can remember has mastered this so well. Nichols never reached again this level of perfection. The dialogs are memorable, the silent scenes are even more. The soundtrack has survived the test of time. The only '60s' thing about this movie is that it dared to take risks.The Graduate is so different from anything ever done on film is hard to categorize. My favorite film of all time.",10,1,2,23 July 1999
Toy Story 2," New Batteries
","I'm so glad the Disney/Pixar team recovered the charm I thinkthey lost with A Bug's Life. Toy Story 2 should be re-named toToy Story Version 2.0 because it improves from the originalformula and brings new features. The Story is again a rescuemission, and the characters show they have matured from theoriginal (I advice you see it before this one, if you haven't),yet, they had to bring back the 'unmatured' version of BuzzLightyear for a while because he's so much funnier that way.I saw this movie at a digital projector screening in SanFrancisco, which improved tenfold the already amazing animation. And if that weren't all, the audience was treated with a long(very long) preview of Disney next digital wonder: Dinosaur. Forwhat I saw, it looks it can be the next big thing. I'm alreadyexcited. You can't get a better deal than that! Thanks Disney!",8,1,3,4 December 1999
Grindhouse," Great concept, dragged down by QT
","In Grindhouse Tarrantino and Rodriguez pair up to make some of the crazy camp that they served with From Dusk 'Til Dawn. Rodriguez's Planet Terror is an instant classic: gory, ridiculous and plenty of great moments. Tarrantino's Death Proof is simply boring, self-indulgent and drags down the whole Grindhouse with it. Any of the fake trailers pack a million times more entertainment than Death Proof (inexplicably, critics decided Death Proof was the best part). Rodriguez is finally capturing the lost opportunities he had in Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Sin City and looks like he's finally using the best of his talent. Tarrantino on the other hand, does a poorly-written dialog rehash of his other films interrupted briefly by some action sequences and the result is plain horrible. Too bad this happened, because the concept is great, the trailers are amazing (I'd love to see Machete if it ever gets done) and if the whole thing would've succeeded, we could be seeing a Grindhouse 2 directed by Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. Unfortunately Tarrantino's flop ruined it and Grindhouse bombed.",6,2,4,9 December 2007
National Treasure," When a ripoff turns out better than the original
","When a ripoff turns out better than the originalThere's no doubt that National Treasure is a ripoff of the Da Vinci Code, set in the United States instead of Europe. The strange thing is, the ripoff turned out a better movie. It has all the action, adventure, joy and fun Da Vinci Code failed to deliver. It's still far from being the best movie ever, but it's absolutely entertaining. Nicolas Cage beats Tom Hanks to a pulp.I think they would have made Da Vinci Code a SEQUEL to this movie. If you're a fan of Dan Brown's book, you'll enjoy this movie. Skip the awful Ron Howard adaptation and watch this instead.",6,0,2,27 August 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick seemed ready to pass the torch to new geniuses.
","Great storytelling. Poor casting judgment. That's how you can resume Kubrick's last masterpiece.Unlike film directors from the school of Lucas, Kubrick treats his audience as intelligent human beings. This is actually a filmmaker who wants you to think when watching his film and not just sit there like an idiot, killing time in a dark room for a couple of hours. He doesn't tell you everything that's going on in the story so you have to figure it out for yourself. Besides, the story is carried from the point of view of one person, and that person has to figure out things just like us.There are some flaws in the movie that stand out too much to be ignored.Especially in the casting. Tom Cruise, a mediocre actor who happens to work with wonderful people, is never believable as his character. Neither's Nicole Kidman by the way. A street hooker that looks like a model from Vogue Magazine disconnects you from a sense of reality, as well as the minorityless New York Streets. Fortunately this movie will survive the test of time and hopefully in the future the presence of Cruise won't be so distracting from the whole thing.The story, which is more teasing than sexual, and basically about a confused guy who ends up crashing into a party he wasn't invited. Some supposedly graphic scenes, that must be in the movie to deliver the story, are ruined with computer imaginery. Yet, none of these are enough reasons to discard this movie. A must see, even when is just short of satisfying.",6,1,2,19 July 1999

The Da Vinci Code," Ron Howard is not worthy of the Grail
","When I read the mega-bestseller, I visualized the movie version as a scavenger hunt in the vein of the Indiana Jones movies and its clones ('Romancing the Stone' and the like). Unfortunately, it turned out to be an uninspired, blah adaptation made by Ron Howard - perhaps the most overrated director in movie history.The whole movie seems to run on rails. The actors look like in a trance. Character development is a joke. The action sequences are snooze worthy. The slight hint of humor in the novel is completely gone.On the plus side, the script follows the story almost step by step. Book fans will appreciate this but it won't be enough to wake them up from this bore.My recommendation: Skip this movie and watch one of the many 'Da Vinci Uncoded' documentaries out there. They will give you more insight on the book's theories than this movie.If you want to see what could have been this movie, but with the fun added, watch the mildly entertaining 'National Treasure'.",1,0,2,26 May 2006
Titanic," It floats
","One thing about Titanic is for sure: Is the most successful film in the 20th century. It made a kazillion at the box office and picked a pile of Oscars and other awards. The Titanic craze grew to the point of making people sick of it (including myself).It's no surprise why a lot of people hate this film as much as the people who love it: The lack of chemistry of the DeCaprio and Winslet couple. The laughable acting of DeCaprio. And finally, the cliche and often ridiculous dialog (In certain part of the movie, the chip was in climax-sinking mode, people were dying like flies. The first thing our heroine occurred to say was 'This is where we first met!').Despite the movie's flaws Titanic manages to hit a nerve on us all. The experience is completely immersive and the film's last hour makes up for all the romance rubbish. It's no question it's a very well done movie and its worth every penny people paid to see it.",10,1,2,14 April 1999

It happens that when you tell achildren's story, you just don't only read the lines of the book like arobot. You act the lines, and give some life to it. What happens withthe storytelling here is that it's lifeless, flat, uninspired. Usuallywhat we see when making money is the only matter taken inconsideration for creating a movie. Columbus was clearly thewrong choice for directing the film. Potter has a great story, andpeople will enjoy it, though is quite forgettable entertainment.

A Beautiful Mind," How to make an Oscar winning movie...
","This movie should be the template for any idiot who wants to make an award winning movie. First pick up a book and make sure it's a biography. Nothing sounds more award worthy than the 'based on a true story' line. Now start with the clich√©s: The perfect award winning role for best actor is a mentally challenged person with a remarkable ability (Forrest Gump, Rain Man, Shine, etc.) add a martyr wife who supports the main character's eccentric view of the world (Pollock), make it look like a period thing, have some decent cinematography a proven director, then, start preparing yourspeech for Oscar night. That's it.I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind is boring, or silly. It's in fact a competent film that delivers. Problem is, it's not the best film of the 2001. That privilege falls under Memento, and possibly Amelie or Lord of the Rings depending of your taste. Unfortunately, there's a formula to win Oscars which these three films didn't follow.Good for them. Enjoy A Beautiful Mind. It's a good movie and at least it did the formula right.

War of the Worlds," Spielberg does with E.T.s what he did with sharks and dinos
","That means, menacing, scary creatures predating on people. This is a good thing since 'War of the Worlds' previous incarnations terrified its audiences. However, there are some stories that, even when fictional, have to have some logic. This is one of those stories, and some parts of the plot are absolutely illogical. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.This movie succeeds in achieving -what I imagine- exactly the effect expected from its original source, so that's a big point in its favor. The horror is real. It was a good thing to focus the story on survivors instead of generals and presidents because its seem from the audience's point of view. Those who expect a devastation worthy of a Roland Emmerich film are going to be disappointed, since most of the time the destruction is seen very subtly. There are several scenes coming from the book of 'Jurassic Park' and a couple from the book of 'Signs'.The things that don't work are things where logic fails just for the sake of moving the story forward. People react realistically in front of the menace 70% of the time. The final fate of the main characters is the worst syrupy studio crap in a science fiction movie since... 'A.I.' and almost ruined the whole movie.However, the things that work still outweigh the things that do not work. 'War of the Worlds' is one of the best science fiction movies in a while, and possibly one of the scariest,",4,2,6,29 June 2005
There Will Be Blood," Markets more than what it delivers
","Miramax proves they don't need the Weinsteins to market over-hyped, critic's darlings. We're talking about the studio that stole best picture Oscars in 1996 from Fargo and 1998 from Saving Private Ryan, and got nominations from movies that were okay but not great like Chocolat. I even think there were far better movies in 1999 than the Oscar winner, American Beauty, but you be the judge of that. This movie, if marketed normally, would've tanked in the box office. Here's how they do it: Show it to a handful of critics by year's end, who'll start the buzz and put it in top-ten lists. Premiere it in one or two art houses in New York and L.A., who are obviously going to be sold out because people wanting to see what all the fuzz is about. The thing goes in crecendo, the movie wins some nominations, premiere it in more theaters. Wins some Oscars, do a wide release. By then, the film is bad-word-of-mouth proof. As in 'Gangs of New York' Daniel Day Lewis' performance overpowers the film and turns it into a one-man show. Only his scenes with Paul Dano have some balance and are in fact the film's most entertaining exchanges. Not a bad film at all, just a bit overrated.",7,6,15,5 January 2008
Downfall," Good historical film
","I don't understand why many people criticized this film for portraying Hitler in a sympathetic manner. On the opposite, this film portrays Hitler as a lunatic, cruel, dangerous and stubborn. Some people surrounding him were portrayed the same. In the end, the only people you're sympathetic with are the millions who died thanks to the delusions of a mad man and the group who followed him.It's refreshing seeing a German film portraying the Nazis more realistically and not as the caricatures Hollywood got us used to seeing.",9,1,4,26 March 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," I consider it the best film of the 21st Century to date.
","A thousand years from now, when historians study the fall of the American empire, they will watch this tale of sex, drugs, money, power, corruption, greed... and will laugh their asses off. The movie is about indulging excess, and it's an indulging excess itself. I mean, a three-hour comedy? Are you kidding me? Who else can pull this off? This is a master, Martin Scorsese, at the top of his form. DiCaprio's impeccable comedic timing in this film cements him as one of the greatest actors of this generation (to me, comedy is far, far harder to do than drama. It's harder to make people laugh than you think). And don't get me wrong, this is a film of horrible people doing horrible things, and most people will be offended how this movie turns horrible things into laughs. That doesn't take away that it's a masterpiece.",10,4,13,6 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally Lucas abandons the Dark Side
","Let's face it: When 'Star Wars' first came out it was like nothing ever seen before. Decades after and with trilogies like 'The Matrix' and 'The Lord of the Rings' people has lost that sense of discovering an adventure out of this world. So how do we make up for that in 'Revenge of the Sith'? The answer is, cram as many CGI effects as humanly possible. The eye-candy is delivered nonstop through this movie and your senses get overloaded.After watching this movie I wondered why Lucas even bothered to make the hideous Episodes I and II. 'Sith' can work well without the couple of stinkers that preceded it. Some people will even say this movie is as good as the first two Star Wars movies. That's blasphemy. The closest to this one is 'Return of the Jedi' which had great moments, but also stupid teddy bears. The terrible moments in this movie involve mostly the romance between Anakin and Padme. Whenever these two characters are together on screen prepare for the worst acting this side of porn. Their lines are unbelievably more embarrassing than in 'Attack of the Clones' and that's a lot to say. The other terrible thing is (spoiler) Jar Jar doesn't die. The couple of times he appeared on screen I begged to see his death, but no: Despite many die, we're denied of the satisfaction.I'm glad Lucas ended the 'Star Wars' saga with a bang rather than a whimper. Too bad the other two chapters will forever stain the franchise.",6,0,4,19 May 2005
Vanilla Sky," Confusing Vanilla Ice
","Abre Los Ojos, the original film this movie is based on, was madea couple of years before The Matrix (yet, premiered in the States in1999 as well), it was a well balanced murder-thriller with a bit ofthe existential matters, and what-is-real questions the Matrixunintentionally address. No wonder it found fans here in the U.S.,like Tom Cruise, but unfortunately, what happens in everyEuropean film that is translated into an American movie (with theexception of The Birdcage, and maybe Scent of a Woman) the U.S.version always falls short. Mainly because they're usuallydumbed-down for American consumption (Point of No Return, TheVanishing to name a couple).But not Vanilla Sky, which is actually done by a good director. Theproblem with Vanilla Sky is that the director makes a mess out ofthe original script, indulging too much on parts of it not meaningfulto the story, a cool soundtrack and maybe assuming people sawthe first so he could play with this one. The result is a confusingfilm that doesn't know where it wants to go.(Spoiler alert) A key element of the plot is the concept of cryogenics, which is notsomething so complicated to explain as seen in Abre Los Ojos,and this year's A.I., Artificial Intelligence. It's not new, and it's evenpracticed in real life. Somehow Vanilla Sky makes a lousy jobexplaining it, calling it 'Life Extension' and a lot of chit chat about adefrosted dog that has little to do with the idea (storing your body ina freezer for a future when a cure for your disease is found). Irepeat: this is a key element of the plot. You make this confusing;the whole movie gets more difficult to understand. This was notonly the only thing messed up to make the plot more confusing.The original kept the audience on the edge, making it wonder tothe very end if the weird stuff going on is a nightmare, or the maincharacter has really gone wacko. Vanilla Sky goes for the'nightmare' theory, which leaves some parts unexplained (like whythe main character prefers to be interrogated with his mask on),again, making it confusing.I'm still surprised though the remake didn't work. The casting wasexcellent, New York City as the setting is perfect, the soundtrack,as in any Crowe film, kicks butt, and the story is faithful to theoriginal in many ways. The confusing stuff is what made it adisaster at the end.",3,0,0,17 December 2001

The Sixth Sense," Finally something making sense.
","I'll remember the summer movies of 1999 for two movies extremelyover-marketed, which could've never live up to their expectations and hype(Star Wars Episode One, and The Blair Witch Project) and two films which quietly delivered what these two films should have, and didn't: The Matrix and thisone.The 6th sense is a masterpiece. Is a movie that will stay with you way long after you see it. Not an horror movie, but a really scary movie. The atmosphere isamazing, even after the movie ends, when the credits roll, you feel chills in your spine. Fear of the unknown is the main reason this movie is so scary. Just imagine you could really see dead people: A curse rather than a gift. Nowimagine you're a kid. Just the idea is...well, scary. The so praised twist at the end is just an improvement to an already wonderful piece of work.
Bruce Willis seemed to be on Valium during the whole thing, but hisperformance is his best since 12 Monkeys. Makes you wonder how a guy whopicked these scripts, including Pulp Fiction, also does stuff like Armageddon. A breath of fresh air in one of the stupidest summers in film history.

Any generation before us couldn't have conceived this film.Everything in it: The visual style, the pace, the computer special effects, the Hong Kong inspired action sequences, the anime inspired characters, the stylish ultra violence, and the cyber storyline, was all pointing that many cultural and technological issues needed to be ripe enough for people to get the movie. The Matrix was tailor made for-and-by a videogame, internet, cellular, cool gadget generation which I'm proud to be part of.After seeing the latest installment of the Star Wars saga I decided that I've out grown it.

300," Many writers wish their books were adapted likewise
","First, 300 is based on a comic book by Frank Miller (Robocop 2), inspired in the battle of Thermopylae. So don't even bother seeing it, if comic book violence, action over character, style over substance, fantasy over realism is your thing. Second, this movie captures the very essence of the comic book, frame by frame and word by word. Sounds familiar? Maybe because Robert Rodriguez already did it in 2005's Sin City, based on a comic book by, guess who? Frank Miller. Other comic book artist in the vein of Miller have seen their work butchered on the screen. Example is Allan Moore, whose comic books have spawned a bunch of mediocre movies (V for Vendetta, From Hell, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Frank comic books are perfect for the screen. The stylish frames are the perfect storyboard. The characters over the top, the wardrobe iconic and visually arresting. Of course, Spartans didn't go to war wearing tongs and red capes, but the symbolism of it, godlike bodies almost nude, tells you about the characters more than any words. The same with the mangled, ugly bad guys, visually altered to give maximum impact. His words are simplistic, but piercing, and like the medium, macho as hell ('Spartan, come back with your shield, or on it.'), that's why you can do a script by simply copy/paste-ing exactly what you read in the comic book. It's the perfect blueprint for an action movie. Snyder knew all this and took every artistic license possible to do this movie like a comic book. He used tricks done by Rodriguez before, only that Rodriguez relying on star power distracted me from the stories in Sin City, also Sin City's pace was not enough to savour each story: Sin City tells 3 stories from 3 books as long as 300 in the same space of time. A lot of people will look at this movie looking for other entertainment tricks used more in regular films. This is looking back. The great thing about 300 is that freshens up the tired sword-and-sandal genre. It's a very welcome update and one of the best films of the decade.",10,9,19,18 March 2007
Sin City," Like nothing you've ever seen (unless you've read the comic)
","Despite 'The Matrix', it took almost 11 years for a movie to give audiences the feeling they got when they first saw 'Pulp Fiction'. And like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix', 'Sin City' is like nothing you've ever seen on screen before. It's the birth of a new genre of movies.It's absolutely Robert Rodriguez best movie (many people I know hate his movies, but I enjoyed 'El Mariachi', 'From Dusk Til Dawn' and even in a minor note the first two 'Spy Kids' movies), and it possibly will be the zenith of his career.The movie owns all these qualities to Frank Miller's comic series. The source of this movie is one of the most visually astonishing, cinematic works ever put on print. The fact that the movie is a carbon copy of the comic books it's both a point in its favor and a problem.Yes, 'Sin City' is not perfect.I believe the movie would have benefited of a slower pace. That would have made the movie too long, but then, Rodriguez and Miller would have used a trick from the Peter Jackson School of Novel Adaptations and cut some scenes from the theatrical version and add it in a DVD for fans. Making the movie a carbon copy of the book also restricted the potential of the film medium. They could have done some scenes not featured in the comic book to connect the stories better. In all, the could have avoided the problem with the 'Harry Potter' movies, which are a bit boring because the book to film transition was too literal.'Sin City' is not for everyone. Many people will cringe to the sometimes gratuitous ultra- violent scenes. It works in comics, but on screen may be too much. 'Road to Perdition' was a movie that toned down the action and violence of its comic book source because of the same reasons. I actually cringed at something different: Elijah Wood and Clive Owen, playing the most agile characters of the movie, display their Chuck Taylors as if they were in a commercial. This was really distracting. It happens than even in a world like nothing you've ever seen, you can't avoid some things of this world.",9,0,2,3 April 2005
Windtalkers," Gone with the Wind
","I saw the first trailer/teaser of Windtalkers a year before the filmpremiered. From the start, the premise was excellent. The promoline said it all: The Navajo has the code. Protect the code at allcost. You know that last sentence was bound to create a problem.And being the director John Woo, a person capable of turning amediocre plot into an action classic (Mission Impossible 2), I wasalready excited. Unfortunately Windtalkers turned out to be a parade of missedopportunities. The premise was excellent, but it wasn't taken to it'sfull potential. The characters were interesting, but miscasted. NickCage's signature overacting ruined most scenes. The Navajo star,with the smile of a toothpaste commercial, didn't look 'Jap'enough for some key scenes where that was an issue (an issuethat doubtlessly happened in real life), diminishing credibility. I was wondering how John Woo style would translate to a war film,and I saw it wasn't much different from some of his former movies,in both action and bodycount. The Japanese were merely theswarm of shooting targets Chow Yun Fat would nail with twopistols in other circumstances. Great for Rambo and pre-Vietnamera war films, but in the 21st century such films look cheesy. Woo's best Hollywood film remains Face/Off.

Cinderella Man," Split decision
","It seems today anything done by the Crowe-Howard combo is going to get rave reviews. 'Cinderella Man' is a pretty good movie, just not a magnificent one. The script is paint-by- numbers. Ren√©e Zellweger was as best mediocre (she has the most embarrassing line in the movie: 'You're the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!') the rest of the acting was pretty good, but not as good as other past performances by Crowe and Giamatti.A terrible mistake in the movie was the demonization of champion Max Baer, who was as beloved as Braddock back in the day. As if the poverty and humiliation of Braddock wasn't enough to carry a story of redemption and second chances, they had to bring a villain. That's so Hollywood.Finally, there are two bigger problems with 'Cinderella Man': The uplifting, true, sport story about people who win back a second chance from the Great Depression was seen years earlier in 'Seabiscuit'. The other problem is, despite being a true story, there was already a beloved boxer who came out of poverty and adversity to win our hearts. His name is Rocky.
