Saturday Night Fever," What did they see in each other?
","Except for the music, this movie was completely detestable.  Stephanie Mangano was an arrogant, pretentious, snobbish fake; Tony Manero was a preening, cocky, prejudiced jerk.  Tony revealed a single redeeming quality in the last part of the film when he protested the unfair outcome of the 2001 Odyssey dance sweepstakes, but it didn't outweigh his behavior up to then.  I doubt that either of these two believed that the sun rose until they got up in the morning.  What on earth did they see in each other?An attempted rape, a backseat gang bang, a gay-baiting incident, a caricatured 'Whatsamatta you!' Italian family that slaps first and asks questions later:  something to offend everyone will be found here.  Loaded to the brim with racism, homophobia, and superficial priorities, this movie might well be considered a chronicle of the worst seventies excesses: drugs, disco, and doin' it.  Not sure of the order.  But if you're looking for a movie that will be an uplifting experience ... of the toilet lid, for you to blow chunks ... here it is, folks.",Null,0,1,5 August 2003
