Child 44," Reviewers, stop making it political, nobody bloody cares!
","I had to register just to write this: stop making a big deal out of this movie. Nobody really cares what Moscow was like in the 30's or your ticket prices, or your perception of socialism! This is a FICTIONAL movie, filled with FICTIONAL characters in a FICTIONAL historical context, not a propaganda piece. So stop making fools out of yourselves, for all of our sakes. P.S. As for the movie, it was weak - poor acting, lukewarm plot, nothing to really pull you in. Gary Oldman, what are you doing, man??? You used to be cool, now you're reduced to make C-grade rubble like this. There are historical inaccuracies, but let's get real, this movie is not claiming to be based on a true story or anything. Could've done the research better, or could've just avoided this whole ordeal entirely. 2/10",2,49,115,16 April 2015
