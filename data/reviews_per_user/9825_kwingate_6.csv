Black Swan," Beautiful to listen to, and to watch, but I wouldn't waste too much time thinking about it
","This film definitely kept my attention. The score of course, was lush and beautiful. The visuals did the audibles justice. Beyond that ... (SPOILERS coming. ... I guess) ... I am not sure what happened during this film. There were rivals for the coveted starring role in one of the classical ballet's most renowned works. Our hero, catches a once in a lifetime break and is in the position to take that role. She competes with the remaining rivals, performs the role, and either kills her rival or commits suicide. Or maybe she never got the chance because the woman ahead of her... It's all quite fuzzy.Of course her Mom (really her only support system, near as we can tell, at the beginning of the film) is living vicariously thru her, having sacrificed everything so Nina (the protagonist) could get this role. None of this sounded too ground-breaking to me either, right?I think the attempt was to make this a film about artists living out the story line of the very story they are trying to tell artistically, like Carlos Saura's 'Carmen' for example. Unfortunately for the makers of this film, the plot for a ballet need not be as descriptive as that for an Opera, and this film reflects that.Also, I've seen Natalie Portman & Barbara Hershey do much better work in other films, while Mila Kunis, IMHO, should definitely keep this one (deservedly) on her highlights real.Maybe it's just me (I love dance: from classical to hip-hop but am not very educated about it) but ... Nina (Natalie Portman)'s movement seemed ... ungraceful & amateurish to me. That surprised me, but maybe that's what good ballet looks like shot so intimately and up-close.",6,0,0,23 November 2017
Pulp Fiction," Most over-rated movie I've ever seen
","I have only seen this movie once, during the original theatrical release, so maybe I'm due for a second viewing, but I just don't get it.  Yes, it's misogynistic, racist, hyper-violent, and near as I can tell --devoid of any redeeming social value: but these seem to be the high points!  Yes there were some funny bits, particularly Christopher Walken and the thing about the watch.  Yes Mr. Tarantino coaxed some very good performances out of some fairly mediocre actors, and yes they were aided by one very capable actor (Samuel L. Jackson).  What I don't get is the way everyone seems so enamored of the dialog.  As I recall, it competed for an Oscar that year with Much Ado About Nothing, starring a guy named Denzel Washington, written by a guy named Bill Shakespeare, and the best line from this 154 min. glamorization of our baser instincts seems to be 'What do they call a quarter-pounder with cheese?' !!!????? As for interleaving plots, I'm wondering if any of the folks so taken with this have ever seen anything made by Robert Altman?  I wouldn't object to the violence so much if it made me think (The Matrix, Memento) or feel (Road to Perdition) something, but unfortunately, this film offered me neither.",Null,22,47,12 March 2003
Signs," Maybe best/worst SF/Horror film I've ever seen....
",".... sort of Blair Witch (minimalist sound track; kept you waiting for something really scary) meets the X-Files (where is this thing going???) meets the Exorcist (Fr. so & so has a crisis of faith, curable only by exposure to Earthly trauma).  Yes there were some pretty silly elements to the plot, but I rather like the non-cinematic (and certainly non-theatrical) dialog which exposed the characters: I'd have to go back to Silkwood to find a film with characters and dialog this real.  Should I be impressed, because the film had me on pins & needles over ... nothing?  Or feel cheated because after all, what I was afraid of was the wicked witch of the West?  Also, don't know that anyone else mentioned it, but I couldn't help wondering if (**** SPOILER HERE: ***) the alien's presumed 'poison' wasn't perhaps, some sort of cure for Asthma, which puts the film more in the camp of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and others which warn us of xenophobic reactions to well-intentioned aliens. I just saw it last night, but I'm leaning toward liking it.",Null,0,1,1 December 2002
Deadpool," I'm Missing It
","This has become my 21 y/o son's new favorite movie. My 16 y/o daughter loves it too. They both love comic-book movies but my wife, who (like me) can take them (Batman) or leave them (...lots to list here....) also liked it.I don't get it. I have a pretty high tolerance for profanity (I made it thru Straight Outta Compton without flinching) and am willing to get past excessive violence if there's something left when you get past all that (The Matrix is one of my top 5; I loved City of God; ...) but when you strip away the (sometimes clever) profanity and well-staged violence there's literally nothing left here.I don't get it.",1,70,146,12 June 2016
The Breakfast Club," Unlike most of us, this film ages well
","I *love* this film. I am not originally from Chicago, so I was never a big John Hughes fan, although settling here 20 years ago to raise a family definitely deepened my appreciation for his films. Even from my East Coast POV where I lived when the film debuted, and from a West Coast POV where I lived when I first saw it, this is not only Mr. Hughes' masterwork but a 'best in class' exemplar of the 'teen drama' genre. I made sure that both my kids saw it before they started high school. US High Schools (when I was coming up at least) were so Balkanized then; they seem to be less so today, maybe in-part because we all made our kids watch The Breakfast Club! Yet we (at least I) watch it with a certain nostalgia for the eighties. On one level, it's one long music video. On another, a there act Greek drama (set in a school library, no less, albeit a very cool one). On another, a kitschy Hollywood comedy. One of my favorite films.",8,1,1,25 January 2017
The Great Gatsby," The Greatest Gatsby -- Ever!
","The movie is never as good as the book. 'Remakes' are always retrograde. Those movies with anachronistic soundtracks are more distracting than interesting for 'serious' films. Baz Lurhmann has proved all these truisms (to which I had more or less subscribed) wrong with this film. It may be my love of the source material, or the fact that I rather like Jay-Z and Frank Church, even when they're scoring a screenplay that references the Jazz Age with every page. But the music respects the Jazz Age even if it is not particularly constrained by it, the same way Gatsby is not constrained by the social pecking order in which he was expected to live & love, even if the film-maker was not constrained by FSG-era interpretations and projections of the author's vision. As a native East Coaster I find this film nostalgic. As an ex- Californian I find it bursting with optimism and energy. As a transplant to the Midwest I sympathize with nearly *all* the characters. This is a superlative adaptation for the screen of the Great American Novel of the 20th Century. I love it, and look forward to sharing it with others so that I may enjoy it over and over again.",9,1,2,23 May 2014
