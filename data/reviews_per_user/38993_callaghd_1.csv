Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie got Derailed along the way somewhere.
","Kill Bill Vol1 was a very very good movie. It was violent, but violence with a purpose of redemption. It was an action thriller with the rare topic of a plot. I also liked how the director mixed Japanese-style Animation with live-action. This created a unique way to tell the story. That was certainly part of the charm and mystique of the original movie.Kill Bill Vol II was tried to be made into a drama, straying away from the original piece. I just never bought into that much. The acting was not that great as well. Just a little too 'Hollywood'.The ending buildup, which of course should have been loaded with action, was kind of a let down, in my opinion.",6,0,1,27 April 2004
