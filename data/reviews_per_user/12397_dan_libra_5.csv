Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A movie that tells you quiet a lot about the audience
","Crass, stupid, low grade, primitive, idiotic, filled with toilet humor, degenerate and outlandish - these are all fine qualities of the movie and its viewers love it for that. That tells you the cultural lows of the society that adores it.The pseudo-intellectual non-sense about the movie exposing American intolerance - just further showcases the ignorance of its audience.Intolerance and insensitivity are one of the main human traits and can be found across all continents, races and nations. That's why we had a Holocaust but also the Rwanda massacre.This primitive farce does nothing to enhance neither intelligence of it's audience nor promote a more favorable view of Hollywood overseas. It completely reasserts all the stereotypes, and rightly so, of the kind of entertainment that abundance, high-quality of life and having no grounding in any kind of human tragedy (like WWII was for Europeans) cause people to enjoy.",1,1,5,24 May 2012
The Expendables 2," sickening
","I won't comment on the merits of the plot and script of this movie, because those parts were completely 'expendable'. Rather, I would to highlight the incredible and astounding amount of violence depicted on the screen. But, what was more astounding was the reaction from the audience to people limbs broken, people slashed, mutilated, decapitated and etc.The audience laughed, giggled and generally had good time. American society is very sick and Hollywood continues on its merry way of sanitizing the last remaining aspects of humanity, morals and intelligence from people's brains.",3,5,13,26 August 2012
District 9," Beyond superficiality
","Whether intentionally or by accident the creators of this movie concocted one of the most original and unorthodox sci-fi movies in the recent history. It is not perfect but it is certainly not conventional in typical Hollywood sense.This is the movie where I think you can find a lot of things to think about, besides the wrapper of explosions, gore, aliens and space ships.But let's dispense first with the superficial. The special effects in this movie are astounding in their realism and relevance. The movie doesn't feel overburdened with them nor do they take the priority over the plot of the movie. Unlike in many modern movies, the special effects here seem to be seamless with the rest of the movie and help deliver it's punch ever more successfully (Avatar comes to the mind where my feelings are completely the opposite - brainless assemblage of special effects)Here are some things and ideas that I think District 9 raises and leaves the viewer to think about (and perhaps this will answer some of their criticisms of the movie)1) We as humans anywhere on this planet are inherently racist and suspicious of anybody acting or looking differently than we are no matter what our race is or nationality. This quality is perhaps a part of our animal nature and transcends our race origins. There is a large history of white colonialism and apartheid, however it is a mistake not to see that any groups of people in power, majority or any significant numbers have inherent prejudices toward other groups that are somehow different from them. We don't have to go very far in history or geography for an example: the Rwanda genocide.2) Why aliens became a subjugated formless mass or what separates the civilized advanced society from the mass of people simply fulfilling their base desires? We live in an advanced society filled with computers, advanced metallurgy, advanced chemical processing, space shuttles and particle colliders. But take a hundred individuals off the street and how many know how to and where to find, mine and process ore, how to synthesize various chemical compounds, how to create semiconductors, perform integration or differentiation or recite a table of chemical elements. The fact is it took a humongous amount of time of trial and error and a few geniuses to propel our understanding of the world. Where would we be without Newton, Gauss, Copernicus, Archimedes, Enstein, Darwin, Tesla and etc.3) Why sometimes a superior mass of people cannot/doesn't rebel against it's oppressors? Well we don't have to travel very far in history to see such examples: Holocaust, various terrorist hostage situations where a handful of terrorists can command a huge number of people.But the movie is not just the ideas, it is also filled with truthfully delivered drama of the main hero struggle to first fall in-line and do his job, then with his egotistic desire to save himself and any cost and finally liberating himself for own sacrifice to help the suffering creatures.",9,1,5,22 September 2010
Children of Men," A very good and tense sci-fi/drama movie
","A bleak hope arising out of the miserable, deplorable, dirty and disgusting world. This is the one sentence that could summarize this ultra-realistic nitty and gritty movie depicting ordinary men - some displaying courage, some behaving like animals. Even the hope comes from the least likable and ill suited human being for that task - but that is life - it is not a fairy tale. However, this is a not spectacle for the plebes as it lacks the major formal attributes of the typical Hollywood creation:1)There are no super heroes running away from explosions happening within 3 feet behind them and etc. 2) The overall mood and the outlook of the movie is bleak and gloomy if not tragic. 3) The movie does not have a kung-fu style fighting sequences or similar action sequences. 4) It has no real beginning and has no conclusive ending. 5) The movie ending cannot be described as happy-ending 6) This is not a Dickens style story with clear-cut story exposition and chewed up explanations.",8,1,6,1 May 2011
Avatar," Dressed up and over-sweetened mediocrity about Indians vs Colonial empire
","In the words of one of the main characters, just sit back and 'let your mind go blank'. I think this phrase perfectly sums up this movie - the chewy bubble gum, the pretty wrapper on some very cheap and sugary candy, the triumph of superficiality over substance.I would genuinely like to salute all the technologists, programmers, engineers, and the artists that made this movie possible. But beyond the spectacle of all the special effects and 3D graphics, for the sake of effects, there is not much to see here. I remember in the first 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe', you were truly awed by the spectacle of the grandiose battle. In the 'District 9' you were grappled by the original story, unusual plot twists, interesting dialogues, and unusual ending. The special effects in the 'District 9' were so amazing and so organically woven into the fabric of the movie (although the movie itself was a bit too much graphic), that they transcended the usual 'special effects' experience, and became just a natural part of the story.Nothing of that sort was experienced by me while watching this latest Hollywood creation. The story is recycled, re-recycled, the music is typically generic (probably the same composer writes music for all these blockbusters), coherent dialogues are pretty much non-existent (they might have as well made it into a silent movie). The plot, the characters, the twists, the ending are so trite and ridiculous that it is just an insult to watch it for any thinking person. The only redeeming factor was the planet's atmosphere, but after first 30 minutes or so of watching dressed-up earth and its creatures (horses, rhinos, wolves, and etc), an incredible feeling of boredom overtook me and I really could care less for who was killed at the end.",4,6,16,19 December 2009
