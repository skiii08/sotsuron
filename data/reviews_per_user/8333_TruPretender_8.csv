Scarface," The Real Scarface.
","'A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.' -Mark Twain'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe 'Scarface', Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.First off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage, it's violence, it's dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.Next on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It's not like 'Aliens'- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in 'Grease 2' she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching 'Scarface' for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real 'Scarface.'",10,334,443,28 January 2007
Orphan," Fierce, Bold, and shameless view into the psyche of fragmented motherhood.
","To start, the film 'Orphan' was promoted to be a modern day schlock film about a murderous child who wrecks havoc on a loving home which adopts her. This method of audience attraction could not be further from the truth. 'Orphan' is an intense drama, about how fragmented minds of both children and adults can hinder the relationships between the children of a family, broken or otherwise, and the parental units with which the family is overseen. The film's premise follows a the Coleman family, a broken, unconventional family who have recently befallen a slight tragedy. Specifically the mother, Kate, who has just suffered a miscarriage. From here, we learn that, in addition to other complications to John, her husband, and she herself, that their marriage is on the rocks, about to slip. They figure adopting a child to make up for the still born one of their own, will mend things. So they adopt Esther, a kind, intellectual, but reclusive young girl from the St. Martins school for girls. This does in fact, mend their marriage, because of all things, their youngest child, Maxine, who is deaf, has particularly taken to Esther. Soon though, events start to take place, inconsistencies, and 'accidents' that all seem to be connected with Esther's arrival. This sets the story, but so much more takes place within the film, that will most obviously be missed by many 'thrill seeking' audience members. First of all, there is a complexity of character development and layers of character issues with both John and Kate, who were both played out wonderfully and very authentically by Peter Saarsgard and Vera Farmiga. The problems the characters are faced with, matched with the problems they've overcome, reaches the viewer with no holds barred realism. So too, do you get the feelings from the actress playing the deaf child. Sign language is incorporated into the film, and stylistically, the direction has many of her scenes in complete silence, helping us live in her world for just a few moments at a time. One of the real gems to this film is Isabelle Furhmen, who is regards nothing but what she is supposed to do as Esther. She is impressive, and focused, with a memorable accent and almost perfect acting for someone at her age. She will go far if she continues to grow and take in all that she can. CCH Pounder pops in for a welcome cameo. The story itself is frankly far fetched, but the actors and director Jaume Collet Serra, who is humbly making his way up the ladder in the industry, and it's not hard to see why, make this stylish and entertaining trash something to think about. The direction is a BIG contribution to the films virtues. The camera work, the direction of the scenes and the actors, and overall execution of the story and the way it's structured give the film more cinematic validity than it originally has any right to. There are physical camera moves than entice and suspend the viewer, there are jumps and build ups in the conversations that lead the viewer on, and then usually there will be a revelations that doesn't try to scare, just creeps up your skin. John Ottman provides a less than memorable score. He is usually on top of the game, providing a score that is better than the films themselves, but this time, the direction has clearly eclipsed him. But it by no means stops there. The best part of the film (direction, really) is the bold and shameless way it approaches how the events in the film are portrayed. Serra is not afraid to go where other filmmakers are sensitive. He places to the two children, one innocent, the other not so innocent, in the scariest of situations, for both children and parents alike, and takes risks with their lives. The situations on screen are in your face and intense, but don't linger on for too long, eliciting an uncomfortable and at times, horrifying feel that makes the viewer want to forget they ever saw this. These depictions include but are not limited to, children locked in a tree house on fire, children killing adults, children psychologically playing off the naiveté of other children, etc. It's definitely not for younger audiences. In fact, it's a film that some adults should see. A commentary on the affect parenting has on children, and how subtle but real the ignorance of a parent can be. It's an adult film on many levels actually, giving the story lines to the parents most of all, and giving the scary material as a secondary tactic. The film is a daring exercise in presenting the subtle consequences of ignorance in the American Family. Likewise, the film can also be taken as a look into a world where youth and innocence is taken for granted, and all ages are affected thusly. Either way you look at it, the film presents a world where the boundaries of age and maturity are broken and the lines that are usually drawn between are blurred. Our characters at one point or another can each be blamed, or sympathized with. And for that, the film has done half of what it should: Reflect while being entertaining. The other half, is what no brained audiences have seen the film for, a gory attempt to cash in on the idea that adults are stupid and children should disrespect their parents. People who are going to see this film for either this reason, or to be scared, will most certainly not get their dollars worth. All in all, 'Orphan' has brought back the R-rated horror film, and with it, an intellect to the adult scary movie, and it will only really be successful if other filmmakers recognize it for what it is, and continue to take this new method on.-TP",7,7,11,2 September 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," God Awful, and certainly NOTHING special!
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' had a real chance at being something big, something to end what had began as the most admirable motion picture saga in years. 'The Bourne Identity' blew our minds far enough to the point that we were going back to the theater again and again to experience that same excitement once more. 'The Bourne Supremacy' promised just as much, and even delivered a good roller-coaster ride of a sequel, albeit a little inferior to it's high riding predecessor. Sadly, 'The Bounre Ultimatum' falls completely flat from hitting anywhere near what the first two films had landed themselves. This film is has all the excitement of a snail race. Why? Well, let's see, it managed to screw itself up in more ways than one. It over blew it with the filming tactics, and the writing was disgusting! I will explain.First off, the film begins with some dreadfully unexplainable way of taking place before the last film ended. Why the writers did this, I have but to know, anyway, Jason Bourne is still on the lamb. You'd think that after all these years he'd be okay to an extent...but wait a minute...it's only been two years since the first one, and about six weeks since the second installment...somehow before the second film ended??? Anyway, there is more conspiracy and intrigue that has Bourne as angry as a caged cobra, and he's fighting mad! Before we can digest a single up-to-date detail of what's going on, a useless story line appears, of a man who's been onto Bourne for years, following the story. The man is brought to Bourne for a quick instant before meeting his own death. Somebody was feeding him information, and somebody wasn't going to let him live...the pointlessness goes on, as does the ridiculous shaky camera-work. Soon enough, the extraneous character of Nicky is introduced this thrice time around, the film falls apart.Despite the bad opening sequences, I was enjoying myself with the usual Bourne action stunts, and the always determined Matt Damon in the role. What's more, is that the first twenty minutes of the film is entirely DRENCHED in the memory of Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente from B.I. & B.S.), giving us the notion that she might get a little more justice than before. Alas, the joy is short-lived when that lousy, disgusting, horrid actress Julia Stiles rears her ugly fat face into the film, and the character Nicky is supposed to be some resurrected position of the new Marie Helena Kreutz. That was when the film lost my admiration completely. It became the first film all over again, with many instances mirroring the first film on many levels. It is the same thing, with David Stathairn practically mimicking Chris Cooper, and that wretched Julia Stiles posing as a reminder of how wonderful Franka Potente was. Heck, that's all this movie is, a reminder how terrific the first film was, never mind the second. Joan Allens performance is a saving grace, but she can't manage to do it without a little help...and she has none, not even from Matt Damon. Everyone else runs, jumps, punches, types, speaks etc. like little miniatures programmed to function like the dangerous characters in the first two films. It's just dreadful. This is not fun or exciting for the fans. Fans more so feel the way I feel, that it is the writers and producers slapping us on the face. Do they think that we won't catch the stupid rehashing of 'Identity'?Some people obviously find that take a refreshing, ironic stir, but I for one can't stand it! Theyshould scrap this garbage with the intentions of making another, more innovative climax to what should have been a great trilogy.",1,21,48,28 August 2007
The Descent," A Deep, Dark Decension
","Be prepared for an unusually dark adventure when you make up your mind to see this film. It certainly builds to a nice set up. Also, for a feminist such as myself, the total domination of the female is both flattering and felicitous. The director certainly had some great ideas that he executed. I can easily say that I was surprised on most levels at first, because I saw something that was almost above my expectations. It wasn't a perfect film, mind you, but it did well with what it had. The film follows a group of strong healthy women who meet in a camping trip, or rather a woodsy hang out in the Appalachian Mountains. One of these women, has just reached the end of a terrible year. Sarah, she lost her whole life, consisting of her husband, and her child. She is taking a private decent as it is, since the accident. Now, her friends are trying to serve her with a power weekend. This getaway soon turns disastrous, when the six women Decent into a cave , where circumstances take them into the heart of darkness, which tests their morals, their sanity, and ultimately, their will to survive. Soon, they are battling an army of unknown creatures that kill and eat, whilst screaming loud in the depths of the dark. This is made all the more unbearable by the fact that we hardly see any of it. The film follows a distant, and pale tone all the way through, and the formula is not so predictable. The opening, however, is terribly rushed, and treated like a secondary plot device. Thusly, we barely have any steadiness or focus clear enough to realize the damage that has been done. Moments later, we are taken to the Appalachians, where the pushy, bossy Juno character is all and ecstatic about this new mountain climbing trip. The characters are certainly defined early on, and it is easily made clear as to which ones are amicable, and which ones aren't. Each one has flaws, and each one has strengths. The dialog, and the general closeness of the women is brought out with close shots and tight angles. Another plus to the film, is the subject of the Decent. There are three actual Decents that are happening, or rather the characters are taking three simultaneous Decents. They have taken a Decent into the dangerous cave, the Decent into the end of their friendship, and ultimately, the Decent into insanity. As the claustrophobia and anger tenses, the women are forced to realize who is the one to blame, who can help them escape, and who they can trust with their lives. The Juno character has lied to them, trapped them in a cave, and endangered their lives. Many incidents end the film, with a tragic feeling, and a notable sense of prevention, which further flames the tragedy. Now, a minus for the film, is that the horror of the crawlers is never reached until quite late in the story, despite some early signs of impending danger. The focus on the women is long, dull, and heavy handed. Thusly, over half way through the film, do we really find the women in serious danger of death by the mouths of these creatures. Yes, we were almost given a good film, and why not? The film has left many audiences talking about it, and given some good topics to debate over, but in the long run on things, the film seems to be a cold product of it's times. Like most films today, it either copies other films, or is a rehash or remake. It's a feminist 'Deliverance' that takes place in a cave. The same type of set up brought to a more, action packed rate. It doesn't keep up with itself, and the survival instinct is muddied. There seems to be a moral message, but haven't we seen that already? What about the modern symbolism about the human system? It also falls prey to the MTV style camera-work, and tactics that are too familiar in some scenes. Also, the plot developments do not reach the potential to which they are first displayed. Alas, a wonderful example of how potential is only taken so far today, that it crumbles before it can reach the apex of perfection.",4,5,8,16 August 2006
Scream 2," ...2, the 'Back For More' movie.
","...And the audience was desperate for a sequel! Yep, the inevitable was near, so near it was a only a single year after the original 'Scream' that we saw a continuation of the Wes Craven movie that spawned a huge following. This film did nothing more than take the first film to a new and alleged stereotypical setting that would be ground zero for another slasher story. I can say, however, that this film was, in event, actually better than its procedure. I guess most sequels sometimes feel more intriguing than the originals, but only to an extent. The feeling is usually only a left-over sentiment from the original winning a fans heart. In 'Scream 2', there is both, a sentiment, and excitement that runs along the entire film. Better yet, the first film may as well not even exist, seeing as Kevin Williamson made quite sure that any pre-requisite films need not apply this time around. You hear so much about the first one, why even bother watching? All you get is twice the gore, twice the cheese, and all that goofy Williamson dialog, fit with cheap so-called innovation.This time, we have a new movie opening up appropriately titled 'Stab'. A hot'n'happening college couple are out on a date to inspect it, or rather, he is, she should be back in the dorm studying. At any rate, trouble ensues when the culture-oriented colleagues become the hot topic of the following morning news.Yes, a second killer is here, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) cannot help but feel that somehow, it is all her fault. If this is incorrect, than Campbell gives off the wrong signals all throughout the film. Anyway, the public media creates a frenzy at a nice little college where Campbell and Kennedy from the first, now reside. Guess who else in back...Gale Weathers! Yes, the convenient 'Stab' franchise is based on none other, than the 'Scream' original caper itself! How Very! (or not!). David Arguette also comes back as the laid-back, humble cop Dewey. We get to see more of Kennedys' rambling about supposed pop- culture sequels such as 'Aliens' . We also receive information about slasher movies located at a college campus. We learn of 'House On Sorority Row', 'The Dorm that Dripped Blood', even a little bit about 'Showgirls'. How fun! In any case, blood baths return, as well as more predictability and that 'lingo' issue Williamson had with the first one.Arquette, Campbell, and Cox are well on target, keeping their characters up to par with the original formality they began with. Kennedys 'Randy' is more intellectual, and given the treatment of a saint...and for what? All he does is sit side and give his own commentary about sequels and trilogies. How original...right! Perhaps if he was not such a film geek before... Other cast members are fun to watch. Jerry O'Connel, Timothy Olephant, and Rebecca Gayheart are nice and steady. A real joker about this, is the disgustingly goofy way that Sarah Michelle Gellar has a bit part as a typical sorority girl on campus. Please...it was enough in 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' also written by Williamson, but I remember finding out she was in this after 'Summer' and thinking it was pretty ridiculous. There is, however, a performance that stands out major from the rest of the cast, and the award for best actor/actress in this installment goes to Laurie Metcalf, for a great comeback into film, as well as all the little manifestations she creates.The writing is slightly better than the original, and obviously so, as the first one was the starting point for all this madness and violence. The issue of extreme language and convenient movie knowledge still present, only this time, we have a full classroom of film studies, where everyone is just like Kennedys' 'Randy'. Williamson is too enthralled to slow the pace, and thusly the story is quick and sharp, if sometimes repetitive and lacking. I suppose it is likely that Williamson reached a certain status of narcissism with the success of the first film. It is all too fake by the end. Some of the dialog is just as hammy as Thanksgiving dinner. Albeit entertaining.Wes Craven gives his usual storytelling in genius fashion, but the impact on pop-culture is still all to shocking to believe. We still have the same direction as the first, with no real end of the tunnel. New back stories and twists may come off as new direction for the story,but for the most part, it just says the same old thing over and over again. Maybe by 'Scream 3'...",5,0,2,25 October 2005
Jaws," An instant classic!
","When I first saw the film, 'Jaws' I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean...literally! Steven Spielberg had made himself the most successful director of all time when he went all out with this one! Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all! Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instant classic!",10,94,162,10 March 2004
Scream," ...as desperate a film as it was a franchise!
","'Scream', yes. The film released in 1996, and the abomination to the entire genre! Yes, a real attention getter and a real creep of a film! Full of suspense and stupidity! The absolute definition of wretched impact on society, with good characters to follow in a homage for obsessive freaks! Screenwriter Kevin Williamson almost had a terrific idea about a gruesome killer stalking the teens of a sleepy California town. Wes Craven is a genius of this certain genre, and to have him direct this film was a lucky break for the fledging writer. The concept was fine. Teens in a small town are being offed one by one in some of the most gory turn-outs. Soon, the police are baffled, and the teens are doing nothing but relating the vicious natured killings to pop-culture horror films. When situations grow from bad to worse-a town curfew is set, and a party is held. It is during this final party that all is revealed.First, we shall go over the concept. It has a strong presence, very strong, and very predictable. How many people do you know, actually saw the film, and could not see the next part coming? Yes, as scary as it might be, it is just as predictable as well. Williamson tries to put forth new ideas and interesting killings, but alas, it does not work, especially when the apparently innovative death scenes are more like puns. It does, however, have many good moments in which dialog is spoken, or imagery is shown that will send chills up your skin. The film seems to try too hard at getting a scare, as though it is afraid to be original, so it relies on the success of other films for reference scares. The concept is overblown by unrealistic scenes of shock value and character analysis details that need not apply. Over all, it was good, but it was also bad.The acting and character placement was fair and easy. Neve Campbell was very popular on the FOX drama 'Party Of Five', and furthermore, she had completed 'The Craft' just months before. Therefor, she definitely had the victim act down after playing the villain. Rose McGowan, Jaime Kennedy, and Matthew Lillard all had good shots at success as newer faces in the crowd. They in turn, had nothing to worry about. All three gave credible performances. Courtney Cox and David Arquette have certainly won the award for most spirited cast members to this day, just look at their position now. Skeet Ulrich is so irritating, he actually comes off well in his part. The rest of the cast features good supporting performances and cameos all around.Now, about the writing, Kevin Williamson is either smug and obviously desperate, or rather way too obsessed with the genre that his extreme passion clouds the writing and brings out the hackneyed atmosphere that films of this type should have been trying to ride themselves of. Even more annoying, is that obvious way Williamson is trying to give every single teen a sort of modern lingo about 'the werewolf movie with 'ET''s mom in it, or 'Wes Carpenter', or even 'Tits Lagites' thing.' Worst of all, the rather convenient way the everyone is an expert on horror films. Randy must be shooting for Leonard Maltin or Rex Reed status. The film has a little too many crinkles in it. Still, those flaws will fade when the moments of madness take tole.The directing is...well, Wes Craven did the deed, need I say more? All in all, the film was a nice little piece of scare fare, but it ruined the genre by giving away movie secrets and supposed methods that make the film formulas work. Nice try Williamson, but no horror film has been very enjoyable since your little stab film was released. Stop trying so hard, it's pathetic.",5,1,5,24 October 2005
300," Hogwash.
","Big bang special effects, black lighting blue and green screens, buffed up actors, no style as far as widescreen is concerned, no good at making an impression on anyone but numb skulled audience members (of which there are obviously many of) to a certain degree. Shall I keep on going? Supposedly based on true events, fictionalized for novel purpose, and blown over the top and out the old proverbial dumper for theaters, this film was a D.O.A. from the second the company logo played. It has all the intensity of a dog taking a bowel movement. Halfway through the film I was sitting in the theater asking myself, 'just what exactly is this about again?' and then it hit me how horrendous the filmmakers visions were.It was just that which made this film so bad, clashing visions. And you can see it in the trailers and promotional material for this film. On one hand, you have actors working out their damned hardest to get into lean shape, and make their characters stand out, but of course falling into the age old Hollywood Blockbuster curse, they are eclipsed by the way they look and no one even cares about where they have been or where they are going. There is no depth, there is only look, and looks. Poor actors, such as Gerard Butler, Dominic West, and David Wenham, giving it their all, and for what? So people can take a look at their chests, muscles, and rear ends. They give the film nothing more. No spunk, no attitude. Nothing. And that's just the start. All the special effects that it took to make the film also fall futile. There is really nothing impressive about the ultra super imposed grainy look given to battle sequences, the MTV fast-slow quick camera movement that has become cliché in the last few years of bad movies, and the horrible use of music throughout the film. All it does is show that too many people had one too many hands in this film, that they all crashed and this film burned because of it. What I'm getting at is that this film is a poor man's 'Gladiator' with sped up camera changes, blaring guitar music that is supposed to 'elevate' the tension of the fight scenes (it doesn't) and actors supposed to look mighty and tough, but only look like homo-erotic male strippers. All this drawn together, too much 'creativity'(if that's what one would call it, I wouldn't though) strung together on God knows what, and mashed into a digital garbage can, this is what you get. There is nothing about 300 that is remotely moving. It has the depth of a bathtub, the feel of sand paper, the sound of grinding in your ears, the look of a comic book that was left outside in the rain for a few years, run over by a tow truck carrying the film crew to the studio to work on another film to redeem themselves from making this piece of stench, and then left on the shelf, you get the point.I could go on, but why bother? If you haven't gotten the point by now, you won't. Watch it at your own risk, and try not to use(loose) too many brain cells.This film is Hogwash.",1,71,136,29 June 2007
