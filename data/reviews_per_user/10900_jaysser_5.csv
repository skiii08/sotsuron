The Blair Witch Project," Not bad for suspense
","The Blair Witch Project is quite the suspense. I would not say it is the scariest movie out there, but it can surely keep you on the edge at certain points. When a film triggers a set of emotions in you, that's how you know it was well-made. I particularly loved the performance, and I believe most of it was improvised. I did see some over-exaggeration at times, but nothing I was not expecting from a typical horror ambiance. An extra point goes for the actors' handling the cameras themselves. On the other hand, while suspense was the main element in the movie, I would have loved to see more frightening scenes, the ones that make you jump off the couch.",6,0,0,23 April 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A ravishing animation
","I was so thrilled to see a comic book turning into an impressively magical animation film, especially one bringing incredible emotions. The visuals, soundtrack, story-line and characters are intriguing and keep the audience at an excessive degree of excitement.",8,2,4,3 January 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Entertaining, but too long.
","One thing I love about Steve Carell is that he leaves a good impression in every movie he's enrolled in. His performance and expressions in 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' makes the audience believe in the situation that he is dealing with. Judd Apatow's movies are known to include comedian actors such as Paul Rudd and Soth Rogen who played two amazing roles in this movie. Seeing that the movie turned out to be entertaining and well developed, I found it longer than it should have been. I think movies like 'The 40 year old virgin', or 'This is 40' (also directed by Judd Apatow) should be plain and simple (about 1 hr 20 min - 1 hr 30 min max). Despite the fact that the plot is amusing, it should have been compressed. Overall, it was a good movie.",7,1,1,4 September 2013
Limitless," Creative, but expected better
","I would like to point out that the idea of the mysterious pill is unique and creative. The movie's plot is revolved around this pill which can be viewed as a good substance to enhance the brain's functioning, while destructing the process of human activity. If it were me, I would have never taken the pill as it would have ruined my conscience. Rather than making him a better person, it turned Eddie Morra to a vicious man (he killed that woman in the hotel).The making of the film was well-done. There were clearly lots of effort put into editing, picture enhancement and special effects. Also, I loved the acting, in general. Bradley Cooper shows lots of talent, especially in the scene where he finds Vernon dead in his apartment. Even-though it didn't affect the film's general outcome, I expected a more extended, interesting role for Robert De Niro.Regarding the script, it is well-written, but I think it could have been more appealing with more action and suspense, which would have better attracted the audience.",7,0,0,14 September 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," A one-of-a-kind movie you will NEVER forget in your lifetime.
","No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never get over it. A genuine and absolute outlook on life and death, freedom and captivity, friend and foe. A perfect score is what the Shawshank Redemption will always deserve. Its idea will never die.",10,0,0,20 April 2020
