The Blair Witch Project," No suspense
","I'd read a little bit about this movie beforehand. Just enough to get the general idea. I was pretty sure I'd like it.So I was expecting the intentionally amateur-looking camera work. That didn't bother me at all. Actually, that aspect of the movie worked pretty well.But I was also expecting a little suspense. Maybe a few frights or surprises along the way.My only surprise came when the end credits appeared, and I realised... that was really it. Nothing scary, original, or even vaguely clever had happened.The fact that none of the three main characters were in any way endearing didn't help matters. At no point did I feel anything resembling care or sympathy.",1,12,22,29 July 2007
