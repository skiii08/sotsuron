The Blair Witch Project," It hits you later and stays with you for days.
","I saw The Blair Witch Project a few days ago and it is still with me. That is what is so different about this film. It seems so real it gets under your skin and you can't shake it. Because you are viewing it through the eyes of the camera, it does seem to be real. Then as I was leaving the theater and driving home, I kept looking in my rear view mirror and checking the back seat.  Other movies don't usually leave me with the hair standing up on the back of my neck for no reason when I'm sitting alone in a room at night. Go see it and watch how it will take days for you to stop thinking about it.",Null,1,2,14 August 1999
