Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pure entertainment and magic! Star Wars is back, baby!
","This movie is timeless like any other Star Wars movie. It boosts you into lots of different environments within the nearly two hours of screen time. This episode IS different from the Classic Trilogy. The characters are built up different. These aren´t underdogs like the Rebels were in the OT, there are Jedi Knights, from the Jedi Order, there´s a young Queen and there´s Anakin, who is already more powerful than he should be. That´s what these episodes are about. Anakin is too strong to handle it at times.Episode 1 has lots of potential and great ideas. Very imaginative things. These movies put all kinds of religions, classic fairy tales and 50´s Sci-Fi into one bag and what comes out is great mixture.Watch them and don´t listen to critics. 9/10",10,2,4,8 February 2004
