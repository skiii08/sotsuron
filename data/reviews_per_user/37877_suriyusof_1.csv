The Finest Hours," a true life event of an impossible mission by US Coast guard in early 50's
","I don't care what the critics say but i just love love love this movie especially the part where Chris Pine's character handle the small boat against the gigantic waves in the middle of the night. It was exhilarating to watch. Even my 8 year old was mesmerized. I love the actors and the characters. Chris Pine and Casey Affleck is 2 of my favorite actors. And i love Chris Pine in Unstoppable too another film depicting true life heroism. I just cant get enough of this movie. Too bad its not a box office. I just don't get it why the American people will rather watch Deadpool than this movie or rated it higher? DP is garbage, this film is a gem. I have watched DP too. Anyway if you thinking of watching this film. Please do and bring your children along. Its good to show them what the old good American people used to be. About heroism, bravery, selflessness, leadership and faith. All this are the essence of the story.",10,2,7,21 February 2016
