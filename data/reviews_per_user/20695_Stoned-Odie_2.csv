Requiem for a Dream," Great piece of work
","I defiantly would recommend this movie. I don't use any other peoples recommendations in this particular summary because I think this movie should be viewed by everyone. It is one of a kind as previous posts claim , and no other movie will compare. Form the music to the great acting , to the realness of this movie it will shock you and make u think different about many things. It will send you through an array of emotions , Most you will see that u have never felt them before , and the rest you probably wont know why u feel them , how they came from the particular part , or when they will end. I would also strongly urge you to look at the movie in a non feeling way at first , because if u look at the drugs and think that it is centered around only the drugs , it isn't. This movie practicality blew me away , more because I understand the drug things. Young people usually wont get this because it isn't something they have knowledge about. I gave this movie a 10 and I think that anyone who views it will like it.",10,1,2,23 December 2005
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America doesn't cease to fill the enormous shoes left by its predecessors. Amazing movie!
","It starts out as most marvel movies do with a mission, and a good showcase of how bad ass the cap is. Then it delves into an insane twist that I didn't see coming at all. With S.H.I.E.L.D. being compromised by Hydra for years, and about to launch a program that will use the three new Helicarriers in concert with an algorithm designed by the late (But still alive due to his mind being downloaded to a mainframe Howard Stark owned) Dr. Arnim Zola has created to kill anyone he sees as a potential threat to Hydras endgame. Captain America already doesn't want Project Insight to launch even before he realizes its complete nefarious objective. This is because he believes in the constitution, and that we shouldn't sacrifice freedoms for security. The movie definitely gets you thinking when it is explained how Hydra changed its mode of operation sense Hitlers failure in trying to forcibly take over the population, and now has created wars and enough conflict and fear mongering that make us Americans literally just lie down and accept, if not ask for something or someone to rule us (Its not that obvious, but that's what seems to be happening now in real life. Look @ the NSA programs and how much the government can see, read, and hear basically anything they want to)so as to 'Keep us safe'. But sense Captain America is strong, and smart, they (Hydra) needs a weapon, and that's there Bucky 'The Winter Soldier' comes in. Obviously whatever tests the Doc was doing to him before he was rescued by the cap had some kind of an effect. Exp when you see him fall from a train that's like 300 ft in the air, and all of this back in 1940 something. So he's lived for years (But they show a picture of him inside of what looks like a Cryo-Chamber, so maybe that's how he's lived long and is still young) and is now mind controlled to fulfill evil operations for devious men (Hydra operatives) and it is a difficult conflict that Cap has to fight him to complete his mission of stopping Project Insight from becoming fully operational. Overall its an amazing movie that follows the enormous footsteps of its predecessors, and fills their shoes perfectly. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes action movies, and if you're a nerd, or a comic book fan, then obviously this is a must see! Hope my review was useful.",10,2,5,24 April 2014
