Insidious: Chapter 2," A wonderful breakdown of modern horror...
","'Insidious – Chapter 2' takes place right after the events of the first movie. In order to bring the audience up to speed, it opens up with 15 minutes of purposely stilted exposition. But not only those first minutes are a true gem of writing! Dialogues throughout the movie will fascinate every viewer, in how far removed they are from actual human speech and emotion. To emphasize this disconnection from the human condition, all lines are delivered by a group of wooden mannequins cleverly disguised as actors. Although this has been a bold choice by the director, the expression known as 'dull surprise' is always spot on. The film also raises many questions, it boldly does not answer: Why is a suspected murderer not in custody? Why does a wife and mother, who must know that her husband is possessed by a ghost, does not act on this knowledge? How do the two paranormal investigators know, that a knife was just pulled? And does a knife really make a 'swing' sound, although the one who pulls it just held it behind his back?This film uses all the horror-film tropes you love and can't get enough of, like: 1) The ghost in the mirror! 2) The false 'standing behind the door' reveal! 3) Baby in danger! 4) Scary children! 5) Scary nursery rhymes!6) A abandoned hospital/mental institution! 7) Ominous pointing. 8) Ghosts ominous pointing. 9) Ghosts ominous pointing white screaming and/or cackling.10) The '...you cannot have seen him, he just died this morning.' Scene! 11) At least five instances of a noisy, scary and inexplicably moving toy! 12) Ghosts wearing antiqued clothes while sitting with their back to the camera! 13) The self-unscrewing screw! 14) Explaining the obvious! 15) The murderous husband bashing through a locked door! (As seen in 'The Shining') 16) The son disguised as his mother, murdering people! (As seen in 'Psycho') 17) Dissolving walls! (As seen in 'Silent Hill') 18) An ending that sets up a third installment!This movie also takes a break from well-timed, well-placed, non-predicable and terrifying jump-scares. No longer will your heart-rate be raised by a sudden shock, that impairs your movie-experience! No, this film fires so many Jump-scare-'duds' and loud noises at the viewer, that after the first third of its runtime you won't care anymore . And if you expect the 'loud noises' to match up with the pictures you see on the screen, you will be pleasantly surprised, because 'Insidious - Chapter 2' breaks new ground! These noises always come a bit too late, which gives you the opportunity to be prepared and not startled by the sudden increase in volume. Especially noteworthy is the one scene, where the baby-bed is revealed to be empty. A dramatic zoom, a loud noise and then BANG!: The instant reveal, that the baby just had fallen out of the bed. Scenes like this are a well thought out statement, how horror movies are desperately fishing for cheap scares.But wait there is more! Like the well-beloved 'weak wrist' camera-work, when a scene is meant to be truly intense! A blatant and artistic disregard for how tin can telephones are supposed to work! A time-travel story! Time traveling ghosts! Where else, outside of Doctor Who, can you find something like this? I warn you! This film is a movie you should not watch alone, because all the quips and witty remarks you will inadvertently come up with, would be otherwise lost to the silence. ---The Insidious Drinking Game: 'Fake' Jump-Scare (x1) Scary Toy (x1)Jump-Scare Sound-Mismatch (x1)Tin Can Phones don't work that way (x2) Drink one each time you think: '....sure this isn't Christian Slater?'",2,19,33,2 October 2014
Iron Man 3," Not that abysmal
","Yeah I kinda liked it, sue me. After everyone was beating the fecal matter out of this movie, my hopes for this film were as high as the dirt under my carpets. Yes, this film has a lot of errors you might notice or don't make sense, yes, there are pretty big plot holes in there (especially that one at the end everyone is complaining about), the plot-twist in the last act is pretty much 'hit or miss' and there is at least one plot-threat that goes nowhere. But if you are not looking for anything too fancy, Iron Man 3 is a good rental.",6,2,3,18 December 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Wars Trek
","No, it is not the 'Star Trek' you grew up with......and probably it isn't Star Trek at all. Like its 2009 predecessor, this movie is not the enlightened future Roddenberry envisioned and has more plot-holes than your average swiss-cheese. And again it really didn't matter to me, because it was just a fun ride. Like the first movie, I liked the action so much so (still way too much lens-flares, though), that many of the plot-holes only became obvious to me, after I took a few moments to think about the movie. But basically, if you can make a movie so entertaining, that you don't notice all the plot holes on your first watch and be entertained, it is still a good movie. I assume that is also the reason why the most reviews here either hate it or really like it: People who like the 'Star Trek'-legacy and would like to see it continued are severely disappointed by this movie. But people who don't care about Roddenberrys 'better future' or see the 'Star Trek'-legacy as 'redshirts dying', 'too tight uniforms' and 'technobabble', enjoy this flick as a good popcorn movie.So if you still need to see this movie, do not expect 'Star Trek'... expect the kind of action you wanted the 'Star Wars' prequels to be.",8,2,3,31 December 2013
The Babadook," Probably the only Horror worth seeing in 2014 ....
","... and the best to come from kickstarter, yet.I was surprised by this movie. I heard that 'The Babadook' was worth a look, but I am weary when it comes to horror-movie recommendations these days. 'The Babadook' follows the story of a single mother overwhelmed by her life. She has an exhaustive job, a problematic child and not yet handled the death of her husband. One day her overly-imaginative son finds a rather unsettling children's book, featuring a bogeyman called 'The Babadook'. Soon after that strange events start to occur.The movie blurs the lines between horror and psychological thriller/drama. For me it is open to interpretation if the Babadook is real, or if it is 'just' the mother loosing grip with reality and spiraling down into schizophrenia. In both cases the movie shines especially because of the fantastic performance of the lead, Essie Davis, which makes you fear for her character, even as her condition gets worse and worse. The movie deviates refreshingly from horror formula: It completely forgoes worn out jump scare noises, builds tension through atmosphere and focuses on the characters and how the events impact on the rest of their lives (how it should be).",8,13,28,17 November 2014
Pacific Rim," 'Giant robots punching giant monsters'
","The acting was not good, especially Burn Gorman (who can do a lot better) was hamming up the scenery like there was a discount on pork. The movie felt at times too slow, the script is - well - something between cheesy, cliché and borderline-stupid. Every trope from 'I lost my partner and won't ever do this again' over 'This insane plan is our last chance and the high-ups don't see it' to ' (...) is the best soldier for this job and you well damn know this, Sir.' was pulled our of the hat at least once... ...but honestly, the visuals are fine and after all, it is a 'Giant robots punching giant monsters'-Movie. So yeah, I wanted to see 'Giant robots punching giant monsters' stuff and I got 'Giant robots punching giant monsters'. So no complaints from my side.",6,3,4,18 December 2013
Insidious," Mediocrious
","I can not understand why so many people give this movie high ratings. In the end, it is bland and utterly predicable, so much so, that I was able to call end around the middle of the movie. Insidious tries nothing new or special, nearly every plot-point seems to be recycled from another horror-movie. The only 'tension' in this movie derives from jump-scares. Even the design of the 'ghosts' are 'slightly creepy' at best; The main antagonist, however, looks like guy in a very elaborate halloween costume. Although no movie is required to reinvent the wheel, Insidious doesn't juggle its generic plot, production design, special effects and direction good enough to make for a enjoyable movie. Insidious was filmed on a budget of 1.5 million dollar and (ironically) I guess that - in this case - throwing more money at the production would have benefited the movie a lot. Especially the sets and visuals in the final act seemed to be toned down to the bare minimum they had to be, to make the conclusion of the movie work. Because of that, the end feels rather anticlimactic, instead like a pay-off for a long and slow build-up. This movie will fade away in your mind rather quickly, becoming one with the memory-mush of all the other mediocre movies you know you have seen, but struggle to remember them.",4,1,4,25 July 2013
