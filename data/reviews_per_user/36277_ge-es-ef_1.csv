The Sound of Music," Good Movie! (but not the original)
","'The Sound of Music' is a great musical. But if you like the story than watch the original movie 'Die Trapp-Familie' (1956,Germany). You'll be surprised that this film (nine years older than Sound of Music) is much more detailed and closer to the original facts of the Trapp family.",9,1,7,6 January 2001
