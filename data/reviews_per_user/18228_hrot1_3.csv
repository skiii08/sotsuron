The Devil's Advocate," It is worth seeing!
","This is a good movie to watch and Keanu had a great performance in this movie. Al Pacino did well too and Charlize was alright, but I think her voice was louder than the right amount the role needed, in some scenes. To me, it sounded like almost yelling which was not supposed to be in those scenes. She did very well in other movie,Monster. Well,this movie was made before Monster.The story is good and it is something different from other movies about devils. I have seen lots of movies and most of them have very predictable plot. This movie is not one of those movies, I think. I like the movies with good performance of actors and actresses and this is one of those movies.",7,0,1,20 September 2005
Monster," This movie is about a psychopathic female serial killer.
","This movie is about a cold-blooded psychopathic female serial killer,Aileen Wuornos who just kill the men without any reason except the first one. Patty Jenkins(the director and writer of this movie) really tried hard to make viewers of this movie to sympathize with Aileen Wuornos. This kind of approach is dangerous because Aileen did not have to kill those men to get the money and nothing can justify her brutal crimes. This movie has lots of unnecessary scenes and some essential scenes are not in this movie deliberately for obvious reasons. Charlize Theron did wonderful performance in this movie,anyway.",3,2,11,24 September 2005
The Italian Job," It is a waste of time to see this movie
","This movie is not worth seeing. The story is bad and very unrealistic. It would have been a good story if those burglars had donated the money to charity or poor people,or they had been caught by some smart cops and sent to jail,at the end part of the movie. I think this movie makes burglars look like some kind of heroes. It also makes armed robbery look like a good way of becoming a millionaire. The justice has not been served in this movie. It is a waste of time and money to make this kind of movie. There is not any good performance of actors and actresses in this movie and it has a very predictable plot. This movie is one of my top 10 worst movies.",1,7,14,21 September 2005
