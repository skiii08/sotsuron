Marie Antoinette," Worst Movie Ever Seen....
","When I say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, I say that knowing I have forty to fifty years left to live. There is simply no way any film I see in the future could possibly be worse than this. This movie was an affront to anyone possessing the slightest concept of taste.First of all, the microphone used to record the actors could be seen _SEVEN_ times - who the heck did the editing on this so called period piece? Please tell me someone was fired for such obviously sloppy work. Secondly, the idea of Rip Torn and Jason Schwartzman playing royalty is beyond stupid - miscast miscast miscast. If Louis the XIV was the 'Sun King', Jason Schwartzmen played Louis XVI as the 'Thorizen King' - seriously, did he have a pulse at all? The use of modern language and music defies belief - a sad attempt at creating an avant-garde film; instead they managed to produce a film so bad I wanted to behead myself for wasting 123 minutes watching it.Too bad Mystery Science Theater 3000 is no longer on the air - they would have a field day with this film.And in case anyone here actually thinks this is good - it's because you are a moron.[8F] The NyQuil Kid",1,6,17,20 October 2006
