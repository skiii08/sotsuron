Alien 3," So, so sad
","This movie is bad for so many reasons.  First, it's just a bad movie.  Dark, boring, and not even scary.  Second, it totally undermines the Alien and Aliens legacy.(Spoilers)To have both Newt and Hicks die is the first 5 minutes, and Ripley at the end, then what was the point?  They all should have just died at the end of Aliens and spared everyone the pain (including us).Finally, this movie is just improbably.  First, there is no way that an egg (or eggs) made it onto the spaceship at the end of Aliens.  The queen didn't lay any eggs anywhere (she was detached from her egg sack, remember?)  Even if you want to believe that eggs could have been on board, you can't believe that if you clone an 'infected' human, that you also get a clone of the alien.  Sorry.I could overlook those plot holes if the movie was any good, but like I said before, it wasn't.",1,421,455,5 June 2000
The Last Legion," Misleading trailer disappointed some reviewers
","I saw this movie with no idea of what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed it and but when I came to IMDb I found that it was given a pretty low score. Did I see the same movie? After reading some negative reviews it seems that the majority of low reviews seemed to be expecting a different type of movie, based on the trailer. I watched the trailer on the DVD and is it misleading, and full of spoilers (as they always are). That's really too bad because on its own this is a pretty good movie.It is light-hearted and family friendly, but I don't see those as negative qualities. If you want dark and gritty Lord of the Rings meets Excalibur, then you will be disappointed. But if you've been disappointed by most every 'sword and sorcery' type movie to come out in the last 20 years then this movie was a refreshing change of pace. The cast is first rate and the production value is good - far better than most Hack N Slash movies.",9,0,2,13 January 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," Not Revolutionary
","The third chapter of the Matrix series fails to build on the premise of the first two movies.  In 'The Matrix' we got a world where reality is not reality.; there is another level of reality outside of the Matrix where people live.  In 'Reloaded' we got yet another level of reality thrown at us, in that Neo and 'the One' have come before.  Zion has been built and destroyed many times before.  The Architect and the Oracle are two powerful forces battling a war of armies and ideologies.  The stage is now set for 'Revolutions' which takes us... nowhere.  Nothing new is revealed, and what little is revealed is vague.  Sometimes vague is good, but not here.  We get lots of impressive visual action, but it's all kind of predictable and doesn't amount to much.  We also get lots of attention paid to minor characters who only mean anything if you played the Matrix video games. Neo, Trinity and especially Morpheus are lost in the background.  None of them get a satisfying ending or final scene.  We don't get any real questions answered, but we do get lots of new questions to ask.  That's not what I was looking for in the final chapter of a trilogy.5/10 stars.",5,0,0,5 November 2003
28 Weeks Later," Could have been good but ruined by some poor choices
","A great premise and setup are ruined by some very poor choices. The makers of this movie hate the audience and their own characters. Nothing that made 28 Days Later a really good movie is in this movie.Let's start with plot. None of the 'this could happen' realism from the first movie is here. I can forgive a few plot conveniences but they just started to stack up. I'm going to list them here so SPOILER WARNING:<ul><li>Mom is immune to Rage virus.</li></ul><ul><li>Dad is lone survivor.</li></ul><ul><li>Dad (UK civilian) gets job where his security badge gets him past the highest US military security points.</li></ul><ul><li>There are zero guards between the entrance and the quarantine area.</li></ul><ul><li>Not to be outdone, his two kids can sneak past military check points.</li></ul><ul><li>One of those kids can also escape all zombies, snipers and find his sister, all in a few minutes.</li></ul><ul><li>Dad becomes the super zombie who can take out squads of trained soldiers (trained to kill zombies, BTW) and who can evade all mass extermination attempts.</li></ul><ul><li>Super zombie Dad can also find his kids, not once, but twice.</li></ul><ul><li>Even though zombie blood if contagious, no one ever bothers to wash, or even wipe it off.</li></ul><ul><li>On the other hand, no one ever gets infected this way either.</li></ul><ul><li>After 28 days, 28 months, and another 28 days no one bothered to close the Chunnel?</li></ul>Anyway, with the plot ruined, the next to go was the acting. It's a mixed bag here. Some was good but some was *really* bad. The screaming zombies acted better than some of the regulars when they were screaming.That bring me to the deaths. You never expect many, if any, of the main characters to survive in a zombie/horror movie. You also expect those deaths to be somewhat spectacular. However, the cruel and callous manner in which some people died crossed many lines for me. If the rest of the movie were any good then perhaps these deaths would have worked. However, I don't think these deaths were given any more thought than 'how can we f*ck with people the most?' The 'night scope' death was also poorly directed. It's bad enough to kill off a likable character, but to do it poorly? You fail.That brings us to the gore. If you want gore then you're in luck. This is probably the best part of the movie, but that's not saying much. Some of it is over the top, and some of it even funny (in a black humor way), but some of it was just cheap. The quick editing and fast panning shots seemed to be hiding flaws rather than being a creative choice.Finally, the 'ending.' Once again, if the film makers had shown any sort of deep understanding of the movie then I might overlook this lack of a real ending. As it stands I can only assume that the writers just got tired and said 'let's end it here.' There was no message or anything deep unless you consider futility to be deep. The ending was just a cheesy, seen-it-before clich√©.To conclude: skip it. 3/10",3,28,34,15 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Extended DVD version is excellent and better
","This is a review of the extended DVD version.I will keep this short because there are so many reviews.The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release.  Note, that this version has more than just new scenes.  Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way.  The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow.  Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original.  Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn).  It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.So, just like with the 'Fellowship' DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.  I already plan on only getting the extended version of 'King' next year.",10,1,1,11 December 2003
Mulholland Drive," Good, but not as clever as people are saying
","When reading the reviews of this movie, there seem to be two main camps:<ul><li>I was confused by the movie, so it sucks!</li></ul><ul><li>I was confused by the movie, so it's awesome!</li></ul>Mild Spoilers...The truth is that Lynch did a good job transforming a TV show pilot into a movie.  He took a rather straight forward story and then when the show was canceled, he turned that story into a dream and then wrote another story around it.  It's not a bad idea and it worked fairly well.  However, this is not a perfect movie, so I really don't understand why some people get orgasmic over it.  I also don't understand why so many of the people who loved this movie consider all of the red herrings and unanswered questions to be positive things.  To me, they are just weirdness thrown in for the sake of weirdness.  Some of it was entertaining, however, so I can't fault him too much for that.The bottom line is that I was entertained for the whole movie and intrigued enough by the ending to watch it again for more clues.  I'm kind of disappointed in the whole 'it was a dream' side of things, as I see that as a huge cop out, story telling-wise.  But, as dream stories go, this one isn't bad.  I'm not a Hollywood insider, but I expect that the satire angle works at that level.  I also appreciate the risks involved.  Most work, but some don't.  8/10 stars.",6,3,6,11 October 2003
War of the Worlds," Makes 'Signs' aliens look like geniuses
","This is a pointless and stupid movie. Everyone in this movie is stupid: the aliens, the humans, the writers, the director, and us, the viewers, for watching it.No one expects tons a realism in an 'alien invasion' movie, but absolutely nothing in this movie is realistic or even makes any sense. Everything that happens in this movie is a plot convenience. A lot of stuff happens but if you stop to ask yourself why any of these things happen, there are no answers. Why attack now? Why attack this way? Why kill some people and just grab others? Why are some people so stupid? Why blow up entire buildings and also spend lots of time looking through rural basements? Honestly, I just didn't understand anyone's reasons for doing anything. Even small things don't make sense, like why is that car on fire still moving? Why are intergalactic aliens fooled by a simple mirror?The only reason anything in this movie happens is because the writers said it did. Nothing is logical, nothing feels 'natural' (even for an sci fi fantasy movie) so it's impossible to care about anyone or anything in this movie. On the plus side, the effects are okay and the acting is fine, but they are not reasons to see this movie. This was actually the worst movie I have seen in quite a long time.",3,2,3,21 January 2006
Signs," The emperor has no clothes!
","I really don't understand why people like this movie so much. I can only imagine the masses have bought into the hype and are not thinking clearly. A lot of people who didn't like this movie express themselves in, shall we say, a rather classless manner ('it's sucks ----'). The people who do like the movie do so because the 'found something deeper' and therefore feel a little superior to those who missed the point. I can only guess that the rest of the people who claim to like this movie are only doing so to appear like they are smart and didn't miss the deeper meaning. Well, I just want to say 'There is no real deeper meaning. This is just a bad movie. Period.' The emperor has no clothes.*spoilers*I think that everyone agrees that the alien plot is stupid, but the people who like this movie seem to forgive that aspect of it in favor of the 'deep' spiritual message. Well, lame aliens and plot holes aside, the spiritual message didn't work for me either. The movie's big point, either you believe in God's plan, or you don't, is a cop out. It looks like something at first, but it's really not. In truth, God's biggest gift to mankind is supposed to be Free Will. However, this is contradictory to the notion that God has a plan for us. You cannot have free will if God has a plan for you.And what kind of plan is it for someone to have to die a horrible death, so she can deliver a cryptic message to save the world that only works because of bad plot holes? Please.The last thing that bugs be about this movie is that people claim that it is scary. Huh? How? When? Even if you buy into the spirituality, then how can you consider the aliens scary? You'd need to accept the stupid plot to be scared of the aliens. I mean, how can you be scared of an alien that can't get out of a pantry? If people are as smart as they say they are, then they shouldn't be scared by this movie.Finally, some of the reviews here say that there is yet another deeper level to this movie, that the whole thing is Mel Gibson's dream. Well, that is interesting, and may even be true, but it doesn't make this a better movie. It explains away the plot holes somewhat, but then it loses whatever spiritual message that it had. God didn't have a master plan for everyone and his wife's death was a senseless as ever. Why would that dream restore his faith?So, on the whole, not a good movie. It had good music, okay acting and a good production quality, but for what? 2/10 rating. Basically, disappointing.",2,4,7,6 July 2003
