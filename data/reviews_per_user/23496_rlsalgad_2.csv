The Hangover," all the common places
","i don't care that this movie is stupid, i like stupid comedies, that's not the problem with this film, the problem is that whoever wrote the jokes to this movie was having a really f*cked up writers block, and in desperation went to his nearest blockbuster and rent every stupid comedy made in the last 20 years and, in a very messy operation, start copy/pasting every joke and storyline, so now, we got this stupid movie, that some studio executive that really dislike watching movies, approve under the assumption that this has some originality, but really it should be being announced as a parody, like the unwatchable '____' movie saga from the infamous seltzer/friedberg couple.the extremely high rating is something i can only explain myself telling me that most of the voters haven't ever seen a comedy before, or that we are living in a crescent more stupid society, that can even get that the 'what happen last night?' storyline has a king in the stupid comedy realm, and that's 'dude, where is my car?', or that the 'bachelor party' storyline has it's begging and it's end with 'bachelor party', or that the cool guy that hate his life but at the end he discovers that really loves his wife and kid it has been done since the 1920's!, or that the wimp who is scared of his girlfriend but at the end redeem himself by rebelling against his wimpiness is the most common character in film history... and the list goes on and on.this movie is the copy of the copy of a few good movies. it can entertain, obviously it can, but it doesn't deserve an over 7 rating... not even and over 6. for me is a 4, is funny, but i'm tired to see copies, and overall like 'the hangover', unoriginal as something can be.",4,1,3,6 September 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," not so good
","in this movie a lot of ridiculous things happens. i knew that before watching it, so i was ready to see a really dumb movie with a lot of action, because i didn't wanna get angry on the stupidity while watching Wolverine, trying to make it a more satisfying experience... but i wasn't ready to see that much over-the-top-ridiculous-blockbuster action. sometimes a character is absolutely hostile with other character, but suddenly the first character stop the hostility and become completely undefended so the other can get him... or sometimes a character is right here, but, not having teleport powers, suddenly gets a Mile away of his last position, with other clothing or implements and a 'i'm so cool' scene begins. i really didn't care much about the script... is a really bad adaptation of the x-men story, but everyone knows that since before the movie was release, but also the characters are very, very poor, the scenes are very, very under-crafted and the twists on the movie are absolutely ridiculous...this movie is disappointing at least... for a pg-13 audience at best.",2,2,7,14 May 2009
