Vertigo," Overrated--this is NOT a masterpiece.
","What's all the fuss about?  This movie's good, but it's NOT a masterpiece, and it's definitely NOT Hitchcock's best movie.  I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and when I finally did get to see it, I was bored during most of it.  It seemed like if it took forever for this movie to end.  Also, I thought this movie was going to be mostly about someone's fear of heights, but fear of heights is only a minor detail in the movie. Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak spend most of the movie walking around, or driving their cars, or talking to each other; not much else happens in the movie.  However, I really liked Kim Novak's performance in this movie, and how she becomes two characters with two different accents (and she starts out blonde, but she looks much better as a brunette later in the movie).  I also liked Stewart's dream sequence in the middle of the film.  But for the most part, this movie was just good, and not more.  I like Hitchcock movies, so I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it and/or would like to see a Hitchcock film.",Null,2,5,27 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," HOW EASILY PEOPLE ARE INFLUENCED BY HYPE!
","If this were not a Star Wars film, people wouldn't even think twice about this film.  Their comments would say things like, 'It's a nice movie to take the kids to see'.  As of this writing, this movie is already ranked #64 on IMDB's top 250 films...it goes to show just how easily people are influenced by hype.  George Lucas himself has stated that the target audience for this film consists of teenage males.  Yet people who are quite grown have made comments here in which they try to look for reasons to make this film seem great, when it's not anywhere near great.  It's not a terrible movie, but it's too much of a kiddie film, and has WAY too much computer animation. This movie will become a success at the box office (inevitably) and it won't be because it deserves to be a success, but because hype has an overwhelming influence on some people, who will go back to the theater to see it over and over again.  What was George Lucas thinking???  This movie looks like a mixture of a Disney movie of the week, a Saturday morning cartoon, and the movie 'Toy Story'.  It's incredible how much computer animation was used in this film.  All the emphasis was placed on the visuals...TOO MUCH emphasis. The visuals were very beautiful, but not enough emphasis was placed on the story.  Don't get me wrong...I love the original Star Wars movies.  I have them on video, and have seen each one of them countless number of times. But this film is so UNLIKE the original Star Wars movies.  If a person who hasn't seen the previous three Star Wars movies goes to see this film, they won't really understand what's going on.  They'll think this is just some movie about a young queen trying to save her planet.  In the other three movies, 'the force' was a very significant element--it was almost like the intervention of God.  In this film, the whole concept of 'the force' is almost nonexistent.  Lucas should've let this film be directed by the guy who directed 'The Empire Strikes Back' (which is the best Star Wars film--even Leonard Maltin gave it four stars).  I'm not going to get into specific details about characters or scenes, but I will say that the movie was lame enough, but Jar-Jar totally DESTROYED the movie for me.  If I were to see this movie again, it would be to admire the visuals, nothing more.  Some users have made comments that people who go to see this film with high expectations are going to be disappointed, thus end up not liking this film.  I disagree.  What ACTUALLY HAS happened is that some Star Wars fans who LOVE this film have gone to see this film with preconceived notions: since it's a Star Wars film, they automatically assume that it's a great film, and that's why THEY like it.  They're not seeing this film for what it really is: mediocre.  If I had to describe this film with one word, that word would be 'unbelievable', but not in a good way.  This film is unbelievable in the sense that I can't believe that THIS is a Star Wars film.",Null,1,2,2 June 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Let me tell you a story about this movie...
","In the past, I was never able to watch this movie in one sitting.  For some reason this movie seemed boring.  I remember when this movie was playing in theaters, though I didn't get to see it back then. Whenever it aired on tv, I usually just watched the first few minutes of the movie and then I'd stop watching it. Or I'd watch fragments of the movie. But never the entire movie. A few days ago I decided to check out the video and watch this movie--the whole movie, just for the sake of watching it. I wanted to see why this movie is considered so great. It's quite notable that this movie was such a hit at the box office. The fact that this movie made nearly 250 million dollars in the 1981-1982 period says a lot. Back in the early 1980s only about four movies had grossed over 200 million dollars; that was before the time of the box office blockbusters of the late 1980s and the entire 1990s. Well you know what? After watching the entire movie, I enjoyed it, thoroughly. It was not as boring as I originally thought. I guess the reason why this movie thrilled audiences so much back when it was playing in theaters is that there really had not been an action/adventure movie like this one before. This movie's success turned Harrison Ford into a full-fledged movie star. Although this movie was made twenty years ago, it has aged pretty well. The special effects look good, even in this age of computer animation. The action sequences are great. I love it when Marion tells Indiana, 'Till I get back my $5,000 you're going to going to get more than you bargained for. I'm your goddamn partner!'  And needless to say, the score is outstanding. Also, the movie's ending is shocking--and it has been copied in 'The X-Files' series. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an all-around entertaining movie. It is the perfect movie to watch on a Saturday evening. It is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest movies. It is also definitely one of the greatest movies ever made....though I wish there had not been any sequels/prequels. ****out of ****.",Null,0,0,17 June 2000
Fight Club," Interesting, surreal, and in some ways confusing
","But not a spectacular film.  This is another 'question reality' film.  More than anything, I liked the fact that this film was directed by David Fincher, who directed the extraordinary 'Express Yourself' video.  On that note, the look of this film reminded me of that video.  Visually, it's a dazzling film; the cinematography is striking and almost spellbinding, plus the editing is terrific.  There's A LOT of blood/gore in the film, but that should be expected in a film with a title like 'Fight Club'(hint, hint: not for the squeamish).  This film also has many amusing moments--I laughed throughout most of the movie.  However, contrary to what some reviewers have said, these are NOT the best performances of the two male leads.  I enjoyed Edward Norton's performance, but it cannot even come close in comparison to his tour de force performance in 'American History X'.  Although I can't stand Brad Pitt, he acted well in this film, playing yet another unusual character.....but this performance cannot top his performance in 'Twelve Monkeys'.  Furthermore, the enormous talent of Helena Bonham Carter, the darling of period films, was wasted in this film.....it wouldn't have made a difference if she had not been in this film.  In fact, the whole presence of her character got annoying after a while.  The most enjoyable performance was that of Meatloaf, playing the character named Bob--it was one of the most amusing things about the film.  What I disliked the most about this film was that it was too long.....and the ending was disappointing.  And, the film got confusing after about the first hour or so.  Nonetheless, it was one of the better films of 1999, this terrible year for films.",Null,0,1,24 October 1999
Citizen Kane," Tremendously boring!!!
","I'll give credit where credit is due--it's clear that this movie was MADE well (especially when considering it was made by a 25-year old man).  But it's not an amazing movie, and hardly has any reason to be considered the greatest movie of all time.  Plus it's also a very BORING movie.  I saw this movie because of all of its hype, expecting it to be magnificent....but I was disappointed and unimpressed.  Perhaps all the techniques that Welles used in the making of this film (cinematography, lighting, editing) may have been revolutionary in 1941.  But that alone is not enough reason to consider this film 'great'.  The plot is simple to understand, but it's not remarkable--nothing about this story would make it superior to other films. As a matter of fact, 'Gone With The Wind' was made two years before 'Citizen Kane', and technically, it was a groundbreaking film.  Certainly, 'Gone With The Wind' is a much better film than  'Citizen Kane', by a landslide.",Null,11,29,1 July 1999
Underworld," An engrossing gothic flick
","I heard about this movie sometime last year, while it was still in production, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. The whole concept of a movie featuring a group of black-clad gothic characters appealed to me. Well, I went to see this movie on opening day, and it did not disappoint me at all. This is a movie about a centuries-old feud between two mythical creatures of gothic lore: vampires and werewolves. It stars the alluring Kate Beckinsale as a vampire that hunts werewolves with the intention of exterminating them. It also stars Scott Speedman as a human who happens to provide a link between the feuding vampires and werewolves. Michael Sheen plays the leader of the Lycans--the werewolf clan which lives in the bowels of the city. Sheen's performance is clearly the best performance in the movie, and his appearance (long hair, goatee, and alabaster complexion) suits his werewolf ringleader character perfectly. The werewolves' meager existence among the city's 'underworld' is contrasted by the aristocratic vampires and their opulent Victorian trappings. The movie's dark and mysterious sets are top-notch, and the movie itself was filmed in the beautiful European cities of Budapest and Prague, adding more of a gothic atmosphere to the film. The action sequences are amazing--in particular, the opening sequence is astonishing. This movie is everything that a gothic movie should be like, especially since it combines fantasy, action, suspense, and horror. I actually felt scared during some parts of the movie. The only thing that I disliked about the movie is that some of the actors who play vampires had to wear a pair of cheap-looking blue contact lenses. Other than that, everything else in the movie is wonderful. The movie turned out to be much better than I expected it to be, and I'm thinking of seeing it again. The ending of this movie serves to indicate that there will be a sequel...and I will definitely go to see the sequel.",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
Shakespeare in Love," Highly Overrated!
","'Shakespeare in Love' is nothing more than a nice little movie.  All of the media hype that it has received goes to show that good marketing can go a long way.  Best Art Direction of 1998? That honor should've gone to 'What Dreams May Come'. Best Costume Design of 1998?  Everyone who actually saw 'Elizabeth' knows that film should've received that honor.  There's so much buzz about the 'Shakespeare in Love' script.  The only interesting thing about the script consists of a few witty lines being said by the characters here and there in the movie, but that's it.  The best thing about 'Shakespeare in Love', which was Joseph Fiennes' performance, was almost completely overlooked.  Judy Dench (who although is an excellent actress) was excessively praised for only eight minutes of screen time.  And of course, the most obvious 'praise' that this film has received was for the overexposed and overrated Gwyneth Paltrow.  In this film, all she does is speak with a British accent, put on a boy's clothes and a mustache, and show her breasts--those are all things that could've been done by virtually any actress.  Yet, Gwyneth went on to win several awards for one of her most dull performances.  She gave a more challenging performance in 'Sliding Doors'.  Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett in 'Elizabeth' was beyond overlooked for one of THE best performances ever. As far as 'Shakespeare in Love' being considered the best film of the year: I thought it was one of the better films of 1998, but it certainly was not that year's best film.",Null,3,5,17 April 1999
Mississippi Burning," A great movie!
","I was never interested in seeing this film before.  For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me.  But I rented it a few weeks ago...and now I'm really glad I did that.  'Mississippi Burning' turned out to be a GREAT film! It's a powerful film.  It's a film about the effects of racism in a town during the 60s.  It shows how the conflicting viewpoints of some of the characters lead to devastating consequences.  Yet, in a town that practiced a code of silence, the 'rules' were bound to be broken.  Among the highlights of this film are an absorbing story, noteworthy cinematography, and very good performances.  In all, it's an extremely good movie.  Surely, it's the best movie of 1988.",Null,0,0,15 June 1999
The English Patient," Breathtaking!
","This is the type of movie that was needed in this day and age.  When it seemed that the days of the epics were gone, along came this beautiful film. This film is a true work of art.  It deserved all the awards that it received (and many more).  The first five minutes of this film are so hauntingly beautiful: the close-up of the painting of the black figure during the opening credits, the waves on the desert sand, and the plane being shot down and quickly catching on fire.  The person who made the comment about turning all the lights off and watching this film with someone you love is absolutely right.  I first saw this film when it was playing in theaters (1997).  I was able to see it again last week (I got the video) and I was as mesmerized by this film as I was when I first saw it.  It's a wonderful love story and visually, it's beyond stunning.  They should make more films like The English Patient, instead of the ultra-violent films that play in theaters in this day and age and that most people go to see.",Null,10,17,11 February 1999
Elizabeth," Spellbound
","Today I went to see this film for the second time.  I first saw this film in the second week of December 1998, after reading a short article about it. Back then, I was anxious to see the film starring the then unknown (to most people) Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes.  This time around, I was once again mesmerized by Cate Blanchett's performance as Elizabeth I, and I was enthralled by the film's stunning beauty (particularly its cinematography). The film itself seems somewhat flawed--I don't know why.  Yet, it's still an impressive and enjoyable film to watch.  The cinematography of this film is spectacular and unprecedented.  I love the use of bright light and of bold color in certain scenes  in the film.  My favorite scene in the movie is the moment when Elizabeth has just found out that her sister Mary has died, leaving Elizabeth to become the new queen.  That scene is probably the best example of the cinematographer's use of bright light and bold color...I love the look of the green color of the hills in that scene. But more importantly, this is Cate's film.  She's amazing in this, her star-making performance.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth I was brilliant.  I will always consider this to be one of the best performances ever.",Null,0,0,1 April 1999
L.A. Confidential," Very good...but the BEST of 1997?
","Yes, 'Titanic' may have been a movie about a sappy love story that takes place during a famous event....but it was still a good movie, and worthy enough of being considered the best movie of 1997.  'L.A. Confidential' is a thoroughly good movie.  The script is excellent, and the plot takes really interesting (and unexpected) twists.  It's a remarkable and unpredictable murder mystery movie--it reminds me of 'Chinatown'.  I really enjoyed this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone, particularly because of its absorbing story.  I had to see this movie twice to notice some things I had missed the first time around--mainly to notice some plot elements, but also to observe the performances better.Now about the performances...just about all of the performances are very impressive.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, and James Cromwell give powerful performances.  Of course, Kevin Spacey also gives a great performance (as he usually does, in just about every movie he's in).  All four of those performances were award-worthy.  I don't understand why Kim Basinger won several awards for her performance in this movie.  There was nothing award-worthy about her performance.  So she plays a prostitute--a 'hooker with a heart of gold'.  Gee, as if we've never seen that before.  As much as I like seeing Kim Basinger act in movies (and she did look even more beautiful as a Veronica Lake look-alike), there was nothing spectacular about her performance in this movie.  If anyone deserved an acting award for this movie, it was one of the aforementioned actors.",Null,1,1,20 June 1999
X-Men," Entertaining, but nothing extraordinary about it.
","There was so much pre-release buzz surrounding this movie.  As a result, I think that going into the theater I expected too much from this movie. I thought this was going to be a movie that would rival 'The Matrix'. I thought that I was going to walk out of the theater feeling so inspired by the movie that I'd want to go to a store and purchase X-Men action figures (and I'm 25 years old). Well, I wasn't disappointed. It just wasn't as good a movie as I had hoped it would be. What can I say about Hugh Jackman as Wolverine? He did a great job, he was excellent in that role. I liked seeing Ian McKellen as Magneto. It was great to see him play a villain. I also liked seeing Patrick Stewart as Dr. Charles Xavier. They both were perfectly cast. I especially liked their chess-playing scene together. I didn't like Halle Berry as Storm though. She had little screen time and ANY attractive black actress could've played that character. I didn't like the Mystique character all that much either (and why cast Rebecca Romijn in the role?). Although she kicked some butt, she was just basically there to be looked at and to wiggle her nicely-shaped body. I wish Anna Paquin's character, Rogue, would've been given SOMETHING to do; all she did was spend her time moping. I would've liked to see her extract the energy from one of the villains. But I liked seeing Anna all grown up. She has come a long way from the cartwheeling little girl in 'The Piano'. I also think that the Jean Gray character should've been given a lot more to do with her telekenesis (but I certainly enjoyed seeing the very beautiful Famke Janssen in that role). Much was said about this movie's special effects prior to the movie's release. I found the visual effects to be rather fake-looking. They were certainly disappointing--nothing that we haven't seen before. In fact, the fight sequences themselves (the moves that the characters had) were a lot more notable than the visual effects. The movie's biggest plus? That for an action movie, it actually had a story, and that the director focused on the story. I thought that the ending was very interesting, and so was the music that accompanied the final scene. Overall, 'X-Men' is good as a summer movie, and it's a good way to spend two hours. It did rekindle my interest in comic books (reading them, not collecting them). Hopefully the sequel will be much better. I would like to see a different set of 'mutants' with superhuman abilities that are even more amazing. It's going to take a lot to top 'The Matrix'.",Null,0,0,15 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," As gothic as it gets
","I really liked this movie!  Some people who had seen it before me told me that it was kind of stupid and even funny.  So I had to check it out for myself.  I saw this movie today, and I enjoyed it a lot.  I didn't think it was stupid at all.  The story was very interesting, and had a nice twist; I thought it was pretty unpredictable....throughout the movie, I kept wondering what was going to happen next and who was going to be responsible for what.  Visually, the movie is amazing!  Fantastic art direction--I loved the sets.  The cinematography was outstanding.  In fact, I loved the whole look of the film--its whole gothic look.  I liked seeing all of the cloudy days and the spooky nights.  You don't really get to see sunlight in this movie.  And everyone in the movie looks pale.  Although not too many bright colors were used, the costumes were spectacular.  I liked the contrast between the dark costumes and the pale complexions.  One notable thing I liked about this movie is how Tim Burton gave this movie a look that can be described as a cross between a gothic nightmare and an enchated forest.  The look and feel of this movie reminds me of the look and feel of two other movies:  'Legend' and 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'.  In my opinion, 'Sleepy Hollow' is like a cross between those two movies.  As a horror movie, this movie never sells out, and it's not campy, nor does it disappoint.  I wasn't disappointed by this movie (and I'm usually very picky with movies).  I'm glad I went to see this movie....I'm thinking of seeing it again, and I highly recommend it....though it's not for the squeamish.  By the way, it was great to see Miranda Richardson in this movie--it had been a while since I last saw her in a movie, and I think she's a very talented actress.",Null,0,0,7 December 1999
Glory," One of the all-time greatest movies.
","I don't even know where to begin in order to describe how great this movie is. It's not necessary to say a lot, because this is the type of movie that will leave you speechless, out of words. 'Glory' is a deeply moving and extremely well-made movie. It's a movie about the bravery of a troop of black Union Army soldiers during the Civil War. Everything about this movie is spectacular. I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. Everything about it is just so right, everything fits so right. The cinematography is dazzling. The score is outstanding. The battle scenes are astonishing. It also contains fine performances by Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. I'm stunned that this amazing and haunting movie is so underrated.

I saw the 1997 Oscars on TV and I figured that if Frances McDormand beat out Emily Watson, then Fargo must be a really good movie. Boy, was I in for the surprise of my life!  How in the world did Frances win a Best Actress Oscar if she's in only like about eight scenes in the whole movie?  It's such a pathetic role.  What was so special about her performance???  The movie itself is unimaginably boring!  Fargo is one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!!",Null,3,8,15 January 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," We'll have to wait a whole year?
","And then another year after that...just to see the conclusion of this tale? I don't know if I'll be interested in seeing the two upcoming movies by then. I saw this movie last night, and going into the theater, I thought this would turn out to be an amazing movie. Unfortunately, it was not.  Why didn't I walk out of the theater with a 'WOW!' feeling? Perhaps it's because this movie was not all that great...or not as great as I thought it would be...nor as great as the previews, commercials, and marketing hype made it out to be.  It reminds me of all the pre-release hype for 'The Phantom Menace' 2 years ago. I've never read any of J.R.R. Tolkien's books, nor did I know what this story was going to be about, prior to the hype. Overall, 'The Fellowship of the Rings' was good, enjoyable, and fun. More than anything, it was visually beautiful. It was like seeing the artwork in a storybook about the Middle Ages come to life. And the battle scenes were great to watch. Also, Ian McKellen gave a fantastic performance, as the wizard Gandalf. But now that I have seen this movie, I don't think it would've made a difference if I had chosen to wait till it comes out on video. For its running time of three hours, this movie holds up pretty well.  I've seen several three-hour long (and longer) movies ('Gone With The Wind', 'The Last Emperor', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'Titanic', etc.), and I have felt bored while watching them because of the length of those movies.  That was not the case with 'The Fellowship of the Rings'.  I did not feel bored at any time during the movie, nor did I think that the movie was too 'slow'. Nonetheless, I'm not sure if I want to go see it again. *** out of ****.",Null,0,0,23 December 2001
American Beauty," Great, but DEFINITELY NOT the best movie of all time
","It seems that Kevin Spacey makes any movie that he is in great (or just about any movie he's in).  Once again, he gets to display his tremendous acting talent.  In fact, ALL of the performances in this movie were fantastic.  I particularly loved Annette Bening's performance.  It's always a delight to see her act in movies, but she totally outdid anything she's done in movies before.  Her performance is this movie was marvelous.  I think that the best thing about this movie was that it had some of the best performances I have seen in movies.  Beyond that, this movie can be described in many ways.  Among other things, it was hilarious, witty, touching, and moving.  I really enjoyed seeing this movie, and I'm thinking of going to see it again.  I highly recommend it, and I think that EVERYONE should see this movie.  However, I think this movie is overrated.  It definitely is ranked too highly on IMDB's top 250 (the #1 movie???).  It definitely is not the best movie of all time, nor is it one of the top ten movies of all time.  Mind you, there are movies in the 101-250 range that SHOULD rank higher than this movie.  Yet, could this be THE best movie of this year?  It's too early to tell--the movie studios usually roll out the 'big guns' at the end of a year.  But 'American Beauty' surely is ONE of the best movies of 1999.  It's a shame that 1999 has been such a bad year for movies.  In my opinion, this has been the worst year for movies in recent times.  I'm still waiting to see 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'The Emperor and the Assassin'.  I'm sure those movies will be just as good as (if not better than) this one.",Null,0,0,24 October 1999
Spider-Man," I didn't miss out on anything
","As a movie lover, I thought that I had missed out on something big because I didn't go to see 'Spider-Man' during opening weekend, considering that this movie broke box office records and all. I went to see this movie today, and I realized that this movie was average at best, and I didn't miss out on anything. The fact that droves of people went to see this movie this past weekend proves that this movie was marketed very well. The previews had made this movie seem like it was going to be larger-than-life. I remember seeing the first preview for it last December, when I went to see 'Lord of the Rings'. At that moment, I couldn't wait to see 'Spider-Man'. Now that I've seen it, I can only wish that this had been a better movie. I was expecting so much more. I remember that I used to love watching the Spiderman cartoon on tv when I was a little kid back in the early eighties. In fact, when I walked into the movie theater today the theme song from that cartoon played in my mind: 'Spiderman, Spiderman...your friendly neighborhood Spiderman...' I was truly hoping that the 'Spider-Man' movie would be as enjoyable as the cartoon had been. Yet, I was let down with what I saw. Willem Dafoe (who already has a weird appearance) spent most of his screen time making all sorts of unusual facial expressions, as he struggled with his inner beast...and the Green Goblin costume was just too fake-looking, too unrealistic. Tobey Maguire was a good choice to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but he and Kirsten Dunst had no chemistry. And, the special effects were a bit too much. In a lot of the scenes, the special effects made this movie look like if it were a movie made on a computer, rather than a movie filmed with a camera. Anyway, by seeing this movie, I gained peace of mind. I wanted to see just how good of a movie this was, and if it was worth the hype. Fortunately, I only paid $3.50 for the ticket, since I went to the twilight show. Needless to say, I was disappointed. One thing I did find appealing was the preview for 'The Hulk', and the fact that it is being directed by Ang Lee, of all people. I surely look forward to seeing how that movie is going to turn out.",Null,0,0,8 May 2002
The Exorcist," Worth seeing (contains spoilers)
","...the re-release, that is.  Around fifteen minutes were added to the original version of this movie.  Not very much new material to see, but it was great to see this movie on the big screen (especially for someone like me who was born after this movie's original theatrical release). I consider 'The Exorcist' the scariest movie ever made. No other horror movie has been able to top it.  Perhaps it's the subject matter of the movie that makes 'The Exorcist' so scary.  I was eight years old when I saw this movie for the first time and it scared the daylights out of me. I wasn't as scared now, seeing the re-release.  I was more focused on seeing the added scenes and improvements that were made to the movie.  The print has been cleaned up (no grainy appearance).  The new sound is great--it helps to make the movie scarier.  Plus, you get to see Linda Blair's scene of a 'spider walk' down a flight of stairs, which was not included in the original version of the movie. The 'spider walk' down the stairs caught me by surprise because it was spooky and it occurred at an unexpected moment in the movie. I've seen this movie several times before, and believe it or not, I found some of the more graphic scenes in the movie amusing.  I laughed during the crucifix-masturbation scene.  However, the scenes of the actual exorcism had my eyes glued to the screen. It's still shocking to see the possessed Regan rise in the air, and then later seeing her sitting on the corner of the bed, giggling mischievously after she has just killed Father Merrin.  And of course, seeing Father Karras forcefully jump out of the bedroom window, down the flight of stairs is more shocking. Even if you've seen 'The Exorcist' many times before, I highly recommend seeing the re-release, especially if you're a young person who has never seen this movie on a theater screen.",Null,0,1,8 October 2000
American History X," The hidden gem of 1998
","It's a shame that this movie was released in only a few theaters. 'American History X' is an extraordinary movie!  It's a story that was told in such a remarkable way.  The performances of the cast make what could've been merely a good movie into an excellent one.  The two Edwards (Norton & Furlong) are awesome in their performances.  Furlong has the potential to become a great actor--I hope he chooses his film roles wisely in the future.  But it is mainly Norton who makes this movie so great.  He displays his phenomenal talent.  He has proven that he already is a great actor.  His performance in this movie is, hands down, his best performance!  And his look in this film is quite a change from his usual preppy-ish look in other films.  Besides the two leads, the supporting cast is really good.  Stacy Keach gives a great performance (and is unrecognizable with the way he looks in this film), and Fairuza Balk is, as always, wonderful to watch in another bad-girl role.   As far as the film itself, I liked the use of both black-and-white and color in this film.  It goes well with the plot.  In spite of the controversy surrounding the director of this film, I think that the director did a very good job with this film.  This film turned out to be much better than what I had expected.  One of my top 5 films of 1998, and one of the best films I have ever seen.",Null,0,0,15 June 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Good but NOT spectacular
","This is a very well-made film.  Certainly worth seeing more than once. The combat scenes at the beginning and at the end were eye-opening.  I knew what this movie was going to be about before seeing it, and I knew what to expect, yet the battle scenes were still shocking to see.  However, 'Saving Private Ryan' was in no way the best movie of 1998--'Life Is Beautiful' was a superior film, in many ways.  'Saving Private Ryan' excelled all other 1998 films on a TECHNICAL level.  If you were to remove the graphic aspect of its battle scenes, 'Saving Private Ryan' would be just another war movie. Some people consider this the greatest war movie ever made.  This movie may have the most realistic battle scenes ever shown, but it's not a spectacular movie.  In fact, its plot is rather lame.  'Saving Private Ryan' is tied with 'Shakespeare in Love' for being the most overrated movie of 1998. 'Life Is Beautiful' clearly told a story about love and triumph without the use of theatrics or of famous actors/actresses.  I can't see why Tom Hanks was praised so highly for his performance in this film; the supporting cast outshone him.  Also, the most hideous thing that was done in 'Saving Private Ryan' was to use the United States flag at the beginning and at the end of the movie.  That's something that would only be done by someone trying to win an Oscar.  I do commend Spielberg for his direction--overall, he did a really good job in demonstrating that war is hell.",Null,1,2,18 June 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Dreamlike
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This is certainly one of the most amazing movies ever made. As a movie, it bridges the gap between an epic and a full-fledged action movie. This movie contains some of the most dazzling scenes and breathtakingly beautiful images that I've ever seen. The gorgeous Ziyi Zhang (or is it Zhang Ziyi?), as the character named Jen, graces this movie with her striking presence. The cinematography, the editing, and the choreography are all phenomenal. Furthermore, this movie has a visually stunning and haunting ending. It astonishes me that anyone would have anything negative to say about this movie. The people who downgrade this movie must be people who actually think that 'Gladiator' was a good movie. 'The Fall Of The Roman Empire', the 1964 movie that 'Gladiator' was nearly a remake of, was definitely more deserving of any accolades...yet it was ignored by all of the award-giving organizations back in the day. Anyway, you can't compare a masterpiece like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' to a disaster like 'Gladiator'. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a remarkable movie experience. **** out of ****.",Null,0,0,9 March 2001
Moulin Rouge!," What an ATROCITY!
","Just because a director does something daring with a movie, it doesn't mean that the movie is worthwhile (or worth its ticket price). That's the case with Baz Luhrmann's highly anticipated (and highly disappointing) 'Moulin Rouge'. I went to see this movie in the afternoon--I paid five dollars for the ticket, and those are five dollars I wish I would've spent on something else! I don't know anything about Luhrmann or his career as a director. But, if he hasn't been a music video director, then he should be...and that's exactly what this movie should've been--a music video instead of a movie. I mean, modern-day songs mixed into a movie about late-nineteenth century Paris??? The performers in the Moulin Rouge were actually singing 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and 'Lady Marmalade'. Nicole Kidman was swinging on a trapeze actually singing 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'. And that was just the beginning. Then there's all the love songs sung by Ewan McGregor (he even sings the love song from 'An Officer and A Gentleman'). Both he and Kidman can sing well, but c'mon! When I first heard that this movie was being filmed, I thought that it was going to be a remake of the 1952 film of the same name. No way can you compare that drama masterpiece to this musical-gone-mad. This movie is nothing more than a visual showcase...a spectacle. It's pretty to look at. It contains terrific sets, beautiful color schemes, dazzling costumes and hypnotic cinematography. This movie's charm does not go beyond its visuals. I actually walked out of this movie in the middle of it--and I have sat through some really terrible movies before, till the very end. In the case of this movie, after I had to listen to the umpteenth million modern-day song, I couldn't take it anymore. I realized that the best thing for me to do was to just get up and leave...even though I wouldn't be getting back my five dollars. Mind you, I'm only 26 years old and I consider this movie an overdone disaster. The director aimed for too much high energy in this movie. If you want to see a worthwhile musical, rent one (let me suggest 'Cabaret').",Null,1,3,1 June 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," Winona's angel face and Angelina's greatest performance
","It's great to see Winona Ryder in a starring role....it had been a while since I saw her playing the lead in a movie.  I really enjoyed this movie....it was slow at times, but still entertaining.  This movie is basically a showcase of two of the most interesting young actresses around: Winona, and Angelina she-looks-like-her-father Jolie.  Angelina is, without question, astonishing in this performance. She IS the best supporting actress of 1999.  The roles of the two girls are polar opposites.  Angelina has a flashy, flamboyant, in-your-face role.  It's a very dramatic role, yet it's not overdone at all--that's what makes her performance so remarkable. On the other hand, Winona's role is understated, but it's also a great performance.  Her performance is subtle, yet it's powerful.  Her facial expressions alone are mesmerizing.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her, with her delicate, porcelain doll looks.  I couldn't help but feel captivated by the range of emotions on her face.  I think that both she and Angelina were perfect for their roles.  Their wonderful performances make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable movies of the year.",Null,1,1,13 February 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," A brilliant work of art!
","Stanley Kubrick proved just how much of a genius he really is when he made this film.  Every time I watch this film I'm amazed at the fact that is a film that is so close to perfection.  Yes, it is an ambiguous film--I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I didn't really understand it.  I thought: this is a total psychedelic sixties movie. But I read many articles that were written about it, and when I saw it again a few years ago, it made perfect sense to me.  I think that the best thing about 2001 is that the viewer is left to interpret the 'meaning' of this film in his or her own way.  Needless to say, the special effects in this film are some of the best ever in a motion picture--and this is a film from 1968.  It is one of the best sci-fi films ever and one of the best films of all time.  It's one of my favorite films.",Null,0,2,16 January 1999
Chariots of Fire," Better the second time around
","I was finally able to see this film.  It has played on tv many times over the years, but I avoided seeing it because I thought it would be too boring. So I decided to rent the video.  On the first viewing, I thought: this is such a BORING movie!  I wasn't really paying attention to it while it was playing, because I thought it was too boring.  But I decided to see it again the next day, and I realized what a really good movie this is.  It's a story about two men from two very different backgrounds, and each one has his unique reason for wanting to win at the 1924 Olympics; yet, there are obstacles that they must face that may prevent them from reaching their goal.  This is a touching film, though it's not a tearjerker in any way.  In fact, it has a happy ending.  I especially liked the electronic music score used in the film....considering the fact that this is a period film, the electronic score gave the film a unique touch.  It's interesting, the score has become one of the best known and most liked film scores in history.  On another note, a film like this one is almost a relic nowadays.  I personally liked this film (after seeing it a second time).  I thought it was a pretty movie, and I'm in my twenties....but I know most other young people would not like a film like this.  If this film had been made and released now in the late 1990s, it would basically bomb at the box office.  Unfortunately, people no longer admire epic-like movies such as 'Chariots of Fire'.  It's a shame.  This movie has been described by some as a 'family movie'; I think it could be described in that way in the sense that it's a 'harmless' movie. There's no blood/gore, or erotic sex scenes, or anything else that would be considered 'foul'.  This is just a movie that's all about triumph and being the best that you can be.  Yeah, it takes place in the early part of the century, and almost everyone in the movie speaks with a proper British accent (things that would bore most audiences), but it is an outstanding movie.  You won't forget the most famous scene in the movie (which can be seen both at the beginning and at the end of the movie): the scene that shows the men running along the seashore, while Vangelis' score plays in the background.  This movie was very deserving of any Best Movie award that was or could've been handed to it.",Null,1,1,3 October 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Words can't describe this film!
","I saw this film only once, and that was in December of 98,  a few days before Christmas.  But to this day, I still think about it.  Right after seeing it, I walked out of the theater feeling nervous, because of what I had just seen.  This film blended comedy with serious drama (and it was more of a comedy), but it was still powerful enough to bring about intense feelings and much thought in me.  This was absolutely the best film of 1998. It was my choice to win the Best Picture award at that ceremony that I have lost all faith in.  I wasn't too much of a foreign-film fan, but after seeing 'Life Is Beautiful' and 'Central Station', that has changed. People have said that there were not that many good films out in 1998, but I strongly disagree.'Life Is Beautiful' is one of the greatest films that have ever been made.",Null,1,2,27 April 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Not as boring as I thought it would be, but I still forced myself to stay awake.
","This film is certainly not a masterpiece.  Nevertheless, it's not terrible. It's a long and slow-moving film.  As a result, I felt sleepy while watching this film.  But the film was OK.  I don't really understand what Stanley Kubrick was trying to get across with this film.  This is an erotica film, and it's basically all about Tom Cruise's character (I originally thought that the film was going to be more about Nicole's character).  I liked Tom's performance in this film.  I like the way that his character evolves. However, I really was not impressed by Nicole's performance--in fact, there was nothing impressive about the character itself.  At first she's drunk, then she's high, then she's sitting in their nice Central Park West apartment.  In most of those scenes, she shows her naked body.  I didn't like the interruption of the scene where Nicole and Tom are kissing in front of a mirror: during the scene you hear Chris Isaak's song, only to have that scene automatically interrupted and the song replaced with classical music. Another thing I didn't like was the grainy aspect of the film--what was the point of that???  Perhaps what really hurt the film more than anything else was the ending--a disappointing ending that'll make you say 'that's it???' On another note, I thought that the orgy scene was done really well.  The orgy scene was the best scene in the movie--not for its content, but because it was done in a stunning way.  However, censorship destroyed the orgy scene (computer generated 'people' were put in to block the sexual acts taking place in the scene).  Overall this film is, like I said, OK.  Some people say that Kubrick films require repeated viewings to really appreciate and 'understand' the films.  But with this one, seeing it once is just fine.",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The 'magic' is gone
","The first three Harry Potter movies were magical. This movie, however, isn't of the same caliber as those movies. That 'magical' element that was present in the first three movies was lacking in this one. The Goblet of Fire just didn't dazzle me the way that the previous three Harry Potter movies did.I initially was expecting this to be a movie that would top the Prisoner of Azkaban (which, in my opinion, is the best movie of the Harry Potter series) in terms of quality. After all, this movie looked spectacular in the previews. Unfortunately, this movie turned out to be a huge disappointment. The best way to describe this movie is that it was a convoluted mess. It felt like if I was watching several different stories lumped together into one movie. Furthermore, it was a boring movie.The young characters are older now, and the series (as expected) has gotten progressively darker. And, we finally get to see what Lord Voldermort looks like. Still, I wish that this movie had been directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who did a fantastic job directing the Prisoner of Azkaban. Considering that that movie already contained dark elements (Dementors, a werewolf, etc), it would've been nice to see Cuarón wield his creative wand and make this movie even spookier (and more stunning) than the last.I satisfied my curiosity by going to see this movie.

You get to see Julie lose all emotion....and at the same time, she loses interest in almost everything.  Binoche's performance and the innovative cinematography are the best things about this movie.

It's not like I set my expectations too high, because I did not know what to expect from this Matrix sequel. When I first heard that the sequel was going to be released this year, I thought, how more stunning than the original Matrix movie could the sequel possibly be? Well, the astounding action sequences and the innovative special effects that wowed audiences in 'The Matrix' are still there in 'The Matrix Reloaded.' The special effects and the action sequences in the sequel are truly astonishing. But what happened to the intriguing plot that made 'The Matrix' so remarkable? It appears that the Wachowski brothers were more concerned with visually impressing the audience. I guess they forgot that in order to entertain the audience, the movie needs to have fascinating story as well. I struggled to stay awake during most parts of the movie, and I actually felt relieved when the movie ended. The Wachowski brothers had the opportunity to make a sequel that would top 'The Matrix,' but this movie pales in comparison to the original. I'm convinced of one thing, which is that 'The Matrix Reloaded' is not worth all of its hype. The movie was certainly not worth the time and money I spent to watch it. Those are two hours, eighteen minutes, and seven dollars that I will never be able to get back. Based on what I saw in this movie, I will NOT be watching the next Matrix movie.",Null,0,0,24 May 2003

Rosemary's Baby," One of the greatest horror movies
","Whenever I watch this movie, I nearly forget that this is a horror movie. It's because this is such a well-made movie...there is actually a story in this movie and it is told in a captivating way.  Nonetheless, the director, Roman Polanski added just the right amount of suspense and shock to make this a definite horror film.  He did not need to include any gory or intensely graphic scenes in this movie. Yet, the movie is scary enough. This movie stars the great Mia Farrow in an awesome, amazing performance. Angel-faced Mia, turns in a marvelous performance as the tragic heroine, Rosemary.  It was quite a feat for Mia, who was only 22 years old when she made this movie.  She's wonderful as the leading character in this movie, and her transformation in the movie from a doe-eyed beauty to a gaunt waif is startling.  John Cassavetes also does a good job playing Rosemary's ambitious husband who's willing to sell his soul to achieve success.  And, Ruth Gordon is superb as their eccentric, devil-worshipping older neighbor. You can't help but feel for poor Rosemary. She initially believes that those closest to her are people that she can trust.  Little by little, she discovers that all those people are plotting against her, and that she's basically on her own. It's horrible to know that she's surrounded by all of those occult-practicing people, yet she can't really do anything about it...she can only accept it.  One of the best things about this movie is the editing--I really liked the way that certain images were superimposed on some of the scenes.  It was like seeing a collage come to life.  The editing is especially noteworthy during the rape scene.  The rape scene is outstanding, frightening, and spellbinding all at the same time.  It's also worthy to point out that sometimes music can do a lot for a movie.  If a movie is good, the right music can make the movie even better; it can set the appropriate mood for the movie.  That's the case with this movie and it's theme song, 'Lullaby'.  Overall, 'Rosemary's Baby' is a terrific movie.

The Mission," Could've been a perfect movie
","Everyone should see this movie. It is a very well-made and satisfying movie that takes place in South America in the 18th century--a movie about conquistadores, native indians, and Jesuit priests. It stars two great actors, Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro. The costumes and production design are excellent. Pretty good depiction of life in 18th century South America, with its class distinctions and mistreatment of the native indians. The score is wonderful and memorable--it's one of the best scores from a movie. In addition, the cinematography is breathtaking; this is certainly one of the most beautifully photographed movies. However, all of the different speaking accents ruined this movie:  Jeremy Irons speaks with his proper British accent, De Niro speaks with his New York accent, Aidan Quinn speaks with his regular American accent (and his monotonous tone of voice), and then there are all of the other accents. It would've been nice if the director of this movie had required that all the actors speak only with an American accent, or only a British accent. Plus, the movie just moved along too slowly. For a movie of this subject matter, the emphasis should've been placed on making the story as interesting as possible, rather than making the movie just a visual spectacle.

Perhaps the best performance is that of the great Morgan Freeman, as a prison inmate.  And of course, Tim Robbins also shines, playing the lead character.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie.  One particular scene that stands out is the moment when Robbins' character breaks free, and you see him standing in the rain, shirtless and with his arms stretched out.  But what is the most memorable scene is the ending--a fitting ending to this touching and haunting story.  If you haven't seen this movie, definitely do so.

The Thin Red Line," Absolutely beautiful--how can people NOT like this movie???
","I'll never understand why 'Saving Private Ryan' is ranked so highly while 'The Thin Red Line' is so underrated.  I heard bad things about this movie before I saw it.  Some people said it was boring, or too long.  Yet, this is a movie that's just as long as 'Saving Private Ryan'.  I guess what a director has to do in order for the general public to like a film is to throw in a lot of blood and gore, have a lame plot, and show the United States flag at the beginning and ending of the movie.  Terrence Malick did none of those things with 'The Thin Red Line', and that's why this film was not admired and respected the way it should've been.  Also, this film was released in the same year as the overhyped 'Saving Private Ryan'.  I could go on and on about the things that affected this movie's chances for success.  Nevertheless, I was completely mesmerized while watching this film.  I was basically glued to the screen.  This is the first war movie I personally have seen where you truly witness the psychological aspect of war, beyond the typical cliche of seeing a soldier about to go into combat and his main thought is: 'oh, I'm so nervous!' or 'I'm gonna die, I just know it!'  The soldiers in this film question the validity of life and death, and wonder if killing the enemy has improved their own lives.  This film shows that soldiers in combat situations have more than just mechanical thoughts.  Some comments have been made about the many symbols and metaphors that can be seen in this movie.  I really didn't focus on that, but what I can say about the visuals is that the cinematography was astonishing. Beautiful use of colors, particularly of the color green.  Also, the score was magnificent.  And, of course, I was impressed by the performances, which were both natural and touching.  This movie, to me, was a remarkable movie, and I will not forget it.  I consider 'The Thin Red Line' to be one of the greatest war movies I have seen.  I cannot believe that notable movies like 'The Thin Red Line', 'Titanic', 'The Color Purple' and 'Casino' are not even on the IMDB Top 250 films, while ridiculous movies like 'Fargo', 'Blade Runner', 'South Park', and 'Shakespeare in Love' are.",Null,1,3,19 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Astonishingly beautiful!
","Are there enough words to describe just how wonderful this movie is?  'The Empire Strikes Back' is undoubtedly the best film of the Star Wars series--it remains so to this day.  I can't think of a single flaw in this movie.  It's a MAGICAL film. Excellent sci-fi film!  There is so much beauty in this film and it is presented in so many ways: (1)the snow planet at the beginning (2)the eerieness of the swamp planet where Yoda lives (3)the asteroid belt (4)and the cloud city, surrounded by the orange color of a sunset reflected on the clouds.  It also has the best lightsaber fight scene of the original Star Wars trilogy--Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader battling it out, in the bowels of the cloud city, the moment when Luke learns that Vader is his father.  Furthermore, it has one of the best endings in motio n picture history....the final scene that shows Luke and Leia looking out the window of the spaceship, with a galaxy in the background is amazing!  You had to have seen this movie on a movie theater screen to really appreciate it.  I remember seeing this film in a theater when I was a little kid, too young to really understand much of what was going on in the film, but still being mesmerized by the film.  Since then, I've seen this film many times (I even saw it again in a theater during the 1997 re-release), and it has remained one of my top 10 films of all time.  But one truly remarkable thing in this film is Yoda's last line.  Obi-Wan's spirit tells Yoda that Luke is their last hope....yet Yoda replies, 'No...there is another'.  In other words, it left open the question of whether the 'lost' Jedi, Anakin Skywalker would return.",Null,0,0,11 June 1999
Gladiator," An enjoyable mess!
","Talk about an oxymoron! This movie was, in general, a disappointment. Nonetheless, I enjoyed watching it. It started out beautifully. The opening sequence was fantastic! The cinematography, mainly in the first few minutes of the movie, but throughout the entire length of the movie was wondrous. Yet, the story went from interesting and inviting to plain stupid. At first I thought this movie would be a direct remake of 'The Fall Of The Roman Empire', but unfortunately it was not. Somewhere along the line, this movie lost its balance. I think it happened at the point where Maximus leaves 'Germania' in search of his family. It seemed as if the director of this movie tried to take elements from 'Conan the Barbarian' and 'Spartacus', and incorporate them with the main story from 'The Fall Of The Roman Empire'. The fight scenes were astonishing, though too many special effects were used in this movie...at certain moments in the movie I felt like if I was watching 'The Phantom Menace'--ugh! All those things contributed to making this movie a mess. However, I would surely recommend this movie to others. Although this movie is more than two hours long, it's not boring. The most notable thing I can say about Russell Crowe is: America, meet your newest star! For those who weren't familiar with him or his work prior to this movie, prepare yourselves. He's the next big thing--everyone else move over. He's got the talent, the looks, and the presence to become a movie STAR. Also, I liked seeing the great Richard Harris as the emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, I was impressed by Connie Nielsen. At first I thought, why cast a Danish actress in a role that could easily be played by an American or British actress? But she really did a fine job in this movie. In addition, I liked the costumes, though they were too unrealistic, but they were striking. On the other hand, so much money was spent on special effects to show how wonderful ancient Rome was; yet in the entire movie, you only get to see a couple of minutes of shots of the city. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's acting was terrible, though he does have the look of a villain....maybe when he's older he'll make a better villain in a movie. While the ending was very similar to the ending in 'Braveheart', I feel that toward the end, this movie redeemed itself. The last twenty or so minutes of this movie were pretty good. I just might go see this movie again, for the action scenes. **1/2 out of ****. By the way, wasn't that the kid from 'Life Is Beautiful' playing Russell Crowe's son?",Null,0,0,29 May 2000

The site made this movie seem like if it would be an interesting movie, especially since it's a movie that deals with the concept of time travel (supposedly). I finally got around to seeing this movie. While watching it, I was trying to figure out what the heck this movie was about. Was this a movie about a paranoid schizophrenic who has hallucinations? Was this a movie about time travel? Was this a movie about a sinister extraterrestrial? Did the movie have to do with any of that at all? All I know is that I was very bored while watching this movie. What's even worse than the movie itself is the reaction of some of the viewers of this movie. I can't stand reading reviews from people who try to find hidden symbolism or try to look for a subliminal layer in all the films that they watch, when there is none of that. Can't they just watch a movie and review it objectively, for what it is, rather than trying to look for a nonexistent underlying meaning to the movie? A stupid movie is simply that: a stupid movie. A boring movie is simply that: a boring movie. 'Donnie Darko' is nothing but a glorified B-Movie",Null,0,2,6 November 2002
