Blade Runner 2049," A looker, but way too slow
","There are so many intricate reviews already written, so I´m just gonna say that this movie suffers from a lack of pace. It´s not bad, but I left the movie thinking of it´s beauty rather then the story itself. Overhyped but worth watching.",7,1,4,7 January 2018
