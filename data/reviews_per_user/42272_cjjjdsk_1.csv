The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Exploration of key themes throughout
","This film does more than appease the audience with its typical 'feel good' vibe, and uses its character building and setting to explore more than just typical teenage life. The way it incorporates serious themes such as sexual abuse and depression, allows the audience to create a deeper sympathy/empathy for the character whilst also being intrigued in the plot line.",9,0,0,3 July 2019
