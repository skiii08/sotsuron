Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good as I'd expected.
",First of all What was the need of having the oaf Jar Jar in the movie.  He should have been killed.  Next Darth Maul nice paint job but you never really get to know who he is. He never talks he doesn't do anything. George Lucas did an awful job on developing the characters.  I know he is just setting the stage for the next two movies but I will be disappointed will the whole prequel trilogy if I never really get to know any of the characters.One thing I think Lucas did a good job on was trying to figure out who the real queen was.,10,0,0,11 June 1999
