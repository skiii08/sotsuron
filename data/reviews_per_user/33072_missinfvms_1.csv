United 93," go see this movie
",I went to see united 93 today and I can say that it is extremely well done. Through out the entire thing you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. Though most of the movie happens in the various flight control centers you couldn't help but feel as though you had a personal connection to every passenger on that plane. The people in my theater were so engaged they started clapping when the people stood up as one and fought against the hijackers. The end is the most emotionally jerking(obviously as that is when the plane goes down) but it was done very well. No flashy explosion or anything showy; the screen just goes black and a monologue appears on the screen. The last 5 minutes of the movie nobody moved...it was that intense. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 14. I hope you go to see this movie. It will truly show you what it means to be an American and be patriotic.,10,1,7,29 April 2006
