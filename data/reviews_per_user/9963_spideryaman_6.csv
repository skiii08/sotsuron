Requiem for a Dream," Not a movie to watch before going to bed
","I'm like 20 years late, but all I gotta say is don't watch it and hit the sack, trust.",7,1,1,29 June 2019
John Wick," Straight up John Rambo
","I'm already almost 4 years late to the party, and I'm surely not going to hate on this movie because, by now, people probably know what to expect prior to watching it.I've given it 5 because, come on, it's Keanu. Other than this, the story is typical. You will predict the ending after 10 minutes.It's straight up Rambo up in here; guns blazing shooting everyone on sight. I read somewhere the Wick's body count was 84. This is a lot of people to kill in about 2 hours.I'm going to watch chapter 2 anyway. Be careful not to piss off John Wick or break into his house, he once killed 3 armed men with a pencil!",5,4,6,17 July 2018
Hot Fuzz," Almost 8 stars for this one? What?
","Oh dear. When I review a movie it's either great or garbage. This one is clearly garbage. I have watched comedy movies, shows, series, stand-ups, etc. More than I can remember. But this one is plain dumpster fire. All I'm seeing is 9 and 10 stars reviews, did we really watch the same movie? I genuinely smiled once or twice and that's it. I'm reviewing this like 11 years late, and many good comedy movies have dropped ever since, but no, there are 80's movies that made me crack up, so it's not the case.Watch it on your own risk.",2,1,6,22 July 2018
The Disaster Artist," I love how the original movie got a 3 stars rating
","A movie with a rating of 7.5 is talking about a movie with a rating of 3. But seriously, Tommy didn't hit her.",7,0,1,18 August 2018
Joker," Too much hype and free marketing
","People on the internet is the main marketing stream to this movie. Memes and quotes from this movie have taken over, driving other people to fall into the hype. Well, it's average. The only good thing about it is Phoenix, and when the actor solely grants a movie a 6 star review means that he was pretty amazing but the movie itself is really average. I'm not saying it's a waste of time, but just watch it away from the hype and you might actually enjoy it",6,3,5,10 January 2020
Annihilation," It's not their fault to produce such garbage, it's ours to pay them upfront.
","This is the trend nowadays, let's throw tons of unexplained stuff and end the movie with the overused 'open-ended' cliche where the writer(s) doesn't even have to think about how to end it to satisfy people who wasted 2 hours of their time to watch something good.I can't believe that the overall rating here is 7! I mean have you actually watched the movie? I get that some people like to explain everything with philosophy, but come on! It's straight up garbage! Nothing deep about it! They are just taking our money to keep feeding this cancerous genre.Oh, one last thing, when you claim that the protagonist is a former solider, please show this trash to an actual solider so they can point out your mistakes.",2,5,9,16 June 2018
