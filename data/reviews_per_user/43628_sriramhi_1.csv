Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks at his best, once again
","When i read the movie synopsis, I just fell in love with the plot and with Tom hanks at the lead, I was pretty sure that i would be in for a treat. I was not disappointed. An amazing story line with solid performances to back that. The sea life, pirate's attitude, the might of US Navy, it all grows on you. On the negative side, I was not impressed with the background score. The climax was a bit, stretched out and lacked the pace to gel well with the rest. I came out quite happy to see Tom hanks deliver one of the best performances, yet again. The best scene is the one where, he decides to put himself in trouble so as to keep others safe. A must watch for all.",9,2,5,20 October 2013
