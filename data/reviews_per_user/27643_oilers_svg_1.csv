Deja Vu," Good movie, nice effects....but a little bit disappointing
","I liked the movie in general, i had been looking forward to it. There was great effects in it, i liked the 'sci fi' part of it all about going back in time and all that and looking back in the past... great actors, Denzel delivers as usual. But the downfall, which made the movie a little sour for my part was that.. the 'bad guy' shoots at a couple of cars and they blow up (typicall Hollywood), tho 2 secs later a whole bunch of police throws out 100's of bullets in Denzel's car.. No explosions.. since the movie was unrealistic in general, they could have made the rest realistic. I just want an unrealistic movie to be trustworthy",6,1,2,8 January 2007
