Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I've seen the movie twice now, the first time I saw it I thought, 'Wow that was a great movie.' Only the second time I saw it did I realise just HOW absolutely spectacular of a movie it was.
","It seems to me that ever since the original Star Wars every time a movie comes out with beautiful and well done special effects it's been lauded as nothing more then a light show, and now this phenomenon has come full circle.To put it very simply, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was a wonderful movie. It was entertaining, in-depth, atmospheric, and best of all was the wonderful continuity of it.  Oh yes and then there was the special FX... =) Yes those were great as well, probably the best ever done in a film.  Like I said some people (especially critics) seem to discount a film when it has similar dazzling effects, but the effects only escalate the wonderful amazement of the rest of the movie.Many people(especially critics) complain of the lack of character development, well anyone who says that go watch Star Wars: A New Hope once more, and you'll realize that the same amount of character development took place in that one as in this new one.  Development of the characters took place over the course of the 3 movies as it most likely will in episodes 1-3.I've seen the movie twice now, the first time I saw it I thought, 'Wow that was a great movie.'  Only the second time I saw it did I realise just HOW spectacular a movie it was.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
