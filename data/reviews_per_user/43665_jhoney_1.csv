The Rock," Why do I find it so watchable?
","One of the rare films that I never tire of watching, though I almost feel guilty about that. The action is real edge-of-the-seat stuff, but it doesn't do to think too deeply about the credibility of it all. I've never been totally convinced that Goodspeed/Cage really needs to remove the nerve gas capsules from each of the missiles in order to disable their guidance systems, and even though I didn't tour the subterranean parts of Alcatraz when I made my own visit to The Rock, I'm sure I would not have found an Indiana Jones/goldmine-style railroad in the caverns. And just exactly what is that fire-breathing entrance that Mason/Connery crawls through? Enough quibbles, sit back and enjoy the action, the music, and the best car chase since Bullitt. Actually, it's probably even better than that, apart from the one weak sfx of the whole movie, when the cable car is blown into the air. Oops, another quibble.",Null,1,1,26 February 1999
