The Ring," Interesting concept, ultimately flawed
","This movie has a very intriguing concept behind it, but it's ultimately flawed pretty badly.  The main problem is that most of the characters and situations are forced to the point where they simply can't seem realistic or natural at all.For one, take the kid in this movie.  Not only is his character completely unbelievable in the way he acts and talks just like an adult and expresses zero emotion, but he really wasn't even a neccessary part of the movie. He's not the exception either: Hardly anybody in this movie is really a believable character.  First there's the mother who seems rather callous towards her son and is always never-too-flustered that she is going to die in a matter of days after watching the videotape.  Then there's Richard who seems to react to strangers in a completely random and unexplainable fashion.  And then there's Anna and Samara who seem like they're pulled straight out of a German fairy tale or something.  In fact...the only character that seems somewhat realistic is Noah.The ending of the movie leaves a lot to be desired too.  Yes there's a plot twist, but it comes off as more of a cop-out than any attempt to seriously explain anything or bring closure.  It creates more plot holes than it fixes actually.",6,0,0,17 October 2002
United 93," Words can't express
","There's nothing romantic or patriotic or uplifting about this movie. It's just tragic. Tragic because the people in the movie fought so hard, and yet it was all in vain.They didn't fight for their country, they didn't fight for America or you or me or the Capitol building - they fought for one thing and one thing only: to save themselves. This movie hammers that point home with frightening clarity and reality. I would suggest that you don't see it unless you are really prepared to see what happens to people when they are faced with the ultimate choice of killing or dying.The worst part is, you can't just tell yourself that it's 'just a movie' after the final sequence rolls and the screen goes black...",9,0,1,3 June 2006
Spider-Man 2," Overrated.
","* Minor Spoilers *I don't even know where to begin with this movie except to say that it is grossly overrated.It makes no attempt to even create suspension of disbelief. Miniature man-made suns float in midair and are labeled 'nuclear fusion power'. Doc Ock's physics-defying mechanical arms are kept in check by a magical green chip that predictably gets destroyed and makes him turn evil. Peter Parker falls 10 stories onto concrete and gets up and brushes himself off like he's Wiley Coyote. Mary Jane writes off Peter Parker's friendship simply because he missed her play.The plot is trite and predictable. Peter Parker loses his powers and questions his role as Spiderman. Mary Jane questions her feelings for Peter Parker and vice versa. Doc Ock tries to kill Spiderman and Mary Jane.I couldn't help but think, after the end credits began rolling, how much this movie reminded me of the latter Batman movies, which were resoundingly criticized as terrible, yet somehow this movie is praised as fantastic. It makes no sense. 'The best comic book movie of all time' it is not.Is anyone here really going to tell me with a straight face that Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a better villain than Jack Nicholson as The Joker in 1989's Batman? Or that either of the Spider Man movies even come close to the same level of suspension of disbelief or convincing atmosphere as that movie? I don't think so.",5,2,4,27 December 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Don't believe the naysayers
","I am a little confused in regards to the people who complain that 'Dr. Strangelove' isn't funny enough.  But I suppose it's not surprising that some people would feel that way considering that nowadays, most people's idea of comedy consists of movies that rely mainly on shock value and gross-out-factor, with little, if any satirical or commentary value.  In my opinion, Dr. Strangelove is far more daring, controversial, and witty than anything the Farrely brothers have ever put out, especially you view it in the context of when it was released, at the height of the Cold War in 1964 when people were paralyzed with fear at the idea of nuclear holocaust and the end of the world.  Competely brilliant, and still very entertaining today, although obviously not in the over-the-top shock your senses way that so many people seem to be used to...More like a subtle shaking-your-head-and-smiling kind of way. :)",10,1,1,12 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Underrated
","* Spoilers * 'Empire' may be the best of the three movies in the original Star Wars trilogy artistically, but ROTJ, in my mind, is and always was unsurpassed by the other two movies in terms of action and sheer scale. There's just so much happening in this movie as Lucas tries to wrap up the trilogy; there's the rescue of Han and ensuing capture and escape from Tatooine, then the resumption and conclusion of Luke's training, the planning for the assault on the second Death Star, the landing of the infiltration party on Endor, and finally the interleaved 3-way finale between the battle on the surface of Endor, the battle in space, and the final confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor. I think one of the main reasons this film is so overlooked in the trilogy is simply because of the Ewoks, which is a shame. That, in my mind, is something that can be overlooked. Yes, they are corny in some scenes, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And the ending is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy - more so than most other sci-fi trilogies these days seem to be able to manage (i.e. Terminator, the Matrix). Who can forget that scene, with Darth Vader dying in Luke's arms...'you were right about me Luke...you were right...' It's just brilliant, and at the same time, a sad ending to a great epic story of finding one's purpose, not giving up, redemption, and the ultimate triumph of humanity and love over evil. Too bad Lucas hasn't been able to recreate the magic in the new trilogy, though (mainly because the characters suck, in my opinion). ROTJ gets a 9/10 in my book.",9,0,0,3 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Too many special effects, too little character development.
","What made the original Star Wars films so endearing was the colorful characters and the great chemistry between them.  Han Solo, the smarmy, overconfident, reckless smuggler; Luke, the immature adventure seeker; Leia, the overly-reserved, but quick-witted and sometimes temperamental princess; Chewbacca, the clumsy, loyal, easily frustrated sidekick who can't be understood by anyone but Han; Vader, the enigmatic epitome of evil.  Hell even minor characters like Salacious Crumb (the monkey-pet of Jabba the Hutt) were colorful.  The main characters also changed noticably a lot as the trilogy progressed, and that's why we loved them and wanted to know what happened to them...Han became less of a loner and realized some causes were worth fighting for; Luke became less adventurous, more introspective, and more scared of his own destiny; Leia let down her defenses towards Han and matured into one of the main leaders of the Rebellion; and Vader began showing signs of humanity towards his son.None of that magic exists in Episode 2.  Many people blame this on bad acting, but it's not bad acting.  Heck, the first Star Wars had some pretty questionable acting, but it still worked.  In Episode 2, the problem is that the dialogue is just far too rigid and formal for any actor to be able to emote genuinely while saying it.  Because of all this, it just seems like we don't really see the characters develop...they just tell us they're developing.  We, in turn, don't develop any sense of affinity towards the characters in Episode 2 like we do with the original movies because they're just not very human.  It's those little, sometimes funny idosyncracies and witty bantering that make the characters seem real, after all...like Han shouting 'Move it, Goldenrod!', or Leia kissing Luke just to make Han jealous, or Luke shouting 'Threepio!?  Where could he be!!?'.  The only thing driving this film is action and special effects.  Let's face it, Episode 2 is an action movie.  But the greatest of the Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back, isn't great because of super special effects...it's great because of the characters, and apparently it's slipped Lucas just how important the characters are (and the special affects AREN'T).",5,0,0,17 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Someone dropped the ball
","* spoilers ahead *My first thought was 'why did I just sit through 6 hours of cinema for this ending?'  I really don't understand how they could screw this one up...all they had to do was have Neo JUST DESTROY THE DAMN MATRIX.  This movie has one of the worst and most unsatisfying endings since Contact, if that's possible...",6,0,0,5 November 2003
Pitch Black," A routine space transport goes wrong, leaving a band of survivors on an uncharted world
","When I first saw the previews, I thought this movie looked like it had some promise.  I wasn't mistaken.  Quite simply, it's one of the best science fiction movies to come along in a while.The first ten minutes of the movie are completely engrossing, as the crisis that leads to the marooning of the transport is played out.  After crash landing on an uncharted world, the survivors try to find a way off the mysterious planet, where it is always daylight....well, almost always.The acting is particularly good, especially the escaped convict Riddick, played by Vin Diesel.  There's no way this movie would have been nearly as good without his efforts.  (The very sexy) Radha Mitchell also does a great job as the captain of the ship.In conclusion, if you like an science fiction, an intruiging storyline, good acting, and an engrossing plot, then see Pitch Black.  If not...go see End of Days at the dollar theater.",7,0,0,27 February 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Subpar Terminator 2 Rehash
","The thing that struck me most about Terminator 3 was how liberally it borrows from T2. Once again, we're trying to stave off judgment day. Once again, a shape-shifting robot who is sent back in time to kill John Connor, and another Arnold is sent back in time to protect him. There's another vehicle scene, the initial confrontation between the terminators, etc. The problem is, the plot just isn't all that interesting because we've already seen it all done and done better in T2, with better actors too. It's too bad Edward Furlong was dropped from this project because I have a feeling it would have been much better with him onboard reprising his role as John Connor. Having Linda Hamilton and maybe even Robert Patrick would've been nice too. As it was, though, Claire Danes and Nick Stahl just didn't really cut it, in terms of likability or chemistry. Kristianna Loken was not a convincing villain as the T-X either. In a nutshell, I think T3 was a so-so rehash that attempted to one-up it's predecessor and fell flat. You might as well just watch T2 again instead...",5,0,1,17 May 2006
No Country for Old Men," Meandering and somewhat derivative, but still interesting
","The first half of 'No Country for Old Men' comes off something like 'The Terminator goes to West Texas'. All the elements are there: an unstoppable, determined, and soulless killing machine set against a hopelessly outmatched protagonist who is simply trying to stay alive another day. Derivativeness aside, this part of the movie is still quite gripping, though, which is more than I can say for the second half of the film. As things dragged on, I couldn't help feeling a little bored as Tommy Lee Jones' pseudo-philosophical and somewhat redundant sheriff increasingly wandered in and out of the story. Near the end of the movie, the story seems completely lost. The abrupt ending especially feels like the filmmakers ran out of gas and tried to pass it off as authenticness and artistry. It's too bad, because this movie could have easily been a 9 or a 10 based on the first hour or so.",7,9,23,15 November 2007
Blue Crush," Actually not too bad
","A lot of people seem to like trashing this movie because of a supposedly weak plot.  Well let me be the first to say that the plot is a whole lot better than a lot of movies that have come out recently directed at the so-called MTV generation.With that said, Blue Crush is a surprisingly enjoyable movie.  I thought it would be horrible when I saw the movie posters and previews, but it far exceeded my expectations.  I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is because the characters and environments actually seem believable.  It's not just a movie about surfing - it's about how these 3 friends live in virtual poverty trying to support their other lives as part of this surfing subculture.  At the same time, the main character is trying to keep her little sister in school (since their mother abandoned them), and battle her own fears which center around a near-death experience she had while surfing in a major competition that keep her from moving on with her life.  This sort of subject matter isn't exactly the stuff that teen movies are usually made from.  For that reason it is on a slightly higher level.",6,0,0,19 August 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Not even close to being the best war movie ever
","To me, the greatest war movies of all time are those that address the issues of why war is fought to begin with, the psychology of the people who fight it, and human nature in general.  Saving Private Ryan simply does not address any of this.  Spielberg instead packages World War 2 into a neat commercialized container for mass consumption.  The movie, although perhaps more realistic in it's depiction of the violence of war than previous films, has stereotypical and flat characters, little character development, too many stupid one-liners and attempts at humor, and a cliched feel-good ending.  'Saving Private Ryan' is maybe a decent drama, but in no way is it in the upper echelon of war films which ask and attempt to answer the real questions of war.  If you want to see a good war movie which does address the real philisophical issues of war and human nature, and doesn't have a Hollywood-ized happy feel-good ending, go rent 'Platoon' or 'The Thin Red Line'.",8,0,1,24 January 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Most Ambitious Movie Ever
","Many people are turned off by this movie because they don't understand it. In my view, the meaning of the movie is perhaps much simpler than some people think.  What the movie is, in my view, is a philosphical exploration of the ramifications of consciousness and our inability to grasp why we are here in the universe.  If we were created by some force external to us, and we don't know why we are here, what happens when we then go on to emulate our creator(s) and create our own life?  How do we provide answers to our creation when we don't even have the answers ourselves?  And how do our creator(s) provide answers to us when we finally return to them with our own shortcomings?",10,2,5,6 February 2004
Downfall," One of the most important movies ever made?
","Through the decades since the end of World War 2, we've come to regard Hitler and the Third Reich as somewhat of a confusing question mark in history: how could this have happened? This movie, perhaps more than any other, tries to answer that question by presenting a unique view of the last days of the Third Reich. It explores the question of why people can be led so easily into hell and the madness of self-destruction by one man, and one idea. The bunker simply serves as a convenient setting to examine this question: after all, it's only at the end, with death imminent, with time for self-reflection, that we can get a really convincing picture of the motives and thinking of those who were involved. 'Why?': I think that's the central question of this movie. No more, no less. And because of that I think it's one of the most important movies that have been made in a long time, maybe ever.",9,3,7,26 July 2005
Donnie Darko," Not just a weird movie...
","A lot of people seem to feel that, just because this movie has plot twists and is cryptic, that it's being 'weird' just for the sake of being weird.  I don't think this is true at all.*Warning: Spoilers Ahead*Here is my interpretation of the movie:  Frank represents life.  He brings Donnie many good experiences, like love for instance, but also bad things, like an unescapable destiny.  Donnie knows that he is going to die when the world ends, just as we all know that we will die someday. But rather than focus on the good things Frank brings Donnie, Donnie chooses to focus on averting the inevitable, and fails to enjoy the experience itself.  His desire to find the 'meaning of it all' from Frank is analagous to our own desires to find out the meaning of our own lives.  Patrick Swayze's character represents the antithesis of Donnie...he is in denial of destiny, and chooses to live life in ignorance (and teach others to do so) in order to gain 'control over fear'.  The moral of the movie, I think, is that there is a happy medium...accepting your ultimate destiny (death), but at the same time, not focusing on that, and enjoying the experience that life gives you.",8,0,0,28 May 2002
Rock Star," Entertaining Crap
","30 minutes into 'Rock Star', you'll feel like you're watching a made for TV movie.  The entire first half hour is so totally unbelievable and cheesy that you will really start to regret that you rented (or bought) this movie. Thankfully, it does get better after that, but not much.  Even after the first half hour, though, the movie does suffer from it's moments of inability to suspend disbelief.  Probably the worst of this, aside from the first 30 minutes, is the end, when Mark Wahlberg's character simply abandons his hair metal band, and next thing we know he's playing 'sensitive' music in an early-90s coffehouse in Seattle and wearing flannel and sweaters.The mere fact that, historically, grunge was a reaction AGAINST 80's hair metal makes this ending completely laughable.  Personally, I was hoping that Jennifer Aniston's character leaving for Seattle halfway through the movie was a foreshadowing of an ending that would've been much more entertaining: Her character joining the late 80's Seattle grunge scene, and then at the end of the movie (presumably circa 1991) during the 'grunge explosion', she becomes rich and famous and Mark Wahlberg ends up crawling back as nothing but a broken has-been. :)",5,0,1,21 June 2002
