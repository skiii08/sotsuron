United 93," I was cynical, the movie is not
","I waited a long time before seeing this one. Maybe I'm too cynical, but when this movie came out I thought it was too soon after 9/11 and smacked of exploitation. As I write this, we've just passed the 8th year anniversary of the tragedy, and I was finally ready to sit down and watch it.I was pleased to find that the film respectfully and soberly deals with exactly the events of that single flight, and only the events of that single flight with no over-the-top theatrics. In other words, we know the final fate of both the ship Titanic, and the plane United 93, but there is a world of difference between the way those tragedies were portrayed in the respective films 'Titanic' and 'United 93'.Again, maybe I'm too cynical but, it was a damn entertaining film. The plentiful use of hand held camera techniques gives a very immersive feel, making the film overall a jaw clenching experience, as if you are there aboard that fateful flight. Far greater than purely fictional Hollywood fare such as 'Airforce One' or 'Flightplan'.Before I get tons of hate mail, let me state once again, I fully admit, I may be too cynical. Yes, I am talking about 'entertainment value' about the dramatization of a National tragedy. But let me explain.I don't generally buy into most 9/11 conspiracy theories, but I've always had my doubts about the official story regarding the final moments of this particular airliner. Are the events in the film true to life? Is that what really happened? I don't know if it's even fully possible to know beyond a handful of cell phone calls what was going on up there. Clearly no matter what happened at least some of the passengers acted heroically. Clearly it ended in tragedy. But, ask yourself, if a known hijacked plane presumably en route to The White House *wasn't* shot down by military aircraft a half hour after the Pentagon was struck and way more than an hour after both Trade Towers were hit, why not? My point being... is this *the* story? The whole story? I don't know. I kind of doubt it.But it is A story. And one that makes for a pretty good movie. And that is the only foundation upon which this review is based. Is it worth seeing? Yes.",8,1,3,14 September 2009
Training Day," Better than average
","This better than average, hard boiled cop drama is worth seeing.  Although Denzel Washington is always good, he turns in a slightly over-the-top performance that probably shouldn't have won him an academy award, as a LA vice cop who plays loose with the law.  Ethan Hawke is a rookie assigned to him.  In one day Hawke learns that being in blue is not as black and white as he thought it would be.",7,0,10,15 July 2002
Memento," Fascinating thriller from the point of view of a brain damaged individual.
","I highly recommend this one.  It is a thriller, a look at mental illness from the inside out, and a uniquely crafted piece of film art, to boot.  As a thriller, it will keep you guessing, but it's look inside the prejudices and misconceptions people have about mental illness is what makes it really remarkable.",9,0,1,22 April 2001
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Fun movie has nothing to do with Wolverine
","Alpha Flight, Bullseye, The Hulk, Mariko Yashida, Stick, Yukio These names are familiar to anyone who grew up reading the X-Men comics. Specifically they all related directly to Wolverine's back story. They are also all completely absent from the movie 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Wolverine was always a mystery man. That's what I liked about him. That's what *everybody* liked about him. So, I was more than a little skeptical when I heard they were going to be making a movie about his origin story. Instead of the Canadian mountain man who was experimented on to make a Canadian version of Captain America, who survived the procedure due to a mutant healing power, but wwe are served up a guy named 'James' who has bone claws and is some kind of Casca-esquire immortal mercenary who's fought in every American war from the Civil War to Vietnam, with his brother (presumably Sabretooth though called 'Victor' and played by Liev Schreiber rather than Tyler Mane). The Canadian government seems totally out of the picture, and William Stryker (the anti-mutant televangelist from the Graphic novel 'God Loves Man Kills') who is now some sort of U.S. military/government type who is doing mad scientist experiments on mutants for military purposes sort of like the character Henry Peter Gyrich in the X-Men comics (Gyrich you remember was killed in the first X-Men movie by Sabretooth). I can't actually say the film is unenjoyable - it actually is worth it for some fans. Just know that it isn't quite up to the standards of earlier X-Men movies, nor the classic comics. One almost wishes that the creators had spent more time reading Frank Miller's 'Wolverine' mini-series, and less time watching Hong Kong wire work.",6,0,2,29 September 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A mess
","This movie was beautiful to look at, thanks once again to Rick Heinrichs. Unfortunately, the plot is a mess, and none of the character's motivations - save perhaps Cpt. Sparrow's - make any sense whatsoever. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but as you watch this film, pick any character and ask yourself, what is he or she after, what are their goals and why? Add to that a lot of 'boy that was convenient' sort of moments, and you begin to ask yourself, how good a script was this to begin with? On the up side, the acting is decent, the effects are great, and there is even some humor. Just don't try to figure out why anything that happens matters.",6,0,1,2 September 2007
Wanted," Unwanted (possible minor spoilers)
","Angelina Jolie as eye candy cannot save this film about superhuman assassins that get their kill orders from a magic loom. I'm not kidding.In addition to the ridiculous premise that can't decide if it wants to be magic or technology, there are impossible coincidences - incredibly impossible coincidences (can you imagine beating someone over the head with a computer keyboard such that the buttons pop off and spell words in mid air?), plenty of 'gimme a break moments' and a deus ex machina or five.If you want wild action try a Hong Kong action film instead.",4,1,4,24 December 2008
Spirited Away," Do not miss this one
","Nearly flawless animated fantasy film, should take it's place withAlice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz as one of the all timegreats.This story combines a little Joseph Campbell, Greek mythJapanese folk tale, Grimm Fairy Tale, gorgeous renderings, slickanimation and a hearty dose of originality.Highly recommended.",9,0,0,24 June 2003
Cars," Not Pixar's best; still among animation's best.
","Cars Like most digital artists, I was a fan of Pixar before they made their first feature film. In fact, by the time I saw their first short film Luxo, jr. many of us already knew their name from the .pxr (pixar) file format.After a string of top notch shorts, most of us were excited to see their first feature film; the first feature film created entirely on a computer. True to form, Toy Story did not disappoint. Even if you took away the ground breaking animation, the fact that it launched a whole new type of animated film – you'd still have a damn good story. Entertaining even if it had been done with stop-motion, cell, or any other type of animation.But Pixar didn't stop there – for the next decade and a half, they continued to produce top-notch films, both long and short. While few (except maybe Toy Story 2) were as good as Toy Story they were all still outstanding.Which brings us to Cars. Released as Pixar's 20th anniversary film, Cars follows the story of a race car, Lightning McQueen, on his quest to win the prestigious 'Piston Cup'. As usual, there is great animation, fun jokes, and neat cameos. But this time, Pixar failed to win the Academy Award for best animated feature – a category that was practically created for the studio following the repeated snubbing of films like A Bug's Life, and the Toy Story films. This was only the second time since the award was created in the early 2000s that Pixar failed to win. And the loss to Warner Brothers (and previously to Dreamworks) was deserved, as this (and the previous Monsters, Inc.) were neither among Pixar's best, nor the best in the field.BUT, the fact that Cars is still an enjoyable, and even superior film judged in the context of all animated features ever made, or all films ever made for that matter, just goes to show how high Pixar has raised the bar for itself and everyone else.",8,0,0,18 October 2009
Singin' in the Rain," Calculated, pleasant time-waster for the masses.
","This musical was built around the title song. It was calculated to please the masses, and it does. The three leads all turn in fabulous performances, with some of the best dance moves by O'Connor, and some of the finest singing by Reynolds. Of course the best all around singing and dancing is by Gene Kelley, especially performing the title song. You would probably have to have been living under a rock to have been born in the 20th Century and not seen that scene at some point. Noteworthy in that and many other scenes are the long, continuous takes of song- and-dance numbers. They are beautifully shot with no cuts to interrupt the flow. Ultimately, the film is little more than a bunch of dance numbers with a corny plot to string them together. If that's good enough for you - you'll love it. If you want more substance be it romance, drama or what have you, chances are you'll find 'Singin' in the Rain' little more than a pleasant time-waster.",5,4,12,17 December 2008
The Mummy Returns," Bury this mummy
","While the 1999 remake of 'The Mummy' is a far cry from the original film, more adventure tale than horror show, it was not bad in it's own right. This sequel however, lacks the charm of that remake.It quickly throws together the cast of the last film in a plot that could pass the muster if only it weren't bogged down by the addition of a groan-inducing 'cute kid', more anachronisms per minute than one can comfortably excuse, cheesy dialogue and an over reliance on CGI effects.While not all bad, the movie in fact has many great sequences, particularly the fight scenes which are better choreographed than most action films, still although there are lots of good parts in the movie, overall it proves to be much less than the sum of it's parts. Best suited for Saturday afternoon viewing on television.",5,0,0,30 December 2006
The Last Samurai," 'Success is a journey, not a destination' - Zen saying
","The Last Samurai is a strictly by-the-numbers samurai epic set in 1876-1877 Japan. All the necessary ingredients are here - beautiful Japanese landscapes and costumes, larger than life battlefield sequences, and eastern philosophy.Although the pageantry is not as beautiful as such samurai epics as 'Heaven and Earth', it is more than adequate.Do not, however go into this film expecting 'Kill Bill', grindhouse type swordplay nor the poignancy of a Kurosawa piece. Instead, 'The Last Samurai' occupies the middle ground; a human story of one Westerner learning to embrace another culture kind of a mixture of 'Dances With Wolves' and 'Shogun', films from which it derives almost directly. And this is the films greatest flaw. It is utterly predictable. No spoilers here, we all know what happens to the samurai. If not, the title ought to give you a clue. Every scene is one that you were expecting to see. And the ending is the ending you expect.But Zwick and co. still manage to weave an engaging story with panache, and a climactic (despite it's predictability) ending, and that is why 'The Last Samurai' is such a great film. As the Zen saying goes, 'Success is a journey, not a destination'. It is equally applicable to the samurai in the film, and the film itself. A success. 8/10.",8,119,216,30 August 2004
The Descent," Goes deeper than most horror films
","'The Descent' is the story of a group of adventure seeking young women who choose to go caving, but are unprepared, in more ways than one, for what they find in the dark depths below the Appalachian Mountains. The film is like a heady mixture of Ridley Scott's 'Alien', and H.P. Lovecraft's 'The Lurking Fear'.The film is terrifying in a way that most films of the genre strive for, but fail to achieve. Many horror films rely only on often predictable sudden starts to convey their scares, while others rely mostly on gruesome imagery (and some sadly on neither). 'The Descent', however, melds the two in a way seldom seen.But, 'The Descent' is more than just a scare-the-Hell-out-of-you thrill ride; it is also an exploration into the limits of the human psyche. The 'Descent' in this movie is both a literal one and a metaphoric one, and that's what makes it a cut above (or should I say below) most horror flicks.",8,1,3,3 January 2007
Castle in the Sky," Entertaining fantasy film
","I had avoided watching 'Castle in the Sky' for many years. I was aware of Miyazaki's exemplary track record, and have enjoyed several of his films to date. However, I was aware that many of his earlier films were geared toward younger audiences. That, combined with the marketing materials (even before Disney got their hands on it) showed nothing of some of the more exciting elements of the story. All I knew was about young boy who met a young girl who 'fell from the sky', and that the film involved some kind of 'Castle in the Sky'. Sounds like a whole lot of ho-hum 'let's put on a kiddie show' type stuff.Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The story deftly blends magic and technology in an early industrial culture. Yes, the orphan boy, Pazu does meet the orphan girl Sheeta when she fell from the sky - but the reason she fell was no mystical fairy tale reason - she was hanging off the side of an airship, being pursued by pirates, secret agents and the military! Thus begins a rousing chase, and a search for the ultimate weapon - Laputa, an island (not just a castle) floating in the sky.There's action and adventure aplenty. And the film should be of particular interest to the steampunk crowd as it's an early anime influence on the genre. There are a few things you have to overlook, such as attempts at humor both scripted, and ad libbed by the English cast, which fall flat, an annoyingly repetitive musical score, and the inevitable moralizing that gets pretty thick at the end of most anime features. But it's worth putting up with that stuff for the fun ride. Be sure to skip the John Lassiter intro which adds nothing to the proceedings.",7,1,2,21 August 2009
All Quiet on the Western Front," One of the most honest war films ever made
","This movie is based on the book you read in High School. Yeah... I didn't either. But the film is definitely worth watching. It's hard to believe it was made in 1930 - for several reasons. For one thing, the war itself couldn't have been over for a decade yet when they started making it. That alone is impressive. Furthermore, sound hadn't even been in film for very long, and most war films were more fantasy than reality back then... but not 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. No, this film is a brutally honest portrayal of war. And, despite it's age, seems to ring true today as well. It's a reminder that despite all our technological advances, for the front line infantry, war really hasn't changed much for nearly a century. Some call it an anti-war movie, perhaps it is, but not in the blatant way of, say, Renoir's 'Le Grande Illusion'. Mostly it's just best described as honest.",10,2,3,4 September 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," When a bridge becomes a symbol
","At nearly three hours, this is truly an epic film. But it is so well made that you hardly notice the length.Excellent historical fiction set during WWII in a Japanese prison camp in southeast Asia where POWs are forced to help build the Burmese Railway. In the heat of the jungle, tensions build, and basic philosophical differences between the Japanese, British and American approach to warfare come to a head.It is a war film, with action and intrigue, but it also explores themes of duty, honor, goals, motives, leadership and humanity's capacity for creation & destruction.Must be seen in widescreen to be fully appreciated.",9,0,1,31 August 2009
The Green Mile," A case study in changing perceptions
","The Green MileI often tell people when evaluating a film one ought to it in terms of its time. But, in the case of The Green Mile, it's helpful to be able to view this with the benefit of hindsight. Rarely has a film been the object of such changing perceptions as The Green Mile.A decade after the film's release, it's one of the most loved films of the 1990s, and is currently ranked in the Internet Movie Database's top 20 fantasy films of all time, beating out such notables as The Wizard of Oz, Toy Story and King Kong.But it wasn't always so for The Green Mile. At the time of it's release it got mixed reviews by critics – according to Rotten Tomatoes dot com, only about 70% of the top critics gave it a good review.To understand why this is, we have to transport ourselves back to the 90s. The last film to make it to the big screen by both the writer, Stephen King, and the director, Frank Darabont, was a film called The Shawshank Redemption, widely considered to be one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history (just as a point of reference, the Internet Movie Database lists Shawshank as #1 on the list of 250 top movies of all time). Whether or not you agree with that, just understand that Shawshank connected with audiences and critics both in a very powerful way.In addition, The Green Mile was also set during the first half of the 20th Century, and also in a prison – comparisons to Shawshank were inevitable, and given King's hiatus (imposed by a horrible accident), and the fact that The Green Mile was Darabont's follow up to Shawhank, his directing debut, anticipation was at an all time high.The Shawshank Redemption cast such a long shadow over The Green Mile, that it's nearly impossible to find any Green Mile review from the time that does not mention it. When compared to such a monumental achievement, is it any wonder that The Green Mile was found lacking?But, take Shawshank out of the equation, and suddenly the picture becomes very, very different. Judged on it's own merits, The Green Mile is an outstanding motion picture. I'm not going to waste time summarizing the plot, or praising the acting, I'm just going to say that everything about this film is well done, and even though it's 188 minutes long, it's worth every minute. And just like the previous dramas, Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption it ends with one of those brilliant Stephen King lines that both summarizes the journey and hammers home the theme brilliantly.Outstanding.",10,0,1,5 October 2009
The Lion King," Disney's last hurrah in the jungle
","Disney, for all practical purposes, invented the animated feature, and for decades pioneered the genre's significant advances like special effects animation, and the multi-plane camera. The studio was riding high in the late 80s and early 90s with top-notch films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Toward the end of this new Golden Age of cell animation, Disney released one of their best – The Lion King. The film is a little less humorous than past efforts, but it's law-of-the-jungle theme (and some of the characters) hearkened back to The Jungle Book.Like the Jungle Book, we have a child (this time a lion cub), and a tyrant ruler cat wants him dead. (Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Scar in The Lion King even sounds like George Sanders' portrayal of Shere Khan in The Jungle Book.) He's hidden away in the jungle where he befriends some fun-loving, off-the-wall jungle animals that provide not only comic relief, but some of the best songs of the film, before a climactic battle ends the tyrant's rule by fire. In fact, the parallels to The Jungle Book are so prevalent that one could call it a remake. But no matter, just like that film it's highly enjoyable, and a highpoint for Disney. Unfortunately, just like that film, which marked the end of Disney's first Golden Age, The Lion King was the last gasp of Disney's second Golden Age. After this came a long steady, slow decline into mediocrity beginning with well-worn tales like Pocahontas, Hercules and Tarzan, ultimately leading to such forgettable fare such as Treasure Planet and Home on the Range. A hole from which they might never have re-emerged were it not for the saving grace of Pixar.",8,1,1,27 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Redone
","In 'Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens', director J.J. Abrams gives us what he's best at - a good but not great sci-fi film that is entertaining and breaks zero new ground.First of all the entertaining part - the film is definitely that. It limits the CGI overload by including at least a fair amount of practical effects, wisely forgets about all the characters introduced in the horrendous prequels and has a lot of homages to the original series and a few homages to other films (a light saber duel modeled after the bamboo forest samurai duel of 'Shogun Assassin' for example are some of the highlights.Unfortunately it is The. Exact. Same. Story. As. The. Original. 'Star Wars' (now known as 'Episode IV').R2D2 is rounder, Han Solo is blacker, and Darth Vader is younger, but the 'Resistance' looks exactly like the 'Rebel Alliance', the Empire 2.0, 'The First Order' looks exactly like the Empire. There's a creepy bald-headed Emperor, the stormtroopers are the same, and the new Vader-like character dresses in black and wears a mask that changes his voice (for no apparent reason).The plot involves secret plans put into the round R2D2 who is then dropped on a desert planet that looks EXACTLY like Tattooine, where it's found by a female Luke Skywalker type character (probably the daughter of Luke, as it's strongly hinted). When the Empire First Order finds them they have to flee the planet in the Millennium Falcon. They of course visit a cantina just like the Mos Eisley one, and eventually have to get the plans to the Resistance so they can blow up the newer bigger Death Star 2.0.Anyway, you get the idea - the exact same movie remade.Sadly, Abrams is equally as bad at directing deep emotional scenes as Lucas, so the few of those in the film are pretty cringe-worthy. But, at least there are no horrible Jewish or African-American pidgin-speaking stereotypes or obnoxious kids in the film.So basically the legacy of Episode VII is that it helps wash the bad taste of the Prequels away. Shame it has nothing else to offer.",8,1,9,18 December 2015
The Wizard of Oz," The Dark Side of the Rainbow (alternate soundtrack review)
","9 Stars for the movie itself, but only about 4 stars with the alternate soundtrack (read on...) The Wizard of Oz / The Dark Side of the Moon soundtrack In honor of the Wizard of Oz's 70th Anniversary, I decided to rewatch it.However, instead of reviewing a film we've all seen 25 or more times, I decided to investigate the myth surrounding the synchronicity of this film to the 1973 Pink Floyd album, The Dark Side of the Moon. The phenomenon sometimes referred to as 'The Dark Side of the Rainbow'.To begin with, I checked all the 'net sources I could find – most were in agreement, that proper synchronicity is achieved by starting the Pink Floyd disc as soon as the MGM lion roars for the 3rd time. So, with a big bowl of popcorn in one hand, and a Dunkelweizen in the other, I prepared for a psychedelic experience to outdo the finale of 2001: A Space Odyssey or the first I ever heard 'Interstellar Overdrive' (hey, now there's an idea for a pairing).Sadly, I have to say that it did not blow my mind. Twenty years of rumors, and this is what I get? To be fair, I was not under the influence of any unusual substances – O.K., a couple beers, but I do everything under the influence of a couple beers. I suppose that those who do enough of the right drugs can probably find connections in any DVD/CD pairing (Dude, Britney is totally singing the soundtrack to Shindler's List on her debut album!!!) .I will concede that there are quite a few points of synchronicity between the two. They do in fact complement each other – to an extent. But the band members have repeatedly denied any intentional connections between the two, and I for one believe them. What then accounts for this seeming synchronicity? I believe I have an answer for that.To begin with, both deal heavily with Freudian aspects of the psyche. That has been a hallmark of Pink Floyd's music from the beginning. Even after demented genius Syd Barrett was institutionalized, the remaining members of Pink Floyd were keenly aware that Barrett's introspective lyrics were a key element of the band's appeal.L. Frank Baum, for his part wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to be a modern update of age-old fairy tales deeply rooted in the human psyche, and the characters themselves are concerned with primary desires of the id – home (shelter) for Dorothy, courage for the lion, etc. This Freudian connection was deepened by the filmmakers who took an Oz as dream approach, both in dreamlike experiences in Oz (the poppy field for example) as well as the entrance and exit of Dorothy passing out on a bed ('It was all a dream).Second of all, The Wizard of Oz is, let's not forget, a musical. One doesn't need to have more brains than the Scarecrow to figure out that a film based around music is likely to sync up pretty well with another piece of music. And so it does; many of the alleged match up points are song and dance routines. While Dark Side is a great match, I wouldn't be surprised if a pairing with, say, Sgt. Peppers wouldn't provide an equally interesting result.While we're on the subject of myths, I also looked for the other big Wizard of Oz urban legend – the hanged man. Allegedly a member of the cast or crew who committed suicide can be seen in one of the scenes along the Yellow Brick Road. Maybe it would be different if I saw it on the big screen, but all I saw at the appointed scene was an amorphous shape in the deep background that could have been well literally anything! In conclusion I'd say that what this exercise did yield for me was a great bit of nostalgia. It reaffirmed in my mind that both of these two artworks are masterpieces, and deserve undivided attention. I couldn't help but wish I were fully focused on enjoying one or the other.",9,3,5,4 October 2009
