Captain Phillips," i held my pee for the entire because i didn't want to miss a second of it
","I knew tom hanks would deliver his role well, but this time he plays his character perfectly; smart, witty, and real. This movie was one of the most realistic movie I've seen. The emotions were real, the intentions were made clear for even teenage viewers can understand, and the acting is superb. The pirates were fiercely intimidating throughout because of their seriousness and lack of fear. The pacing is exquisite. Tom hanks serves his role. He doesn't develop powers or knew martial arts to kick their asses, but relied on hope and his quick thinking. I was pulled into the movie from start to finish. I didn't want to leave. I was so happy when the ending concluded because it was so good and heartwarming. No it doesn't contain intense violence. It was written for suspense and they did well. I recommend this movie to everyone and please see it",10,1,3,4 November 2013
Frozen," Overrated but not bad
","This movie was exceptional. It's stuffed with clich√©s like Anna's pursuit of love. In the third song 'the first time in forever' she was said 'what if I meet the one?' I rolled my eyes and was not pleased in the direction that this movie was taking. I don't understand who ran the kingdom and how Anna was never outside? After not seeing each other in 10 years, Anna decides to spend the coronation night with some dude she just met instead of talking with Elsa. Elsa was justified in getting mad at Anna for accepting marriage to Hans. I don't like the powers Elsa has. Where did they come from? Instead of the trolls making her forget everything locking her away until coronation they should have told Elsa to just say no whenever Anna wanted her to 'do the magic'. The powers were confusing because they did not explain the powers' abilities. She can do snow and ice. Sounds reasonable but then she can make a dress...a dress. Made from what? She also gained a full face of makeup at the final line of 'Let it go'. I don't like Olaf and he was slightly annoying. He was sort of funny but is a little in-your-face with his introduction. When we were introduced to Kristoff he was cool and calming but I was baffled when he threw an inappropriate joke into the mix. I like him but I knew Hans would be evil once Anna started showing minor affection to him. The rock trolls' answer to Anna's problem was 'an act of true love' I was seriously annoyed because that is as generic as it gets when it comes to Disney. If I want to see a groundbreaking film that people make it out to be I want to see the reasons why it's groundbreaking. It's not as good after watching it 3 times. The ending was weird because Hans' sword did not shatter or dent the ice but the sword shattered. I didn't like that. The plot was unclear and it relied on the soundtrack to make the viewer appreciate the film. I like the tone, music, and likable characters, so it's a 6/10",6,1,4,6 March 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," Ridiculously boring
","I'm sorry, but this movie sucked. The first one was nothing special but this was a drag. The reviews were average to good on meta critic and rotten tomatoes but they were wrong. This movie is really predictable. Once you see the setup to the scene you can basically figure out the whole scene. The characters were more annoying and the plot was presented in an unfunny scene. The only source of comedy was racism and low brow humor. They just reused fat jokes. The new cast member was annoying and no one really developed as a character. The movie tried too hard to be funny and it failed to be funny. I was bored for that movie. The problem was resolved because they're the protagonists even though the Bella's weren't good enough. The rest of the people in the theater were young Tweens and they were the only ones laughing and enjoying it. I'm only 15 and I didn't enjoy it. Most of my gal friends thought it was hilarious but I don't see how. It's good if you're a tween. I'm sorry if you disagree but this movie could've been so much more",3,15,51,23 May 2015
