Casablanca," From a seventeen year old film geek
","I still have so many great classics I've yet to see, but after catching this on TCM recently I can see why Casablanca is so highly regarded. The dialog in this film blows so many modern films out of the water, being at the same time witty, in some cases laugh out loud funny, and powerful. It's amazing how many of its iconic lines have become permanently engraved in film history. This is only the third film I've seen of Bogart's but he continues to impress each time. His delivery of each quick witted remark keeps a permanent grin on your face and he plays the hard boiled 'cool guy' with a heart of gold and a sketchy past flawlessly. I hope classics like this are not lost to my generation brought up on Micheal Bay and torture porn.",10,1,2,15 August 2010
