It," Awful, too much humour and truly terrible story
","5 out of 10. And the 5 is purely down to the amazing sound and picture from this movie. Every special effect, make up and costume were the dogs..... Unfortunately the rest was let down by the child's story book plot. The movie had more jokes than scares, this is meant to be the horror film of the year? Really? I think the director and everyone else except the writer should do the next conjuring or insidious movie. That would be awesome as I was really impressed with what I could see visually. In a nutshell this is a horror movie wrote by kids containing kids with some jokes chucked in.",5,13,30,10 September 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Worst horror movie I ever seen.. It's so hilarious.
",Dog poo in the woods! Who in the right mind rates this move anything above 1star . 92% rotten tomatoes! How on earth? The Truman show meets vacancy. Im blown away how bad this is. I'm speechless shocking story hilarious effects. I just watched a unicorn stab someone. Wake up people,1,1,1,8 October 2017
