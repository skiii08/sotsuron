E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This is why you should see this movie!
","Dude, this movie is an awesome example of great filmmaking. Not only is the story great, the storytelling is fabulous (which ARE two different things, mind you....you can have a great story, yet poorly execute the telling of it), and the kid actors are all incredible. However, I would recommend seeing the original version without all the added scenes and such. To me, there is something significant about seeing a movie the way it was first made. Adding CGI stuff later I think takes away from the cinematic history the movie holds. Plus, the CGI makes E.T. look too cartoony, and less real. It's like at first there's an actual 'thing' there with the actor, being lit by lights and filmed by the camera, and then all of a sudden it switches to something intangible. A digitally created imposter trying to pose as the once 'real' character. Yes the movements and expressions might be slow, or choppy, since it is a puppet, but I'd rather see a movie and say 'Whoah, check out what cool effects they did back then with the technology they had at the time!' than say, 'Well, I have no idea what they were capable of back then because it's all been altered and overshadowed by present technological advances in special effects...' (come on, you all know that's exactly what you think too!). But, even so, the movie itself is still great one way or the other, because regardless of the level of special effects, what matters most is the story! If you'd like to know some other cool things about what made this film so great and so influential to our culture, check out a video I did to invite people to re-watch this movie! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn6heIayYTM it's totally the cheese!
