Ali," travesty
","i have loved the legend since i was a kid. just as i was hitting my teens, he was on his way out via larry holmes. cant tell u how sad i was that day even tho i never saw him 'live' at his peak. i cant tell u how i felt when a biopic was announced. a lot of people disagreed with the choice of will smith, but i knew he would b very good, because we need someone who has that certain something, which will smith has. even tho hes all the wrong height/type etc. and when i read that michael mann had stepped in 2 direct, it seemed like a marriage made in heaven. 4 2 long people have 4gotten who and what muhammad ali was. simply put, a living legend and the greatest sportsman who ever lived, and thats not just my opinion, but a fact. when i saw the film. disappointed, no. gutted, yes. how could the perfect pair screw it up so badly? that certain 'something' that attracted everyone, and i mean everyone without prejudice 2wards him was totally non existent in this movie. again, a 'hollyood' biopic of a black man was filmed with the violins playing in the background. he suffered yes, but did it dent him? hell no! thats what makes him an extraordinary fellow, as if he knows, mans, and his own life is but a mere journey in the great scheme of things. altho the recreation of the fights was very good, everything else, and i do mean everything was totally misjudged. it just seemed like a long boring trudge thru an extraordinary life. professional people were drawn 2 him because of his total command of his chosen profession, but everyone else, because of his humour, and childlike innocence. even if u hated the man, which a lot of biggots did, even they could not deny that was capable of putting a smile on their faces. even 2 this day, people will cross continents 2 b in his company, if only 4 a few minutes. but would u want 2 spend anytime with the muhammad ali from 'ali'? don't think so.",Null,0,0,19 May 2004
Troy," a silly little film
","helen of troy launched a thousand ships. in which case brad pitts achilles could easily launch a thousand titanics. its hard to see a movie where the lead guy is prettier then the supposed 'most beautiful girl in the world'. troy is a fable of heroes and immortality. and it feels like a stage drama from the start. some of the dialogue is absolutely cringe inducing. i don't know whether the story has been oversimplified for mass popcorn consumption, but everything is explained at every turn. misplaced dialogue is spoken when a simple look or directorial frame would have been enough. there is a great story in there somewhere, but never for one instance do you feel lost in the drama, you know you are watching a movie, mainly because everything seems misplaced, especially brad pitt, who is totally miscast as achilles. he is simply too ... American. the film finishes with the voice over ' i lived in the time of achilles' but nowhere in the film is the impact of achilles felt. troy only comes to life near the end after the death of prince hector, played by eric bana, who outshines brad pitt's posturing in every frame, and only because of some fantastic acting by the great peter o'toole as king priam, mourning the loss of his son and heir. lets hope next years Oscar has his name on it. diane kruger as helen is pretty, but too inexperienced an actress to pull off one of the great literary figures. where 'gladiator' felt real. this feels strangely pretentious and uninvolving. life is lived. only in hindsight does it become a parable.",Null,1,2,13 June 2004
Clash of the Titans," Ripped off for paying for non existent 3-D
","OK i don't really want to say anything regarding the film, as it was directed by the man who bought us 'the transporter' series and ruined 'the incredible hulk' .so what did you expect? saying that the film isn't actually all bad, although you feel its been cut to get as many butts on seats as possible. but my main gripe is that talking about chasing money, there was no reason for this film to be in 3-D! there is not one 3-D effect in the whole entirety of the damn thing. they are chasing the avatar whirlwind but re-jigging this in 3-D, and charging more for the honour of wearing silly glasses while watching a flat film! the main thrill of the original were the final harryhausen effects, in the Medusa in particular. in this Medusa comes across like the 'scorpion king' in mummy 2. obviously rushed and completely ruined the scene chewing effects of the original. worth it only for Mads Mikkelson, who was also the best thing in 'casino royal' save your money and wait for the DVD",7,0,2,14 April 2010
The Last Samurai," total cop-out **may contain a spoiler**
","i remember when i saw 'gladiator' i feared that maximus would not die at the end, as he should have because hollywood bigwigs would want him to fight another sequel. thank fully it was directed by an englishman and starred an australian and he did die and the film became a masterpiece. i had my reservations before watching 'last samurai' not because it starred tom cruise, but because it is directed by ed zwick, the ultimate mills and boon director as anyone who has seem the brad pitt lovefest 'legends of the fall' will testify. but you know what? i was pleasantly surprised, and as an hour passed by i totally forget ed zwick was at the helm and the film started falling into place. alas, the pleasure was short lived. this film had 2 things going against it. tom 'happy ending' cruise and ed 'homoerotic' zwick. after spending over 2 hours watching the film head towards a majestic finale, just before the end....someone cops out!    'hey we cant let tom cruise die'   ' yes but its like baghdad in that field'   'i know, well kill every jap but keep the toothy american alive so he can tell the emperor about honour ... and he gets to keep the girl'   'but that doesnt sound right'   ' will add on another $50m to the box office'   'ill go tell tom and ed'   hence the  death scene is drawn out like a pantomine, losing ken watanabe the oscar in the process. that bit with the token female just rang hollow throughout the film as the japanese are a very closed people, and the idea that theyd let a foreigner, especially an american mess around with a dead samurais wife just didnt add up. as good as it was, they totally blew it in the last ten minutes. so, i cant help thinking of 'gladiator' if tom died in a hail of bullets along with the samurai, because lets face it, thats where the bottle was taking him, this would no doubt become a mini masterpiece. as it stands, its hollywood fluff.",Null,0,1,15 May 2004
300," a fascist wet dream
","300 is based on the ancient legend of 300 spartan warriors defending the honour of Greece against an insurmountable Persian foe. a handful of Spartans who held out against the invading Persian forces until the Greek army arrived, hence, their gallantry passing into myth and legend. the film 300 is based on a comic reading by famed author frank miller. i have not read the comic, therefore cannot comment. the film itself was no doubt made with the current occupation of Iraq in mind. hence, it will play incredibly well in the American mid-west. to the rest of the world, sadly, it plays out as the few in Europe, who stand up to the many in Asia. this being mentioned time after time in one of the many gallant spartan speeches. the sacrifice of the few for the 'freedom' of the many. all the Spartans look like buff models, the archetypal bronze male of Greek mythology, with a six pack to a man. yet, the Persians are all faceless. where they are lucky to show physical attributes, be they negroid, oriental or plain semitic, they are hideously deformed, to a man. even their leader, Xerxes, stands 10 feet tall and proclaims to be divine. its not a bad film if you are blind to the blatant racial undercurrents. the Spartans look so gallant as they cut down the Persian foes, and so sad when when of them falls, all done in lovely slo-mo. even the queen makes a last ditch speech to the senate for a final 'upsurge'. but it is all just so terribly one sided, not to mention totally unbelievable. the ultimate in right wing fascist fantasy.",4,5,13,22 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," better then private ryan
","you know this film is so much better then saving private ryan. ryan stands and falls with its opening sequence. as good as that was, but the rest consisted of reminding americans that there was a war 60 years ago. but this is a different beast. a spiritual beast. a meditative beast. they say war, for fighting men, is long bouts of boredom, intercut with intense violence. when the violence does come, its more surprising, because its so relentless. but in between what it does show, is the world has always been here, and will always be here, even after mankind has totally destroyed itself, only to go back into the earth from which he came. in a word, beautiful.",Null,0,1,25 February 2004
