The Avengers," Totally Satisfying
","The Avengers, a movie based on very popular Superhero comic book characters. The key word being 'Comic Book'.This movie hits the nail perfectly for every comic book fan & Superhero Fan in existence. I mean you have Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America & Thor all brought to the Life in vivid explicit detail. Personally, I'm a comic book reader (an avid reader actually) & I never in my wildest dreams thought something like this would be made. A lot of comic book adaptations kinda miss their mark completely- they end up being totally revamped or 'matured' (I hope you understand what I mean by this- sometimes it works like in the Dark Knight) but thank Goodness! This movie is straight up for the fans. What more could you ask for?I tell you seeing the Hulk actually being the Hulk & watching a comic book movie actually delivering the action just like a comic & even better- is truly a rare thing indeed. Especially for these type of comic books.One other important thing ... if you don't know who Bruce Banner is or the name Tony Stark & perhaps have never heard of MARVEL... Please, don't even bother. This movie will just be another Popcorn flick for you or worse... (the stuff happening in this movie will just fly straight over your head & you won't even begin to understand what's going on)",9,1,4,6 July 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Absolute Masterpiece
","This film has Elves, Orcs & Dwarfs... & many other creatures. I just had to get that out of the way because movies like these cater to a very specific taste... & that is Fantasy. You either watch Fantasy films or you don't.This movie, directed by Peter Jackson & adapted from the legendary books by J.R.R Tolkien is done absolutely brilliantly. If you're unfamiliar with J.R.R Tolkien, he is the author of the classic Fantasy novels- The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit- both of which have been made into grand epic movies & all of them directed by Peter Jackson.It's great that stories like these are given to Directors who really really love their craft & can get into the thick of creating a tale of this magnitude that they literally start resembling some of the key characters (Peter Jackson eventually looked like a Hobbit after Production )The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy & The Hobbit trilogy is amazing & watching it gives you an appreciation of the dedication & commitment involved in bringing something like this to Life. These movies will go down in History as true Epic Fantasy masterpieces that will delight viewers for all time.",10,5,9,5 July 2014
