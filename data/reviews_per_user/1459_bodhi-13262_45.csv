Blade Runner 2049," Blade Walker
","The highly anticipated sequel of Ridley Scott's 1982 classic, 'Blade Runner 2049' has finally landed audiences into the not-too-distant future.1. To be brutally honest, this film is as boring as they come. I understand just how much of a fan base the original has garnered, but this is by no means as great of a sequel as critics say it is. The story surrounds a young BladeRunner named 'K' (Ryan Gosling) who uncovers a mystery that sets him on a path to find the rogue Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). As far as a plot, this film suffers from severe lag very early on that makes you not care about the story only when it's gonna end. This is the first in 2017 that I sat through a film and kept checking my watch wondering when this slow- burn of an uninspired film will be over. The trailer and every promo for this film misleads you into believing that this would be action- packed or entertaining in the least. 2. The only note-worthy person and performance in this is (not surprisingly) Harrison Ford. He unfortunately first appears 90mins into the film which really is a mark against it since he's the best actor in the cast. I have no idea why Ryan Gosling continues to receive major Hollywood roles considering he's a terrible actor, who's literally a waste of space. Even worse, Jared Leto has less screen-time in this than he did in 'Suicide Squad', but his role as Niander Wallace is so lifeless, that I didn't care for him one bit. Only because I have a huge crush on Ana de Armas, I'm willing to let her hollowed character slide on this one;) Apart from the two main leads, everyone else has limited to extremely minimum screen-time, although there was no need for anyone else to embarrass themselves.3. I honestly had to rename this movie 'Blade Walker' because there are countless shots of Ryan 'No-Talent' Gosling, slowly walking toward inanimate objects for no reason at all only for the sake of killing time. The visuals are the only interesting things in this lackluster film. The production design is phenomenal and it's sad that there wasn't a more entertaining story set in this world. The action finally comes in the last 30mins of a 160min film, and those sequences are pretty underwhelming altogether. I don't blame anyone for leaving the theater at any point before the end. I wasn't that impressed by the pace of the first film, but this sequel is even slower. I hate constantly repeating how painfully slow this film is, but I must warm everyone who wants to see this, it's painful to watch.Sicario is one of my favorite films, but Denis Villeneuve has really let me down as a director this time. I hate this film for being such a waste of time with an unnecessary lag which is unforgivable. If not for Harrison Ford and the visual style of the film, I would literally label this as utter bullsh#t!!!",2,26,74,7 October 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Better the 'Monster' you know;)
","'10 Cloverfield Lane', serves up the chills, suspense and ultimately the terror.This movie has the eerie feel of that of a classic 'Hitchcock' film. The creepiness is first brought on by the incredible performance of John Goodman (Howard) who, if anyone else, couldn't bring this interesting character to life.John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett) plays a humble and funny farm-hand trying to make the best out of a bad situation, and the beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) just happens to be the wrong girl in the wrong place at the wrong time, basically. They both have an interesting dynamic especially when they interact with the mysterious Howard. Winstead is ultimately the audience avatar as the movie progresses.The two younger characters do have a number of tension filled scenes with Howard all the while contemplating just what is happening outside the bunker. All in all, it's Howard's word against there's as they all try to get along and abide by his strict rules. They basically ask the same question the audience will be asking; 'What is going on out there?'Be warned though, the conclusion and answered questions will have viewers divided. Personally, what happens on the outside isn't as scary nor suspenseful as the events which take place with all three characters locked in the bunker.If this is to be compared with 2007's 'Cloverfield', this film surpasses it massively and it gets an extra thumbs up from me just on the count that there is no use of the God-awful 'shaky-cam';)",7,2,4,28 March 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The 'Force' may be strong, but it hurts.
","'Rogue One' is the prequel to 'A New Hope' and the sequel to 'Revenge of the Sith'. Confused yet?......I know. I don't consider myself to be a huge 'Star Wars' fanboy, but I do have respect for this property and have seen all the films up to this point. So I will try to be as fair as possible in this review.1. Coming off his failed attempt at revamping 'Godzilla', director Gareth Edwards does an exceptional job with handling this movie. It was hard to believe, but Edwards does in fact prove himself to be the breakout director of 2016. Some of the shots in this film are beautiful, especially when it pans over the vast landscapes. The set-pieces are amazing for the planets that they travel to, and the production design is incredibly creative. ILM just gets better and better with developing CGI, which leads to amazing generated imagines, especially with the Starships and the infamous 'Death- Star' during the climactic battle scene.2. My first complaint comes in the form of the characters and their acting. I am in no way a fan of Daisy Ridley's performance in 'The Force Awakens', but she overshadows Felicity Jones (Jyn) as yet another lanky British female lead with family abandonment. I know Jones has proved herself as being an exceptional actress, but there's nothing that special about her here. The same goes for Diego Luna (Cassian), but the performances in general are not that outstanding except for a few supporting characters. However, the humor displayed by the droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk), makes him a sheer scene-stealer throughout.3. I must say, this film is probably the darkest of the saga thus far, which in turn plays to it's advantage. It's not as heavy-handed on the action until the last third, and I appreciate the fact that they saved the best surprises for last. Although, I personally felt that the film took a little too long to build the momentum in the beginning, but gladly it picks up. I must warn audiences though, with a dark tone comes sad and depressing moments. Not saying it's a bad thing, but many characters face tragic deaths throughout. With the stakes being so tense and the tone so dark, the film lacks the element of fun excitement, which can be a problem for some.4. The true show-stopper of this entire movie is indeed Darth Vadar himself, voiced by the returning and legendary James Earl Jones. He is by far the greatest villain in cinematic history, and he is scarier than he has ever been every time he graces the screen. Ben Mendelsohn (Krennic) is the actual antagonist of the film, since Vadar's role is technically supposed to be a cameo/guest role. Mendelsohn does a great job, but not as a hands-on bad guy. The chances that this movie takes and it's badass moments, pushes it past 'The Force Awakens' for me, cause it is actually better. Once you can look pass the tone, it's truly enjoyable.'The Empire Strikes Back' still holds the mantle, but 'Rogue One' comes in as a solid third just behind 'A New Hope'. Prequels usually don't feel as natural as they should most of the time, but this flawlessly transitions it's was into 'A New Hope' by the very end.",8,1,5,30 December 2016
Zootopia," Try Everything:)
","'Zootopia' is the latest Disney animated feature that tells the story of a daring bunny named Judy Hopps (Gennifer Goodwin), who becomes a police officer in a city of civilized animals.1. Walt Disney pictures has outdone itself once again with this film. The animation and level of creativity put into a movie like this is simply incredible. The design of the city of 'Zootopia' itself is amazing beyond belief with sections of snow, desert and rain forest for specific animal residents. The last CGI animated film that featured animals in a civilization that was this good came in 2011's 'Rango'.2. The story-line (besides Judy becoming an officer) in centered on a string of missing animals that have gone savage. Against the wishes of her commanding officer Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), Judy is tasked with finding a missing Otter, but is unwillingly joined on her quest by a suspect and street-wise Fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). It's really fun to watch this unlikely duo help each other solve this mystery.3. Bateman steals the show just by how sarcastically funny he is in the way his character Nick interacts with Judy and his take on society as a whole. You wouldn't expect much action from a film like this, but there's a lot. In my experience, there weren't many laugh-out-loud jokes, but you get chuckles and delightful moments throughout. There is just an unbelievable majority of cool things here and there that it's hard to mention them all. Besides the Pixar films, this surely stands as a soon-to-be classic for Disney animation that topples the likes of 'Tangled' and everyone's beloved 'Frozen'. Shakira also appears in the film as an animal pop-star called 'Gazelle', who dishes out a terrific song entitled ; 'Try Everything', that leaves a mark even more so than 'Let it Go'.",9,4,10,27 April 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty is found within:)
","'Beauty and the Beast' truly is a wonderful 'Tale as old as time', that enchants audiences to this day with a terrific Disney classic.1. The story itself is adapted from the classic French fairy-tale of the same name, but of course things are modified to fit Disney's interpretation. Some of the best things include the wonderful added characters to the tale; Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts and of course the adorable Chip. Although not included in the original tale, Gaston is by far a fantastic addition and perfect villain for the film. He is the complete opposite of the Beast, who is hideous on the outside yet has a heart of gold and kind soul within, unlike Gaston who is beyond handsome on the outside, yet ugly and cruel within.2. The focal point of the entire film, is of course the beautiful Belle (Paige O'Hara) and the Beast (Robby Benson) himself. Disney's infamous animator Glenn Keane does an exceptional job creating the Beast. He is impressively combined with other animals to fit his build, such as; the arms and body of a Bear, the legs and tail of a Wolf, the mane of a Lion, the tusks of a Boar, the sloping head and horns of a Bison and the eyebrows and expressive eyes of a Gorilla. You can't help but fall in love with Belle, due to how humble and caring of a young woman she is. Hence the reason she's the undeniable Beauty who tames the angry Beast.3. As with most Disney animated films, the musical score and numbers are simply incredible. Disney veteran Alan Menken, is responsible for the wonderful musical compositions heard in the film. The two most outstanding numbers are; 'Be Our Guest' and of course the forever classic 'Beauty and the Beast'. The latter song (sung by the talented Angela Lansbury) is first heard in the incredible ballroom dance sequence. Back in 1991, the visual animation in this film was by far ahead of it's time, the ballroom in particular. The 3D version of the film is highly recommended since it emphasizes (even more) the gorgeous imagery.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a directorial job of sheer perfection. Everything about this film works on all levels, and I dare anyone to find a single thing wrong. My only regret is that Walt Disney himself passed away before this wonderful tale was released.",10,2,2,31 May 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," All hail the 'Lord' of Thunder!
","Asgard's time has finally come as 'Thor: Ragnarok' not only completes its trilogy, but unleashes destructive entertainment and proves to be the biggest game changer in the MCU thus far.1. Following the events of 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to Asgard after his failed quest to locate the infinity stones. Learning that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is still alive, he also discovers that Hela (Cate Blanchett) the Goddess of Death has come to claim the throne and lay siege to the peaceful realm. When both brothers are isolated on the scavenging planet of Sakaar, Thor must enlist the help of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) in order to save Asgard and its people from Hela's rule. Though not the most original plot, the fall of a hero and his quest for redemption is always fun to see. MARVEL continuously has a knack for telling the simplest of stories in the most entertaining way, and this is no different.2. Having never been a fan of the first two films, this is indeed the best of the bunch. Not only is it funny and action-packed, but also the most visually stunning film MARVEL have made so far. Ever since 2014, most audiences have been hung up on the comedic and unique style of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', and now I can safely say that 'Thor Ragnarok' is better in every way to those films. For a director handling a film of this scale for the first time, Taika Waititi is no short of a pro. He clearly implements his own style here while removing the dark tones of the first two and replacing it with a more lively and upbeat setting. Waititi's choice of cinematography and production design is nothing short of breathtaking. 3. I never thought portraying the character of Thor showcased Chris Hemsworth's acting ability to the fullest extent, but I was glad to be proved wrong this time. Hemsworth shows a different side to his character ranging from emotions of fear to exceptional humor. The chemistry between both he and Ruffalo lends to some of the more funnier parts of the film. Jeff Goldblum as 'Grandmaster' heightens the comedy aspect while Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie showcases a more serious tone. And of course, how could we forget the ladies' favorite, Loki himself. Tom Hiddleston can do no wrong as he never loses the charm, charisma and overall mischievous nature of Loki. On another unrelated note, Scarlett Johansson needs to move over because Cate Blanchett sizzles the screen in her skin-tight costume as the unbelievably sexy Hela;)4. If I had any problems, the first would be that some of the characters felt underused. Idris Elba returns as Heimdall, but only serves as a single purpose to the plot. Worst of all, Karl Urban as Skurge could well have been non-existent. We all know Urban is a good actor, but he literally has nothing to do but stand next to Cate Blanchett and look intimidating. Only at the very tail-end of the film does he actually attempt to do something, but that's over in the blink of an eye. Other CGI characters (seen in the trailers) such as Korg, Fenris Wolf and Surter all makes appearances in this film, but I won't say what their involvement in the plot is since this is a spoiler free review. Other than a slight overuse of the 80s soundtrack, this is an all together/well crafted film.Although not the best MCU film, it is by far the best outer-earth one. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' still ranks as the best superhero and MARVEL flick of the year, but this is a close second. Be sure to stick around for the first post-credit scene at least. While short, it sets up 'Infinity War' more than any other film in this phase. The Guardians may have a talking raccoon on their side, but in the words of Tony Stark, 'We have a Hulk!'",8,2,6,3 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," 'With great POWER......comes a GREAT f#%king movie!!!.'
","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' unleashes a whole new bag of tricks as the webcrawler swings his way back onto the silver-screen, but this time......he's (finally) part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With Sam Raimi's 2002 film and it's sequel being the most highly praised incarnations of the character, does Spidey have a successful rebooted homecoming?1. Following the events of 'Captain America: Civil War', Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns home (after his bout with the Avengers) to fight crime in his neighborhood of Queens NY with a brand new/hi- tech spidey-suit courtesy of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) himself. Eager to impress Mr. Stark and join the Avengers, Peter unexpectedly crosses paths with the ruthless Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his associates, who are hell-bent on stealing parts and manufacturing advanced weaponry to sell on the black market for millions. For the most part, I had no problem whatsoever with the plot and found myself utterly compelled by the story even though it was quite simple.2. As much of the Tobey MaGuire fan I am, all props to Tom Holland. He highly impressed me with his short stint in 'Civil War', but now he has proved why he is the definitive Spider-Man. Never before has the character been this true to his comic-book incarnation. Holland portrays him with just the right amount of humor, quirkiness and level of emotion that the character of Peter Parker truly is. Even though you see him appear in all the trailers, Robert Downey Jr. isn't in a majority of the film as it would seem. He serves just the right amount of screen-time while playing the pivotal role of Peter's mentor. Also, Zendaya's character of Michelle doesn't have a large role in this either.3. She obviously will play a bigger role in the sequel, but as for now, she gets about several minutes of screen-time total. Laura Harrier (Liz) however, is more of the female lead in this (next to Marisa Tomei), as Peter's love-interest. Jacob Batalon fills the comedic shoes as Peter's best friend Ned. The two have great chemistry and they both add most of the humor in this film. Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan, who's job this time around is to baby-sit and monitor Peter to ensure he doesn't get himself into trouble......which he ultimately does lol. The main thing is that they all feel like real people dealing with real-life problems at times which everyone can relate to.4. You can't have a great Hero without a great villain, and Michael Keaton hits a home-run as the film's antagonist Adrian Toomes/The Vulture. He's scary, ruthless and yet you still sympathize for him when you learn about his motives. Apart from Sebastian Stan as 'The Winter Soldier', Keaton stands out as one of the better villains the MCU has delivered thus far. Bokeem Woodbine appears as the secondary antagonist Herman Sholtz/The Shocker, and there are hints of other popular Spider-Man villains, but this review is spoiler free so I won't name them of course:) As shown in the trailers, Chris Evans does make a few cameo appearances as Steve Rogers/Captain America, but only in some funny P.E. instructional videos.5. The dialogue is very humorous as it should be and the editing gives the film a nice flow to where I didn't feel the length. All of the action sequences were surprisingly great, especially scenes with the Vulture. It's fun to watch Spidey screw up, but he is amazing when it comes to all his spectacular stunts and web-slinging. The film isn't flawless though. Marisa Tomei felt underwritten to where she was a little too forgiving of her nephew's suspicious behavior/antics and once again, she never comes across as anyone's aunt. The climax was great, although I felt it refused to take an emotional approach and instead ended it generically. The very last scene of the film was pretty cheesy to be honest.The movie sets up a (respective) sequel but it doesn't aim toward 'Infinity War' as one might think. There is an unexpected cameo by a female character with hints of previous MCU films throughout, so pay attention. Director Jon Watts does an excellent job here, and this is the kind of superhero flick that I would pay to see again.",8,3,9,7 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Don't forget, we're the bad guys.
","'Suicide Squad' was undoubtedly this summer's most anticipated movie since it's announcement a couple years back. Does it live up to the hype and break the critical curse of DC? For something to start with such promise, it sinks faster than the Titanic:(1. From the moment the film begins, we get a rather cohesive introduction to all the villains imprisoned at 'Belle Reve'. I was impressed to see how well things were balanced as we get flashbacks and brief back-stories of all these characters. It's obvious at this point that Batman (Ben Affleck) appears in the film, and it's also no surprise that he's the reason why most of the inmates at 'Belle Reve' are locked up. We especially see how Batman captures Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) in flashback sequences. There is also a pretty cool cameo by 'The Flash' (Ezra Miller) in the segment where Cpt. Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is captured by him. All in all, the film has a strong opening that really pulls you in.2. The initial plot follows the events of 'Dawn of Justice' in the wake of Superman's death, which prompts ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to assemble a response team called 'Task-Force X', in the event that other threatening super-beings were to invade earth. Coincidentally, a new threat emerges in the form of a possessed bitch called 'Enchantress' (Cara Delevigne). At this point the foundation slowly starts to crumble, beside the fact that the character of June Moone/Enchantress is so f#%king unlikable and that there is a sickening love-story between her and Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnamen). I also hate Cara Delevigne as an actress, and she really adds to my belief here from all the popping' n lockin' bullsh#t choreography the Enchantress has. 3. We never really get a proper understanding of how or what Enchantress is using or doing to destroy the world apart from the fact that she creates a green halo in the sky. If you think what I said sounds clichéd, the bitch also unleashes her brother 'Incubus' (who is just a tall and terrible CGI creature) and transforms the remaining people of Mid-Way city into black, face-less (literally) and non-threatening mutants, who's only purpose is to serve as a reason for there to be a couple action sequences in which the squad haplessly takes them out. The threat in this film just proves that the story was terrible on the part of writer/director David Ayer. It's sad, cause you'd obviously expect more from the guy who wrote 'Training Day, Harsh Times & Fury'.4. Viola Davis seems more like the real threat in this film, because she plays Amanda Waller as ruthless and cunning as she should be. Will Smith as Deadshot connects you more than any other character in this film. Smith has a natural charm that he brings to every role, and it's hard to not feel for him when you see his story and the struggle he has to be with his daughter. Joel Kinnamen (Rick Flagg) had a good structure at first, but he proves to not be much of a badass as we think, and we soon realize he's literally just chasing the p#ssy. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) had some promise latter in the film until he (for no apparent reason) bursts into a flaming CGI monster at the climax and leaves you utterly confused.5. For the one person that hardcore fans have been waiting to see since Heath Ledger's portrayal, might have to wait a little longer to be honest. The Joker (Jared Leto) unfortunately has less than 15mins of screen-time in a movie that's 123mins long. He appears in a few flashbacks as well as being intertwined in the initial plot, but we still never get a proper grasp or feel of what his character is all about. Jared Leto is undoubtedly an amazing actor, but he is completely sidelined in an already clustered film. Harley Quinn falls down the middle for me cause she was never really a character I cared for even in the cartoons and comics. However, the relationship between her and the Joker was by far the most interesting aspect of this film btw.Talk about falling short of the glory, a saying which perfectly summarizes this film. I can honestly say that 'Dawn of Justice' and 'Man of Steel' were by far better films than this (no matter by how little). Zack Snyder can no longer be solely to blame for lack- luster DC films, but here's to hoping Patty Jenkins, James Wan and Ben Affleck can save this cinematic universe.",5,0,2,7 August 2016
Doctor Strange," What doesn't kill you, simply makes you STRANGE.
","'Doctor Strange' is the latest hero and film added to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With great power comes strange abilities, and boy does this film deliver elements of the weird:)1. To start off, 'Doctor Strange' is the definition of a 'good' movie, and that's pretty much all I can say about it. The one and only thing that makes this film stand out are the visuals and unusual powers the characters possess. In no way is it horrible, but it falls short of being something great since the world of Doctor Strange had damn near unlimited possibilities. We've seen the science and fantasy before, but this film deals particularly with magic and the supernatural. I can easily compare the tone of this movie to 'Thor: The Dark World', where it's satisfying but just okay.2. Apart from the journey of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to find the Ancient One and regain proper use of his hands after a terrible car crash, the plot revolves around a rogue master named Kaecilius (Mad Mikkelsen) who has stolen pages from a book of spells in order to open a dark realm and unleash a dangerous evil entity. As far as intrigue, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fascinated with the character of Strange himself, and his training in becoming the Sorcerer Supreme. The visuals are stunning, the creative action sequences, and (of course) Mr. Cumberbatch are by far the best parts of the film.3. For years now, Benedict Cumberbatch has been one of my top five favorite actors, and he delivers the best he can. The only personal flaw of mine is that I don't quite see him as Doctor Strange quite yet. I believe the script wasn't as keen as it could be on developing the character to the point where he feels solidified in this universe. Mad Mikkelsen is scary and physically brutal as Kaecilius, but the writing just isn't there to give his character more weight. He had the potential to be just as lethal as say....The Winter Soldier, yet the script doesn't do him justice nor the rest of the main cast.4. People may compare Stephen Strange to Tony Stark when it comes to ego and arrogance, but Strange is not so self-centered to the degree of Stark. Rachel McAdams is hinted to be Strange's love interest as the film progresses, but the dynamic between them isn't what you might expect. The only warning I'd give comes during the climax. Let's just say I got flashback's of 2011's 'Green Lantern' when a particular threat is introduced during an inter-dimensional sequence. The movie is only 115mins long, but things feel extremely rushed, especially the transition of Stephen Strange into the Sorcerer we know.5. I also give both Tilda Swinton (Ancient One) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) a lot of credit since they play their respective roles to great conviction. If you do go see this in theaters, I strongly recommend that you wait till the very end, cause there are two amazing post-credit scenes, one in particular which sets up another highly anticipated Marvel film slated for next November;) There are so many things to touch on, but they are so minor it can be overlooked. I really like this movie, although as much as I wanted to, I couldn't fall in love with it. All that being said, 'Doctor Strange' is still one of the better comic-book movies this year right behind 'Captain America: Civil War'.",7,2,5,4 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Rise of 'Mary Sue'.
","With 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' being the climactic ending to a nine-film story-arc and heavily divided trilogy in itself, does J.J. Abrams' final attempt to tie-up loose ends and save the 'Skywalker Saga' from a disastrous fate as 'The Last Jedi' exceed expectations?1. Personally, this film is split down the middle for me and the following review is spoiler-heavy cause there are a few major points I feel the need to cover. As far as story goes, it appears pretty simple on paper. Unbeknownst to the galaxy, the diabolical Sith leader Emperor Palpatine survived his fatal fall at the hands of Darth Vadar and returns with sheer vengeance and a massive Sith Fleet to once again conquer the galaxy which forces the Resistance to undertake a journey in finding and destroying him once and for all. Pretty straight-forward of a plot right? Wrong! Despite the film rushing through the motions from the very first frame, the dramatic elements are interjected at random times throughout the film which belabors the story dynamic.2. On a couple positive notes, the one story element which should have been pushed more so than the rest was the relationship between Kylo Ren/Ben Solo (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). There is a better interplay between the two than how it unfolded in 'The Last Jedi' in which they both battle with the dark and light within them. With the termination of Snoke, Kylo Ren has now adopted the mantle of the First Order's Supreme Leader and enlists the 'Knights of Ren' to hunt down and kill Rey at the behest of Palpatine himself. With Driver probably being the most compelling actor and character of the trilogy, he is underused and has lesser screen-time than he did in the previous films. J.J. Abrams has always been a good action director and I had no problems with any of the action set-pieces this film had to offer. Coupled with the production designs and impeccable special effects, the action is quite entertaining on its own.2. Now onto the problems. With part of the convoluted story involving finding a special device to aid in locating Palpatine, you realize just how useless some main characters are, particularly Finn (John Boyega). Apart from being a terrible actor, Boyega as Finn is reduced to nothing but a yelling/screaming tag-along who continues to have a hard-on for Rey. If you were wondering whether Rey and Finn ever hook-up...........no they don't. Side characters are introduced at the last minute with no real purpose to the overall plot rather than being there to propel segments of the story. Considering Carrie Fisher passed away well before filming, General Leia serves one purpose which I'll get to later. I can't help but think that Palpatine was re-introduced because Rain Johnson made the sole decision to kill Snoke in the previous film and J.J. Abrams was desperate to crow-bar in a familiar villain to end the saga with.3. Ever since 'The Force Awakens' I had the inkling that the character of Rey was an attempt by Disney to subtly push a feminist agenda into the new trilogy. I foolishly gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking that Rey would be more human and relatable in the subsequent films, but I was proven wrong. Rey is undoubtedly the embodiment of a 'Mary Sue' in which, despite any external conflict/challenge, she remains a flawless and unrealistically strong female without any hint of weakness. One of this trilogy's cliff-hangers was the mystery behind her parentage, and needless to say, I was yet again underwhelmed. As it turns out, she is the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine and he has been in search of her in hopes that she will take his throne to become the new Empress of the Sith. How does someone with hereditary powers of the dark side be able to resist elements of the same darkness and also be able to channel the light side of the Force? Bad storytelling I guess.4. There came a point where this film almost turned me around and I had a slight sense of hope when it came to Kylo Ren as he relinquishes the dark side and turns to the light. During a vicious light-saber duel on the wreckage of the Death-Star, Kylo defeats Rey but Leia uses the last of her life force to subdue her son before he delivers the final killing blow to Rey. Leia ultimately passes away due to this which leaves Kylo the last of the 'Skywalker' bloodline. The film deceived me into thinking Kylo (now redeemed as Ben Solo) would be the actual hero of the story as he was finally brought back to the light by the love of his parents Han and Leia. Instead, Ben teams up with Rey to battle Palpatine but as this is a feminist story, Ben is knocked out of the fight and Rey is the one to summon the spirits of past Jedi to slay the Emperor in yet another 'How the hell would that work?!' type scene.5. Despite the rediculous nature of the climax, I still had a bit of hope, as Rey dies due to her exertions to kill Palpatine, she is brought back to life by Ben using the Force. Surprisingly, the two share a passionate kiss in that moment and I was thrilled to see a dynamic where rivals fall in love and possibly get married to continue the 'Skywalker' lineage. However, that was the better ending that played out in my head rather than on screen. In actuality, after kissing Rey, Ben dies and his body vanishes in Jedi fashion. The writing in this film is bland and near atrocious in some parts but the story is the most disappointing to say the least especially how things play out. J.J. Abrams must have been inspired by the final scene in 'RoboCop' (1987) when he wrote the final scene for this film cause that's how bad the writing is when you have to borrow from other films. Rey adopting the surname Skywalker for no reason at all was (needless to say) the final kick in the groin for me.Never was I a major 'Star Wars' fanboy, but I highly admired the classic trilogy and the masterful storytelling/film-making it encapsulated. Those films were inspired, episode 7, 8 and 9 were not. I'm so glad the 'Skywalker Saga' is over because I (like many others) desperately want to move on with something new rather than being sold on nostalgia.",5,41,76,31 December 2019
Rush," Everyone's driven by something!
","'Rush' is the true story of the legendary rivalry between Formula-1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. This film takes place over the course of about five years, highlighting the most important time in these men's lives.1. Ron Howard truly is a master of his craft (and has raced his way to the top of my 'favorite film directors' list) as he succeeds massively with this biopic of the decade. He captures the sheer intensity of what and how dangerous the world of Formula-1 racing can be by putting the audience in the driver's seat. 'Rush' is a prime example that proves just how utterly ridiculous the 'Fast & Furious' films are by grounding itself in the harsh reality and challenges faceb by both Lauda and Hunt.2. Apart from the incredible cinematography and spectacular racing sequences, the real force behind this film are the performances. Hemsworth and Bruhl lead the pack with the latter being the more outstanding. Daniel Bruhl is spectacular with his spot-on portrayal as Niki Lauda, from the accent to his mannerisms, Bruhl deserved an Oscar nomination for this particular performance. Hemsworth on the other hand does prove that he has acting chops when it comes to dramatic roles in his portrayal as James Hunt. The reason why Bruhl stands out more is due to how different Hunt and Lauda are, with him just being more of a driven character with his highly focused attitude.3. Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara round out the cast as Hunt and Lauda's respective wives. They play important parts in the lives of these men within the years of them chasing the Formula-1 'World Title'. Their stories can seem crow-barred in but it's hard not to touch on some of the lighter events in the lives of these men. The transitions between the love stories is my only nit-pick of this film (only by reflection), but it's hard to find many flaws when the movie speeds past such things with perfect editing.Next to 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Rush' is (without a doubt) Ron Howard's best film to date, and in years to come, could very well be considered a classic. Powerful, moving and outstanding, 'Rush' delivers an incredible cinematic experience, no matter if you see it on the big or small screen.'The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel;)'",9,1,2,6 April 2016
Justice League," Give me 'Justice' or give me death.
","The long awaited live-action DC Superhero team-up we have all been waiting for has arrived. 'Justice League' brings our favorite heroes together, but does the film come together as well as the team does?1. When an intergalactic foe (Steppenwolf) threatens all life on Earth, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to assemble heroes from every corner to defend the world. With 'Justice League' being the 5th installment in the DC Universe, this movie undeniably feels a little rushed although it does have the appearance of a stand-alone film. It is quite obvious that DC and Warner Bros. are trying their hand at reverse engineering these characters by introducing them in one big ensemble and then gradually branching them off into their respective films. Is this DC's best movie? Not at all, but it's far from their worst.2. One the positive side, Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) is the most prominent character in the film more so than anyone else. If there's one person that gives life to this film.....it's her. The quiet moments between Gadot and Affleck (Batman) are by far the most interesting. There is a conflict between them in a sense of a love/hate relationship which hints at a possible budding romance. The other standout character was surprisingly Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg. Maybe it's just me, but characters struggling to regain humanity that was stripped of them always resonates with me and Cyborg is just that. The least interesting member of the league however, is Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash. He clearly serves as the comic relief but he had more misses than hits. Most of his one-liners fall flat and the ones that do get nothing more than a chuckle.3. The one person I wanted and expected more of was Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Momoa obviously has fun with the role but never quite proves himself to be the badass we know him as from the comics. For someone with super-strength and command of the seas, his range is limited mainly because of the script. I'm certain 'justice' will be done to his character in his upcoming solo film, but I was disappointed that he wasn't as engaged as he should be. Not to spoil anything or explain what takes place, but the brief moments we get of Henry Cavill in the film, he finally proves himself as the Superman fans love. Probably the best set-piece in the film involves him about half-way into the movie. That sequence in particular was far more exciting and thrilling than the climax.4. Every moment in which all the league members communicate and talk amongst each other is where the movie succeeds. Despite being the only human of the team, Ben Affleck holds his own and works best in every scene he has with Gal Gadot. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf is about as underwhelming as they come. Never is his ultimate plan thoroughly fleshed out nor his objective justified. All he serves as is just a plot device and a reason for there to be a 'Justice League'. The film drops Easter-eggs every so often including two post-credit scenes. If you can manage to be patient, the scene at the very end (not spoiling anything) hints at the possibility of the solo 'Batman' film (starring Ben Affleck) that everyone has been waiting for.The scenes directed by Snyder, opposed to the re-shoots by Joss Whedon, are as knight and day. Not saying that's a bad thing, but the film feels very choppy without a proper flow. I wasn't bored but nether was I even mildly entertained. 'Justice League' is by far better than 'Suicide Squad', but until it establishes a stronger script, pacing and less over-the-top CGI action, it will not succeed at matching the standard of MARVEL.",6,3,4,17 November 2017
The Revenant," A slow-burn......with ice.
","'The Revenant' deserves all the praise for the artistry, cinematography and acting depicted in this film. However, there is a heaviness to this movie, but not in a good way.To be fair, DiCaprio and Hardy shine with their performances with the latter being the more interesting. The reason why I say that is due to Hardy's character of Fitzgerald just having more dialogue as well as more interactions in the film. This being a story of survival, it's understandable why DiCaprio groans and grunts his way through the movie to the final act. He lacks in dialogue so it's hard to tell what he's thinking rather than what he's doing which is crawling and limping his way back home after a savage bear attack.Only one person deserved an Oscar for a hand in this film, yet...it shouldn't have been DiCaprio. Alejandro Inarritu won his second Oscar for this as well he should have, cause his directing was brilliant. Of that same year, I saw 'Black Mass', and Johnny Depp's performance in that particular film was far superior than DiCaprio's, hence the reason I found it unfair, cause a nomination for Depp would have mean't another deserving Oscar snub for DiCaprio.'The Revenant' is still one of the better films of 2015, but it could easily lose an audience just by pacing alone.",6,0,1,28 March 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Go Rogue
","'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is the 5th installment of the spy/thriller franchise. The tone is set a bit darker than the previous as I.M.F agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes in search of the shadowy 'Syndicate' terrorist organization while his own agency is on the brink of dissolving.1. Although this sequel doesn't deliver on the spectacle of the previous film, it still succeeds on so many levels. Most of the main cast returns with the exception of newcomers Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Tom Cruise is still the show-stopper as Ethan Hunt while we follow him throughout the film in his search for the 'Syndicate'. Once again, Cruise performs most of his own stunts which are spectacular in the final film. The underwater and motorcycle chase sequences stand out the most and truly are exciting when you see it on the big screen.2. British actor Sean Harris plays the antagonist this time around, who's supposed to be the complete opposite of Ethan Hunt. Although he's not a memorable character to say the least, Harris still has more screen- time for development than the villain of the last film. Simon Pegg (Benji) has a much bigger part than he has in the franchise so far, and it's safe to say that it wouldn't be the same without him. Of course, the locations play a big part in this franchise as well as they travel to Austria, Morocco and London, with the latter being the main setting.3. The action will always be over the top, but it comes with the title. If one can give the 'Fast & Furious' films a pass, then this will entertain you to no end, cause the action (no matter how impossible it seems) is still thrilling and plausible operating in it's own realm. This is still Cruise's movie to carry, and he does it well while proving that neither age, appearance nor Scientology is gonna keep him down.'Rogue Nation' is a summer blockbuster - plain and simple. Thanks to the directing of Christopher McQuarrie, everything comes together perfectly and packs all the action and suspense into one sure-to-thrill film.",7,1,2,13 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," The safest hands are still MARVEL's own.
","'Captain America: Civil War' delivers on all cylinders as MARVEL and the Russo brothers serve up the best MCU film thus far. 1. The plot is quite intriguing yet simple at the same time, as the movie opens with the Avengers trying to thwart a terrorist attack lead by former SHIELD agent now mercenary; Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. Things end with casualties, leading the Avengers to not only have to answer for their previous mission, but the events from earlier films (The Avengers, The Winter Soldier & Age of Ultron). Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron-Man (Robert Downey Jr.) are divided when when accords regulating their activity is presented, thus leading to high tensions and an ultimate all-out war. What's even more interesting are the sub-plots involving Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) respectively.2. This film consists of more characters in one film thus far and the Russo brothers balance things just right (even better than Joss Whedon to an extent), giving each character their time to shine yet keeping the focus on Captain America since he's still the focus of the film. The action is spectacular and the best MARVEL has shown so far. 'The Winter Soldier' had one of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences and this film also has an outstanding fight and chase scene between Bucky and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Of course the main set-piece is the mind-blowing sequence between Cap and Iron-Man's team as they clash heads during the airport sequence. IMAX is used to superb effect for this sequence so the action leaves the audience breathless.3. Even though the movie is mainly focused on Captain America, Black Panther, Spidey (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are the standouts to the film (of the latter I can't say why, but if you've seen the film, then you know what I mean;). They never seem forced or misplaced, even though Spider-Man was a late addition to the cast, they all just leave you wanting more and hyped for their future respective films. I believe 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' will play a bigger role in setting up 'Infinity Wars', cause this film is undoubtedly more grounded than the others. If anything else, it leaves you wanting more and curious as to where Steve Rogers' story will go from here.4. If there are some complaints, they are very few and far between. There's one thing I can say without spoiling anything, is that a very interesting and potentially threatening character (who was introduced in a previous MCU movie) is eliminated near the beginning of the film. Bucky feels a little less sympathetic than he did in 'The Winter Soldier' considering he plays a major part here. A potential love- story arises in the midst of the film, but it seems just a bit misplaced in an already crowded film. However, these really aren't major complaints to linger on in the film because everything else is so fantastic that it makes you forget.The Russo brother have outdone themselves once again, and it's safe to say that 'Infinity Wars' are in the right hands. Joss Whedon only wishes the previous 'Avengers' film could have come together as well as this did. 'Captain America: Civil War' is surprisingly unique and presents elements audiences haven't seen before, and that makes it a fun and action-packed feature.",9,2,9,23 May 2016
Pearl Harbor," War is Hell
","'Pearl Harbor' is a biopic which recounts the events of that tragic day on December 7th 1941, where the Japanese bomb the historical American base.1. In the vein of 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbor' has the same effect of having a fictitious love story in the midst of a factual tragedy. This time around, it comes in the pairing of Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale (who do make a cute on-screen couple to be fair). Keep in mind, the movie is 3hrs long so we mainly get scenes with the both of them at the beginning and near the end. The love story works well up until we get to the awkward and forced love-triangle involving Josh Hartnett. This is the unnecessary weight of the film that could easily be trimmed down to save on running time. Let's summarize the romance shall we? Your best friend (Affleck) aids the British army, is presumed dead after his plane crashes, you (Hartnett) use that as an opportunity to make a play on his mourning girlfriend (Beckinsale), then unknowingly get her pregnant after a month of having unprotected sex in Hawaii.2. If there's one thing Michael Bay knows, it's action. Every action and battle sequence in this film is highly intense and really captures the feel of what this war could have been like. The theatrical version is tamed to a certain degree, but the director's cut is Rated-R and shows tons of blood and gore. Of course, the actually bombing of Pearl Harbor occurs in the 2nd hour of the film after the campy stuff.3. The acting is nothing spectacular with the exception of Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight, who play Lt. Doolittle and President Roosevelt respectively. Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett are the leading characters (with the latter being the weakest) that we follow as the film progresses. If nothing else, I know women would like the romance in this film more than the guys.'Pearl Harbor' is an okay/down-the-middle type film and nothing else. Michael Bay delivers on the action and Hans Zimmer provides the breath-taking score to follow. Love it or hate it, but it exists.",6,0,1,16 April 2016
Non-Stop," Liam Neeson........on a plane!!!
","'Non-Stop' is yet another action vehicle for Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra, having previously worked together in 'Unknown'. Entertaining and thrilling, but this flight is a long one.1. For the most part, the movie has a mysterious and intriguing setup. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sucked in at the beginning. The plot involves former cop and now 'Federal Air-Marshall' Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) as he reluctantly performs his duty overseeing a red-eye flight from New York to London. He soon begins to receive random and threatening text messages from a mysterious terrorist who just may be one of the passengers on board. I honestly thought the plot might have been straight forward, but it ends up being more intricate and I was pleasantly surprised.2. As interesting of a mystery this film is, it turns into more of a thriller not long after. When the unknown figure lives up to his threats, the tension begins to build as Liam Neeson races against the clock to find the killer. However, all good things must come to an end. For a movie that has a great beginning and middle, the twist that is revealed in the last third is heavily underwhelming. The film plays to it's advantage as a suspenseful thriller, but looses all momentum when it delves into the generic action realm at the end. It feels like studio interference to the original script.3. If there is one saving grace, it is Liam Neeson himself. For an actor who has jumped into action films in recent years, Neeson is still a theatrically trained actor and he delvers an exceptional performance no matter what he stars in. Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll and Michelle Dokery round out the cast. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o also appears, but she is completely misused in her role. This film was on the brink of being something more than what it was, but it all comes down to wasted potential. I personally enjoy thrillers, but I was disappointed to say the least.Even though the movie lost a lot of points for the climax, It was still an entertaining flick. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson, then no matter the flaws, this would still be on your watch-list.",6,1,2,18 February 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Destiny has arrived...
","After a decade of spectacular films and cast of characters, the culmination of the entire MARVEL Cinematic Universe has led to this. 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the first-half of what is to be a monumental cinematic event. With years of hype, does this film deliver and meet every expectation we've been hoping for?1. This review is SPOILER FREE , but there will be mentions of certain sequences, however, I assure you there won't be any reveals. To make things simple, the mad titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) has finally decided to scour the universe in a hunt for all six infinity stones and deliver a balance to life and death that he sees fit. Blood will be shed and fear spreads as a fractured Avengers face their greatest threat as the fate of the world hangs in the balance. In all honesty, this film delivered on everything I wanted to see all whilst exceeding my expectations at the same time. One must remember that to fully appreciate this film, you had to have seen every MCU film prior to this. If you've missed films in between or if this in your first MCU experience, I'd heavily recommend that you catch up as soon as you can before seeing 'Infinity War' because you'd be utterly confused viewing this on its own. 2. Although all the characters are in one film, they're not all together (if you know what I mean). Certain Avengers are handling things in different places across the galaxy, so don't expect a unified team-up on this one. Everything has its place and I continue to stress that this is part one of two in the 'Infinity War' and Thanos' story. The three leading heroes (Captain America, Iron Man & Thor) are all on their respective quests until the ultimate convergence during the climax. Personally, the more intriguing story was Captain America's (Chris Evans) quest and the defensive actions in Wakanda, as well as Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) relationship with her adopted father Thanos. Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Guardians' plot is a close second while Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) was the least compelling. Not to say having three different story-lines is a bad thing, rather than which is more entertaining to follow. 3. Thanos is by far the greatest CGI creation I've seen come alive on-screen since Gollum. The effects are impeccable and Josh Brolin delivers an outstanding motion-capture performance as the mad Titan himself. There is an ere of sympathy to Thanos that I found interesting and all credit goes to the writers. He is (most certainly) a force to be reckoned with and can definitely be placed in the category of the greatest cinematic villains in history. What was equally impressive were Thanos' minions/followers, 'The Black Order'. Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw & Cull Obsidian respectively, are badass characters all of whom I'm dying to see more of. The action is spectacular and some of which I've never seen before. It was hard to contain my inner nerd the more the movie progressed closer and closer to that spectacular climax. So as far as action goes......no complaints whatsoever.4. The one thing I found a little campy and I guess the only flaw of this film is that Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch's (Elizabeth Olsen) relationship. As seen in the trailers, Vision has evolved to the point in which he can now generate a human appearance. It's insinuated that both he and Wanda are intimate (having sex), and that's just awkward and somewhat gross to think about considering Vision is still a robot/machine of sorts despite his intellect. Besides that, I must warn audiences who've been spoiled by the happy/hopeful/humorous MCU endings thus far, because 'Infinity War' has a rather dark ending. When it was all over, I was unable to move from my seat and just sat there for a few minutes to wrap my head around the final event and realization of the films climax. Its somewhat of a cliffhanger but not entirely, because the film does have a legit conclusion.I felt fear and shed tears for certain characters as there is so much emotion tied into this film. Some sequences are truly heartbreaking despite the amazing action and moments of humor. Kudos to the direction of the Russo brothers and writers Markus & McFeeley, because 'Avengers: Infinity War' is truly one for the ages and a spectacle of a film. It it so fantastic that MARVEL has indeed succeeded the likes of DC and even Star Wars, as this is easily in the higher rankings of best comic-book films ever made.",9,3,10,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Overly Lengthy & Underwhelming.
","'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' is acclaimed director Quentin Tarantino's 9th film and one that surely will be closely observed by critics. As anticipated as any Tarantino film can be, does this one live up to the hype?1. Set in 1969 Los Angeles, the story involves fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stunt-double/close friend Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they try to salvage some acclaim in Hollywood within their twilight years in the industry. Firstly, as simple as that plot may sound, a film like this takes many turns and (as with most Tarantino films) stories converge. Personally, I expected intertwining story-lines but not such a dull script. With a run-time of 2hrs 41mins, this film could easily have lost 60-45mins as it is plagued with tons of unnecessary and dragging scenes. I don't mind lengthy films, but the biggest crime a lengthy feature can make is to be boring. Capturing the audiences' attention should be first priority.2. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt is no doubt the best part of this film. It's about time these two have worked together and they both do their best to keep you invested in their slice of the story. On the other hand, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is completely useless to say the least. Her character is there for no reason at all and contributes absolutely nothing to the overall plot. Her scenes should have been cut from the final theatrical version entirely. Many other A-list actors make cameos throughout but are in no way outstanding judging by performances. No disrespect to the late Luke Perry, but anyone could have played his part as he utterly insignificant in his short role.3. This film succeeds a lot more when it shifts gere into comedy and focuses on DiCaprio and Pitt. The secondary plot (as shown in the trailers) involves the 'Manson Family', which leads to a rather entertaining and funny climax, but actual events are in no way depicted as they were in real life regarding the infamous cult and its leader Charles Manson. The script just didn't seem to quite find its voice or direction. The editing needed to be tighter, and again, a lot of scenes should have been left on the cutting-room floor. One film I really admire with a similar tone is 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' (2005) which is probably a better and more entertaining film than this. I found myself hard to stay invested in the story and was suffering from cinematic fatigue by the time it was over.'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' is a clear definition of an overly ambitious film that aimed high but hit low. I'm an admirer of many of Tarantino's works, but this certainly isn't a film I'd wanna watch again in theaters or even on television.",3,26,45,31 July 2019
Gone Girl," 'Amazing Amy' is a crazy b%tch!
","'Gone Girl' is the big-screen version of Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name, and I must say, justice was done here:)1. The mystery begins with the untimely disappearance of Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike), and the looming assumption that she was murdered by her estranged husband Nick (Ben Affleck). The first hour is basically the mystery and investigation of Nick on whether of not he actually murdered his wife or was she coincidentally kidnapped. Affleck plays the role well, where he keeps you guessing and scratching your head wondering if he's guilty or not. His misleading and painted smile, as well as his calm demeanor throughout, leaves everyone a bit skeptical about Nick. I know critics have a devious hard-on for Ben Affleck's acting, but it would be a lie if I said this role didn't suite him.2. With the help of (the surprisingly entertaining Tyler Perry) high-powered lawyer/investigator Tanner Bolt, along with his devoted twin sister Margo (Connie Coon), Nick discovers that Amy is actually alive and devised a psychotic plan for revenge which included staging her own murder. Rosamund Pike is quite a twisted f#ck as Amy, plain and simple. Things soon turn into a game of 'Cat & Mouse' when Amy eventually realizes that Nick has become aware of her plan. Enter....Neil Patrick Harris, as Desi Collings, an ex-boyfriend and sociopath, fixated on Amy. Harris portrays his character with the persona of a boarder-line psychotic who's in love with Amy, however, he ends up being a pawn in Amy's deadly game.3. There is a pretty hot but ultimately disturbing sex scene between Amy and Desi during the last third of the film. Amy slashes Desi's throat where he inevitably bleeds to death while having sex so that Amy can stage a rape scenario in which she can portray the victim. The cinematography is awesome, especially when capturing the more thrilling and intense scenes. The entire tone of the movie has the similar feel of the dark mystery it initially sets up. My only complaint however...is the conclusion. Amy returns home which proves Nick's innocence to the Press, but she still schemes her way back by inseminating herself with Nick's sperm, ensuring that he can't leave her. Justice (literally) isn't done here.David Fincher outdoes himself here giving audiences a thrilling film in the same vein as his previous one; 'Fight Club & Se7en' especially. If you don't mind the ending and have a strong stomach, then nothing is holding you back from enjoying the hell out of this;)",8,1,5,16 August 2016
The Lion King," Slimy, yet......unsatisfying.
","'The Lion King' (2019) is yet another classic title in Disney's long list of live-action remakes. However, with acclaimed director Jon Favreau at the helm, will this film the mold to become something more than mediocre?1. If you've seen the original 1994 animated film, there is nothing different in terms of scene, story and song in this remake. The goal was obviously to review the original and copy each scene with CGI effects. On a positive note, the CGI was breathtaking! From the vastness of the African plains to character designs themselves. If you thought Avatar (2009) was still groundbreaking with its CGI world, this film rivals that immensely. There was never a moment to which I though anything looked fake. The art department should be nominated for their work on this film cause this is as realistic as CGI effects will appear nowadays.2. Overall, I had mixed feelings about the new voice-casting in this film. James Earl Jones' voice is obviously irreplaceable and I couldn't imagine anyone else as Mufasa. However, Jeremy Irons (original voice of Scar) also has an iconic voice and whilst Chiwetel Ejiofor does a good of a job as anyone can, Irons still seemed like the better fit. I was appalled to learn that Jeremy Irons himself approached Disney and was more than willing to reprise his role as Scar only to be rejected as the studio only wanted Black actors in the film's leading roles.
The only other voice actor I had a problem with was Beyonce as adult Nala. Obviously she's an amazing vocalist but her actual speaking voice is too deep to the point where it is more so deeper than co-star Donald Glover's(adult Simba).3. Lastly, the music of the original film is iconic in its own right and very much timeless. Of course the newer voice actors do covers of the original songs but to no greater effect. It serves its purpose but there is nothing special about it overall. There are some new song written for the film but they are God-awful! Having Pharrell Williams on board as the music producer on this was a terrible choice. Hans Zimmer knew just how to represent Africa with his organized orchestra headed by African singer Lebo M. who brought traditional African instrumentals to the original film. Here, injecting a hip-hop and R&B over-tone to the score was utter garbage and a slap in the face to Hans Zimmer's Ocarina's-winning work.'The Lion King' is just an okay film. There honestly was so much potential to recapture the magic of the original but seemed like the film-makers were trying way too hard to make this great that they completely missed their target.",5,0,1,25 July 2019
A Quiet Place," They can't SEE you, but they can HEAR you.
","Fear comes in many forms and 'A Quiet Place' is no exception. Horror films typically get the worst reviews, but will critics be kind to a film that may or may not follow the generic monster movie formula?1. The film takes place in a rural countryside in what seems to be a deserted Earth. Mankind is near extinction as mysterious creatures (with keen ears) hunt and kill anything or anyone that makes a sound. We follow the Abbott family as they live a (literal) life of silence in order to survive on their farm. Personally, horror is not my favorite genre, but when making a horror flick, the simpler the plot, the better the story. This film doesn't cheat the audience, it's simply a story about a family and their fight for survival. There's no major end-goal, explosive action or larger than life plot, and I loved that about this film. The key is to keep things simple, focus on the story, the characters and the suspense and this movies delivered on all of that. 2. I usually wait for Thriller/Horrors to be available on online streaming rather than go to the theater to see, but I made it my business to catch this one on the big screen, and I'm glad I did. What makes 'A Quiet Place' remarkable/memorable, is not just the horror aspect but the characters, situations and performances. There is not one bad performance in this film. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are great as usual, but its the actors who play their kids that impressed me the most. Millicent Simmonds (Regan Abbott) in particular, plays the eldest child who's deaf. Unlike the other characters who speak in the film (at certain points), Simmonds has no dialogue yet delivers an almost Oscar-worthy performance.3. I was surprised just how much this film resonated with me on an emotional level. I won't spoil anything, but there is a scene between Krasinski and his daughter (Simmonds) during the film's climax that literally broke my heart and had me drowning in my own tears. Since there is very little dialogue in the film and more communication via sigh-language and expressions, that made the emotions that more substantial. To be quite honest, I wasn't that scared of the creatures (when they're finally revealed) rather than their vicious and animalistic capabilities. The opening sequence alone lets you know just how ruthless these mysterious creatures are. I wished however, that there were more practical effects to intensify the already creepy atmosphere.4. I wasn't a fan of the creature designs since they didn't appear all that menacing. That was honestly my only complaint about the film. This would have been the perfect job for creature effects artists like Stan Winston or Rick Baker to handle. John Krasinski deserves a lot of praise for his direction here. The man handles the camera well, the shots have a sinister beauty to them and the film flows superbly. I was literally on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Never have I been so curious in a horror film constantly waiting to find out what happens next. The film has somewhat of an open-ending for a potential sequel, but its perfect the way it is, so please don't take any liberties Hollywood!Given the opportunity, I'd definitely go see this again. And just a word of advice, if you live a world with monsters that will kill you the second you make a sound, in no way should you be having a baby when all babies do is make noise!!!",9,3,7,7 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," I have lived to tell the Tale...
","After a 5yr absence, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is the fifth installment of the series and the continuing adventures of the infamous Cpt. Jack Sparrow. Having hit choppy waters since it's fantastic first film, does this one finally recapture it's adventurous fun?1. Having embodied a character (at this point) more popular than Indiana Jones, the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise would be truly lost without Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow. With wind in his sails, undying wit and drunken-luck on his side, it's hard not to love a character like Jack Sparrow. No matter which film(s) we like better than the others, Sparrow has stolen the show since 2003 and has undoubtedly grown on and become aware to every movie-going audience. I was delighted as anyone can be having him back on the silver-screen for what could be his final adventure. Needless to say, I couldn't help but think his luck and charm just might have run it's course with this film.2. No doubt that Johnny Depp is in fact one of the greatest actors of our generation. He's an A-list star as well as a household name and now most notable to younger audiences for his portrayal of Sparrow. However, his characters on film may be immortalized, but Depp is in fact getting older and his fatigue does in show through this particular performance. Perhaps the blame can fall on the writing or the story as a whole, but the charm and wit we all love from this character is few and far between and solely replaced by drunken foolishness instead. We all look forward to what new mischief and tricks Jack has in stored, but I left the theater feeling as if he's now one big walking joke.3. The plot revolves around Henry Turner (Brendan Thwaites) promising to rid his father (Orlando Bloom) of the Dutchman's curse by finding the Trident of the Greek God 'Poseidon'. In the case of Jack however, a former enemy who himself and his crew were enslaved as ghosts, are set free and seek revenge on Sparrow. As simple as this may seem, it unnecessarily becomes more convoluted. Karina (Kaya Scoldelario) a young astronomer gets involved, since she claims that she can navigate to the Trident's location by mapping the stars. Alas, even though she has more personality with her character than Thwaites, Scoldelario serves just a minor purpose to the plot and even less as a love-interest as she is utterly underused.4. Having an Oscar-winning actor as the villain seems like a win/win scenario right?.....not exactly. Javier Bardem is indeed a great actor, but as the ghostly Cpt. Salazar.....he falters. Not only is he not as intimidating as one might think, but his Spanish accent is much too thick to where it's hard to understand his English. Bardem definitely falls short of the franchise's previous antagonists such as Geoffrey Rush (Barbosa), Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) and even Ian McShane (Blackbeard) to an extent. The film tends to work better as long as you focus on the characters that you've already invested in. The action scenes are done well, but never quite hits any exciting high-notes.5. Besides fun and relate-able characters, the next important thing necessary in a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film is.....the Caribbean. Not only was this installment filmed entirely in Australia, but it's glaringly obvious that set-pieces were missing. There are way too many digital back-shots that take away from the organic feel swashbuckling films supposed to have. Filming for this ended in the summer/fall of 2015, and my guess for it's delayed release was the massive amount of CGI and art direction added in post-production. Not saying that all the effects were bad, but the CGI on the ghosts and the final action sequence is quite glaring. For it's second film 'Dead Man's Chest' to have won an Oscar for special effects, this was indeed a huge step back.'Dead Men Tell No Tales' amounts to be an average and mildly entertaining flick. Rating this out of the franchise's five films, this would be #4, with 'At World's End' being by far the worst. 'Curse of the Black Pearl' is definitely the best, and I sure hope the filmmakers find their stride as they did with the first and have a successful return-to-form if there is to be a sixth entry.",5,3,9,31 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Everything they've built......will FALL!!!
","'X-Men: Apocalypse' is the 9th 'X-Men' film (Deadpool and The Wolverine included), and the 4th directed by Bryan Singer. As much as I wanted to love this movie, it still fell short of what it's capable of.1. The story itself does come with intrigue as an ancient and the world's first mutant; 'Apocalypse' (Oscar Isaac), is awakened in 1983. He intends to cleanse the world by causing it's destruction with the help of his four powerful mutant horsemen: Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Angel (Ben Hardy) & Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Apocalypse is also out to possess the world's most powerful mind, that is Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy), hence the X- Men, lead by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), must stand against a God and prevent worldwide destruction. If anything else, the film keeps you engaged enough to wonder how it will all end.2. Character development is lacking, especially when it comes to Mystique. For all the cool action and acrobatic fighting this character does, it's completely abandoned in this film. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't seem to be invested in playing Mystique as she was before, which is a big let down. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are clearly the most dedicated, with the latter giving a more outstanding performance. The film features more mutant characters than the previous ones, and it's obvious that a proper balance wasn't found since we never really get a solid grasp of the new and younger mutants.3. As for 'Apocalypse' himself, Oscar Isaac portrays him as a cold and menacing entity for the first third of the film, but it's not long until we realize how one-dimensional he is. The suit he wears is interesting enough, but his head and face was a failed attempt by the make-up department. For being the most powerful mutant, he barely puts up a strong enough fight against the X-Men as he is blasted and impaled to his death. As far as villains go, Apocalypse feels less threatening than Bolivar Trask (Days of Future Past) and even Ajax (Deadpool), when he shouldn't have been, which makes his involvement in this film even worse. 4. Nicolas Hoult (Beast) and Evan Peters (Quicksilver) also return, followed by a handful of newcomers. Younger versions of; Cyclops, Jean, Storm and Nightcrawler are introduced, but only to indicate their existence/involvement in (possible) future films. Hugh Jackman has a short segment in the film where he once again portrays the infamous 'Wolverine', except this time he's under control as 'Weapon X'. Jackman's participation in this was obviously a bridge towards his next and final 'Wolverine' film, as well as fan-service to entertain the audience with a little bloody action.5. The action is only impressive to where we've seen it done before in the same franchise. 'Quicksilver' in particular has a similar sequence like he did in the previous film, where he rescues all the students as the X-Mansion is destroyed. There are too many sequences where it's CGI and not character driven. The images of cities and monuments being destroyed is impressive visually, but it goes on to an extent where you lose interest after a while. Things are not as chaotic as 'The Last Stand', but you would have hoped that the film-makers learned and not repeat past mistakes. Bryan Singer does a competent job, but yet he fails to surpass himself, making this the weakest 'X-Men' film under his direction. I personally hold 'Days of Future Past' as the greatest 'X-Men' film thus far, so I'm still interested and have high hopes for this franchise moving forward.",6,1,6,5 June 2016
Logan," 'Courage, above all things, is the first quality of a warrior.'
","'The world is not the same as it was', nor will we ever be able to make it back. 'Logan' is the third and final chapter of the 'Wolverine' trilogy, and the very last for Hugh Jackman himself. James Mangold returns at the helm for the defining chapter, but does the movie deliver a satisfying end?1. Following the present day events of 'Days of Future Past', there is no longer a threat of the mutant-terminating Sentinels, but that does not mean the future is bright. Set in the year 2029, the aged Logan, Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and Professor Xavier have isolated themselves in a deserted area near the Mexican border. With the sudden arrival of a mysterious young girl with powers identical to Logan's, they find themselves on the run and being hunted by forces with a devious agenda. The first positive thing about this, is that the plot is easy to follow. It honestly helps to have kept up with the franchise.2. 'Deadpool' was the first X-Men related film to have ushered in a new age of comic-book violence, but 'Logan' certainly pushes it to a whole new level. The squeamish beware, cause when the claws come out, the bodies hit the floor in the most gruesome way. All credit to the effects team and James Mangold's direction, because the action is precise and you see every stab and slash when Logan or Laura/X23 engage in a fight. Apart from featuring an aged Wolverine, the story here is completely different. Also, even though it's set in the future, no apocalyptic events have taken place nor does the world need saving. The story is as personal as it gets.3. No one should solely go see this movie for the bloody action, but for the superb performances and character arcs in this film. Hugh Jackman and of course the legendary Sir Patrick Stewart, deliver the best performances (as these characters) that we've seen in this franchise thus far. Compassionate yet heartbreaking is how I would describe the relationship between the two. Having known each other for many years, there is an obvious but silent father/son notion as we watch them interact with each other throughout. Another great thing, the movie isn't afraid to show the harsh realities of life, even for powerful mutant superheroes. There were so many times in this film in which my heart just went out to all these characters, simply witnessing their pain.4. I hate to say a film as touching as this has flaws, but unfortunately it does. The first two-thirds of this film is absolutely brilliant, yet even with a simple story, things become convoluted. Firstly, a subplot is introduced in which Laura isn't the only child having been experimented on, and she herself has a mission to travel north and regroup with the other child refugees. This element does not lend a whole lot but rather distorts the personal story introduced in the beginning. Even though the children play a hand in the film's climax, I can't help but think it was only used to hype the action. When casting confirmed that actor Boyd Holbrook would be playing the vicious 'Reaver' leader Donald Pierce (as he is in the comics), I was ecstatic.5. However, Holbrook's potential as a villain is completely wasted. Not only does he get little screen time, he is not at all intimidating nor does he feel like an actual formidable threat. Richard E. Grant as doctor Xander Rice turns out to be the true bad guy seeing as he is responsible for the forced experiments on the escaped children. However, the big reveal is that Dr. Rice has successfully created an exact clone of Logan, except under his control. This aspect comes out of left field and it's really up to the audience how they receive it. I personally thought this was a bad idea to introduce a clone as the antagonist seeing as they could have capitalized and not waste Donald Pierce as a character.6. Lastly, it's hard not to talk about this movie without mentioning the scene-stealing performance of Spanish actress Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney/X23. Not only was she created with Logan's DNA, she definitely is the female version of him as in the comics. Their bond during the trip to find refuge is he only piece of thread that binds and saves the ending from being generic. The 'Reavers' end up being a faceless group of guys with robotic arms that are only there to be sliced and diced especially during the climax. With his body no longer bearing the capacity to heal, Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies not before Laura accepts him as her father. The sheer emotion of that scene captures you when Laura holds his hand as he lays dying.7. Having been teary-eyed throughout, the final scene broke me like a twig. They gather around as she says goodbye to her father, but with Laura being the last to leave the site of his grave, she removes the wooden cross and positions it like an 'X' as Logan's headstone. That last moment caused the tears to streams down my face, with all that emotion came the realization that this beloved character that was a joy to watch since the year 2000... was now gone. As much as one might wish for a continuing story for Logan, this was the perfect end to which there is no coming back. Despite it's flaws, 'Logan' delivers and is undoubtedly the best 'X-Men' film we have gotten thus far. Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine will forever be one, and his performances as this character can never be erased from our minds and especially our hearts. It surely hurts to see a beloved icon resign from glory, but as long as dedicated fans are alive....'The Wolverine' will never die.",8,2,6,12 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Welcome to a new Age......of Ultron.
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' was the most highly anticipated superhero sequel ever since the smash-hit of it's predecessor; 'The Avengers'. Joss Whedon returns to the helm, but did he do as good of a job the second time around?1. The main cast of the first film returns to great effect, but the new additions is where the weight is felt. The blatant fact that Whedon included Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to the cast simply because he said they looked cool, is really not a good reason at all. The two serve somewhat of a purpose, but could easily be removed and not change a thing to the plot. Robert Downey Jr. is the center of attention once again as he unleashes the villainous 'Ultron' after jump-starting a dormant peace-keeping program. It's obvious that this was a forced story- line since 'Ultron' was the creation of Hank Pym/Ant-Man and not Tony Stark.2. This movie (unfortunately) follows the same beats as the previous in terms of plot points. Loki's scepter is once again the cause of confusion, a villain that is physically inferior (combative-wise), and another faceless army of minions for the Avengers to cut through during the climax. I'm actually glad Joss Whedon left the MCU, cause this would have been the sad direction 'Infinity War' might have been headed. James Spader does an amazing job voicing and motion- capturing Ultron himself. His appearance might be menacing, but he pales in comparison and disappoints every time he faces off against any Avenger. And just like Loki, Ultron is punked during the climax and smashed around by the Hulk.3. There is a completely out-of-left love-story between Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) & Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), which is utterly sickening for the least since Whedon willingly ignored the existence of Betty Ross. I for one was actually relieved when Quicksilver died, cause he was just a waste of space. The introduction of the 'Vision' (Paul Bettany) in the last third of the film was exhausting to me since the movie was already crowded with characters at that point. Luckily the Russo brothers actually found a purpose for the Vision in 'Civil War', so he can probably be excused in this film. I'm still overjoyed that the Russo's will be directing the future Avenger films.4. The climax is kinda underwhelming to say the least, since it's basically a repeat of the last film. The most impressive sequence actually comes in the middle when Tony Stark summons 'Veronica' (the Hulkbuster armor) to stop the unstable Hulk from rampaging through the streets of South Africa. Audiences were on the edge of their seats for that entire fight scene. Never would I take anything away from the visuals and CGI in this film, because they are fantastic. If it's one thing MARVEL gets right, it's the special effects using ILM. However, this film does way too much advertising of future films crammed into one and it becomes way too obvious and overbearing at times. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still fun and enjoyable to watch, but then it doesn't really stand out due to the fact that nothing new is really presented. It's still worth seeing, but Whedon and company fails to ignite nor recapture the thrills they've achieved before.",6,0,1,1 October 2016
Don't Breathe," Seeing is believing, and he can't.
","'Don't Breathe' is a film which cleverly shows that horror comes in many forms. Three young robbers mark a blind man's house to steal his funds, but 'underestimating' is something thieves do best. However, does a premise and film such as this deliver?1. The first noticeable thing about this film is the tone. The production designers did a terrific job in setting up the creepy atmosphere as well as finding the perfect house where all the alarming events take place. Of course, the attempted theft takes place at night, so the audience follows these characters through the dark maze of the blind man's house. The cinematography is especially fantastic as the camera smoothly navigates it's way through hallways, basements and tight crawl spaces.2. The three robbers are played by Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) & Daniel Zovatto (Money) respectively. The real horror establishes itself when one of the three meets their untimely and gruesome death. We quickly learn just how dangerous the blind man is when things take a turn for the worst. Jane Levy has more screen- time as she is proved to be the most sympathetic character when we learn of her backstory. Dylan Minnette is more of the innocent one who just follows orders at the behest of his crush on Rocky (Jane Levy).3. Last but not least, the 'Blind Man' himself, who is terrifyingly portrayed by Stephen Lang. Normally in a situation like this, the audience should be on his side, but his tactics prove to be lethal and brutal to a degree where you end up hoping the robbers survive his entrapment. The movie nose dives when more is revealed about the blind man and things turn insanely creepy. For all the suspense accumulated during the first half, I lost all faith the moment my stomach began to churn from the disgusting ordeal presented.There are too many moments of false hope near the climax and the movie makes you feel like it just doesn't know where and how to properly end things. I do give a lot of credit to director Fede Alvarez, but things unfortunately fall out of place and sources by the end.",6,2,8,26 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Only 'True Love' can break the spell.
","'Beauty and the Beast' is Disney's take on retelling their classic 1991 animated feature in a live-action version. Introducing an all new cast but familiar beats, and with a perfect blue-print to follow, does this version recapture that of it's predecessor?1. First and foremost, if you are a fan of the 1991 film, you must try your best to see this film with an open mind. Although the plot in the same and the story unfolds the exact same way, there are still changes and different variations of things here and there. Everyone's main complaint is the look of the Beast (Dan Stevens). I would agree that he should have more of a vicious look, but the more I thought about it, if the original design of the beast from the animated film was translated into live-action, he would have been too terrifying and scare the daylights out of the younger audiences. In that sense, I can see why Disney altered him to be more subtle in appearance for that reason.2. Alan Menken (the veteran Disney composer) returns to score this film, and he does yet another fantastic job in recreating his original songs for the new cast. The movie is approximately 120mins, and this can be in part to the addition of a couple new songs as well as more fleshed out back-stories, especially that of Belle and the Beast. Another complaint that crossed my ears, was the casting of Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, having been criticized for his shaky French accent judging by the trailers. Need not worry, you completely forget about your doubts when you see him on screen. Not only are the CGI effects fantastic, but Lumiere completely steals the show whenever he is on screen, especially during the 'Be Our Guest' song and dance number.3. The movie however, is not without flaws. To begin with, as beautiful as Emma Watson might be, she in no way captures the spirit of Belle. Coming to her father's rescue a couple times doesn't quite sell the point that she is as brave and courageous as she's supposed to be. She only skims the surface of the character without bringing much depth to it at all. Dan Steven as the 'Beast' however, shows more conviction in his role as the cursed Prince. His persona and feeling of a tortured soul comes closest to that of Robby Benson who voiced the Beast in the original. Sharing (a little but not as bad) the same lack of character depth as Emma Watson, Luke Evans (to me) feels slightly miscast as the handsome yet egotistical Gaston.4. I applaud Bill Condon's direction as I was blown away by every theatrical song/dance sequences in this film. Of course the most outstanding being the classic ballroom scene which brought tears to my eyes. I also appreciate that the Beast finally gets to perform his own solo song which expressed his inner struggle of both anger and compassion. Something which was clearly missing from the animated film. There is no arguing with Disney especially when it comes to their CGI department, because they can do no wrong. The production design in beyond incredible with not a hair out of place. The magic is surely recaptured whether you admit it or not. This and 'The Jungle Book' surely stand out in Disney's live-action line-up thus far. Fans will undoubtedly nitpick this film as much as they can simply because the animated one is sheer perfection in their eyes. Not saying it's not, but it be unwise not to give this version a chance, because it does it's best and delivers beat for beat in a spectacular way:)",9,1,6,3 April 2017
Die Hard," Welcome to the party Pal!
","'Die Hard' is without a doubt the pinnacle of classic action films and a highlight of the 80s. There's only one name that terrorist fear; McClane!1. In a time when a new action star was needed, a young Bruce Willis rose to the challenge amidst the likes of Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Reluctantly on a trip to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and kids, John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself under the radar of a terrorist plot on Christmas Eve. Willis really was a breath of fresh air at the time of this film's release, considering no one knew what to expect since action stars of that era were damn near body-building types.2. As far as Willis is concerned, with every great hero...there must be a great villain to follow; enter Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber). Apart from '007' films, Rickman defined what a suave, intelligent and deadly antagonist can be. No matter how bad a villain is, it's equally fun to have a formidable henchman at his side, which (the late) Alexander Godunov (Karl) portrays with sheer brutality. However sad it was to hear of Rickman's passing, his legacy still lives on in his most memorable and career defining role as Hans Gruber.3. Behind a great action-flick like this, stood an exceptional director. John McTiernan proved his worth in the realm of action the previous year when he directed another cult and sci-fi classic; 'Predator'. It was clearly a no-brainer having him on board and in turn, McTiernan also went on to direct the third film in the franchise: 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance'. His directing style is obvious as can be since the action sequences are well maintained so that things never get derailed or too crazy.4. Reginald Vel Johnson and Paul Gleason round out the main cast, with memorable side characters as well that stand in as other terrorists and comic reliefs respectively. Willis himself adds more of the humor to the film when he finds himself in stressful situations as the film progresses. He just has a natural charm as McClane which no other action star has ever brought to a character before.To find things that don't work about this film is a hard task, cause I honestly can't think of anything. When spectacle meets action, that's when you'll know that old habits DIE HARD!!!",9,3,3,15 July 2016
Joker," Life is but a JOKE🤡.
","Being DC's first standalone film in years, 'Joker' is without a doubt the biggest risk Warner Bros. has taken in terms of revisioning this iconic character for the big screen.1. The film's plot deviates almost entirely from the comics except for one storyline of the Joker having been a failed stand-up comic. Other than that, this is mostly a character study of a mentally ill man who deals with loneliness and the aggressive and unfair society he lives in that ultimately pushes him to a breaking point. Personally, I rather enjoy such stories that deal in harsh realities and how people deal with such. Director Todd Phillips without question proves his strength as a serious director with this film.2. Ever since 2008's release of 'The Dark Knight', Heath Ledger has stood the test of time of being the best comic-to-screen adaptation of the Joker. While I still believe Ledger's portrayal captures the true chaotic nature of the character, Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck/Joker is easily as equally Oscar worthy. I'm sure other reviews will elaborate a lot more on how brilliant Phoenix is in the part so it should be no surprise me saying it here.3. This is an R-Rated film that pushes boundaries psychologically and causes the audience to ponder back and forth on how they should feel about Arthur himself as he begins his inevitable spiral into madness. There is also a clever approach to the filmmaking in which it makes one question as to whether what they're watching is real or not. If you've seen the trailers, you'd know that some other popular DC characters make an appearance in this film, but don't get your hopes up for a sequel of any kind cause this film isn't about them and it's clear that this is definitely standalone.4. The rest of the supporting cast serve their respective purposes to where they don't detract from Arthur's story. The only other people apart from Phoenix to get a little more screen-time is of course Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy who plays Arthur's ailing mother Penny. My one complaint however is that Arthur's inevitable transformation into the Joker (as we know the character to be) comes in the last 30mins of the film. Despite the tension and suspense being high during the climax, the transformation should have been given a little more time to resonate rather than being rushed.As of 2019, 'Joker' has not only been a genuine cinematic achievement in the comic book genre but in terms of a sheer character drama as well. This will obviously be in my top 5 films of the year and hopefully everyone can appreciate this gritty yet compelling look of a man who's life is no laughing matter.",9,1,4,5 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," LIVE, DIE, REPEAT.....watching this movie!!!
","'Edge of Tomorrow' is the best Sci-Fi/Action flick one could hope for:) It cleverly combines drama, action and surprisingly humor with the fantastic directing of Doug Liman (Bourne Identity).Tom Cruise has without a doubt proved himself to be a shining action-star of this generation. Schwarzenegger, Stallone and even Bruce Willis, only wishes they had a film like this on their resumes.'Starship Troopers' with a 'Groundhog Day' twist, sounds silly right? Well you'd be wrong when it comes to 'Edge of Tomorrow'. The savage alien 'Mimics' have attacked earth, and only a military Major (Cruise) who has been unwillingly thrust into an alien war, must put an end to the bloody conflict when he mysteriously obtains the ability to reset the day whenever he is killed in battle.Coming to the aid of Cage (Tom Cruise), is Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), better known in the war as the 'Angel of Verdun'. Blunt does a fine job of being the 'Full Metal B*tch' next to Cruise, having her character fleshed out more and more as the film progresses. Both her and Cruise make a decent pair although I personally thought someone much more attractive should have been cast in Blunt's role.The trailers did a great job of concealing the Mimics/aliens, cause they are savage and scary as hell when they are seen in the final film. Hat's off to the effects team cause the visuals and designs of the aliens are simply fantastic. The Mech-Suites look bulking and odd when the actors wear them at first but once again, doubts are removed, cause they are f#%king badass once in combat.It's hard to find a flaw in this movie other than the fact it had to end. I wish the final scene went on longer so we could get a decent conversation between the two leads in the aftermath of it all. Once again, when it comes to watching this movie; LIVE...DIE... & REPEAT!!!",8,0,1,28 March 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of Bullsh*t!
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the story of up and coming yuppie Jordan Belfort as he schemes his way to the top of the stock-broker game. It's safe to say, as entertaining as this movie seems, it really isn't.Martin Scorsese is a legend in the directing business, but he falls short this time with the absurdity of this film. In no way am I intolerant of a hard R-Rated film, but this pushed it to a disgusting and uncomfortable level. The word 'F#%k' is used in close to damn near every sentence to a grand total of over 500 times. Clearly the script writers had an easy job writing dialogue where 80% of it is profanity.In no way am I knowledgeable of the real Jordan Belfort, but DiCaprio's representation of him is way too exaggerated that it's borderline ridiculous. Even without reading the book, I'm 100% sure that the life of Jordan Belfort was in no way as bold-faced, wacky, exaggerated and goofy as it's represented in this film. DiCaprio does an okay job with his performance when it comes to the emotional and more direct scenes as Belfort, but it's buried under the crazy non-sense this film constantly bombards the audience with.Margot Robbie plays Jordan's second wife Naomi, who's only purpose is being the 'sex object' and estranged wife. A woman who marries a man who cheats on his ex-wife (with you), is a sex and drug addict that runs a scheming business, deserves every bad thing that happens. Jonah Hill, rounds off the cast as Belfort's.....goofy sidekick Donnie......and that's it.Scorsese fails on every level for a director of his capacity, making this film a huge miss for him. People are gonna like this film more than not, so DiCaprio will get an Oscar nomination for all the wrong reasons. This was a viewing experience that made me feel high on cocaine when it was over, but not in a good way. The film pushed itself and it's audience till it breaks with all the ridiculous profanity and erratic craziness that leaves you baffled and wondering: 'What the hell did I just see?'So if you get a chance to see this film, don't take it.",4,6,9,3 April 2016
Wonder Woman," 'I can save the day, but you can save the World.'
","'Wonder Woman' lassos her way onto the big screen as DC unleashes it's 4th film of it's extended universe. With acclaimed female director Patty Jenkins at the helm, does this film finally surpass the critical stomping of both 'Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad'?1. To be perfectly blunt, 'Wonder Woman' indeed (with the exception of 'Man of Steel') lifts the depressing curtain of the DCEU. This film exceeded my expectations by far and no one could wipe the proud smile off my face leaving the theater. After Superman flew across the sky in 2013, it took DC four years to raise the bar back up to a level in which I thought 'Man of Steel' succeeded (as far as origin stories go). Was it a flawless movie?......No. Does it succeed in parts where it's good?......in spades. When Wonder Woman/Diana Prince made her debut in 'Dawn of Justice', I can honestly say that I wasn't that impressed, nor was I a fan of Gal Gadot since I thought of her as a mediocre actress at best. However, I'm often glad to be proved wrong.2. Having Zack Snyder (Man of Steel/Dawn of Justice) and David Ayer (Suicide Squad) at the reins up to this point, it took a woman like Patty Jenkins to finally turn things around. With 'Monster' being her claim to directorial fame, Jenkins will definitely be remembered for this now, as well she should be. Of course Gal Gadot will be the most outstanding hero of the DCEU, that is unless Aquaman, The Flash or Green-Lantern decide to steal the show in their respective films lol. Even tho I still think her acting is not on the level of great, Gadot does manage herself well enough to were I genuinely felt for her character as the film progressed. Being a guy, it's kinda hard to relate to a female lead based on my gender, but it doesn't divert from how good I thought she was.3. However, the true acting spirit and the most relatable character to me, was Chris Pine as Cpt. Steve Trevor. Even though it's easy to get lost in his blue eyes, Pine steals every scene he's in and his chemistry with Gadot is easily better than that of Superman & Lois Lane. For the first time in this universe was I caught up in the love-story, and Chris Pine is just a beautiful man altogether;) Reading my review so far, you'd think my rating should be higher, but as I mentioned earlier, the film has flaws. Mainly....the villains, not the best, pretty weak and lazy; that's how I'd describe them. Apart from Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) and Gen. Ludendorff (Danny Huston), there is a third antagonist who is revealed during the climax, but my review is spoiler free.4. As with every DCEU climax, this one is no different as it boils down to a CGI-fest for the final sequence. Even though it's more focused than the other films' climax battles, it sorta (but not completely) takes away from the emotion the movie was trying to convey at that point. I'll admit that there was a moment in the last action sequence that got me a little teary-eyed in which Steve and Diana talk. The last time I cried was in 'Man of Steel' and I'm not too proud to admit it. Despite the heavy use of slow-motion shots in the very first action sequence when the Amazons storm the beach, everything from then on works really well. Audiences can now see the sheer power Wonder Woman possesses along with her superhuman skill- set and combat abilities.I wish I could give this film a higher rating than I have, but with time to reflect, there were just some unforgivable errors made in which the DC filmmakers should have picked up on, seeing as how it costed them in the past.

Black Panther," 'Different' isn't always 'Better.'
","The most anticipated MARVEL film since 'The Avengers' (2012), does the hype surrounding 'Black Panther' pay off in terms of it being an exceptional film, or does it falter under the weight of expectations?1. There will be major spoilers scattered throughout my review so this is your last chance to stop reading if you have yet to see the film. The movie picks up a week after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' as Prince T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda and ascends to the throne as King. The plot on the surface is fine and delivers as expected, but the events that follow isn't anything new. Not saying that's a bad thing, but there was nothing that happened I wasn't surprised about. The more interesting subplot revolves around a past event in which King T'Chaka (John Kani) murders his younger brother N'Jabu (Sterling K. Brown) for trading Wakandan arms to various countries. It turns out N'Jabu had a son (Erik Killmonger) that grew up to seek revenge against the country that abandoned he and his father.2. As much class and style he possessed for his brief stint in 'Civil War', Chadwick Boseman is not interesting at all as T'Challa/Black Panther. Not saying he's a bad actor, but he plays the character with such drawl and lack of charisma. He does not 'own the role' as they say, so it's hard for me to buy into it. Michael B. Jordan was by far the most interesting and sympathetic character by far. He brings much needed life into an already dull film. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger but unfortunately he has very little screen-time. After the sequence at the museum in the beginning, Jordan does not show up in the film until 40-45mins later. Killmonger is such a compelling character that by the time he finally pops up again, they rush through his story to where he feels under developed. I would wholeheartedly agree that he could have been the best villain of the MCU to date had the script-writers only incorporated him more into the story. 3. Andy Serkis was an interesting villain as Ulysses Klaue when he first appeared in 'Age of Ultron', but he's murdered by Killmonger halfway through so there obviously won't be any more development for him to say the least. Despite that, Serkis does make his presence known during the casino and chase sequence in South Korea. As far as action. there were only two sequences that I did enjoy, one being Black Panther chasing Klaue through the streets of Korea and Killmonger kicking the crap out of T'Challa to claim the throne as the new King. There honestly wasn't any other set-pieces I enjoyed or found mildly exciting. The final brawl between T'Challa and Killmonger on the subway track was awful. The CGI was weak and the overall fight was boring without any sheer tension or stakes.4. Apart from Angela Basset and Forest Whitaker, the rest of the supporting cast is either annoying or flat, and the same goes for the humor in the film. If it was up to me, the script would have gotten an overhaul or placed in the hands of actual writers to modify or (better yet) rewrite the whole damn thing. Despite the camera occasionally doing unnecessary close-ups on the fights, the cinematography on the African plains were amazing. The design on Wakanda and the sets blew me away, however, we don't spend a lot of time on the environments to say I felt captivated by it. Maybe 'Infinity War' might do justice for this character once more, but as for now, the Black Panther himself is a weak and undeserving (so-called) hero. Imagine Thor lost his home of Asgard, lost most of his people and even lost an eye all in his last movie, and I truly believe he'd make a better King than T'Challa and actually have the balls to rule Wakanda.'Black Panther' will undoubtedly sky-rocket at the box-office from all the undeserving false hype. Sure, kids will love it but there's no reason critics to honestly give such a mediocre film glowing reviews. Seeing it for what it, this movie is no better and probably lesser than some of the MCU film before it.",5,104,230,19 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Darkness & Light!
","'Dawn of Justice' picks up 18 months after the events of 'Man of Steel' where people are in question on whether Superman (Henry Cavill) can be trusted residing in this world of ours. Citizens and politicians don't feel as threatened as Gotham's very own Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who summons his alter-ego 'Batman' in order to combat this possible foe.1. The film kicks things into gear just a few minutes in as we witness the 'Battle of Metropolis' (the climax of 'Man of Steel') through the perspective of Bruce Wayne as he witnesses casualties (due to the destruction caused by Superman and Zod) in his city of Gotham. This is one of the key sequences that really pulls the audience in and gets you hyped for the events to come. It emphasizes the hate Batman feels towards Superman as it inevitably builds up to that ultimate face- off between them.2. The best aspect of this film, is in fact.....'Batman' himself; Ben Affleck. He really absorbs, captures and owns the role of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. You can't take your eyes off him whenever he's on screen cause you feel his torment and fueling hate as the movie progresses. People may be divided by how brutal his portrayal of Batman may be cause he is very...very...brutal. Batman kills throughout the film without second guessing and I personally loved it. I'll admit, killing isn't a character trait of Batman but it does make things interesting cause it's something we wouldn't expect from the caped crusader. I can't recall what fighting styles were used, but Affleck manages to capture the sheer physicality of Batman ,which leads to all the action scenes focused on him, pretty f#%king awesome:)3. You may think the continuing romance between Clark Kent and Lois Lane is the emotional hook of the movie, but it's really not. It feels like they've lost most of the chemistry they shared in 'Man of Steel' which translates poorly into this film. You really could care less about them, wishing that most of their scenes were cut. The more interesting on-screen couple though is Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot have the most chemistry whenever they share the screen even though it's not much. Not saying there's a romance between them (but we'll see;) although they make a really cool pair.4. The action in the first two-thirds of the movie is pretty awesome to say the least, especially every sequence involving Batman. The two most outstanding set-pieces are the Batmobile chase and the rescuing of Martha Kent. This is where Batman shines immensely, which proves just how much more interesting and dynamic he is opposed to Superman. Up until the climax, the movie shows promise even though the face-off we've all been waiting to see where Batman takes on Superman, doesn't last very long. You feel a bit disappointed and cheated in a way just by how brief it all is. It is revealed that Lex Luthor (Jesse Eissenberg) has orchestrated this confrontation by kidnapping Martha Kent, thus forcing Superman's hand to kill Batman. The high-tech Bat-suite is never really explained just by function alone and it's hard to see why Superman didn't just explain the situation to Batman instead of throwing punches at first. 5. Unfortunately, the movie falls apart in the third act where Lex reveals his plans and unleashes the ancient Kryptonian 'Doomsday'. Never do we fully understand how Lex created Doomsday and why it involved General Zod's body aboard the crashed ship. I was ready to walk out of the theater just by the fact that the fight between Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman taking on Doomsday in so terribly chaotic. The kids will love it but things got too crazy for me the more it went on. The creature design was unimpressive and the CGI became mediocre as explosions went off left and right.It's exhausting to watch, but I used Wonder Woman as eye-candy while waiting for the sequence to end;) Another flaw is the fact that the film is littered with dream sequences throughout. This aspect really weighs it down, especially when Batman has his 'Mad Max' out-in-the-wasteland experience, which hints at the villainous 'Darkseid'.Overall, 'Dawn of Justice' is an enjoyable experience if you take it on a light and fun level, but that's about it. Of course, a segment of the film is hijacked for the purpose of advertising the upcoming 'Justice League', but that's not really a major nit-pick. Whether you love it or hate it...I can't blame anyone cause the likes and dislikes are about 50/50. That aside, I can safely say I still had a good time watching this:)",6,1,5,10 April 2016
Casino Royale," You know my name; Bond...James Bond.
","'Casino Royale' is a well crafted '007' film that does justice and stays true to Ian Fleming's novel. Martin Campbell surely has outdone himself since his first 'Bond' film 'GoldenEye', with a different directing style that makes this the most modern and grounded of all the 'Bond' films before.1. Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery, but he does the best he can with the character of James Bond even though his acting comes off a bit stiff and emotionally detached at times. However, he does have the best physicality of the previous Bond actors and it sure does show in all of the action sequences which are choreographed amazingly.2. The one sequence which stands out above the rest, is the spectacular foot chase after the opening credits where Bond pursues a bomb-maker involved in a sinister plot which is uncovered later on in the film. All the action in this film is done surprisingly well under Campbell's direction (which I had hoped later directors would have taken note on...but didn't) with all emulating a sense of suspense, excitement and most of all...consequence.3. Mads Mikkelsen is even more exceptional than Craig as the cunning antagonist 'Le Chiffre'. He brings a sense of mystery and style as the character with so many interesting dimensions as a villain that he steals the show whenever he's on screen. One flaw is that he doesn't have enough screen-time, especially in the third act of the film. He proves himself to be smarter than Bond and just outdoes him at every turn when it comes to style.4. Now the bad part. The real anchor that weighs this film down is the campy love-story. Craig and Green (Vesper) have an interesting dynamic when they play-off each other with a sort of love/hate relationship once she is introduced at the beginning of the film's second act. The movie takes a huge nose-dive near the 2hr mark when their love-story comes front and center. At that point, it feels like the film has outstayed it's welcome when we get a full 15mins of Bond and Vesper laying on beaches, having sex, living in hotels and exchanging lines of horrible dialogue with each other. These scenes (undoubtedly) should have been cut from the final film, cause it unnecessarily adds extra length to an already 2hr 30min running time.5. Lastly, in no way am I denying that Eva Green isn't an attractive woman, but the actress who appears in the first act (Caterina Murino) is an absolute knock-out and is more of a classic beauty suited for a 007 film. She should have played the female lead of Vesper Lynd rather than Green based on appearance alone, cause she just emits hotness;)If I were to decide, I'd say 'Casino Royale' is the best of the Daniel Craig '007' films since the others (the closet being 'Skyfall') never really live up to the bar which was set be this reboot.",7,2,5,29 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," That's not how the 'Force' works!
","'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' has been the most anticipated and over-rated movie for a decade, but is it worth the the hype?1. To start, this film heavily mirrors 'A New Hope' just by plot alone. A lone scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley) discovers a stranded droid called BB-8 who carries classified information regarding the whereabouts of the last Jedi; Luke Skywalker. Sounds familiar? That's cause it is. You can say that this films serves best for the new generation of 'Star Wars' fans but doesn't deliver on the fresher take we've all been hoping for.2. The stand-out performance in this movie is Harrison Ford himself, playing the infamous Han Solo. His charm, charisma and rebellious style is something you can't help but love. Both he and Chewbacca are more of a dynamic pair that the younger leads. Carries Fisher returns as Princess Leia, but this time goes under the 'General' title as she is now the leader of the 'Resistance'. Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) doesn't appear until the last 3mins of the film, so it's kinda confusing why he's credited in the main cast when this is more of a cameo appearance.3. Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron) and Daisy Ridley (Rey) fit well into this universe, except for John Boyega (Finn). This is a prime example of horrible miscasting with this particular actor. I suppose the main reason for his casting was the fact that they wanted someone with an ethic background in this film. Boyega plays a 'Storm Trooper' from the 'Star-Killer Base' that goes rogue and becomes entangled with the resistance. He doesn't fit well as a leading-man as he screams, shouts and frantically stumbles his way through the movie. The point where Rey is captured by the 'First-Order', Finn acts more like a nerdy p#ssy-hound to the point where it seems like he's only coming to her rescue in hopes of getting in her pants.4. Adam Driver plays the emerging Sith-Lord 'Kylo Ren' of the First-Order, who is ultimately revealed to be the son of Han Solo and Leia Skywalker. The costume design is devious and intriguing as Driver's performance. He is a presence to be felt as he goes ruthlessly searching for the droid BB-8, cutting down anyone who stands in his way. He has aspirations to follow in the dark foot-steps of his late grandfather Anakin Skywalker/Darth-Vader. It would be a lie to say that his scenes aren't gripping, the most stand out being where he murders his own father (Han Solo).5. JJ Abrams does a fine job taking the helm, considering he's fresh off directing the rebooted 'Star Trek' films. His directing style here couldn't feel more different than the films he's done in the past. It's a breath of fresh air that Abrams didn't use any of his constant lens-flares in this film.All in all, 'The Force Awakens' is a decent film and more of a natural progression from 'Return of the Jedi'. Having been a fan of the classic movies, this one feels all too familiar to take the story that serious. That aside, I think 'Star Wars' fans can still appreciate this film for all the things it does right, cause it does outweigh the wrong.",7,1,18,12 April 2016
Deadpool," NO Claws, NO Hugh Jackman, NO Problem:)
","'Deadpool' is a breath of fresh air to the genre of comic-book movies. It's one of the few R-Rated MARVEL films (apart from the 'Blade' trilogy) that pushes the limit of violent action and breaks the fourth wall.1. Ryan Reynolds was born to play the 'Merc with a Mouth' (not just the fact that he's also Canadian) with his natural humorous charm and his (always) in shape physique. He is the focal point to everything even when the movie hits it's lows at times. Casting anyone else would be a huge injustice to the character of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. 2. Ryan has a decent amount of chemistry with his love interest in the film Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) although you don't get much of them together for a majority of the film. Things are balanced just right between them seeing as this is mainly a superhero flick and not a whole-hearted love-story which the film-makers are fully aware of.3. The effects are surprisingly good (especially on the mutant Colossus) for a film on a modest 30 million dollar budget. Most of the stunts and fight scenes are practical until the third act where the CGI tricks are pulled out of the bag and into the mix. The only thing that's animated about Deadpool (aside from his personality) are his eyes, if you look closely...you'll notice.4. Taking into consideration the events of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', you'll clearly know that the future (our present) has been reset. So Deadpool's storyline in this film doesn't follow his traditional product of Wolverine/Weapon-X Experimentation. The one main thing that carries over from his comic-book adaption is the fact that he's dying from stage-4 cancer. This doesn't at all hurt the film despite what hardcore comic-book geeks may think. The fact that Wade is betrayed and experimented on to the point where his mutation is triggered through stress, desperation and sheer torture, makes you feel more sympathy for a character like Deadpool.5. Ed Skrein plays 'Ajax' (Deadpool's sworn enemy and tormentor), another self-experimented mutant who's abilities garner him super-human strength and invulnerability to pain. He's an interesting addition and opposition of Deadpool, yet he feels more one- dimensional than anything else, only there to serve the purpose of acting and looking menacing until his final showdown with Deadpool at the film's climax. Gina Carano (Angel Dust) plays Ajax's partner/sidekick, who carries the same mutant powers as he (minus the severed nerve endings). She has little to do and barely any dialogue, but just to aid Ajax in the final battle and take on Colossus.6. T.J Miller and some other side characters fill out the rest of the comedic cast that add to the graphic humor. His character of Weasel fits in well and plays off Ryan naturally whenever they interact. Take it, this film is not for everyone. It's super violent, super bloody and super awesome! Not a good idea to take your kids to see this, cause I can't stress enough that 'Deadpool' isn't your average superhero flick. A sequel is undoubtedly on it's way, and needless to say, I only have three word in response to that; 'Bring it on!'",8,3,11,29 March 2016
Spectre," The writing's (NOT) on the wall.
","'Spectre' is the fourth and final installment of Daniel Craig's reign as Ian Fleming's infamous spy; 'James Bond'. Does this film go out on a good note? Mostly......no.1. From the beginning to end, it's quite clear that Daniel Craig is overly bored of this character at this point. Apart from 'Casino Royale', Craig lacks the charm and charisma that Bond carries as a main trait. His expression rarely ever charges as he wears the same face throughout the film, making you guess if he's acting or not. Nothing makes you care about Bond just by the portrayal here, so if he doesn't care, why should we as the audience?2. I had high hopes that the villain would shine for the least, since two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz was cast. However, it would have been wiser to just re-watch 'Inglorious Basterds' instead. Waltz has few scenes in the film and rarely ever comes across as menacing or dangerous in any way. The reveal to who he actually is comes at no surprise, especially if you're a fan of the Sean Connery films. 3. The only person who seems like a genuine threat is Dave Bautista, who plays a 'Spectre' henchman called Hinx. Again, he's another character that doesn't appear enough to get a grasp of who he actually is. Nevertheless, Bautista's appearance proves to be more threatening as every encounter he has with Craig is by far the more entertaining feats of the movie. We never had a formidable henchman in the Daniel Craig 'Bond' films thus far, so Bautista's inclusion was perfect casting here. However, he is dropped near the end of the second act of the film...forever:(4. Lastly, the story is not at all compelling even considering this is the big reveal of a huge shady organization that's been hinted at since the 1960s films. The new Bond-Girl (Lea Seydoux) plain sucks as a new campy love-story is introduced, adding absolutely nothing of benefit. There is an obvious connection to the previous three films as this one tries (and fails) to wrap things up in a decent way.Sam Mendes should have exited the franchise when the chance arose, cause for an Oscar-winning director, this is the worst of his work. Hollywood needs to take a much needed break from anything 007 related, until they can refresh their stories and ideas to perfection before putting this character back on the screen.",5,2,5,9 May 2016
The Nice Guys," You can never be too NICE;)
","'The Nice Guys' is the latest return to form from writer/director Shane Black. Coming off the unexplained mess of 'Iron Man 3', Black delivers a fun and edgy dark-comedy in the vein of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'.1. Never have I been a fan of Ryan Gosling (March), because his acting has always been on a sub-par/mediocre level to me. Yet somehow, Gosling fits perfectly here and blends well into his character. On the other hand, Russell Crowe (Healy) has always been in my top 10 'favorite actors' list, (not that I'm complaining) but he seems to be playing himself in this role. Crowe is most notably known for being an aggressive tough-guy in real life, and he mirrors his character to a fault in this film. Hence the reason I said he's playing himself lol.2. The plot of this movie is fairly simple and nothing all that special, but the real entertainment comes from great dialogue and interplay between characters. Kim Basinger (Kuttner) has an important role in this, yet her acting is utterly poor whenever she's on screen. The surprising talent comes from young actress Angourie Rice, who plays Ryan Gosling's feisty and responsible daughter Holly. The darker tone of this film comes in the form of Matt Bomer, who plays the villainous hit-man John Boy. Bomer is quite scary and menacing even though he doesn't have much screen- time.3. Shane Black took a great direction in making this a murder/mystery which keeps the audience compelled. Also the fact that it's based around the death of an incredible hot porn-star (Murielle Telio) and gorgeous women as suspects, there's no reason guys wouldn't like this film;) There is never a boring moment as things move at a good pace, in which I have to give a lot of credit to the editor. Crowe & Gosling are an exceptional pair, just like Gibson & Glover or Downey & Kilmer, but that's what Black does best, writing strong buddy-characters with great chemistry. This film deserves a lot more praise and recognition because I know movies like this don't draw large crowds. 'The Nice Guys' is pure entertainment, with a perfect balance of crime, action, drama and of course....comedy.",8,1,2,20 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," The world belongs to the MAD!!!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the continuing saga of drifter Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in a post-apocalyptic world. This time, Max comes across a vicious warlord and aids in the escape and plan of a rebel called Furiosa (Charlize Theron).1. George Miller goes above and beyond in this much-anticipated sequel of the beloved franchise. If you were expecting a movie filled with drama, romance or even a compelling story-line, this really isn't that type of film. The action is wall-to-wall the moment the movie starts in a sequence where Max tries to outrun and is eventually kidnapped by the 'War-Boys'. There are three key action sequences that blows your mind; starting with the Sandstorm, the desert Gorge escape and the final chase back to the Citadel.2. The plot is simple, so there's no confusion. Furiosa smuggles the beautiful sex-slaves/wives of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) out of the Citadel, and the war parties hunt them down after finding out the wives are missing. The only downside of this film comes when things slow down. Near the beginning of the last third, the characters take a pit-stop (basically) and try to gather their thoughts when they realize the place they were looking for isn't actually there anymore. Talking about philosophy and future hopes really isn't a strong point for these type of films.3. I can understand if people won't like it due to all the madness, but it's surprisingly tamed enough to where things never feel like it's pushed to a breaking point. Unlike Tarantino or Bay, Miller knows exactly the right mixture to making a near perfect adventure film. Hardy and Theron are the key players here, although it feels like we get a bit more character development of the latter. This film won 6 Academy Awards, and it's well deserving of it. From the cinematography, editing, artistry, costume and production design, it all blends in a spectacular fashion. 'Fury Road' is a long chase sequence from beginning to end, but I guarantee, it's a ride you'll never forget;)",8,3,11,20 April 2016
13 Hours," 'It ain't over till it's over.'
","'13 Hours' is another (non-robot) Michael Bay film, which tells the true events about the contracted soldiers which defended a US compound on September 11th 2012. Does it deliver as well as it should? And was justice done in the retelling of this true story?1. Just going on the premise of watching this as a movie with no factual attachments, '13 Hours' is indeed a really good film. However, if you're going into this as being just another 'balls-to- the-wall' action flick, you'd be wrong. The best advantage of this film is that it's more of a suspenseful thriller when it comes down to it. From the beginning, we get small doses of the job that these men undertake on a daily basis when it comes to defending their country's interests. We also see just how dangerous of a 'fail- state' Libya is, and the paranoia that your life can be at risk any moment really churns your stomach.2. The casting was terrific, and I believe this is James Badge Dale's (Rone) movie to carry. He has the most charisma and physicality in part of his acting, and you can't help but like his character. I honestly thought it was a mistake to make John Krasinski (Silva) the 'poster-boy' of this film. I say that due to the fact that he plays the average'man with no special qualities to him other than the fact that he has a family he wants to return to. Not saying he's bad, but he only gets one heartbreaking moment at the very end where we finally see him shine as an actor. I like Krasinski, but like I said, Dale is the better bet.3. I know many critics condemn Michael Bay based on the 'Transformers' films, but people really need to let that go, cause Bay works extremely well when he's directing a non sci-fi movie. Bay is also overly known for being an action director, but this film is probably his least action-filled movie to date. Not saying that's a bad thing, but throughout the film we only get small doses of action. I'm sure the script writers adapted the events as accurately as they could, but I think this movie really needed an extended and edgy climatic action sequence. However, that's just my personal opinion overall if I had to nit-pick lol.I was hoping that this film would be just as or even more gripping than a similar one like 'Lone Survivor', but it does simply an 'okay' job non-the-less. I'd say this is up there with Michael Bay's better films, and I would heavily recommend it.",7,1,4,22 November 2016
Sully," Miracles can happen, even on the Hudson.
","From actor/director Clint Eastwood, 'Sully' tells the story of the aftermath, through the eyes of Cpt. Chelsey Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), about that fateful day in which he miraculously landed a passenger aircraft on the Hudson river.1. There is no film that I can think of, in which Tom Hanks ever gave a bad performance. Nor have I ever disliked a character Tom Hanks has played. The man is a National Treasure, and one of the greatest living actors of out generation. Even if one has never seen an interview with the actual Cpt. Sullenberger or simply can't remember, Hanks completely loses himself in the role of Sully. There is a blatant reason why Hanks is a two-time Oscar winner, and could very well be heading towards another nomination here cause he absolutely deserves it and all the praise he's getting.2. Apart from the master himself, I was just as equally impressed with the acting of Aaron Eckhart, who plays Sully's co-pilot Jeff Skiles. There is never a moment where you doubt the chemistry between these two because their acting is on another level. Mr. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an incredible amount of praise just by his directing alone. If this man doesn't get a nomination for 'Best Director', I'll literally pull a 'Dirty Harry' on the Academy. The film is short, but it's edited in such a superb way that it never leaves you feeling bored.3. There are just a few hiccups here and there that just doesn't make this film quite as perfect. Laura Linney plays Sully's distraught wife Lorraine, however she never comes across as such since all her scenes take place within the confines of her home. Maybe the reason is due to some scenes being cut, but her range is never fully explored. With events that could have ended in tragedy, there are (unfortunately) nightmares that follow. There are dream and elapsed sequences where Sully envisions the worst, from the plane crashing, to passengers losing their lives.All in all, 'Sully' is still a sharp and well directed cinematic feature, and something those who witnessed the miracle themselves, should be proud of.",8,0,1,10 October 2016
Alien: Covenant," In space...no one can hear you (unenthusiastically) scream.
","'Alien: Covenant' is the second installment of the prequel films leading up to the original 'Alien' (1979). Being one of the most iconic monsters in horror-cinema, does the infamous Xenomorph lend itself to recapturing the scares as it once did?1. Ridley Scott returns to direct his third entry in the 'Alien Universe', with he previous ones being both the original 'Alien' as well as 'Prometheus'. It is quite easy to see that Scott is in fact the most invested in this franchise seeing as he has stuck around this long. Being such an accomplished director, Scott brings his signature style into the film giving it a nice flow as things progress. The editing is great since everything moves at a decent pace and I was never bored throughout. To Scott's credit, he knows how to keep an audience entertained or at least engaged to some extent. However it would be unwise to compare this film to any of his highly acclaimed works.2. This installment does in fact surpass it's predecessor 'Prometheus' on the grounds of it being a little more simple with the plot. When an unexpected accident occurs, members of a colonist crew are awakened on their way to a surveyed planet when they are intercepted by a random and mysterious transmission. To it's credit, the film wastes no time plunging the audience right into the action. After critics panned 'Prometheus' for being slow, boring and weak on story, the writers obviously got the message and tried their best to tighten things up with this one. As far as the scares go, I think audiences have become too familiar with the creature at this point to be in any kind of awe.3. From the trailers, they tried to convey that the Xenomorphs no longer need to burst through people's chests, but their backs as well. If there's anything we learned from 'Prometheus', the 'Engineers' weaponized a specific black goo that......well......does anything convenient for the plot. For something that was never fully explained before, there's still not much of an explanation in this one as well. I honestly didn't care too much for wracking my brain around the science this film was pushing, just as long as we got the alien we love incorporated with creepy thrills for the least. As far as the black goo and spores, nobody cares anymore. 4. The action is surprisingly well done but the horror and gore is nothing we haven't seen before. The crew consists of fourteen people, but we only get to know Michael Fassbender, Danny McBride, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup (to an extent). Everyone else (as you figured) is just to be killed off. There is a twist near the end that really is too obvious to not see coming. Once again, I still regard this as being better than 'Prometheus', but still it seems to fail in recapturing the horror or deliver the same thrills for a film that finally reintroduces the Xenomorph. 'Average' is probably the best word to describe this film.Like I said, 'Alien: Covenant' is still entertaining, although I didn't feel cheated seeing this in theaters, it's still a middle-of- the- road sci-fi flick that doesn't quite exceed expectations.",5,0,6,26 May 2017
Furious 7," It's not just about being fast...
","'Furious 7' is the latest installment to the franchise and the last for the late Paul Walker. Nothing much has changed as far as the tone of the movie goes, but it still delivers on the things it does right.1. The initial plot involves Deckard Shaw's (Jason Statham) quest for revenge against Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) for the crippling of his brother Ian (Luke Evans). This should have been the major following of the film, however it diverts into something irrelevant and confusing. Shaw somehow has a lock on Toretto and finds him at every turn, yet Dom decides to go in search of a device that would allow him to locate Shaw instead. The film uses this second-hand plot in order to travel to exotic locations to progress the film. Even though it's intriguing, it's completely pointless.2. Jason Statham was perfect casting for the main antagonist, yet the inclusion of Djimon Honsou and Ronda Rousey are unnecessary and terrible (respectively). It's quite obvious that Jason Statham is known for being an expert martial-artist in real life and it mirrors his character in the film. Neither Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs) nor Vin Diesel (Toretto) can match his skill even in the film, but somehow they manage to get the upper-hand in their fight scenes. This is hard to believe among the many other things that one needs to suspend his/her disbelief for. 3. The action is impressive for the most part, but the movie borders on ridiculous for the most part. I can stomach the set-pieces throughout the film, that is....until the end. This is where the 'Mission:Impossible' films will always rank higher than these, cause they never fall into the 'goofy action' territory. Only in a different world would someone walk away from a tumble down a 30- story cliff or parking garage. It seems Formula-1 racing doesn't exist in this world, cause if it did, then those drivers would undoubtedly be the best, not a bunch of criminal street-thugs with toy cars.The movie concludes on an emotional note as it says farewell to Paul Walker, due to his untimely death during production. Basically, I'm kinda bored and exhausted by this franchise at this point, but if you love it......then by all mean......keep driving forward.",6,3,22,18 May 2016
