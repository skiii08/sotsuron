Having to hurry up, remember what has happened, and to get back to Los Angeles in time for the wedding. Lighting for 'The Hangover' was always very bright and colorful. There was never a scene were everything seemed dark or gloomy. Even after they woke and realized that Doug was gone the lighting was still bright. At night when their car got hit by Mr. Chow, the street was very well lit to show that Vegas is a town that never sleeps. There wasn't a lot of music when it came to this movie. Most of the sound came from the silly things that they guys did throughout the movie. Whenever they would go to another scene there would be no noise so that the audience would be able to focus on the actors and what was going on.The Hangover's theme closely resembles the theme of 'Road Trip'. Road trip is about a guy who mailed a video off of him cheating on his girlfriend and him and his group of friends deciding that they would go with him to go retrieve it. They both tie end together because they both show how mistakes can happen and how far people will go to fix them. The Hangover's theme focused on how three friends having to backtrack their night to find their friend, before they miss his wedding.",9,1,2,13 December 2010
