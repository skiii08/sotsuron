Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A truly awesome movie that doesn't get the praise it deserves. Indeed very worthy of being a Star Wars chapter.
","Often I wonder why people didn't like this movie. Even the fans seem to hate it. Well, not all do. I have actually meet lots of people that like it, and I think it is indeed a great movie.All right, I admit that some things in it could have been omitted, but hey, it's nothing that hurts the movie. Jar Jar seems to be one of the main subjects of hate, but i think he's is a likable and nice character, maybe too clumsy, but its okay with me. Other of the complaints I often hear concerns Anakin. Whats the problem with the main character being a 10 year old boy? I don't see one, does he seem not credible? Not really, remember, he was no ordinary kid, the Force gave him those exceptional gifts, and consider how kids would be if we were in Star Wars time, they would be used to other things and environment, and would be smarter and more skilled in other stuff. There is some political babble in it, but its nothing overwhelming, and the movie never gets boring.Everything in this movie is top notch. The characters are excellent, the music is awesome, the effects, the visuals, the locations, everything is incredible. The CG characters, vehicles and effects are just plain amazing. They're like they were real. There is nothing wasted in this film, and I think it is one of the best looking movies of all time. I really enjoy it and watch it every time it is on TV, just like i do with any Star Wars chapter. I really like all the characters, and specially Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi Wan, Darth Sidious, Darth Maul and the battle droids. This is an incredible chapter, and truly worthy of much praise, just like all Star Wars episodes, and i think Episode II should get the praise it deserves too, since it was very much badly criticized, just like Episode I, without a real reason to do it, people did it just for feeling pleasure by bashing something. Bash something they couldn't manage to make even in their wildest dreams. That's called jealousy and envy.I think this is a fantastic movie, the excellent first episode of the legendary Star Wars saga. And like it or not, a superb work of art that will be admired forever, and nothing can change that. In short, a classic. 10 out of 10-",10,0,2,29 May 2005
Van Helsing," One of my fav movies! Awesome! Its just like Castlevania!
","I have always been a big fan of the Akumajou Dracula (Castlevania) series, and since i saw the trailer of this movie I noticed there was something similar to it in Van Helsing. So I was looking forward to see it. And I did and it surpassed my expectations by far.That was one year ago, I saw it today on DVD and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Van Helsing is an awesome movie, it has a great cast, excellent characters, locations and a wonderful storyline.Hugh Jackman was a great choice to play the main character Gabriel Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale did a good job as Anna Valerious. The character design of the monsters is incredible, very well done and their CG rendering is convincing and stunning. Also, the non-CG characters, such as Frankenstein's monster, look stunning too. The Werewolf, is awesome, it's just as I imagine them, incredibly real-life looking and incredibly savage.The locations are very pleasant to see, and they add a very nice touch of eeriness to the movie. Everything in it, from the start is top notch and though the movie is set in the 19th century, it has an excellent middle ages atmosphere, with strange frightened people everywhere, many religious references,prayers in Latin, catholic paraphernalia and themes, the oppressive clergymen from the Vatican and dark Gothic art. In two words, simply wonderful.I have noticed some people says they didn't enjoy the movie and didn't like it. Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and mine is that this movie couldn't be better. A truly masterpiece, and I am not a guy that is into horror, gore, vampire, or Goth movies. I liked it very much because it is a great movie in all senses, and it did a wonderful job with each of the classic monsters we know and love: Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Werewolf, etc.This is just a short review I will make for now, I will soon add more of my thoughts about this incredible motion picture. Flawless, awesome, and fantastic. My favorite movie. This is the closest you can get to see the manga/anime world of Castlevania brought to life.Simply perfect. 100 out of 100.",10,2,4,6 February 2005
The Incredibles," This movie is like it was made by God Himself!
","Yes, maybe my summary sounds exaggerated, but there's no other way to describe this movie. It should get a 10 in the movie score here at IMDb.Once in a while a truly perfect movie is produced, and in 2004 it was The Incredibles. Everything, from the characters to the smallest details is mind-blowing. Everything in the movie looks awesome, and the character designs are excellent. The level of CG used in the movie is one of the highest i have seen, everything looks realistic, with a little addition of cartoonish look which enhances the overall appearance of characters and environments. The clothes of the characters look so real, its amazing. Their hair, it really looks like if it was completely real.The characters' design are perfect, and they are so likable, no one of them is a waste. All of them have their very own personality traits and it adds to the storyline. And speaking of the storyline, it is very good, it's not some goofy kind of story for kids, it's well written, fast paced and just plain amazing. Also, it's great that it's not really a movie just for kids, it treats its audience as intelligent people and the action scenes are very realistic, it's more like a very violent action movie. There's no restrictions in what's depicted, there's bombs, explosions, bullets (not beams or lasers) and even killed people. The animation and facial expressions are incredibly life-like.The issues in the lives of the characters are also dealt with not in the traditional way, not hiding the more serious or 'adult' themes from the kids, but depicting them life-like and in a nice non-vulgar or obscene way. The humor is also great, there's no absolutely forced or dumb jokes in the movie and the ones in it are very funny and creative.The sounds are fantastic and it adds a lot to the overall experience. The music is more like jazz, and fits the situations accordingly. I saw it dubbed so I am not sure how was the voice acting in English, though, I am sure it must have been pretty good for the first time, since American actors and actresses have never really been good at voice acting.This movie is a true example of how movies should be made. An excellent option, and i hope I can get the DVD when it comes out. The Incredibles is the closest that American movies can get to Anime and Manga, and it will always remain in my list of favorites.This movie gets a 10 out of 10. No, 100 out of 100! One of the best movies ever!",10,2,5,29 December 2004
