The Benchwarmers," Not Bad
","It wasn't actually a GOOD movie if you get what I mean.The dialouge wasn't spectacular and the acting wasn't greatBut it was very enjoyable which in the end, I guess, is what we watch movies for.So the entertainment factor score would be higher than 6. But because it's not a brilliant film it doesn't get the full score.Rob Sneider and other actors starred in this movie, good actors.But something that does really annoy me, or someone should I say, is John Heder. I have only seen him in 2 movies, this and School for Scoundrels but he isn't a brilliant actor so I don't wish him to be in any big movies in the near future.But well done for the movie, very enjoyable :D",6,1,2,30 August 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Magnificent piece of film!!!
","This movie is 8th in the world according to IMDb and I'm not surprised. I saw the movie first a few years ago with my dad and enjoyed it, but not I'm a bit older, I understand the movie is spectacular! Nicholson is amazing in it, his best movie and he has done very well in other movies including bucket list but this was amazing. All the characters you are supposed to love, you simply love and Nicholson's character 'Mc Murphy' and Chief have amazing chemistry and have a very special bond. But the best part of the movie, is when they pretend they are watching the world series and have a great time. A perfect movie and a must see for anyone!",10,2,4,28 August 2008
