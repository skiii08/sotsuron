Resident Evil: Afterlife," Truthfully not a bad film!
","I was excited about Afterlife when I saw the trailers featuring Wesker and other familiar characters. This film is honestly a good entry in the series and does do the Resident Evil series proud I think. I almost given up on the series after the absolutely dreadful Extinction before. Another good factor that improved on the previous instalment is that Paul Anderson took over once more as writer/director and I think he's done a very good job. The inclusion of more characters from Resident Evil 5 also made me like the film more being a massive fan of the game. Although the executioner made his way halfway into the film, his being there wasn't really explained and I feel that he was included just for cameo fun but was still good to see him. The characters all have flare and spark and none of them behave in a chaotic or headless chicken kinda way which is something I find irritating in an action film sometimes, but I didn't see anyone hamming it up. The story does pace well and has some good locations, set pieces and a lot of artistic style (the opening scene in Tokyo in the rain is a good one). I did get lost in the plot now and then and I think some characters didn't have a lot of time to shine (Chris, Jill and Wesker mainly). Also I'm not fully switched on to Alice and her predicament. If you're a fan of Resident Evil, then there is no reason whatsoever why you would turn this down. I genuinely believe these films have transisted well from video game. I'm a fan of the series apart from the aforementioned Extinction but you won't be disappointed with this one. A few minor plot holes and untied knots but a great film overall. P.S, my only drag with the film which I did laugh at was that amongst all the bullets flying, not one character in the entire movie reloaded their weapons!!!",9,0,2,25 July 2011
