Come and See," Russians sure do know how to make a boring movie, no matter how interesting the story is.
","Russians sure do know how to make a boring movie, no matter how interesting the story is.'Come and See' is an intense true story about a kind and quiet Russian boy who looks for a gun, which could be his ticket to join the Soviet Army. Little does he know the horrors that will come once he does join the army.It started out pretty good, but it soon got to a point where it all felt messy and nauseating, kind of like the feeling I get when watching an overly artsy Nicolas Roeg film. My only problem with it was that I might've not been in the right mood to enjoy a film like this, but I can't disagree with others calling it a masterpiece. Apart from that, some parts were very uncinematic and the editing was horrible.The best part of the film has got to be the natural cinematography, without it there probably wouldn't be much to talk about. I loved the point of view shots, they made me feel really uncomfortable. Some dialogue was pretty good and there were some scenes that were extremely tense, too bad they were followed by other scenes of boredom and nonsense.I've got to also point out how I loved the way the movie established so many characters in no time by doing simple things like taking a picture and seeing their reactions as they walked towards the group and how they posed was enough to tell me who these guys were. Once again, I have to say the camera work was brilliant, it reminded me of the similar work in 'Children of Men' and 'There Will Be Blood'.Towards the end I kept thinking this would make a great double bill to watch before 'Inglourious Basterds', for that way you wouldn't look away when the 'Bear Jew' beats the Nazi who doesn't give Aldo Raine the information he asks him for. There's a sense of realism the movie brings that makes it so discomforting to the viewer, even the bullets used in the movie were real and they even killed a cow. I'm not saying it's just an okay movie, its actually a great movie, but it's not a movie I'd like to see ever again as it left me feeling real bad and might've just ruined my day.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'The Thin Red Line', 'Au Revoir Les Enfants', 'The Pianist', and/or 'Requiem for a Dream'.",6,3,17,7 August 2013
Sucker Punch," Its Pan's Labyrinth directed by Quentin Tarantino
","First of all, do not compare this with Inception. I'm a fan of Zack Snyder and tried my best to see the good in this but it was to bad to try. It went the same way as Pan's Labyrinth but added violence into the fantasy too so there was no good part in it, the characters sucked, soundtrack didn't fit in, and copied so much from other movies. I can't believe Zack Snyder did this, being the same guy from movies I love so much (300 and Dawn of the Dead), how could he make this. Please don't watch this, I believe that is what he would want if he still wants to be looked at as a great director. Even though everyone sucked in this I still have to say Jena Malone was pretty good in it as always.",5,1,5,16 April 2011
This Is the End," Comedy of the Year
","I can't believe I was so close to not even watching this, 'This is the End' works in many ways, its an apocalyptic comedy, a date movie, a stoner movie, its Seth Rogen and the 'Apatow Mafia' at their peak and most of all its the most fun you'll ever have at a movie theater this year.Set in Los Angeles, its about Jay Baruchel (She's Out of My League) hanging out with Seth Rogen, who invites him to a party at James Franco's house, when suddenly all hell breaks lose.Its better to go in it not knowing nothing about it, its definitely one of those movies. Apart from the obvious, like Michael Cera's hilarious performance in it, its an original unexpected comedy with a great script. Its about friendship and it has a lot of pop culture references, which I loved about it.I saw it here in Los Angeles, where I'm staying for the film festival, I actually bumped into Michael Cera on the way to the movie, he seemed like a very cool guy, when I asked him for a picture, instead he said 'You know what, I'd like to get to know you instead' and he shook my hand, it was pretty cool.Overall its a very fun movie, wait to see Craig Robinson in it, I couldn't stop laughing at everything he did, but avoid seeing it with someone who's already seen it, you don't want them to spoil anything for you. As a matter of fact, just stop reading this review now if you haven't seen it and go see it, I really hope this movie gets the attention it deserves. By the way, the ending was just brilliant. Its definitely the comedy of the year up until now.I'd recommend it to people who liked 'Shaun of the Dead', 'From Dusk Till Dawn', '40 Year Old Virgin', 'Pineapple Express', and/or 'Superbad'.",10,27,54,6 July 2013
Blade," Stay away from this movie
","I don't like when movies make me suffer while watching them, specially when:<ul><li>every single line of dialogue makes me feel like vomiting. - the main character is the biggest douche in the history of cinema. - unnecessary twists come up just to make the story feel worse then it already is. - the soundtrack sounds like one from a lame video game. - every actor seems to put as little effort as they can. - fight scenes seem like the actors are emulating Michael Jackson.</li></ul>I feel sorry for the friend I invited to see this with me because I saw it on Quentin Tarantino's list of favorite movies from 1992 to 2009, only to then find out it wasn't this 'Blade' he was talking about, he was talking about another movie called 'The Blade' from 1995. I don't expect him to forgive me, nor let me choose another movie to watch ever again after this.After watching 'The Wolverine' I wanted to see what an R-Rated Marvel movie would be like (apart from 'The Punisher', which is a guilty pleasure of mine) and I thought this would be a great idea, I was wrong and if you haven't seen it I can only ask you to please stay away from it.I'd probably give it a 1/10 if it wasn't for a scene where a little Asian girl the bad guy, played by Stephen Dorff, is holding as a hostage gets thrown away into what seems to be a hot dog stand and from there to the steet, it was one of those Robert Rodriguez ridiculously funny moments and just because of it I'm giving the movie a star.I recommend you stay away from this...please don't watch it.",2,4,12,28 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Failed cash grab by Guillermo del Toro
","I tried hard to like it, I hate being too critical of it, but even though it was an okay movie, its also easy to forget the next day. Unlike movies like 'Fast and Furious 6', 'Pacific Rim' gives nothing to talk about, no big action sequence or anything we haven't seen before. The movie is just scenes from other movies put together starting with the definition of Kaijus, kind of like the opening to 'Pulp Fiction'.Kaijus: Colossal alien beasts who rise from an interdimensional portal on the Pacific floor to devastate human cities.Thats all you need to know, there's not much to it apart from that, the movie is what you would expect. Transformers + Godzilla = Power Rangers... or in this case, Pacific Rim.I liked the cast, too bad they've wasted their efforts on making such a poor action film. Well, its actually not bad, but there's not much to it, it gave me the same feeling I got when watching Power Rangers as a little kid. I would watch it, then go run and play and forget I even saw it.Its also safe to say its definitely the loudest movie of the year, its just an average action movie that feels like a failed cash grab by Guillermo del Toro. It does have a few good moments though, like one unexpected death scene I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, but apart from that its just a wannabe Michael Bay movie.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked 'Top Gun', 'Independence Day', 'Pearl Harbor', 'Transformers', or 'Armageddon'.",6,3,9,23 July 2013
Man of Steel," Not a masterpiece, but still great
","While it wasn't the superhero masterpiece I was expecting, with 'Watchmen' looking like what Kubrick would've done had he made one, I thought this could only end up better, but I still feel the need to defend it.Its not on par with Zack Snyder's Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead and 300, I still thought it was a great film. It treats superman as god, and therefore asks the question of 'how would humanity react to god if he came out to us and how would they treat him if he weren't a vengeful god like superman is. Why would they feel the need to treat him right? Unless he was here to protect them from evil'. I loved all the scenes with Kevin Costner, some even left me teary-eyed. I also enjoyed the opening, I thought it looked great in 3D, maybe even better than Avatar.What I didn't like about it was Henry Cavill, his performance was dull and made it harder on the rest of the actors who were all doing as best as they could with the script. I hated the unnecessary scene at IHOP and the way they underused both Laurence Fishburne and Amy Adams.I noticed a couple of problems with the script, like how did Lois Lane go from one place to another during the fight scenes? Its as if writer David S. Goyer forgot he was writing a movie about Superman and not a sequel to his movie 'Jumper'. I liked the flashbacks though, they were kind of cheesy, but they did get me all emotional, specially the scenes with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. Besides all that, the opening was amazing, the effects in it were great, its just the dialogue wasn't as epic as the visuals that kind of got me down.To all the people that hated it, come on, what were you expecting? Its a lot better than Superman Returns, thats for sure. What I find ironic though, is that superheroes, who do good for no self benefit, are being used to make a lot of money. The thing is, where will they go from here? Why is the Justice League necessary? Why can't they just stick to superman like Nolan's batman trilogy did, while making a great amount of money. Why do they feel the need to rush the sequel? They're planning to release it next year, just look what happened to 'Green Lantern', my advice would be to stick to superman only. They've got a good thing going. Why risk ruining it?I'd recommend it to anyone who liked 'Batman Begins', 'Star Wars', 'Avatar', or 'The Avengers'. Its definitely a must watch this year, unlike most movies that have come out, specially other superhero movies.",8,2,6,6 July 2013
American Beauty," Self-Liberating
","'American Beauty' is one of my favorite films, for me watching it feels kind of like a pat in the back, like I've found someone who thinks just like me, one of the best feelings there is next to being distracted.Its the story of Lester Burnham, a man who's going to die a year from when we first meet him. He wants to set himself free from everything that's making him feel depressed while also feeling attracted to his daughter's best friend.It's one of the 'self-liberating' films that came out in 1999, along with 'Fight Club' and Office Space. A sub-genre I think first started with François Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows', a film that isn't afraid to speak to its audience and really touch people. 'American Beauty' is a film that turns to you and asks 'How do you feel?'.Talking about this movie could go on forever, its obvious that movies like 'Lolita' inspired it apart from others I'm not really sure of like 'Kes', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'Blue Velvet', 'Citizen Kane', and 'The Godfather: Part II'.I hate to mention every single technical aspect of a movie in a review, but this film sort of deserves having everyone who worked on it mentioned. The performances in this are all amazing, no character is left underdeveloped and we leave the film thinking that we actually know these characters, something very hard to find in films (e.g. Dazed and Confused).I can find identify myself very much with the characters, specially Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), and even the others I can understand up to some level. Like Lester's wife, a person who's lost herself to materialism while striving for perfection. Or Lester's daughter, someone who feels lonely and ignored by her parents.The simplicity in the cinematography fits the story perfectly, unlike films like 'Magnolia' that give a human story the wrong cinematographic approach and make it feel more like a thriller or comedies like 'The Big Lebowski' that turn away from the comedy and give the film more style over substance. The score and the soundtrack also add a lot to the film, letting us know the state of mind of the characters or enhancing a feeling to the audience.Finally, it's hard not to love the beautiful and poetic script by Alan Ball (my favorite writer after Charlie Kaufman), dealing with themes of death, materialism, and redemption. It's a film that shows the beauty in cinema as an art form, in the way that what the film says couldn't be said as well in any other medium. For example, had it been made as a play, we wouldn't understand the characters as well for the intimacy that cinema gives us would be lost.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked 'The Ice Storm', 'The Virgin Suicides', 'Little Children', 'Lost in America', 'The Kids are All Right', 'Donnie Darko', 'Lost in Translation', Wes Anderson movies, or any film I mentioned before.",10,1,2,13 August 2013
Behind The Candelabra," A fun celebrity story
","'Behind the Candelabra' is a 2013 biographical drama directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Ocean's Eleven).It tells the story of Scott Thorson (Matt Damon), a young man working in a movie, who with the help of a producer gets to know Liberace (Michael Douglas), a famous pianist. Once they find out that they both share the same loneliness the two begin a secret relationship.The movie really exceeded my expectations, it would've been nice to see this in theaters, it might have even been very successful. It was pretty fun for a biographical movie, I was expecting something more serious and dramatic, but instead its an incredibly entertaining movie.About Soderbergh, I have become very interested in his career, I really hope he doesn't retire, he's one of the few directors who approach his work with passion. By the way, how nice of him to wait for Michael Douglas to finish his treatment for throat cancer to begin filming, which regarding his performance, was definitely worth it. Matt Damon is great in it too. They both made the romance believable and they both had their funny moments.I'd recommend it to people who liked 'Goodfellas', 'The Intouchables', 'The Social Network', or 'Monster'.",9,0,2,6 July 2013
The Conjuring," James Wan at his best
","'The Conjuring' is a high class horror film, its hard not to be scared by it, we care for the characters and the story is compelling enough to make you feel interested the whole time.Based on true life events, Ed and Lorraine Warren are paranormal investigators set to help a family terrorized by a demon, said to be one of the most terrifying cases of their lives which they hadn't shared with anyone...until now.First of all, I loved that it takes place in the 70's, I agree completely with director James Wan's point of view that it is almost impossible to make a horror film set in the present. For example, the teenage daughters of the haunted family would be taking pictures of the demons with their iphones and would be posting them on posting them on instagram, basically the demons would turn into the victims and the humans would be the bad guys.The movie isn't perfect though, there are a few plot holes in it, but still it does have some great scares in it that had me jumping out my seat and I liked the way it builds up tension and lets us know the characters before it starts with all the craziness. Not only is the movie set in the 70's, but it also has the feel of a 70's horror film, with slow zooms and filming styles you wouldn't expect from a modern movie. I really believe James Wan has outdone himself with this movie, I'll even go so far to calling it the scariest movie I've seen in my life. Thank you James Wan for this great movie and good luck with Fast & Furious 7.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great horror film, I guess it gives the feeling audiences must have felt when watching 'The Exorcist', 'Don't Look Now', or Poltergeist' for the first time.",9,212,309,6 July 2013
The Wolverine," What could've been a great R-Rated standalone Wolverine feature, turns into just another Marvel episode around the third act.
","What could've been a great R-Rated standalone Wolverine feature, turns into just another Marvel episode around the third act.For the first act it looked pretty good, I was expecting to give it 4/5, I was really interested in the philosophical themes the movie was dealing with, it wasn't just another Wolverine movie, it felt like I was up for a lonely samurai badass Wolverine, similar to 'The Punisher'.Then came the second act, it felt as if Darren Aronofsky had stayed on and directed scenes in it, specially the scenes with a mentally unstable Wolverine and the excessive violence that had me wondering why there were any kids in the theater. Still, it was easy to see that James Mangold was a great replacement, he can handle both action and drama, which was the perfect mix this movie needed.For the second act I was expecting to give it 4.5/5, I felt like I was watching a great superhero film, similar to my experience with 'Watchmen', it seemed perfect right up to there. I kept on admiring the choreography of the fight scenes, something hard to find in modern action movies where all we can see is just CGI robots or aliens. The only action movie to come out this year where I truly admired its action sequences was 'Fast & Furious 6'.Finally came the third act, which felt as if some studio executive came and started messing with the whole story to make it just another Marvel episode, similar to what The Avengers series does. Not only did they do that, but they scrapped so much of the story from the first two acts that everything stopped making sense. *spoiler* I'm talking about the archer who is praying at Yashido's funeral, promising him that he will take care of Mariko, his granddaughter, but then during the third act its revealed that Yashido was alive all along and was the bad guy everyone was working for, including this archer guy I'm talking about who when we first met was praying to a guy he already knew wasn't dead. Can somebody explain how that is supposed to make sense? *spoiler* Alright so by the third act which is when all these dumb plot holes started I was ready to lower my grade, but had I rated the third act apart from the other two I'd probably give it 1.5/5.Could've this been a lot better had Darren Aronofsky directed it? Maybe, maybe not. I don't like the way he handles action (see 'The Fountain') and not only that, he wouldn't had let there be any comic relief which is something 'The Wolverine' typically does (specially in this movie, but in a good way). I would've liked it more than this one, thats for sure, I know he wouldn't have let studio executives control his third act after working on it for such a long time, and I would've loved seeing an R-Rated version of 'The Wolverine', there were so many violent scenes in this were I would've liked seeing the off-screen outcome of the villains that the Wolverine attacks.For recommending this movie, I'm going to have to separate the first two acts from the third. I'd recommend the first two acts to anyone who liked 'Black Swan', 'Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol', 'X-Men: First Class', 'X2: X-Men United', and/or '13 Assassins'. I'd recommend the third act to anyone who liked 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'X-Men: The Last Stand', and/or 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'.",7,1,4,28 July 2013
The Matrix," One of the coolest movies of all time
","One of the coolest movies of all time, 'The Matrix' has everything I could ask for in a movie. It has great action in it and thoughtful subtext that will keep you thinking after the movie ends.The year is 1999... Or is it? It's actually closer to 2199 and humans are being controlled by machines, they have them stuck inside a program that simulates real life called 'The Matrix' while they feed on them for energy. It's up to a group of people fighting the system and a new recruit, Neo (Keanu Reeves), to free the people from enslavement.Director Darren Aronofsky thought that 'The Matrix' redefined Sci-Fi movies, and I agree, what it did has yet to be matched by modern science fiction films that tend to lean towards visuals and give no importance towards action and fight choreography like what we can see here. The use of slow motion is perfect, it's used to highlight the action and give the viewer the feeling that he's right in the middle of it, unlike modern action movies with all the shaky cams.The underlying themes it deals with are what makes it far superior than any other action or science fiction movies and leaves the audience with something to talk about. It deals with some of the same things Stanley Kubrick dealt with in '2001: A Space Odyssey' in the 60's, they're themes that are even more interesting now that we live in a society that depends on technology and for that it's a movie that's way far ahead of its time.I'm not even going to mention the sequels, I see 'The Matrix' as a stand-alone feature so I'm just going to ignore they even exist. As Quentin Tarantino said, the sequels ruined the mythology to it, I couldn't agree more, but I think that when you forget the sequels even happened it's a masterpiece.It's hard to see how Hugo Weaving didn't get more recognition for his performance as Agent Smith, he plays one of the most terrifying villains of all time, his screen presence is always felt and the way he delivers his lines (specially when he says 'Mr. Anderson') is something that would fit perfectly in a horror film.If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it to anyone it to anyone, specially whoever liked 'Wall-E', 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', 'Inception', 'Equilibrium', 'Dark City', 'The Wolverine', 'Twelve Monkeys', 'Minority Report', 'Sin City', and 'Looper'.",10,0,0,15 August 2013
Back to the Future," Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is
","Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, 'Back to the Future' is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it.If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends.By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened.Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz.Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule.To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things.I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart.However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place.Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage?Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy.' ------------------------------------------------------------Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch.I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked 'Star Wars', 'Groundhog Day', 'Looper', 'Wall-e', or 'Jurassic Park'.",10,1,1,15 August 2013
