Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't try to analyze...just enjoy
","I have been very disturbed about some individuals trying to tie religious and racial undertones to this movie.  I was 22 years old in 1977...the first time I saw Star Wars.  Today my 22 year old daughter accompanied me to see this movie.  We both loved it. It was just as exciting today as it was back then.  I was in a galaxy far, far away...kind of fun to get away every once in a while.  I had read some reviews and was afraid I was going to be disappointed... but alas... I was not!!!  The special effects were awesome. Even Jar Jar Binks wasn't as bad as we had heard.  I do recommend you be up on your Star Wars history or it may not make sense.  Everything fits if you know what is going on and who is who..and what role they play in the future. Go see, have fun and don't try to over analyze...and you will love it!",10,0,0,27 May 1999
