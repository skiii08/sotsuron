The Blair Witch Project," Stupid, boring and not frightening at all!
","As I went to see The Blair Witch Project my head was filled with all kinds of crazy ideas on how this film would be... And as I left the cinema my head was filled with voices asking how i could have spent 65 kr (about 9$) on a film which only made gave me motion sickness.. The acting might be pretty good, but hell... If I brought a camera to the forest for a couple of days and filmed 2 of my friends (not to forget add a couple of spooky sound effects) I myself would have created The Blair Witch project. I was bored throughout the film and I wasn't shocked at all.. It was only the very last minutes of the film which was slightly exciting but thats about it!",1,1,3,8 December 1999
