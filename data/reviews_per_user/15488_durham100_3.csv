Black Swan," Just a posh remake of 1995's Showgirls.
","Simply awful. No merit whatsoever. If this wins an Oscar I'll eat my hat and the hats of all those around me at the time. This is one of those films where it is deemed philistine to not like it or is rated highly on a fear or having missed something you should not have missed. Sadly, there is nothing to miss. The tension is terse and kept at the same level from beginning to end and you just don't care about what happens to the characters. Everyone is a stereotype thinly sketched and seen countless times in a myriad of movies. In fact, everything in the film - the story, the characters, the attempt to shock via the sex scenes has been seen before. Don't be fooled, this is not the masterpiece people are saying it is.",1,14,24,27 February 2011
1917," Over hyped and over the top reviews. (no pun intended)
","The first ten minutes or so is fantastic, the one shot thing works and suits that part of the film. But for the rest of the film all it does is get in the way. It prevents you from getting into the film and you can almost see the actors and extras have been waiting for the camera to come to them so they can do their bit. The story is flimsy and empty. Some of the sets, especially the bombed out buildings at night, are so obviously sets this even more takes you out of the film. Aside from the opening, I was aware every minute that I was watching a movie. The acting is fine though under the circumstances, the action sequences are limp and unbelievable as are many of the events that happen along the way - these mostly feel like fillers to pad the film out and many are very heavy handed visual bits that simply do not come off.
It isn't a bad film by any means, but it isnt the masterpiece it is being made out to be and there are many better war films out there that do not sacrifice so much substance for style. Even the music in many places is inappropiate and intrusive. By all means go see it, but remember you don't have to think it is the bees knees just because the critics say it is.",5,15,36,18 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," The first film I have seen this decade...
","This is the first movie I have seen in 2020 and hence this new decade. It is a shame this is the film with that honour because I fear the next ten years of viewing will not match this, such a high bar it has set.
I laughed, I cried and I got angry. This is like a catch-22/Mash type film, just when you've had a big laugh it whips the rug from under your feet with something so sad or ugly - it is perfectly and beautifully done.
The acting is top class, hard to believe the young chap playing Jojo is in his first film so excellent he is.
There are people who say this is tasteless but I am afraid they simply do not get it and/or their grasp of the history of the time is poor and so they do not get the swipes and references.
This movie also looks great both when it is whimsical and also when grim and sober.
I just loved it, I think I will be watching it many times over the coming years.
Well done all involved, it must get at least a nod at an oscar if not win outright.",9,3,6,1 January 2020
