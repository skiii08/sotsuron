","Nah, it's not as good as we remember. Nostalgia is a bad judge.",6,0,1,11 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The usual Disney standard
","This website has become too popular, therefore quality is decreasing. If you like cinema and you've seen lots of movies in your life, you can't possibly give a 10 out of 10 to this. That's why quality is decreasing, everybody wants to give an opinion, even people who can't tell the difference between Shrek and the elephant man. Something has give you an emotion, therefore is a masterpiece? But the depth in that emotion is irrelevant if even a rock thrown in a lake makes you laugh. What's the point in having a scale from 1 to 10 if you just give 10 if good and 1 if bad? Binary machines, that's what you are, really. For me, 6 because Dosney has all the talent and money of the world and tries to make money with it. As simple as that. They don't want to hear about great movies 'cause wouldn't satisfy a larger range of people and less people means less profit. We know that. And it's nauseous. But why blame actors? They are professional. Why can't we enjoy cgi? They have the best artists. This movie wasn't going to satisfy fans (how can you call them toxic if they're the only reason why the saga is so successful??) but at least the corporation who owns the rights was gonna provide us the usual semi-satisfy product made with usual ripetitive 'success' formula that made it so famous. Everything else which can be said is irrelevant, if you keep mentioning how things could be different. Not gonna happen. 6 is the standard rating for Disney: mediocrity at it's finest level.",6,4,13,19 December 2019
