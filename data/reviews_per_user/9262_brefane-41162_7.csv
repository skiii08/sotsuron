Spartacus," Kubrick at his most commercial.
","Not half as good as Kubrick's Paths of Glory, but at 3hrs and 17mins it's twice as long. Kirk Douglas, superb in Paths of Glory, is not always effective or varied enough here and the film's wayward focus makes for a wearying and sometimes tedious 3 hours. The interior set design is unpersuasive as well as uninteresting. The varied cast includes Olivier and Laughton who seem at home in their roles as well as Woody Strode who cuts a striking figure, a rather embarrassing Tony Curtis, handsome John Gavin and beautiful Jean Simmons who is moving particularly in the film's satisfying last scene. I much prefer Kubrick's next feature the outrageously funny Lolita (1962) as well as the superb 88min Paths of Glory (1958).",5,2,7,5 January 2019
Hereditary," Excrutiatingly slow Grief Porn
","One of those films where you not only lament the money spent, but the time wasted as well. Toni Collette cries, screams and implodes without variation in relentless close up for 2 hours while Alex Wolff as her son always looks bewitched, bothered and bewildered and Gabriel Byrne as her clueless husband is always in the dark in every sense of the word. Hereditary is numbing: it's the Manchester by the Sea of supernatural horror; it feels endless, and when it does end you experience relief. There's no atmosphere, character interaction, supporting characters or anyone to care about. The silly last scene explains little, and 1967s Eye of the Devil had the same basic revelation. Everything about Hereditary feels borrowed. A dreary 2 hours and 7 minutes; the grief you feel has nothing to do with the characters on screen!",1,4,9,2 July 2018
As Good as It Gets," Not as good as it got
","Considering the awards and praise this popular comedy received, the result is a drawn out and mediocre affair with too many characters that serve little purpose where a shorter, more focused script would have alleviated the the tediun and seeming endlessness of this movie that feels like a pilot for a TV series.. The script is awkward and contrived with the lead characters not seemingly meant for one another; the ending was not a happy one for me. Nicholson lacks charm where say Kevin Kline might have made it work, Hunt periodically turns on the waterworks and Kinnear is a bland stereotype. The film is occasionally maudlin with Shirley Knight and the dog giving the best performances.",4,0,4,8 June 2019
Us," LudicrUS!
","Like Jordan Peele's first film, Get Out, his sophomoric second feature, Us, demonstrates that his directorial talent outweigh his ability as a scenarist. Despite good, if borrowed premises, both films become problematic in the final third where the elements don't come to a meaningful or satisfactory conclusion. Us, more ambitious and large scale than Get Out, is less enjoyable. It's both overlong and tiresome. How many times can I watch Lupita Nyong'o swing a golf club at a doppelganger? Unfortunately, the film gives one plenty of time to ponder the absurdities, inconsistencies and clichés. Why do the Wilsons' doppelgangers allow them so much time and opportunity to escape and ultimately survive while everyone else is killed immediately without warning. The tethered apparently destroyed all of Santa Cruz with no policeman firing a gun or anyone else offering resistance unlike the Wilsons whose son destroys his doppelganger by having it mimic his actions. And why does his mother waste time listening to her doppelganger spout (expository) gibberish instead of continuing to search for him in the underground. The underground is a mall with seating, numerous rabbits, classrooms, an escalator and perhaps a sweatshop that produces form-fitting red jumpsuits, leather gloves and shears! Get Out had some sharp humor; here the humor is ill-placed and uncertain. Despite the reviews that say it needs to been seen twice to be understood, once was more than enough for me. Like some other recent films: A Quiet Place, Velvet Buzzsaw and Bird Box, the antagonists/creatures need better definition, consistency, some sense of purpose and a screenplay that doesn't require the audience to fill in the gaping holes in logic and reason. An unsatisfactory film during which I was aware of the audience becoming fidgety.",4,3,4,8 April 2019
Get Out," Don't watch 'IT', watch 'OUT'!
","Get Out may not be everything the media may lead you to believe, but compared to other recent horror films like the atrocious and tedious IT, it's a masterpiece. Skip IT, and go with Get Out. Anyone familiar with The Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Stepford Wives will find Get Out a new and effective variation on an old theme that disappointingly looses steam as it goes along, and runs afoul of clichés with no real payoff or satisfying resolution, and the last minute rescue is hokey as is an awkward attempt at exposition via television. The acting and directing go a long way in making Get Out compelling and enjoyable and a level of social critique in the script makes Get Out a welcome relief from the usual horrors.",6,5,9,6 December 2017
Ray," Strictly by the numbers
","An uninspired, standard biopic that follows a familiar arc featuring poverty, fame and drug addiction, Ray tells us less about the man, and more about Hollywood formulas applied to music legends. Jamie Fox's Oscar winning impersonation of Ray Charles is excellent, but the character is one-dimensional and Fox's performance is all surface. The film features so many of Ray's songs that it feels like a jukebox musical. The film itself is undistinguished and overlong with a secondhand feel thanks to Taylor Hackford's strictly by the numbers direction and a screenplay that refuses to part with a single cliché. An A&E Biography would have been better and more authentic.",2,4,7,8 May 2016
The Godfather," An Offer I Can Refuse
","I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichÃ©s. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them.",7,2,5,25 January 2016
