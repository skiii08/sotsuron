Sucker Punch," a very enjoyable movie
","I really thought this movie was awesome. I went in thinking that it was going to suck(thanks to all the critics) and I was blown away by the epicness. The critics said it had no story. I think the story is really good. They need to escape and use their imagination to help and guide them. The fight scenes are the best that snyder has done, well at least to me. The movie is full of epic nerdy scenes that will make any young guy that plays video games very happy. I like the way they present the Asylum as a sort of whore house/dance house and the story goes from there. It's very stylish, very epic and pleases you when you see the credits roll. And the quote from the movie and trailer is awesome,'If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything'.",9,5,12,30 March 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie of all time
","This is one phenomenal movie. This movie is Christopher Nolan and Hollywood at their best. Bane is an incredible villain for his sheer power and unrelenting will. He stops at nothing to cause Gotham destruction and chaos. The stakes are the highest out of all the movies and the scope is HUGE. I'm not going to say much, but Bane and company know how to take control of a city. The action set pieces are just amazing because of their realism. The scope, the action and the gear the characters have are all just amazing, but that's not what makes this movie one of the best of all time. It's what's at stake. It's Batman and Bruce Wayne and Blake and Gordan and others. They all go through so much and you see their terror, their despair and their success. It's just the deepest, most engaging hero movie of all time. Whoever enjoyed the first two, I promise you, you will enjoy the hell out of this one.",10,2,7,21 July 2012
Cloud Atlas," Some people may not like or get it, but it's a goddamn master piece
","This movie is nearly flawless. The acting, the cinematography, the settings and the plot are just mind blowing. I had no idea how amazed and touched I would be by seeing this movie. The plot is six very loosely connected stories throughout human history; some in the past, one in the present and some in the future. Each story is completely different from the others in theme, feel and and even genre. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and cringe as it takes you on an exploration through the decisions people make and how those decisions make ripples throughout space and time. This is like no movie you've ever seen before. Most characters, or 'souls', never change throughout the story, but there's one who transforms from a murderous thief into a civilization-saving hero. It's so beautiful to see this transformation and it really effected me. I pulled many things from this movie and found there to be some really deep, meaningful statements about humans, our history and where we might be headed. History repeats itself. There will always be evil men and the death of innocence, but through all this horror and oppression, it is possible to change and understand. This movie was a flawlessly directed masterpiece. Just watch it.",10,52,96,7 November 2012
John Wick: Chapter 2," One of the best sequels and most action packed movies I've ever seen
","The first John Wick film was a great surprise. The story was simple and pure, the action and choreography were top notch and the hint at world building was very intriguing. When I heard that a second movie was in the works, I was worried that it would fail to live up to the original (as most movie lovers are). All I can say is that John Wick Chapter 2 is sensational. I watched the first film 3 days before watching the second, and my god was the action in Chapter 2 better than the first. Seeing the actual actor do most of these scenes really makes you believe that this character is real and that he's a force to be reckoned with. I loved the shootout scenes but my favorite are the hand to hand combat he does with higher level assassins like himself. The story isn't as simple as the first, but it really fleshes out the underground world of assassins in this universe. It introduces us to new characters, places and systems to really give us the sense that these are things that go on in secret all over the world. I like to give movies ratings based off what they're trying to achieve. This is an action movie, and as action movies go, John Wick Chapter 2 is one of the best action movies I've ever experienced and a truly worthy sequel to the first.",10,19,41,11 February 2017
