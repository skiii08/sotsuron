Howl's Moving Castle," Surprisingly Enjoyable
","I am typically not a fan of most films animated in this fashion. Strangely I felt compelled to watch it and completely captivated. It had a very unique and wholly childish view of wars as novel games with no purpose. Interestingly enough it doesn't have any problems with violence so long as it is in rebellion of the establishment. The love story is sadly too faint, yet the fanciful imagery and delightful characters make this move entirely entertaining to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.I think fewer words are better, IMDb thinks otherwise. So I am forced to add more.If you stay focused on the movie you will easily understand it and it will be pleasantly predictable. If how ever if you want you want to be surprised or want to tax your mind, walk away from the movie skip 20 or so minutes. I don't believe this movie to be too childish but a child would enjoy it equally. No obscenity and fairly tame with no death graphic injuries. I believe shallow people will not get into this movie completely, but they should watch it the same. It would be unhealthy and truly depressing to eat the same super every night, even if it is our favorite meal.",9,1,2,19 November 2007
