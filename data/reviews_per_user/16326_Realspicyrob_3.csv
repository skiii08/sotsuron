E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good but needs more science
","E.T The Extra Terrestrial is a film that, by most accounts, is a very entertaining piece of childhood nostalgia. However, it's so unrealistic and for that reason I can only say it's simply entertaining. I mean me and my cousin DIno were watching it at the Sam's Club TV section and we just were not buying it. Sure the alien had personality and looked neat, but I want MORE. Especially out of Drew Barry Moore, who really didn't give all that good a performance. I found her character to be juvenile and immature and she totally weighed down a perfectly solid flick from acclaimed director Steven Stealberg. Overall I'd say give it another watch but if you're anything like me and DIno, you're gonna be totally disappointed by the lack of science and realism in this piece of cinema.",7,3,6,21 March 2017
Dunkirk," Cinematic Masterpiece Lacks Words, Heart
","Look I'm as big a Chris Christy-Nolan fan as the next guy, but oh jeez was this major motion picture odd. Harry Stiles had like TWO lines in the whole film. Like, me and Cousin Dino were like 'Surely that can't be it.' Oh but it was, Dino, it certainly was. Also, why not just call them Nazis? Don't beat around the bush, Christy-Nolan, we KNOW the spoiler at the end that they were Nazis all along. Irregardless, Hoyt Van Hoytema's imagery was awe-inspiring to the say the least, and Hans Zimmer's score was one of his best. All in all, despite its obvious flaws, Christy-Nolan made a beautiful war film.",8,0,6,9 November 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," More like Murder on the BORING Express heh heh
","Me and Dino watched this on a park bench next to a guy from Carson City with an IPad he claimed he won 'in a church raffle' and I have to say that this piece of mediocrity was far from an enjoyable whodunnit. The plotting was so tame and uninteresting that it makes me wonder how this movie could even be written. Johnny Depp basically plays himself and Kenneth Branagh was my least favorite Poirot of all time (More like POOR-OH heh). The saving grac you ask? Nari Blair-Mangat, who played the role of 'Waiter' to a tee. Five stars.",5,1,3,16 October 2018
