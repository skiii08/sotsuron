National Treasure: Book of Secrets," unbelievably great!
","this shouldn't have spoilers...or it doesn't from my perspective! :) I have been waiting for this movie for almost a year...since i went to DC with my 8th grade class...and we were standing across the street watching Nick Cage and Justin Bartha running lines...it was one of the single most amazing movies of the year! i thought it was absolutely fantastic! it has an incredible story that fits with the old one. And one thing that i thought was fun, was that it gave Riley more of a story this time. He was a bigger part of this movie, than he was the last one. The ending really surprised me, and the relationship between Helen Miran and Jon Voight is hilarious! This one 9more so than the other) has a very Indiana Jones feel about it. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie, and am already planning on going to see it again! I cant wait till it comes out on DVD and i want to see all the bonus features and deleted scenes! SideNote: look for the part in front of the yellow church...thats where we saw them filming! and when they r on the stairs in front of the capital...we were there getting our picture taken only a day or so earlier!",10,0,5,23 December 2007
