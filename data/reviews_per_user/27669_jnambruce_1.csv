3:10 to Yuma," Osacars all around for 3:10 to Yuma
","This was absolutely the best movie I have seen since Gladiator. Russel Crowe deserves an Oscar for his performance. All of the lead characters gave outstanding performances. The set designs and costumes were right on target for the period. If you like westerns you will love this one. I believe it is one of the best Westrn movies ever made. Not since John Wayne has there been a cowboy as rough and tough as Crowe. The ending will have you cheering for the villain, and crying for the hero- but in a good way. Not only will you enjoy this movie, but, you will walk away having learned some valuable life lessons. I highly recommend this movie- you will not be disappointed. I guarantee you will want to add 3:10 to Yuma to your DVD collection.",10,3,8,8 September 2007
