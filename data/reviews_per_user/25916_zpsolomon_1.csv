The Blair Witch Project," Don't watch this horrible film!!!!
","This film is just mindless blabbering an arguments about how they are going to die until the last two minutes of the movie leaves you on a cliff hanger which leads the shitty sequel. If you want to waste your life on pointless junk, this is the movie for you!! If you actually like horror films and care about your life, I do not recommend this movie.",Null,1,3,18 December 2017
