The Ring," Possibly one of the scariet movies ever made!
","Wow. It's been more than a year since I saw 'The Ring,' and yet it still sticks in my mind as the scariest movie that has ever been created. The musical score is not only intense and horrifying, but the sequence of images that are flashed at you seriously freak you out. I watched this at a sleepover with three other guys (in the pitch black) and we couldn't sleep all night.There were two scenes in particular that stood (and still stand) out in my mind:1) When Noah is in that workshop place and his 7 days are up, that has got to be the scariest sequence in the whole movie. What happens:first, Noah is reading a newspaper and puts his cup of coffee down on the paper. When he picks it up again, a 'ring' of coffee has leaked through and forms a ring on his newspaper. A sign of things to come.next, the TV in the workshop flickers on to complete static. noah pales and stands up, staring at the TV. he's the only one in the workshop. he walks over to the remote which is sitting on a table, and flicks the TV off.third, the TV turns back on. Noah seriously freaks now and pulls the plug from the TV. he's satisfied that everything'll be OK, but the TV goes back on (to a screen of static, of course)next, the static goes away and is replaced by the infamous well, bathed in gray-blue. and who should climb out of the well but...samara. noah watches in horror as she crawls out of the well and towards the TV screen.eventually, she reaches the TV screen and crawls out...with her gory skin and tattered clothes and black hair, samara is the devil. literally. then she goes for noah.noah tries to get away, but of course, you cannot get away from samara. he runs, but samara employs her 'evil ghost child' powers and teleports to right in front of noah. noah keeps running, samara keeps teleporting. there's one shot where she's right up near the camera and you can literally HEAR her.then, samara is standing over noah (he's tripped over something and can't get away) ... and the screen goes blank.cut to rachel, who is running up the stairs to the workshop place, runs in, and you get a flash of noah's totally ripped up face. very scary.2) when rachel is on the island at night, she breaks into samara's dad's house (remember, samara's dad is a horse-obsessed psycho) and rachel is searching for clues in the guy's house at night. Of course, he hears her - and jumps out from behind with a hook. EXTREMELY freaky, because this is day 6 and rachel isn't supposed to die because of some crazy other guy, she's supposed to be murdered by samara. Anyway. the guy, who is obviously having some sort of mental malfunction, goes for rachel with the hook. rachel starts yelling at him and screaming - then something in his brain clicks. his mind basically stops working, and ...he jumps into the bathtub and electrocutes himself with a really weird contraption. scary sequence with freaky shots and intense music. NEVER watch this movie in the dark alone!!",9,0,1,10 June 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Exactly what I wanted to see
","Being realistic isn't one of the 'Pirates' franchise's strong points, so going into this movie, I wasn't expecting a cohesive storyline, and I totally enjoyed the movie. Everything about it was enjoyable, from the music to the settings to the dialogue to the action scenes. I loved it.The first time I saw it, there were times when I thought, 'This is too ludicrous. This is getting stupid,' (I don't need to actually cite the situations, they'll be pretty clear when you see the movie) but at the end of the movie, I looked back and thought, Wow, that was an awesome movie. And the ending? Bizarre, but it perfectly sets up the third movie. (Oh, and stick around after the credits, too. There's an amusing little cutscene after they've all run. Not too many people know about it.)I was really surprised and pleased at the return of Governor Swann, Norrington and Gibbs, and at the relative largeness of their roles. I had thought that these smaller characters from the first movie would be phased out to make more room for Jack, Will and Elizabeth, but they actually contributed to the story and were welcome returners. (I was also really glad that Ragetti and Pintel returned) In all, the movie had amusing and amazing action scenes, romance, great music, great returning and new characters, an actual story, and even a little character development. What more could you want?",8,0,1,13 July 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," i'll see it again (voluntarily)
","I saw 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' a few weeks after it came out...today, as a matter of fact. The trailers weren't exactly what would have convinced me to see this movie, instead my friends did. Well, I went, and I'm glad I did, because it's one of the must-see movies of the summer.Since you'll read tens of thousands of plot reviews from other comments and fandango and so forth, let's skip that crap and get to the good stuff.I thought that the only movie I've ever seen that was funnier than this was 'Scary Movie 3'. My personal favorite was the scene when both the Smiths have discovered that their spouse is a secret agent/spy working for a rival agency. They start shooting at each other, but Mrs. Smith (Angelina Jolie) has a bigger gun (it looks almost like a rocket launcher...) so Mr. Smith (Brad Pitt) runs into the kitchen. When she starts firing at him, he throws the refrigerator door open behind him and she launches a few rounds into the inside of the refrigerator, exploding cans of soda, cartons of milk, etc, etc, and they show it in slowmo...lol...my friends and i were practically in the aisles...Overall, I thought that the stellar performance in 'Smith' didn't come from Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie...instead, I think that Adam Brody stole the show. Yes, he only had a supporting role, but his great performance boosted my rating of 'Smith' by a few stars. What was best about his performance was a subtle, deeper kind of thing -- his character, 'The Tank,' actually acts like Brody's other well-known role, Seth in 'The O.C.'. He had a few of those 'Seth'-y sarcastic moments, i.e. The Weather Channel sequence, 'More desert,' etc. Another great/hilarious fight scene comes at the end...when that one guard/agent has a rocket launcher and he keeps trying to shoot the Smiths with it. A few of the best scenes (you'll only get these if you've seen the movie, they're not spoilers): the 'accidental stabbing' part, the highway scene, and the neighbors...'I like the carpeting' lol!I think the worst part of this whole movie was the music. Some music choices in certain points, I think, were questionable...ah well, it was still a great movie and i'll definitely see it again.",8,1,4,15 June 2005
Fantastic Four," Disappointing
","What a sad, sad waste of a fairly talented cast this is. I walked into the movie theater, expecting to see a movie with great special effects, a strong storyline and some interesting characters. Instead, I got slammed with 2 hours of jumbled nonsense. 'Fantastic Four' is not 'fantastic' as all the ad campaigns and media hype have made it seem. You may be wondering: what made this movie so disappointing? A number of things, really. I wasn't thrilled at all when I heard that director Tim Story (Taxi, Barbershop) would be handling this project. I could pretty much tell by then: this movie is a flop. Story brings nothing interesting or valuable to the table as a director, in fact, many of his projects have come out with the flat, hollow tone of this one.The story is as follows: a formerly wealthy scientist, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his business partner/bodyguard Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) approach ultra-rich old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) about funding a project in space that would examine human DNA and possibly reveal the secrets of ending many diseases. (Reed's logic to this project is just as confusing as the rest of the film.) Von Doom agrees, and he, Richards and Grimm go up into space along with Von Doom's coworker/Richards' ex-girlfriend, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and Sue's hotheaded NASA-dropout brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans). The scientists are up in space when they are hit by an enormous space storm and are exposed to copious amounts of radiation. When they get back on Earth, after recovering from their injuries, they slowly realize that their DNA has been altered, giving them superpowers. Richards' limbs have become elastic/stretchy. Sue can turn invisible and fire force fields. Johnny has become a 'human torch' who can light fire to himself and fly. And Ben, who was exposed to the most radiation, becomes 'The Thing', a solid rocklike creature who was superstrength. They must use their powers to go up against Victor, who has turned into Dr. Doom, with steel skin and lightning coming out of his fingers and randomly kills people.Major Problem 1: continuity issues. After the five scientists are hit by radiation, the ship blows up. How the heck do they get back down to Earth? You basically get a cut from them flying through the air to them down in Victor's medical center, and they're all fine. You can't exactly breath air in space, and even if you could, the fall down to earth would kill you, or you would float around in space forever. It just doesn't make sense. Also, why is Victor so intent on killing the Fantastic Four? Obviously, the failed mission is one of the reasons why his business plummeted, but it wasn't the Fantastic Four's fault. It was a freak of nature: the storm arrived 9 hours early. Major Problem 2: social issues. This is a comic book movie. We want to see action. 90% of the movie was the 'Fantastic' Four getting their social problems sorted out. Examples: the scene with Ben and his wife after Ben has become The Thing. At best, it's laughable. Director Tim obviously included this scene to add emotional depth to the movie, but all this scene does is give us another reason to knock another star off this movie's rating. The exchanges between Johnny and Sue about Johnny's behavior are poorly scripted and, frankly, are time wasters. Reed is trying to sort out his feelings for Sue, who never exactly 'broke up' with Victor, and a lot of their scenes are awkward and unnecessary, too. The only slightly funny and interesting arguments in this movie are the exchanges between Ben and Johnny - they act like a pair of five-year-olds, bringing some laughs. At several points, I thought, 'Yes, finally the action begins,' but it never happened until the end. And even the end action scene wasn't all that long or impressive. What the director, script writers and editors didn't get was: we don't care about the Fantastic Four's social problems. This is a comic book movie, for crying out loud, and we want to see action...so give us action! In the movie business, the whole idea is 'give people what they want.' The trailers included basically all the action that you're going to see in the movie, so don't prepare yourself for a 'Spiderman'-esque show.Rating: ***** out of 10.",5,2,4,10 July 2005
