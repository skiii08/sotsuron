Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is good dirty fun
","Obviously, this movie is polarizing to say the least. Most reviews here are either 1/2 or 9/10.....So, the question is, what are the expectations of those giving this film such a low rating? I can understand going to see a film that you know nothing about and hating it, but I have a feeling that the awful reviews are coming from those who knew what to expect, and just wanted to affirm their pre-conceived notion of the film. So, the joke's on you 1 and 2 star reviewers (you went to see Borat! hahahaha). This film is a landmark demonstration of the ignorance found throughout our country (but, this movie could have been made anywhere so this is not a knock on the US). And yes, some of it is staged and cut in ways to drive the point home. But, if you can't chuckle at the absurdity of Cohen's character, then you my friend, have no sense of humor and should stick to Knock Knock jokes and reruns of Everybody Loves Raymond. Borat is the year's best comedy hands down. If you don't take yourself too seriously, and understand that comedy is not always pretty, then Borat is for you...It's very nice! Put on your thick skin and go to the theatres and just enjoy it. Cohen's only agenda is to make people laugh, and he succeeded big time. High five!",9,3,10,12 November 2006
