Skyfall," A very good Bond film. Yes we can forget about Quantum of Solace.
","If you have been hearing the words Bond is back. My it not over hype this latest 007 flick. The last one was a let down. But not this one. A very good Bond film. Yes we can forget about Quantum of Solace.Like Casino Royal it stands on its own, but works as a great sequel. And yes Bond is back! I'm not going to spoil anything in this review. All I will say is finally we have an entertaining bad guy along with a strong plot as far as Bond films go. Is it the best bond film ever? Well that's an impossible conclusion to come to as far as I'm concerned. Its certainly one of the best.My rating: (Four stars ****) (10/10)",10,5,15,24 November 2012
John Wick," This is an action movie! Yes a very violent one and done well.
","No major spoilers. If you like the action genre done well. Watch John Wick. Vehicles flying around at high speeds, great gun play and kungfoo stuff. This is an action movie! Yes a very violent one and done well.Its been a few years since we have had a well made action movie for a mature audience that could warrant being a new trilogy. Unlike The Expendables. This one is it. But if it dose not happen. Its sure to be a singular cult classic. Especially with its refusal to be a shoot em up style of show, but a shoot em in the face style of show. As well that one of the main plot features, put simply, is that Wick is seeking out vengeance because of the murder of his puppy. Any way no more info. Watch and enjoy.",10,46,88,11 November 2014
The Prestige," A first rate movie! The Prestige is a timeless treasure! Will be enjoyed forever!
","Just in case the reader of this review has not watched this movie somehow. I've included no spoilers. I just watched The Prestige again now some 8 years later after its original release with some friends. Even though I still remembered a bit of what to expect in this twisting, turning show. Was still blown away by this first rate movie! My friends who were privileged in it being there first viewing. Had an even more high tend experience as the credits rolled. Yet because its such a well done show. In its direction of story, screen play, and acting. It all comes together to make a timeless treasure! A movie your going to enjoy again and again. Its movie magic and will entertain people forever! Don't miss out on this movie. This is why movies are made.",10,3,6,24 November 2014
Interstellar," Truly a must see. Not just once but at least twice. Strong recommendation.
","This is most likely the movie of the year. Just as with The Prestige and Inception this film is truly a must see. Not just once but at least twice.The question is really, what dose Interstellar as film do wrong. In my opinion. It dose nothing wrong. Good balance of real science with science fiction and drama with action. The movies musical score works wonderful and the acting is all top notch. Yet, some are going to find this movie a little too heavy and too long. Thats OK though. If you didn't really enjoy past Nolan movies or 3hr epics. Don't see this movie. Then no needless fault finding will happen and everyone's happy.With that a side. No spoilers I just Recommend Interstellar strongly.",10,2,8,11 November 2014
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A good time, this film is smart, funny and very enjoyable to watch.
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a very fun film. From the very start to end the show is entertaining and holds to own. Yes theirs a bit of originality here. Turning in to our next decade it was looking bad for originality, but with the release of this film and of course Inception its looking good for 2010 so far.A good time, this film is smart, funny and very enjoyable to watch. Sort of a comic book, action musical and romance flick. Very cool and for all sorts. Not a perfect picture but still it holds up like I said. Who knows, maybe you the reader will like it more or just the same? My over all score 7.5/10 or *** out **** stars. Go see it and enjoy.",7,9,26,14 August 2010
Django Unchained," A MASTERPIECE ! And one of the best movies this decade.
","Spaghetti western greatness is back on the screen thanks to Director Quentin Tarantino. Its not only just an over the top violent, wickedly fun, course language filled and very long film. The staples of any good spaghetti western. Its much more. A MASTERPIECE ! And one of the best movies this decade.As a Tarantino film it stands with the rest of them. The screenplay is outstanding. The acting is grand. The actors chosen are perfect. Again lots are offended by this movie of his as well.Many as with my self, will be offended with a few scenes in this movie. I'm not talking about the over the top gory violence involving the massive gun shot outs. I'm talking about the realistic brutal violence done to the slaves. Also the spectacular portrayal of Quentin's character Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio should offend. Really if your not offended then there's a problem. The films offencive nature is relay what makes this movie stand alone in its genre. It exerts a powerful grasp with the mix of dark comedy woven in its themes of racism, slavery and brutality. If your not offended a bit at times, that dose not only state a personal problem of humanity in your hart, but you will also not be able to get the most out of this experience.Four Stars **** 10/10 (PURE ENTERTAINMENT!)",10,4,13,5 January 2013
Lincoln," A wonderful film. See it.
","Historic figure films have always been a catch to me. Many have been good too. We have had films such as Gandhi. Touching and stuck close to historic facts surrounding him. Also we my think of Bravehart. Stretched the historic facts about William Wallace but captured the emotion. Both are wonderful films. Now here is a Steven Spielberg directed film about the final days of President Lincoln, with Daniel Day Lewis, as Lincoln. What can I say they have accomplished here.No spoilers, I will just say in short. A wonderful Film. See it. My Review: (Four Stars ****) (10/10)",10,3,13,24 November 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Hulk Smashing!, Hulk Busting!, Robot Blasting!, Robot Thrashing!, Good Time!!!
","I'd say if enjoyed the last Avengers? And really who didn't? This lives up to the last in every aspect. This one has Iron Man,The Hulk and has more robots. Even an ultra evil one with a good bit of humour. And when has evil robots ever been been a bad add in, for a comic or science fiction show? This all makes for A Hulk Smashing!, Hulk Busting!, Robot Blasting!, Robot Thrashing!, Good Time!!!Actually the whole gang is back. And again in whole, the group is balanced off well in this comic epic. Was just stating at the start what really makes the show. Hulk and Iron Man. Iron Man in that Hulk buster battling Hulk was the shows stealer moment. Coming in next would be Ultron, an evil AI bent on destroying humanity and still managing to be an enduringly fun and funny memorable character. But he is not the only one who has added some more action and fun drama to this second instalment. Nope there are some new interesting characters introduced. This is what makes Age of Ultron to myself even better then the last. Not going to spoil anything. This one did have more to offer. Still not perfect. But it's hard to be critical on a movie this mammoth.",8,0,3,21 May 2015
A Clockwork Orange," Artistically the greatest movie ever, yet one of the worst ever to.
","A dark comedy about a young man who rapes thieves and brutalizes for kicks. At the same time musically up lifting and teaches us something about our own morality. This movies funny, violent, disturbing, disgusting, challenging and mesmerizing. This movie also should of never been made.Kubrick is a true genus and this work stands alone as his best in one way. Artistically the greatest movie ever, yet one of the worst ever to. When I was finished washing A Clockwork Orange I felt upset. At the same time though I was thrilled because the man who is a rapist and thug was cured back to the way he was, a rapist and thug. Now how dose that work? Well when I was 19 and a bit naive. I was just focusing on artistic achievement of what I was just put through. Hay, it was entertaining. I could not put this film to criticism either because, I felt it was not real any way. So why hold any moral judgement against the film.That is it though. The artistic achievement is what is wrong. And the fact that this story of fiction is used, to work your hart over on the victims point of view and then, that of the heartless offender's. Bad things happen to nice people then to the bad guy, because he can't do bad things. He beats one man and then rapes his wife while the man is forced to watch. Then later we watch this criminal get beaten and tortured, and yes you feel sorry for him. The movie dose feel like clockwork. So much can be said about this movie and even now when you read this review, much arguing about A Clockwork Orange will still be happening around the critic globe.As for me, my final review is in and no I'm not in for a an other look. Final overall score 1/10.",1,14,34,15 August 2010
Inception," What makes Inception a masterpiece? Flawless Entertainment.
","Sometimes it seems the Movie Critics as a group can be off. This is clear when you take a look at the generally favourable overall review Inception received from meta critic. True not a bad rating for a movie. A masterpiece though? Shaw Shank Redemption, The Matrix, Dances with Wolves and 2001 a Space Odessy, to name some other professional critic messed up overall reviews when released in theatres.But enough of that. What makes Inception a masterpiece? Flawless Entertainment. Before seeing the movie, I read some reviews about this movie being flawed. Along with the hype and average good reviews from professional movie critics. I did not expect much. Once the show ended though I could not see what they were talking about. It was just to much for most of them. This dose not make a film flawed.If you are able to focus in on a movie, you will enjoy this film. Its a thinker. When you think just how complicated the scenes and story direction just flows through and through till the end, but at the same time still simple to understand and action packed through and through. Well.... Flawless is the only words to describe this movie.This is one of the best films ever created. 10/10 For me. Watch it!",10,3,8,10 August 2010
Prometheus," Prometheus is even good enough to warrant a reboot.
","Ridley Scott has made an other since fiction master peace. This prequel of his classic film Alien my not be as original in monster horror, and that could never be expected. Alien set a classic standard for this genre. There is also a few other similarity's of great since fiction films that you might notice when watching. That is what makes the style of this one original. The movie dose not simply just stick to the roots of the two prier classics, Alien or Aliens. With this stated if your a true fan of the classic first two as I am, no worries. I'm not going to spoil the movie experience for you. So I can only say that all the gore, horror, action, thrills and geeky cool android drama is top notch. The pain of watching Alien 3, Alien Resurrection and the Alien vs Predator series that tried to destroy the trilogy. Is finally over hopefully. Prometheus is even good enough to warrant a reboot. Yes a new Alien trilogy. 10/10 Rating for me. One the best films of the year and this decade so far.",10,3,18,26 June 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," Beautiful Madness! A rush from start to finish. See this marvel on the big screen...
","I'm a mad max fan. Stating that first right now so its out of the way. Yet I must stress that even if you have not seen any of the previous movies, this stands on its own and actually surpasses the originals. So enjoy new comers. Yet if you crave more please give Mad Max 2 Road Warrior a viewing.At its heart mad max movies are action, survivor, chase films. With the science fiction premise filling up the setting. Nothing new in a way. The second instalment was all of this though, and at very high production and filmed with grand skill, and is thus considered to be one the finest action films ever made, also has what's considered to be the greatest chase scene ever filmed. As for Fury Road. Well.... No spoilers. Everything can be put into one sentence. Its all what Mad Max 2 is and much, much more!This should be hands down a best picture contender. Beautiful Madness! A rush from start to finish. See this marvel on the big screen before it's to late.",10,18,35,16 May 2015
