Blade Runner 2049," Even a replicant watching this would admit it.
","Great movie. Nice CGI. Excellent plot and it is original. Only problem, it was too long. But still, great movie!",8,2,12,19 February 2018
It," Ok
","Better than the miniseries and the book, but gets boring when you watch it a million times. Here are the errors with the movie.1.It is scary, but he looks too much like a monster. It is obvious from the start. I think they are overusing CGI on him.2.Change of plot and many scenes omitted from the book.3.Henry Bowers is killed off early.4.Too many jump scares.So, close, but no cigar.",6,0,1,20 February 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Thor Film Ever
","The first Thor sucked a**. The Dark World was OK. This one. Hah. This was the best Thor film in centuries. Even though The Last Jedi was good, this film was 2 stars better.Watiti should direct Thor 4. He does the best job as Thor director.",9,1,5,2 February 2018

Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad
","It was a good movie, but not that much great action. The fighting scenes were awesome and the villains are portrayed well, but not that much interesting.So 7.5/10",7,0,0,21 February 2018
Life of Pi," Without Richard Parker, this movie would have died by now...
",Lit man!! Nice job with all the actors. This movie really demonstrates itself as a survival guide. The book was great too and the movie meets its expectations.,9,0,1,25 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better than expected. Worse than ideal.
","The Rise Of Skywalker is the finale to the long known franchise of Star Wars. However, while it was a satisfying ending, there were some plot mishaps.1. Palpatine's return is very rushed. It's as if 'Ok let's just bring him back for more views and boost up the ratings.' There's no mention as to how he survived(but it is realistic to have him appear with life support) aside from 'unnatural Force abilities.' What if every Sith did the same? His final form was cool, but debate is over whether it should have been there. The opening crawl 'The Dead Speak' basically spoils it that Palpatine is alive. It should have been revealed that he survived at the end of The Last Jedi or he should have been a vision.2. There are many gaps in the storyline. Leia and the Resistance don't seem bothered that Palpatine is back. Vader's sacrifice basically means nothing now. The whole movie acts as if the previous films don't exist.3. The characters are also mishandled. Kylo Ren's 'redemption' was sort of underdeveloped. But, Ford's cameo was AMAZING. Seeing what he did in the previous movies gave everybody no hope that he would redeem. Also, Rey being revealed as Palpatine's granddaughter didn't have the same effect as 'No. I am your father.' It was more like 'Rey. Palpatine is your grandfather.' While Luke Skywalker was better handled here, he should have had more screen time. Finn is made Force Sensitive without any explanation whatsoever.And most importantly. We were 'dying' to know who Snoke was. Turns out he was basically Palpatine this entire time. What a letdown. Trevorrow's script at least gave us an idea of who he was.I hate to say this, but Trevorrow's Script(Duel Of The Fates) > JJ Abrams Rise Of Skywalker.But still, The Rise Of Skywalker is a satisfying ending to the galaxy far, far away.",5,3,16,15 February 2020
Forrest Gump," Life Is Like Fighting In Vietnam
","I loved this movie so much. When my parents asked me to watch it at first, I was skeptical. Once I saw it, I LOVED it so much. It was a very great story with a lot of life lessons.",10,1,1,14 January 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Watch the movie, engage interest, and get this movie an award.
","That took long enough. A good movie without plot holes and more character development. Good things about the movie were the memes, visual and special effects, motion-capturing, and great storyline. I give it a very good 10/10. Nothing wrong. Despite the loss of some beloved characters(practically at the end), we still saw a very good movie. All the characters were properly portrayed along with showing how they are continuing to evolve and fight back against Thanos.Amazing movie. 10/10.",10,2,6,30 April 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalypse The Midget
",Why is Apocalypse a midget. He was a giant in one of the trailers. This movie is the worst X-Men film ever. Worse than TLK.,3,1,4,14 January 2018
Coco," Musically Amazing
","A very good storyline and a great plot on how Miguel stands up against his idiotic family. Also, the twists were cool such as Hector being the real musician and Ernesto being the fraud. Who cares if it ripped off Book Of Life? It was AWESOME!!",10,1,1,2 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," TLJ is the second best Star Wars film
","I watched The Last Jedi. Before you start hating this review, let me be honest. Star Wars 8 is the SECOND best Star Wars film. I know Luke Skywalker(you know what)at the end of the film. But, Star Wars does not only focus on three characters. Sometimes, to boost up the ratings, they decide to add new characters.At least its way better than TLK(worst TF film ever and see my TLF review). I think 'Without sacrifice, there can be no victory.' Plus,The Last Jedi has some new features such as The Elite Praetorians. I wouldn't consider THE BEST yet. Kylo Ran goes all out Hitler and kills Snoke and Luke. Then there's Yoda. Kill kylo Ren we must he would say.",7,1,3,14 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Every Review of what you just wrote was wrong.
","This movie is underrated. People need to forget about its flaws and focus on what really matters. Luke may not have returned as a triumphant hero, but now, its up to Rey. So please, stop insulting the movie. It will not be the last Film",7,3,25,19 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not The Best, But Ok
",Enough with calling TLJ a failure. I watched it. I would not consider it a failure. It was OK. I think they are running out of ideas. I would put The Last Jedi at 3 on my favorite Star Wars movies and 8 on my favorite films.,7,1,9,2 February 2018
Joker," Best Origin story of the Joker(MAJOR SPOILERS!!)
","I saw the movie this weekend. I had very high hopes for the movie.When I saw it, it was better than I expected. The movie deals with psychology about a man who lives in a society where rich and poor are divided. The film states the main problem:Social classes. Rich are given more importance and the poor are made to suffer and live impoverished lives. Arthur is suffering the most throughout the film.Examples of social classes are shown throughout the film:One in Particular is the train scene where three Wayne Enterprises businessmen are bullying a poor girl and this reminds the Arthur about his life. He yearns to be noticed and wants to be recognized, but Gotham never gave him a chance and mentally and physically abused him. While he did do bad things in the movie, there were many reasons that pushed Arthur over the edge:1. He was beaten up by a group of teens(I hate them) and left there crying. His boss was angry at him, just because he lost a sign?!, not because he was assaulted!?2. A guy he thought to be his friend gave him a gun for protection, but when it was revealed, he used Arthur as a scapegoat. Arthur was fired for something his friend did. This explains why he killed Randall, but spared Gary, since Gary WAS nice towards him.3. His adoptive mother Penny abused him and gave him a head injury, that caused his uncontrollable laughter.4. His favorite comedian host made fun of him by playing his laughing video. Throughout the film, Arthur wanted to be like him and imagined him liking him, but in the end, he was just like the rich, spoiled people of Gotham.Therefore, the Joker ended up getting at the end what he wanted his whole life:respect and fame. The Clowns hailed him as a hero and it put a smile on his face, even when he was imprisoned.Amazing movie! This should be made canon to a DC movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an amazing performance.",10,5,10,13 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Smashing!!!
",Ignore the hate. Praises for Tom Hiddleston. He is GOD in this movie(along with Kong). This movie was super cool with super Kaijus.,10,1,5,14 February 2018
Wonder Woman," Great!!
","What the hell is going on with the hate? Wonder Woman was good. Great Visual Effects and CGI. Face it, I saw this movie in Adelaide. It was not at all bad. I liked it so much.",9,5,8,14 February 2018
Black Panther," Black Panther Strikes Back
",Amazing movie. Contains great fight scenes. Cool special effects. Great character development and casting. This is one of the best Marvel films and my second favorite after Thor Ragnarok.,10,12,45,19 February 2018
Black Panther," Black Panther Strikes Back
",I loved this movie. Nice Visual Effects and CGI. It was the best Marvel movie I had seen along with Thor:Ragnarok. Why the hate? The film had a great plot and nice character development. It was great to have a real superhero in action. Well done Chadwick Boseman for being Black Panther.WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!,10,4,13,21 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Son Of Krypton Vs Bat Of Gotham
",That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice.,9,76,105,21 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New Return Of The Jedi
",And...A new film rises. More fight scenes and great places. I think this is my favorite Star Wars film,9,1,16,19 February 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," Best War Film Ever
","I watched Hacksaw Ridge twice. Why? It was a GREAT movie. Mel Gibson is very good at making movies and this one is his best. Also, Andrew Garfield has performed well as Desmond Doss. No matter what happened to him, he was a true savior.",Null,1,1,13 December 2017
Princess Mononoke," Great Anime Movie
","I never watch anime. But when my friend showed me this movie, I liked it. Well done Studio Ghibli",8,1,1,19 February 2018
Alien: Covenant," That's the spirit
","Why the hate? Alien:Covenant is one of the best movies(despite the ending). In this film, we get to see the so-called origins of the Xenomorphs and Neomorphs. It explains a lot. I like Michael Fassbender in action. It is a great movie for Alien fans.",10,3,8,20 February 2018
