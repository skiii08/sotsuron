The Expendables 2," Just as well as the first
","The film is just as good as the first one. Even if there is less action during the movie, there are more funny moments. It is good too.",8,0,0,9 June 2019
World War Z," Yep...
","The movie is not bad, but I don't really like zombie attacks.",4,0,5,13 March 2020
Yes Man," Wow !
","The film is slightly ridiculed but advocates an extremely important idea. The importance of seizing opportunities. Don't settle for a quiet little life and get out of your comfort zone. It sounds hard at start-up, but that's how we live our best experiences and create our best memories.
This is why this film is one of my favorites! The message is great: Knowing how to say yes to everything, until our subconscious is positive and learn to say it more often.",10,0,2,19 March 2020
The Expendables," Good movie with a lot of action, but ..
","The film is really dynamic. We do not get bored at all. All the big actors : Bruce Willis, Jason Statham, Schwarzenegger ... Only default: Stallone. I do not really like this actor and unfortunately he is the main character.",8,0,0,8 June 2019
Suicide Squad," I love it!!
","This film is funny, moving and fascinating from start to finish. Special mention for Harley Quinn which I particularly adore!",10,0,2,15 March 2020
Split," Interesting, but a bit long.
","Usually not a fan of horror movies, I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I found the time long enough, 2 hours of film may not have been necessary. But the concept, exciting!",6,1,1,28 April 2019
Django Unchained," Fabulous
","One of the best movies. A little long, that's why I only put 9/10. I understand the reputation of Quentin Tarantino.",9,1,2,10 February 2020
The Lion King," Extraordinary.
","Worthy of my favorite Disney! It's a pleasure for the eyes. I recommend to all fans of the cartoon. But: The voices are not at all the same as those of the cartoon, it is disturbing for some characters (Simba for example).",9,1,4,17 August 2019
Into the Wild," Cool ! But really long
","Who has never thought of going on an adventure? Getting back to basics? The 20th century, capitalism and mass industrialization is a source of stress and discomfort. It's proven ! There, we follow a young man who does what everyone has already thought to do one day: to burrow alone in the deep nature. Did it make me want to do it too? No, especially after seeing the end! But It's a very informative film. We live another story, the kind that we would never dare to undertake.",5,0,0,19 March 2020
Titanic," Unbelievable !
","Usually not very fan of romance movies, this one is a must and I understand why! Although it is very long and we know the end of the story even before the beginning of the film, it is captivating! We're not bored !",10,4,6,28 April 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Marvelous
","This film is superb! I have never bothered to look and be interested before, but I love it! We go down in history from the beginning, the 2h30 pass very quickly!",9,1,1,27 October 2019
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Superb
","Superb movie, like the first! Only downside: the passage with spiders ... I do not think to see this movie again because it's my biggest phobia! But I still liked it",6,0,0,29 October 2019
Hancock," Cool !
","The film is really nice, not too long, moving. It's not bad!",7,0,0,13 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Different
","This film is not at all the kind of film I usually watch. I will not see him again because I found it very long. Nevertheless, I put a 5/10 because it denounces the backstage, what we (spectators), we do not see and we do not imagine. This devastating pressure to win the love and admiration of the spectators. This search for love goes further than one could imagine. After trying to commit suicide on stage, the whole production thought only of rejoicing at the noise and the notoriety that it would generate. Not believable, is it?",5,0,2,11 February 2020
The Big Short," Interesting
","Not my favorite, but the film is really interesting. The subprime crisis experienced by the banks themselves. We learn a lot, it's cool!",6,0,2,14 February 2020
The Sixth Sense," Amazing
","A very moving film! it surprises us until the end! One of my favorite movies without hesitation. It's a pleasure to feel so close to the little boy, to learn to understand him better throughout the film. And until the last we realize that finally: we do not really see everything!",10,1,1,29 April 2019
The Matrix," Wow !
","I loved this film ! It's long but yet it's pure genius! The matrix that makes everything our mind wants to imagine possible. A funny way to make us understand that it is only a question of convincing our mind to successfully do what we want. And if we too were in this parallel, imaginary world ?",10,1,1,13 February 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," Very long
","Interesting about the situation in India, but very very long and repetitive. The end is predictable.",5,0,0,8 July 2019
