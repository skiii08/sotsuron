Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," There is something for everyone in Episode I.
","The latest addition to the Star Wars saga was everything I expected it to be and more. Seeing the Phantom Menace at 12:01 on the morning of its release to the general audience was  worth standing in long lines, paying the high admissions price, and the sacrifice of a  good nights sleep. Being surrounded by the atmosphere of opening night only added to the newest Star Wars experience. I watched the movie without expectations but with much anticipation in hopes that it would convey a sense of continuity  with the last three chapters. I was not only satisfied but also impressed. However, it is obvious that the movie had a much broader target audience, and this may be why some people disliked the light hearted  Jar Jar Binks.The special effects are outstanding and the computer animation is used in a way to maximize the greatness of the film. The actors accomplished the feat of creating convincing characters, yet all left the needed room for future growth and development. The action scenes were great. The light saber match and the pod-racing scenes gave me that feeling of satisfaction I got when the dark side was defeated  by the Jedi in the other films.In essence the Phantom Menace was everything a Star Wars movie should be. In my opinion the movie lived up to the anticipation and the hype. Be sure to see it at least once this summer, as you will not be disappointed.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
