Minority Report," not that great
","imo the the third act of the movie was really good but events leading up to it, except a few good ones, were full of awkward out of place humor, action movie clich√©s , and predictable moments some of the things like cops just standing in a line so that their view is blocked by the balloons Agatha not telling cruise that lamar is the killer early on Agatha being able to see future (like in the shopping mall) but not when the guy takes cruise's gun nd kills himself availability of A.I. like the spideys but no other implementation of it pointless technology like reading ur name and shopping details out loud cruise insisting on meeting crow at that very moment rather than waiting for the predicted time to pass just dampened the experience for mecollin farrel being the good guy at the end , and the scenes leading upto the person pretending to be the child killer being killed were so damn predictable and stretched that i was pretty bored but the last 45 mins or so was pretty awesome so that held the movie up a bit",7,1,1,14 December 2015
