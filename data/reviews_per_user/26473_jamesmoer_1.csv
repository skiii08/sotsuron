Source Code," Great movie.
","It's an amazing well planned movie with a good twist. Keeps you at the edge of your sit every minute. I've really enjoyed it and frankly and I don't understand what's the guys problem below me is, stop nitpicking at every detail, god.The plot feels fine and balanced, the characters have good world submission and it feels as if you're on the train as well, experiencing it. The only thing that bugged me is that there was too much dialog, I already knew what was happening or what the character/s were talking about. Overall a very well balanced sci-fi thriller.I recommend you to see this movie as soon as possible, it will give you a nice ride to the limits of your imagination!",9,0,0,12 April 2011
