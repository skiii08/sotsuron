Mission: Impossible III," MI3? Third time's the Charm!
","This movie, should you choose to accept watching it, had some tributes to some of Tom Cruise's previous movies - a piece of reggae at the beginning tying in to both 'The Firm' and 'Cocktail' especially when he was using a cocktail shaker, his travelling a motorcycle like 'Top Gun;' even the chases thru the flick lends themselves to his 'Minority Report,' but MI3 was better than the first two missions.Philip Seymour Hoffman as the insidious arms dealer was very villainous and totally different from his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Truman Capote, which shows his versatility.Laurence Fishburne as the other potential foil to Cruise was very good as a by the book and neo-jingoistic agent. A far cry from the prophet/ally of Morpheus in the Matrix (patriotism in another way), or the fury of Othello, or his days with the 'Boyz In The Hood.' Obviously we'll be seeing more of him in other missions...The film was handed to JJ Abrams of 'Alias' fame and justifiably so - the transition of secret agents on TV to the big screen was easy for the director, through him the main plot and sub threads were deftly woven! The fact that Cruise's Ethan Hunt is getting married; how his team feels he's betrayed them in seeking romance; another plot is that Ethan's effectiveness as an agent could be compromised by having close ties - all juxtaposed with achieving a new mission after being out of the field for so long! But the main plot is seeking a biological doomsday device known as 'The Rabbit's Foot' and Hoffman as the arms dealer hoping to get it into his greedy clutches.The techniques and technology in MI3 is very scary if indeed possible - sculpting a mask on the spot; a vocoder matching the voiceprint of who you're impersonating; satellite imagery that can locate a license number from a vertical slant; implanting a debriefing in a supposed disposable camera - it's not 'What will they think of next?' but 'Why haven't they done so-and-so yet?' The idea that defibrillator can defuse a head-bomb was a stretch in hindsight, but with the break-in to the Vatican, Cruise/Ethan as a Cardinal and other amazing effects, you can forgive that! Go and see this film before it self-destructs in...",8,0,1,8 May 2006
50 First Dates," Really Having Every Day a New Beginning [spoilers?]
","I have never gone through so many tissues in a long time! It is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen... Jocko & Rob Schneider alone deserve Oscars!    Most guys in Henry Roth's position would have either taken advantage of the situation or given up right from the start, after his womanising ways wore out on him here was a challenge for him - after all the women who never forget him here's one who doesn't even recall their first 'Hello!'   How he chooses to overcome that to make the ultimate commitment(s) is a viewing well the worth the effort and the Kleenex!   http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",10,0,1,18 May 2004
Iron Man 3," Ironclad Trilogy - Robert Downey Jr steels the Show!
","This is the first film I ever watched in 3D and I am glad to learn it is no longer one red and one blue lens as that made me close to seasick! I am glad my initiation for 3D was with this movie, I could not ask for better! Fanboys will be irked, and most of them are, while I have both read the original series (when comics used be 20 cents) and watched all three (was not too in love with Iron Man 2), I still appreciated all the effort which was poured into Iron man 3 (IM3) - what Fanboys need to accept is while the Mandarin had a bearing in 1960's USA? Mandarin as he used to be does not make sense in a post-9/11 21st Century.China is a Superpower in its own right and USA is not in a Cold or Warm war with Beijing, Mandarin was great for the 60's, how do you bring him into the 21st Century? You cannot, North Korea does not have a Mandarin and would not make any sense culturally; Captain America's nemesis from the 70's - Yellow Claw is another antiquated relic and even Shang Chi could fall that way except he is designed to break away from that mould, as the son of Fu Manchu who seeks to do right and not what suits a Middle Kingdom from World War 2...Mickey Rourke as the Russianised Whiplash was more relevant and yet how Marvel treated the premise in Iron Man 2 for me seemed very cheapened when one considers Gorbachev & Perestroika.Iron Man 3 was fine, if a book & film are the same then it's boring, it's the adaptation which makes for cleverness or a bomb - 'Outland' with Sean Connery is only case where movie was better than the book for me until Iron Man 3.That is why it is so necessary to throw most of the comic books you know out the window, then Robert Downey Jr in Iron Man 3 was brilliant, it is an excellent capper to a grand trilogy which was part of a larger plan to realise the making of the Avengers.So making Mandarin as a drugged up patsy for the real villain was understandable, when you consider this is another type of commentary on the War Against Terror, which still channels Fahrenheit 911 & Swordfish but in a different twist which still has mettle.The whole film is about transformations. Killian started as a greasy long haired geek who can barely walk; Tony Stark began the trilogy as a womanising alcoholic and concluded in IM3 as an Uber-MacGyver who got anxiety attacks because he learned to be in love and care for his staff and even appreciate his 'tools' of Jarvis & Dummy. Tony was forced to learn that it's not the armour which carries him through, it is his mind which makes it all pull together.There are those who watch this from the outside and want to know why Mark 42 armour was so flimsy - when you have a prototype are you placing all the bells & whistles first or making sure the basic functions are coordinated? Using Star Trek: Next Generation the TV Series as a corollary, the NCC 1701-D had fewer weapons than the original Enterprise although it was a better designed ship.If you knew nothing of the comics this would be great in its own right, this is to draw Non Readers & Fanboys simultaneously. Killian's transformation was the reverse of Mandarin, and his vendetta seemed realistic for me (Guy Pearce's acting on par with Robert Downey Jr when you recall Pearce has been 3 heroes - Time Machine, Lockdown & Count Of Monte Cristo, yet the only other bad guy was when he appeared in Adam Sandler's Bedtime Stories)? If a Comic Book movie follows slavishly to what was printed before, then where is the thrill or surprise in watching?France did it with an Asterix film (where he met Cleopatra), but what they did was to add not subtract from the book... Marvel used the same treatment of creating an Alternative Universe with Spider-Man, Wolverine and the Xmen and all had satisfying Box Office results! IM3 sews up the development of a petulant rich-kid into a responsible technocrat acknowledging his actions have global repercussions, with Tony Stark's chest now fully healed this allows for superior armour which can fight Thanos or whosoever in Avengers 2, without having to divert as a pacemaker, which is an evolution not peculiar to the films but on par with the comics too! Ironic? ;)",9,2,8,7 May 2013
Casablanca," The Classic of All Classics: Morocco by moonlight exeunt reluctant heroes...
","Where do you start on such a beautiful relationship? By rounding up all of the usual suspects! Look at that, two of many catchphrases from one film...
That alone should tell you about the best ever picture - dialogue plus acting and action carrying the movie along without cursing, without car chases, without nudity and sex & love & passion hinted at, but never rubbed in your face... Classy in a class of its own!The snivelling Peter Lorre; the would-be bullying of Sidney Greenstreet; Ingrid and Bogey - each reluctant heroes on opposite sides of the heart juxtaposed with the near clueless nobility of the Viktor Laszlo character...
All the while the snide private observances of Claude Rains observing without being observed and a reluctant champion in private, at that!Woman needs man, and man! Sam - you played it for her now play it for me!! This was one of the earliest pictures where music, in this case: one particular song, was key to the whole plot of the film...Damn, here's looking at you kid!",10,0,2,24 August 2004
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 lacks Mettle - Original whips Sequel by far
","Shrek 2, Spider-Man 2 and Superman 2 are a few examples where the return was better then the debut. Sorry to say Iron Man 2 is just a bridge to prepare folk for both Avengers and Thor from Marvel's line-up.Stan Lee made his usual cameo as one of the well-wishers when Tony Stark was exiting from his year-long Expo. However, the real scene stealer was Scarlett Johanssen as Natasha Romanov/Natalie Rushman as the Black Widow she kicked everyone's butt including Director Jon Favreau as 'Happy' Hogan, Stark's bodyguard & coach (sic).Mickey Rourke was made to appear highly intelligent as a physicist/hacker gone way wrong - Ivan Vanko son of a Howard Stark collaborator. If you're a comics purist you know that 'Whiplash' (never called so in the picture) was an American by name of Scarlotti.Don Cheadle as James 'Rhodey' Rhodes/War Machine was a poor man's Terence Howard. The interaction of not Batman and Robin so much as the interaction of Robert Downey's excellent 'Sherlock Holmes' where he sparred verbally and even physically with Jude Law as Dr Watson.Marvel, wishing to appear Politically Correct, have transformed Colonel Nick Fury (once portrayed by Caucasian David Hassellhoff, admittedly God knows why he was picked) into Afro-American Samuel L. Jackson, who's role as Director of S*H*I*E*L*D seems now to be a sop for the fact that both Cheadle and Howard were second fiddles to Robert Downey Jr's title role.Some highpoints included when Tony Stark though he was dying and got blasted on booze and was treating Champagne bottles like clay skeets; the initial War Machine and Iron Man conflict in Stark's Malibu Mansion and of course, what happens after the credits at the very end of the film - Odin forbid me revealing!While an acceptable li'l pot-boiler, the reality is you're better off watching the first Iron Man twice, since the thrill in the current flick will rust out fast!",7,0,3,8 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dead Men Tell No Tales - Until Now!
","Johnny Depp as the perpetually pickled Captain Jack Sparrow is hilarious, especially when he sees Kiera Knightley and his first reaction is to tell his first mate, 'Hide the rum!' No doubt recalling their last encounter when they were trapped on a cay in the Caribbean...Kiera Knightley in all her anorexic glory did not seem as pithy as in the first episode.Bill Nighy as the CGI'd Davey Jones was indeed well chosen, he has played an iconic rocker in 'Love Actually'; as well as the Head Vampire, Viktor, in 'Underworld' among many other roles over the years...However, I have a few historical bones to pick - Caribs are not proved to be cannibals even on a ritualistic basis, further, they were straight haired in the film when in fact they intermarried with Africans (who were either explorers or runaway slaves) and therefore would have rather curly hair! Next thing, only black people in this movie had Jamaican accents but in fact the white people would have to have that accent first to pass on to the slaves and would have been more likely at least 100 years before the setting of this story! Next thing: how on earth does a pseudo-Jamaican have a Creole Patois brother? So the Caribbean consists only of Jamaica and St Lucia, please! Apart from that, the story was interesting and the swordplay was good if a bit wild like on the old mill-wheel - are these new rides Disney is subliminally selling to the public? That and the ball-cages from the Carib camp? The next installment will have many loose ends to tie up, but apart from the anachronisms, this picture was as good as the first - a premise that can just as easily fail, so well done Jerry Bruckheimer! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",8,1,3,16 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," WW2 & Christianity too?
","I admit I've never read the book... But now I do want to check it out very badly! Tilda Swinden as the White Witch was good especially when she played Gabriel (Gabrielle?) in 'Constantine,' but this can lead to typecasting as nothing but a villainess! Whereas Jim Broadbent as the Professor was most intriguing - he played a villain in 'Moulin Rouge' and in Jacky Chan's version of 'Around The World in 80 Days' and a good guy this time yet each character may seem familiar - each was their own entity... Perhaps he should have been Dumbledore? Typecasting in the hero section comes with Liam Neeson playing the Qui-Gon Jinn/ish talking lion, Aslan (what a beautiful name), but then he has played the anti-hero Darkman - which was a while ago! Aslan was not exactly messianic to me, he was more John The Baptist-like, in that he tended to presage the children whose visit was foretold...His laying down his life for Edmund was Christ-like, but more along the lines of John The Baptist losing his head to Salome - yet then there was the resurrection for having faith! He also called on the armies of the dead to help the living army of good, like Judgment Day! A very intriguing notion using pagan/Greek mythic characters to portray one of Humanity's best theories... Christianity, what a pity we all find it so difficult to practice it! Using four unknowns as the Pevensies was smart, but their choice for Lucy is a bit off, as she tends to be stone-faced or not sure when to laugh or cry!However, the choice for James MacAvoy as Tumnus was good, this shows marvelous versatility for the young Scot who played Leto Atreides to perfection in 'Children of Dune.' The effects were far superior to Xena to have the Cyclopes, Centaurs, Fauns and Satyrs move with ease and grace! Aslan looked natural when talking, and so did the beavers... Even the Gryphons moved better than in 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'!! As for Maugrim the chief of secret police, he was a truly fearsome wolf and using Michael Madsen's voice made it more effective! I love how the four children of Adam & Eve adopted the tactics of World War II in the fight against the White Witch - using boulders for bombs and Phoenixes as incendiary devices to compensate for lack of numbers!!This is doing better than the Harry Potter series that is starting to head for a nose-dive in my view, I eagerly await the 'King Caspian' and 'The Dawn Treader' instalments! This was much better than the cartoon I saw as a child...",8,1,2,28 December 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," This Ice Age is Cooler
","The animation is better, the humor is more intelligent and yet slapstick simultaneously! A mammoth believing they're a possum, and when you learn why - tears come to your eyes! How a sqrat can defend itself against a multitude of piranhas, using the fish themselves against each other! But if he's dying, leave him be, lol! Scrat, the main character to my mind, was both the problem and solution for the valley - he caused the valley to flood and also to drain in his immortal quest for the Perfect Acorn, and he nearly died for it too; not that he'd've minded!! Diego, an exiled sabre-tooth tiger, learns to overcome one of his greatest fears - is this supposed to explain why tigers nowadays like to swim? Denis Leary plays his character out well and sounds a bit like George Clooney still...Manny finds love and a continuance of his lineage in the most unlikely place, as Ellie (another mammoth) appears to be the 'sister' of two mad extreme-sporty yet hip-hoppy possum brothers! Ellie's voice is laid out by the very popular and eponymous Queen Latifah.The definition of water and fur has vastly improved over the first and an absence of humans added to the concentration of following the story... This ice was really nice!",8,5,6,17 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," I Sing Of Arms & The Spider! (a.k.a. - Courtesy Your Friendly Neighborhood Spoiler-Man)
","If you told me in April that there'd be not one but two sequels that outshone their predecessors I'd've looked you straight in the eye and laughed myself sick - maybe all over your shoes/feet! Then 'Shrek 2' came along and even now I still say ' * Boots, ha-hah! Hack, hak, hagh... hairball!' Well, and I believed the old adage about lightning strikes etc. Still wrong! SpiderMan 2 came along and yanked me kicking and screaming into an unexpected cornucopia of comic book lover delights of fancy!The last time there was a sequel that exceeded the original was SuperMan 2 in 1979! Sure, Peter's face may have been shown more than he intended but in his line of work do you expect his uniform to stay intact? The way has been paved for the Man-Wolf, the Lizard and Harry Osborn as Green Goblin 2 in future installments... As for the plots, there were so many and yet you could keep track of each thread (web-strand? ;p)... * Peter's all-out tiredness at trying to please his aunt, MJ, Bugle, College and Pizza joint - phew! * The on/off near-relationship between Pete and MJ; Doc Ock's love for his wife (and master touch implying his arms were what made him evil) juxtaposed with his fevered desire to prove science Is (I had forgotten what a great science student Peter was nearly as good as Curt Connors or Reed Richards - ye Gods! Ioan Gryfudd as Mr. Fantastic? Whoops! Wrong forum!)The cameos of Stan Lee (Marvel's Galactus) in another crowd scene and 'Army Of Darkness'' Bruce Campbell (Sam Raimi's buddy) as the evil usher were well-timed and the re-appearance of 'Xena's' Jaxur as the sycophantic assistant of JJJ was equally appreciated. This picture has many memorable quote-lines... 'I am Spider-Man no more!' or 'Mr. Jameson, your wife called to say she lost the checkbook!' and his instantaneous response? 'Thanks for the Good News!' There was also Otto's 'Ladies and gentlemen? Fasten your seat belts!' It doesn't seem likely there'll be a budding romance betwixt Aunt May & Doc Ock in the movie version of Spidey's life as compared to the comics, not after the aborted bank robbery (and in this version, it seems Aunt May suspects Peter's truth?)... My final spin? Don't crawl, LEAP to the cinema and watch SM2!",9,0,0,31 July 2004
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Slice and Dice - Logan & Gambit: Longshot?
","Cramming 1845 to 1960 in 20 minutes cheated viewers into an otherwise potentially rewarding sci-fi yarn from Marvel Comics.Who was Sabretooth & Logan's father? Why did Sabretooth change from Thor with fangs in 1st X-Men of 2001 to a crewcutted Wolverine in 2009? Logan's loose ends were tied up better but not much... The whole premise of the picture could have been stretched to 3 films easily and do at same time like 'Pirates Of The C'bean' to simplify and lessen drag of expectations.If this was done more quickly, I doubt so many would have been disappointed. The first picture could expand more on who their father was (he obviously did not have the healing factor) and why there was a conflict with what turned out to be his step-father, what made Wolverine sick as a child and then sprout bone claws in stress.A next picture could delve into Civil War, WW 1 and 2 then Vietnam which led to his joining up with Deadpool, Wraith and Blob, that expansion could be a teaser for last 30 minutes of current flick.It's like - 'We know you're waiting but since we have a deadline this is what you'll get.' The movie lacked Julienning for my part, but I guess they were avoiding an 'R' rating, Gambit is cool but too brief to really create a desire for more... Zero was far more intriguing as was Deadpool and Wraith. But then they had longer exposure? If you're an action junkie it's a Happy Meal, but don't expect even a TV Dinner and that's the tooth, uh, truth!",7,1,3,1 May 2009
Constantine," Roll over Neo! Constantine smokes out Evil and flips a bird at it!
","I don't know what's the critics' problems are, maybe they recall 'St. Augustine In Hell' from Sting and realise from David Foxx' monologue/soliloquy that critics are part of Hades' heavy diet, but for me this movie rocks as much as the first Matrix and the 1st half of the 2nd Matrix (the rest stunk plot-wise, but that's another story)! This was a great way for Keanu to break away from the encoding of that technobabbble, something far more organic yet just as philosophic...Can you really blame the character of becoming a lung cancer victim before he reaches 40? After seeing all of the demons that he has? They say the cleft on your top lip is an angel's finger-imprint to remind you not to let on what you were taught in Heaven before you came to Earth, but while John may have that cleft they forgot to repress his knowledge and it nearly drove him insane - in fact, his parents thought he was and he nearly lost his life for it.This movie is heavily Catholic, so those who get offended by that kind of dogma, run, OK? On the other hand, if you are Catholic this flick may offend you, too, it requires some real open-mindedness! For me, Rachel Weisz is highly over-rated, she lacked the oomph of sexual tension that was supposedly implied with Keanu/Constantine - she did a better job in 'Runaway Jury' and the 'Mummy' series - what she did show is that she can be a great replacement for the current actress handling Witchblade...Keanu as the tortured exorcist is excellent (I understand the original character was British, so what? Sometimes ignorance is bliss! I know the original Blade in 'Tomb Of Dracula' comics and the upgrade in film is WAY better) and his dismissive attitude to demons even under attack is astounding yet hilarious - the usual reaction to any Garth Ennis endeavor! Garth created 'Hitman,' 'Preacher,' among others in the comics and their content usually makes demons blush, and if he's handling the translation of his character from book to screen then step back and give him some slack! Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite was good too but under-utilised and i hope he's exploited more if sequels are in the offing, as there should be! I liked how Hell is ruled by 'Lou' who looks like a Sopranos-reject, but the classic part and essential Garth Ennis was when Constantine was floating to heaven and he gave Lucifer the finger! I would watch the movie over and over just to savour the irony of that part of the picture, LMAO/ROTF This picture is also a great way to scare people into stop smoking, I say it's a great picture all around and get out and see for yourself today! http://www.tinyurl.com/3464k/",9,13,33,27 February 2005
Troy," Hit And Myth - w/Spoilers for a spoiled film?
","As a story in its own right Troy is okay, and Brad Pitt was correctly chosen to be the powerful yet arrogant and self-destructive Achilles.His fight scenes reminded me of Jet Li, and were the best things in the picture... Eric Bana playing Hector actually made me root for the Trojans for the first time! But being a Greek Mythology freak, I was annoyed for a number of facts!Troy fell around 1184 BC not 2000 years ago, Patroclus actually was older than Achilles - it's even possible they were lovers...They had no involvement of the gods, there was no attempt by Odysseus to avoid war by pretending madness - I could go on and on and on, bah!http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",4,0,2,8 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Oy, Me Hearty - Check the flick or walk the plank, Yo Ho Ho!
","Loved it, it was faster paced than its two predecessors... The amount of cut-throatedness against each other was amazing - I was wondering how it could be resolved in the 168 minutes allotted it! Johnny Depp as a schizophrenic was very intriguing, all of that rum finally left a warped delirium tremens indeed, yet he was very cunning right to the end in spite of his befuddlement when in solitary purgatory.Keith Richards appearing as his father after being promised ever since was a bit anti-climactic, but welcome nevertheless! This film portrayed Orlando Bloom in his most macho, masculine, butch and male role ever yet! Now I can understand why wmn would drool over his sorry skinny butt! It was unexpected that Disney allowed his rather strong character to be murdered, albeit survive as the next Davy Jones...Kiera Knightley as a sex symbol I find difficult to believe for myself - but she was very good as evolving into what was more pirate than even the rest of the pirates or even Chow Yun Fat's Singapore Captain! I hope there can be a prequel expanding Chow Yun Fat's character, it was too brief in this film to have any significant dimension.The strained love affair between her character and Will Turner resembled that of the Greek myth between Orpheus and Eurydice.However, although they say there are no more POTC's, there are still unanswered questions - what happened to Sparrow's quest for Ponce de Leon's Agua De Vida? Will Barbossa stop Jack from reaching Florida? Were Calypso and Bill Nighy's un-squidded human sailor be reunited in pure passion? What of the Black Pearl, whose is it really? Or does it even belong to another?",10,21,34,28 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3? Sandbagged! Arachnomania Beyond Belief, Only Venomous disappointment
","How do I hate thee? Let me spin the ways... It does not help since I read the original comics, this film is trying to cram 30 years of Spidey's history into less than 2 hours! Sandman never was involved in Uncle Ben's death, Venom did not die plus Eddie Brock was way older and muscular, the suit was a gift from a cosmic character called the Beyonder in an Event called Secret Wars.X-Men did not follow comics totally either but they stayed within original characters permutations - I mean come on! Harry Osborn becomes GOOD? Please, he was insane and on drugs! The issue was a classic as the use of pills made the Comics Code Of Authority refuse to put on their stamp at the time... Gwen Stacy and Capt Stacy her dad was okay, the characterisation for the cop was better using the farmer from Babe. Brock or Venom, whose name I never heard called in the picture was eventually a good guy albeit rough Bounty Hunter with The Punisher.The acting was the worst I'd ever seen from Toby MacGuire, the Venom guy or even Harry seemed better as Parker! I am so sorry I watched!",4,0,1,18 May 2007
The Prestige," What prestige to pull a trick that costs your soul?
","An apocryphal Nikola Tesla played by the phenomenal David Bowie as the undoing of two rivals is what really makes for the film based on a book from UK sf novelist Christopher Priest.For my part, it was Hugh Jackman's character of Rupert Angier obsessing over revenge that led him to his dark path; while Bale's Bowden character in literally leading a double life and never letting himself take the blame which led to his near destruction.Michael Caine as the man who taught them both was an endearing and yet clever touch... The theory that Tesla had mastered alternating current to the degree he had and thus creating the ultimate Prestige was in and of itself intriguing.I see many tricks that were conducted in the movie were advised by David Copperfield, yet the Hugh Jackman specialty at the end of the movie can be clearly seen as a variation on a popular trick from Criss Angel.The plotting, acting as well as cinematography are all worthy of Oscars not 2 forget the costume and art direction and layout - very prestigious, I look forward to checking the book now! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com",8,0,0,15 February 2007
Notting Hill," Love-lives of the Rich along with The Not-So-Famous: A View of Spoiler Hill
","Hugh Grant is your perpetual goofy good guy and Rhys Ifans as the dopey flatmate with incredible T-Shirts was a classic foil yet Hugh's saviour in the end...Rhys was hilarious posing for the paparazzi, and he made up for his flub in the end by literally putting his life on the line to stop the traffic to let Hugh & Co. go through to the hotel find Julia. (loved the cartoon aliases and how the Japanese thought a simple exuberant gesture of gratitude was a common greeting, LOL)Alec Baldwin was effective in his cameo as the slovenly soon-to-be ex-lover of Julia...Julia was not as effective as I thought she could be, there was no 'Pretty Woman' spark... Yet the passage of a year with just the duration of Bill Withers' 'Ain't No Sunshine' as Hugh walked through the Notting Hill Market more than made up for it - a true cinematographic gem worthy of the classification of 'classic!'The chase scene at the end was also magnificent punctuated by Stevie Winwood's 'Gimme Some Lovin'' (You gotta admit the his character was DUMB! HellOOOoooo? A woman spends money to buy an ORIGINAL Chagall as a way of saying 'Sorry' and you say 'NO?' Are you on peyote, man?)The end was beautiful, I never thought something as simple as a park bench could be so romantic?",9,0,0,26 August 2004
Watchmen," All Along - The Watchmen Tower Over Realities
","Any film which has two far less one song from Leonard Cohen is bound to be cool. 'First We Take Manhattan' and 'Hallelujah'... I only read the first six books of the Watchmen in my teens, so I knew enough that for my part Zack Snyder did a fair job of almost slavishly following the book except to the endgame as far as I know. Even so, he created a rightful alternate which should keep fans wanting more...After all, what will happen with NiteOwl II and Miss Jupiter (Silk Spectre II)?? I didn't see any condoms and therefore is it that far off to imagine a next generation? I am sure even Leonard Cohen would have a great snicker as to how his 'Hallelujah' would be used - as I am sure like Prince, both see God and sex as closely related or different millings along the edge of the same coin.Dr Manhattan spoke of creating life in another galaxy what will this do to that Universe? Were there aliens already there or is that version like Asimov and Campbell's Universe? Stark and human-solo until Dr Manhattan's proposed project? In a weird and very real sense, Ozymandias brought sanity to a world long since bereft of it... The Comedian and Rorshach were fully aware of it and had different operating mechanisms for it. Rorshach did not cope, nor accept - he just had no illusions that the world and himself were insane, in fact insanity gave him lucidity.Edward Blake, never denied his brutal nature and thrived on it and made it his tool to survive when metahumans were outlawed. It is intriguing how since this series in 1986 that everyone who's sought to conceptualise genuine ultra-normals in a present day situation have all chosen an entropic outcome with political overtones...'Kingdom Come' also DC, the novels 'Those Who Walk In Darkness' and 'What Fire Cannot Burn' from John Ridley - even Pixar/Disney's 'Incredibles' follows that trend as well as Michael Rappaport while his parking attendant character is on Experimental Meds and thinks he's super-powered.By far, Rorshach was the most captivating character in this film and probably the most genuine hero. He refused to surrender his ideals even in the face of annihilation and thus proved the true definition of heroics. He also had the best line in the movie and it summed up his ethos too; 'I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with ME!' Manhattan was not necessarily remote, his mechanism to handle the resultant ripples from his re-entry was to adopt stereotypy but was forced to snap out of it when confronted with another unexpected hero - Miss Jupiter, who rose above her semi-tragic childhood unlike Rorshach who embraced his dark young days and used it as fuel to drive him onwards.Hollis Mason - the original NiteOwl and Miss Jupiter's mom the first Silk Spectre, the two surviving MinuteMen both tried coping with the New Wave in pretty much the same way - reliving the past and reinforced with booze.The direction was great, Matt Frewer as a devolving ex-villain was sad yet humorous, Billy Crudup is a far cry from 2003's 'Big Fish,' and there was credible acting all around except maybe for Ozymandias who was a little too hammy yet maybe that was needed to expose his delusions? It will be remarkable if there's a sequel, and would lead to a next conundrum... Who watches out for those who watch the Watchmen?",9,0,2,30 July 2009
Over the Hedge," Hedge Your Bets: Watch This, LOL!
","The plot is old as all get out, loner joins group or community to use their ability to achieve a goal and ends up adopting them long after they adopted him.But it is what was done to make you forget that while watching! Bruce Willis even as a voice alone at his zany Moonlighting or Hudson Hawk best as RJ the raccoon-trickster with a bag of tricks to outdo any magician.Garry Shandling as Verne the introverted turtle, Eugene Levy as a hedgehog and Avril Lavigne with William Shatner as possums...The interaction was astute, while 'Ant Bully' was also about exterminators, this one took the cake with the almost Mission Impossible like set-up! The digital animation was even better than Shrek 2, which is good, as Shrek 3 from the same DreamWorks is due soon - I know, as it wasn't that long ago that John Cleese was here in Barbados and told me he finished voicing his slot as the Frog King.Nick Nolte reprised his villainous role from 'Richman, Poorman' to play the villainous Vincent Bear to perfection! The movie is also a statement on the environment and how we encroach on it and how it can backfire - what was the bear doing with all of that processed food? It said: DON'T FEED THE BEARS, but as usual humans do what they wanna do, eh? Poor RJ may not have known about doughnuts if we learned to share with nature instead of trying to suborn it...

Dreamgirls," America now Idolises Jennifer Hudson, this was really Effie's Story!
","Note to IMDb: I think the scoring system needs a slight tweaking, there should be .5 as well as the numerical value - instead of an absolute final value since while the movie was about 7.5, I would rate Jennifer Hudson's performance as 9.5! To my view, this show ranged from 1959 to about 1983 or '84, let's say 25 years from late 50's to early 80's, while the show was based on the Supremes, there were other references that were spot on but I noticed some other anachronisms - Beyonce's pictures in the mansion showed her sporting a hairstyle where the hair is twisted into tubes and that was not 70's, certainly not for black people then either! Another out-of-time slot was the dance sequence for 'Bad Man' (the first payola scene, not sure if I have the right name for that song) those moves were clearly 90's and now, there was another discrepancy also with Beyonce's hair as a flowing perm in the mid 70's, anyhow, now for the picture itself...Eddie Murphy as Jimmy 'Thunder' Early was a surprisingly good choice, his meteoric rise as a Little Richard wanna-be, changed into a balladeer even though his heart was not in it, and that led to his thwarted efforts as a 'conscious' singer objecting to Vietnam which led to his pathetic demise - yet it was he who gave the Dreamgirls their break! Beyonce as Deena Jones (read a close alternative for Diana Ross), was good as an alternative version of Tina Turner who in this case was able to walk out without being beaten or losing money, her pyromania in 'Listen' was very good but not earth-shattering...Jamie Foxx as Curtis Taylor Jr the slick nobody who wrests away the managing of the group from Danny Glover's Marty Madison, bringing them to a white audience and defeating white bands by using their own methods against them was very harsh and real. His success led to overconfidence and an ultra-Svengali degree of control for the whole band.But it was Jennifer Hudson as the feisty, tumultuous and passionate Effie White who stole the show by far! I am so glad that American Idol's Simon Cowell is eating his words, when Effie/Jennifer belted Jennifer Holiday's classic from the original 'You're Gonna Love Me' I knew she had to get an Oscar, I went through three Kleenexes as she mourned her unrequited love for Curtis/Foxx! All through her pain and sorrow she kept her pregnancy quiet, named her daughter Miracle and drank her fortune away, until she appealed to Madison/Glover to find her another break, then the reluctant champion stepped forth and did 'One Night Only' which lyrically reminded me of Bonnie Raitt's 'I Can't Make You Love Me' and then the now-evil Curtis/Foxx stepped in to do another payola to wrest her comeback until Beyonce/Deena blew the whistle! The scene with the new trio minus Effie that was set in the gay bar was obviously a nod to Diana Ross' homosexual following, especially when she had the hits 'Muscles', 'I'm Coming Out' and 'Inside Out' that were large hits in the gay community.The movie in and of itself is another rags-to-riches tale, but the real story and performance was Jennifer Hudson! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com/",7,2,4,6 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," On Parole, hope Goblet has more 2 offer!
","Having read all 5 books, I can safely says this one has the most faithful adaptation from the book - yet I do miss Richard Harris and hope Michael Eamon can keep up (although he seems to be closer to the book's version of Dumbledore)!Having said that I still felt something was missing but the flights of Buckbeak the Hippogriff were magnificent!I do trust the author and producers do not dump the actors who made Harry, Hermione and Ron live almost as good as the book and they should pay heed to the BBC's online poll where out of 82,000 people surveyed globally only 6,000 felt there was need for change - the other 76k swore they'd stop watching the series or read the books thereafter!If you never read the books then this is perfect for you and carry the whole family... but remember as Harry gets older things get darker and creepier and less child-like!

The Butterfly Effect," Time Is Not Enough (Beware: Spoiler-ish)
","Hate a childhood bully? Imagine being able to travel back and stop him from ever hurting anyone... Only to learn you caused the early death of one of your parents?This may be an oversimplification but the film examines the mutually dependent realities of situations and upbringing... Juxtaposed with cause and effect!For a young man, Ashton Kutcher - of 'That 70's Show' fame and beau of more mature Demi Moore - is showing a depth and profoundness that no one suspected by underlining such an ambitious project.Equally reminiscent of another time-travel story - the book 'Replay' by a former journalist - this picture shows life is not a video cassette you can splice and edit just so...",10,1,3,18 May 2004
Batman Begins," An ex-American Psycho's Fiery Reign creates a new Equilibrium!
","This is how Batman SHOULD have been portrayed all along, the only one to get close was Michael Keaton, but then it started to get off kilter in 'Batman Returns;' from off-kilter to Kilmer and it started to regain momentum, but then there was a period I think blotted out? Someone related to jazz-singer Rosemary Clooney? I think my therapist told me to leave that part of my past severely alone... LOL!Christian Bale indeed has a baleful glare that he perfected in 'American Psycho' went on to sharpen in 'Reign Of Fire' with Matthew MacConaughey as the mad Kentuckian with an axe to grind - but his epitaph was nearly 'Equilibrium' where he was the Matrix' Neo on steroids! As Bruce, the wealthy wimp who pretended to be a tough-guy for when his parents'murderer was in court to the brutalising enforcer in Tibet who was arrested to protect the village's tough-guys, Christian played each aspect to a crisp perfection...Liam Neeson as Ducard, Ra's Al Ghul's viceroy in the ninja clan, was still a bit Qui Gon-JinnESQUE but as one who had slipped into the dark side without being aware of it, and like Anakin Skywalker ... Ducard did it for love.I hope and yet know this is not the last of Ken Watanabe, the real star of 'The Last Samurai,' as the head of the insidious clan, we need to learn about his Lazarus Pit where he can return to life again and again that was barely hinted at... Where's Ubu his henchman and Thalia his reluctant daughter that loves the Bat?? Room for more! I want the new Bat-Mobile, oh wow, a Hummer on steroids! Lean forward steering, so cool!! The Scarecrow was too lightly dealt with and was unappreciated for that reason for the most part, although perhaps Mr. Bean/Rowan Atkinson would've been a better Jonathan Crane.I hope they keep this winning team with Gary Oldman as James Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, as for Sir Michael Caine as Alfred, they obviously researched and learned the original butler really was an East-Ender, Magnificent!!",9,0,0,7 August 2005
Ghost Rider," Nicholas Cage should go to Hell: Marvel does soul-less film
","First off? The film gets a six, but Cage - who named himself after Marvel character 'Luke Cage: Hero For Hire' - really only deserves a four for his appalling Elvis imitations as Johnny Blaze, who was blond: BTW! Next? Any Marvel fans who were looking for those Mike {Will Eisner-trained} Ploog-like cinematography and hoping to see the transition of Johnny Blaze's Faustian quest where he never really competed against his father (he wouldn't have sold his soul if he did not LOVE him, right?), then forget it, stop right here! Don't even bother reading the rest of this review - it's painful...All I can say is, I am glad a friend paid for me to go - if I lost money on this dreck, then somebody's head would have to roll, or maybe I would start claiming souls myself...Even in the X-Men trilogy, while it differed from the comics there was enough familiarity to draw readers along and enough excitement and drama to accept it as an alternate universe... Here? There was no such sexiness, not even Eva Mendes - who left me cold! As for Donal Logue, all he does is die in Marvel films, it's getting tired now! There was no Jesus-like character (as in the comic-book version) who showed Johnny how to seek redemption, it was not Mephistopheles (the Silver Surfer's true adversary) but Satan himself who trapped Johnny into co-existing with the demon Zarathos.In the picture, Blaze is given Spawn-like powers; finite changes and a chain that extends or shortens on command and acts as a conduit for his Hellfire. In the comic, Hellfire just made you suffer, there was no Vision of Penance! Yes, there was a Ghost Rider in the days of the West, but he dressed in white and was not a bounty-hunter for Satan; there is no perpetual line of Ghost Riders in the same way Todd MacFarlane's (Hell-)Spawn has had generations before and after the current black hero...I love Sam Elliott wherever he appears, but sadly his cameo here was wasted, I hope the money was good! As for Mephistopheles - the idea he had four rebellious sons was intriguing, but lasted too short and they were too easily vanquished, here was a marketing ploy gone to Hell... This could have made for at least two sequels if executed properly! The movie it seems, was just a way to test th extent of Marvel's team to use CGI, hope they can use it further to erase this movie and create a telescope to look for their souls - as this pic surely had none to sell or buy! I hope this film is cast to the inky depths of Tartarus or Elysium, where it belongs! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com/",Null,0,2,23 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Oh My Stars & Garters: An alternate Universe?
","Scott Summers? Charles Xavier?? What has Marvel come to in doing such murder??? DC is not that big a threat movie-wise yet...Comics-wise, DC is making big strides, but on the silver screen, Marvel still pops claws! This film is supposed to tie all three together, yet there were two intimations that the big boys of Mutantdom will host an X4... Both clues were at the end of the movie - Charles' spirit seems to be literally living on and Magneto appears to be taking extra doses of One-A-Day With Iron, LOL! If I picked at the non-comic elements of this movie, I would take as much time as the Original and Uncanny X-Men took to develop! Original X-Men were about late 60's and the Uncanny mutant heroes were from the mid-70's...The scenes with Logan and Hank McCoy were too short and too tame, they never really cut loose - but it was funny when Logan asked Hank why fight if he's a diplomat and Hank was seeking to retort with a spiffy salvo and lost it in the midst of punctuating himself with a bite, kick or cuff! The Angel is also another reason X4 cannot be far behind as he was here too short, and no redux of Nightcrawler? Bamf!!! Storm was played up better here and I was still shocked at how Cyclops was made dust by Jean, it was as if she was a neo-Proteous (son of Moira MacTaggart, he was one sick and powerful puppy in the comics, oops! I did it again...)??The Morlocks that Callisto (white in the comics and black in the film, aw shaddup already) was in charge of was sidelined and Madrox The Multiple Man was villainised when he really started as a Hero...But, as difficult as it was, if you treat the tale as a great sci-fi allegory against discrimination in any form and it had very well-executed SFX then you did get quite a bit of bang for the buck - if you read the comics like me? Take along a salt shaker, but if you are new? 'Snikt!' those adamantiums and get ready for a fastball special!",8,0,2,24 May 2006

The Incredibles," Shrek Meets A Lite Version of 'Kingdom Come'
","Unlike DC's futuristic graphic novel series 'Kingdom Come' which implied the children of heroes and villains unleashed Armageddon, or even Marvel's 'Earth X' which had similar results by the heroes own doing, the premise of 'The Incredibles' is that the very people they sought to help were ungrateful jerks - When a suicidal jumper sues for the right to die! This one act leads to an avalanche of suits against numerous heroes and eventually their forced integration into Society As We Know It...Thoreau spoke of men who lead lives of quiet desperation, little realising how apt it was for Bob Parr, the ex-Mr. Incredible (very well characterised by Craig T. Nelson, whose history as an ex-football jock turned coach as well as a Commissioner of Police groomed him well for this vocal role - BTW: Ironic that Michael Chiklis... also a former Commissioner... plays a superhero too, The Thing of the Fantastic Four from which this movie under review pays tribute to), now forced to be a Claims Adjuster for an insurance company with an appropriately blood-sucking little leech for a boss...However, Bob chose not to let the song die in his heart unsung and live to fight another day! At first, it was very quietly, using the company's own intricacies against it, and then finally he chose the Johnny Paycheck route, and boy - he did so in Spades! As Bob, not Mr. Incredible, he goes 'bowling' on Wednesdays with his buddy the ex-Frozone (equally superb casting with Samuel L. Jackson - who gave the movie's best quote: 'Woman, where the hell is my Super Suit?'), but what they're really doing is listening to Police Scanners for minor crimes they can help 'solve' with their 'incredulous' abilities - an ultimate way of 'chilling' with a buddy! Bob's son, Dash - short for Dashiell, like the man Hammett... an old private eye who was a real hero and and author - almost stole the show as the little Super who was not ashamed of his ability, and it's very obvious Bob is proud of his son. His sister Violet for most of the movie looked a bit like the Grudge...One question remains begging is if Syndrome would still exist if Bob took Buddy under his wing, or maybe Buddy would be so much hamburger due to severe grandstanding? Perhaps that can be explored in future instalments? Their powers were Fantastic Four-ish (especially the creature who was obviously a take-off on 'Mole Man' at the end). But the music amazingly was like James Bond, and yet it fit in well with the film, I hope they stay that way! This movie is good... but for the sequel? I think there should be an origin of ElastiGirl, Bob and Frozone and hopefully an expansion of Jack-Jack's abilities! Also I want to see more of Bomb Voyage, the idea of a French Joker looks rather intriguing!! Pixar did well, I hope they successfully break away from Disney altogether and do their own thing, they seem to need little impetus to do well on their own! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",9,1,2,6 February 2005
Stardust," Stardust - where few things are as they seem...
","I am still stunned at the magnificence and the effort put into what appears to be a clever transposition of 'Ella Enchanted' and 'The Golden Compass'! The old man who guarded Stormhold from England is a lot more spry than he looks! For me what appears to be relatively unknowns as the young romantic leads and established 'Hollywood Royalty' in the roles of Mentor and Villainess! I read the FAQ and I am glad I saw the movie first, I doubt the book would have caught my spirit as easily as the film - despite the fact I think Neil Gaiman is a talented author.I love the plot twists along the way, but my favourite was Captain Shakespeare, who - although not in the book, nevertheless seemed a member of the Neil Gaiman universe. The ship catching lightning was splendid! Victoria got justice in the end when the rival revealed his true colours! Michelle Pfeiffer's part was very insidiously macabre and reminiscent of Anjelica Huston's role in 'Witches' based on Roald Dahl's novel.Charlie Cox and Claire Danes have interesting careers ahead of them,I hope they get far!",8,3,4,5 August 2008
Hero," Rashomon as History Lesson? Mild Spoilers
","Color coded versions of what seems to be the truth, and each layer as another aspect of an onion that makes you nearly weep at its simple beauty, fantastic effects and fight scenes interwoven with philosophy and love in all of its forms... Jet Li as the Nameless was magnificent in his native tongue, people complained of it in English Sub-Titles but for once it was good to hear everyone in their own voices!Sky was the most powerful 'villain' as in when he bent the swords of the palace guards and fought/danced psychically with Jet Li to the tune of the blind musician! Broken Sword seemed the most brutal yet was actually the most intellectual and Flying Snow his ex-lover was the one who remained locked in her passions in and out of bed...The Emperor too was good in his own way, like Broken Sword he appeared to be a dictator until he spoke of unifying even the written language of what was to be China (BTW: a quick e.g. 'ma' has five meanings... Rope, horse, shrimp, mother and placing oneself in a fighting stance - especially in Oriental chess that is called 'go' in Japan)!This was a fascinating study of what is truth, and also the complications of unifying a whole kingdom - for a long time Chung Kuo / Middle Kingdom was China's nickname (I used to confuse it with Tolkien's Middle Earth), but I never knew about 'Our Land' until now...Fly, skip running, to see this masterpiece that must've inspired 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'!!",10,0,0,17 October 2004
Shrek the Third," Third Time is nearly Charming's - but Shrek returns the King!
","I have a direct connection to the movie, I had the privilege of interviewing John Cleese in late December 2004, he had just completed his part for the movie and was resting here in Barbados! Obviously, the digital animation takes longer than the voicing for the project! It is so sad therefore to see what a small role he played in Shrek The Third, but it was hilarious for a prolonged death scene - only Dreamworks can pull that off and make you smirk! This movie finds Shrek having the duties of royalty foisted on him, when all he wants to do is be in his swamp with Fiona - yet even if he heads back there, he finds another surprise... Fatherhood! On an aside to the real world and not part of Cinema yet related - why do those who don't want kids have them out of their ears and those who want a brood have to wait so long? If Puss Y-Boots is not careful, he'll be a daddy too many times over! Loved his farewell scene with all of the female cats, what a viejo salsito Tomas or saucy old tom; 'You I do not know, but would not mind to get to know' Donkey is easily a very happy dad with five fire-breathing baby-burros! So the trio go and look for Arthur, the replacement for Shrek as King... This character is voiced by Justin Timberlake (ironic, as he is the 'ex' of Fiona's voice, Cameron Diaz) and it seems he is a dorky teen! The Worcestershire College he attends (pronounced 'Wuss-ter' BTW) is a mix between Beverley Hills 90210 and Gilmore Girls, Shrek thought Lancelot as the handsome successful knight was the dude he's looking for - but unfortunately, Arthur just finished playing a quintain, or jousting dummy, for the same Lancelot! At first Artie, as he likes to be called, looks at Kingship as giving orders and being pampered until Donkey inadvertently reveals the true responsibility of ruling a land.It takes his former teacher Mr Merlin to try and get him to realise his true calling and even what Shrek must acknowledge as being a parent! Meanwhile, Charming - as sneaky a cad as ever thanks to Rupert Everett - is plotting with the more modern fairy tale characters to pull a coup on Far Far Away. Hook from James Barrie plus the Grimm Brothers' Rumpelstiltskin and the talking trees which feature in many tales...This I hope is a portent that other genres can be explored like Anansi from the Caribbean (A telephone operator or pizza-baker?) or Paul Bunyan from the US (Reduced to replacing lightbulbs in streetlamps?) or even the steeplejack from Britain (Is he a portable chimney weep?)! This means there can be at least another two Shrek pics if you include Fiona's pregnancy! Eventually after being nearly jailed thanks to Rapunzel, Fiona with the other Fairy Tale Sistas (Snow White, Cinderella, Fiona's Mom the Queen as delivered by Dame Julie Andrews plus Sleeping Beauty) battle the Palace Guards! Snow White via song controls animals; Cinderella knocks the spit out of guards with her glass slippers but the classic is Sleeping Beauty who literally FALLS asleep and knocks henchmen out like ninepins! Does Shrek get back in time? Does Artie accept that with Great Power Comes Great Responsibility? What about Fiona? Is it a boy or girl or both? Here's a silly hint - remember the digital animated feature's title...",8,0,1,28 May 2007
The Illusionist," Ed Norton makes your breath disappear!
","The photography and even the cinematography of this fine thrilling epic reminded me of the 'Age Of Innocence,' and I see Dick Pope is familiar with Turn of The Century plots as he also did the film version of 'Nicholas Nickleby' back in '02! I see this magickal mirage as a potential Oscar contender even if for Costume and Cinematography but also Paul Giamatti should be given the nod in Best Supporting Actor as the tortured Chief Inspector Uhl - does he do the right thing and become totally corrupt or does he allay his soul and forever seal his humble beginnings? His other ignored work was with Arnold McCullers in Duets, but when he was acknowledged for Sideways? Somebody definitely passed the bong around too many times! Ed Norton was despicable as the villain of The Italian Job, he has fought Robin Williams in 'Death To Smoochy,' and has worked with Spike Lee in a role nobody expected him to take on but now he reaches up his sleeve and pulls a new trick in his role cards! His character's deft weaving of an ethereal tapestry against the poor typecast Rufus Sewell again as another villain, this time as Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (he also sneered in - Knight's Tale; Bless The Child & The Legend Of Zorro - if Rufus played a hero, his performances have obliterated it from most folks' heads)! Jessica Biel as the duchess who dared to love 'beneath' herself, is a far cry from the action gal with the laser-bow in 'Blade: Trinity'...The plot itself was a view on many things - the timelessness of true love; how love sees no class/color/religion; what really is truth? How life and death can be intertwined and made to exchange places if only for a pulse...Also? The importance of planning and how you never think you can outsmart a magician, it was rather like the British TV series 'Hustle' in terms of the deftness of sewing up the threads of the fine plot and movie - time to disappear! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com",10,1,2,8 January 2007
Shrek 2," Better Than The First!
","What a delight, despite numerous flatulence jokes (which I loved), it got a 'G' rating (ol' Jack Valenti lightening up?)!They poked fun at everything including Lord Of The Rings, Disney (more than once) and From Here To Eternity...However, it was Puss 'Y' Boots who definitely stole the show (I am still driving my family mad imitating the dialogue and accent), with Antonio Banderas' marvelous performance by dissing Donkey without his even realising and his sending of a famous Garfield aphorism, I cannot wait for 3 and 4, which are already being prepped I hear! (Is a Baby Shrek next? And what about Ye Olde Fairy Godmother, is she really gone? How did she start, was she really nasty from the beginning or did Power Corrupt as said by Lord Acton...)In fact, I think that Banderas should get an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Voice-over!The animation in this sequel was better than the first like Prince Charming's hair in the beginning or the furniture's details and the raindrops when Shrek thought all was lost...Even the soundtrack was marvelous, there wasn't a single song that sucked! It's rare indeed when a follow-up exceeds the origin, but Shrek 2 is right there with the best of the best!",10,1,2,1 June 2004

They could be father and son, and th fact both are from the British Isles playing true homespun Americans was awesome!Having experienced challenges with my own father, I saw the true echoes of such paternal guerilla warfare - the film was true to life in that there was no real resolution except that the son finally realises he's more similar to his dad than he is truly aware of...A great picture for a father to watch with his son(s) whether or not they quarrel! Who cares if the tales are tall or not? It sounds a lot better that way, eh? Life's like that until you add the spice...",Null,0,0,30 April 2004
The Dark Knight," Swan Song of Heath Ledger - Dark Clown could teach Pennywise new jokes
","How can you fight an evil that is purely psychotic for sheer randomness? This film could easily be a commentary on USA's War Against Terror, and how the hunters are not so different from the prey...If it was not said Heath Ledger was playing the Joker in all of his satanic glory then I would not have known who it was at all! The man finds the nastiest way to make sure he has no dividends to share for a successful heist and makes the robbery look like part of an innocent field trip; he uses a pencil in ways most of us would never even dream of in our wildest nightmares...Two new catchphrases have now evolved from the Joker - 'Why So Serious?' and 'Let's put a smile on that face!' How can you catch a man like that? Fetch another man who knows no boundaries nor jurisdictions, has immense funds to source his projects, his conscience is so passionate he appears cruel yet he wants to save lives - Batman, the avenging hero who walks in shadow, the Dark Knight! Christian Bale as the vigilante saviour who seeks to right the Joker's wrongs is an excellent reflection of how too far right is left in the War Against Terror. I feel for his voice when he grated it as Batman and used a normal register as Bruce Wayne.Seeing Aaron Eckhart play a Two-Face who did not care for his looks was a refreshing change for once, I did like that departure from the comics. Having him play a character that was an unmasked version of the Bat is rather intriguing, pity more could not have been played off of that aspect. I was annoyed that they chose in the end to kill off Two-Face/Harvey Dent, apart from the fact he did not die in the comics, he was also a thorn in Batman's conscience as the Dark Knight felt responsible for Harvey's recreation into the coin-flipping redresser of injustices via corruption.Gordon's rise to Commissioner was understandable yet a bit rapid, Gary Oldman playing a man far younger than he really is shows his talent for acting.Well-choreographed acting from a talented ensemble cast, near seamless directing from Christopher Nolan, the film is a bit long (nearly 3 hours) yet very much worth it - hard to believe they had even more planned for the late Heath ledger in this same flick... His replacement has a deep dark clown-nose to refill, if possible. In fact, can there be any more without him?",10,7,15,26 August 2008
Taken," Life of Bryan - Neeson as Eastwood in Luc Besson tale of Albanian Human Trafficking
","Luc Besson, magnifique, what can I say, hein? He wrote Fifth Element with Bruce Willis set in the far future and then he also did The Messenger with Mila Jovovich set in the past looking at Joan Of Arc; this time Luc handles Human Trafficking and removing certain stereotypes some may have of Liam Neeson, of 'Love Actually' and the first 'Darkman' film.Neeson is Bryan, a former CIA operative who so loved his daughter he went AWOL for her b'day showed his devotion to her despite being punished with an Antarctic assignment.He chooses retirement in order to be near Kim, his daughter for her b'day despite her Mother resisting Bryan's attention. This aloofness no doubt is to prove her devotion for the new rich husband in her gold-digging life played to scintillation by ex-'X-Men' Famke Jenssen.When Kim wished to go to Paris, Bryan's old war-horse alarms tingled and he ignored them at the pressure of his former spouse to show his daughter he was not uptight, big mistake! Luckily, Bryan made sure Kim carried a roaming mobile which was essential when she got abducted by Albanian smugglers - all he had was the MP3 of their voices and he kept replaying to learn their voices and other clues.Neeson's calmness yet underscored with a leonine ferocity far blew away any previous notions of his playing a college professor type! The technology used in the film to track down the abductors was amazing, a perfect counterpoint to the 'Interrogation Methods' used by Bryan on Marko, the Albanian ringleader in human trafficking...Two knitting needles, jumper cables and house current - oh yes! A gag too, brrrr! This is definitely a story to make you think twice about letting your kids go gallivanting off by themselves since much of this new/old crime - also called 'White Slavery' has been happening for decades! Make sure teens do not blather all their travel details to complete strangers, OK?",9,7,11,17 October 2008
National Treasure," Bruckheimer Does It Again, is he a Mason or Illuminati though?
","This movie is a massive suspenseful roller coaster that hearkens to a lot of Masonic intrigue - they imply there's a clue to a treasure hidden from evil prying eyes...Nicholas Cage is the altruistic would-be discoverer and Sean Bean is the questionable fellow who bankrolled Cage's quest, and now wants to unearth it for base reasons of commerce rather than nobility...Cage gets forced into stealing the Declaration Of Independence which seems to be the Map for this treasure that was formed from the booty of Alexander The Great, as well as the Knights Templar in addition to what was looted by Napoleon in Egypt and all of that was left under the care of the Masons (Illuminati? But then they were never mentioned in the whole flick)! Jon Voight as Cage's dad and Christopher Plummer as his grandfather were well-cast! Harvey Keitel as the cop who is an unexpected ally was also well thought out, especially if one understands The Brotherhood very well - be you Illuminated or Masonic...The movie is nothing but a pure chase and is reminiscent of the Amazing Race, while the method of stealing the map is very CSI-like, this is money well spent at the cinema! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",8,0,0,6 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," 'Goblet of Fire' out of Fuel early!
","I was very disappointed with the latest installment of Harry Potter! This was a longer book, but if you can have 3 hour epics from Kevin Costner and Peter Jackson, then here should be no different!In the beginning of the movie, they made it seem as though the Quidditch World Cup never happened! Not true! The match was Bulgaria versus Ireland, George & Fred correctly bet that Ireland made the points yet Bulgaria would pull the Snitch - that was part of the seed-money for their pranks-shop...Madame Maxim in the book never plucked anything from Hagrid's beard (which was gross as it was), in fact, she got offended when he was implying she was a fellow giant! Because there is still discrimination against Giants to this day in their world! Where was Hermione's movement to free house-elves? And Dobby? The freed house-elf? This was Rowling's look at racism and unions... Ron was offended at Harry being in the Tri-Wizard as an excuse for being angry that his family were perpetually 'poor,' while Harry inherited fabulous wealth that he just gives everywhere! That's because Harry couldn't care less for the money - he learned to do with less, having been raised so poorly by the Dursleys! Voldemort in returning to Earth was not a noseless semi-serpent/earthworm, he may have been hairless but that was as far as it went! Poor Ralph Fiennes, what a come-down!!Also, when Harry won the Tri-Wizard tournament, he thought of the prize fee as blood-money and gave it all to Fred & George who pooled with their Quidditch money to start their own shop for jokes and pranks.... I was very much let down in a serious way! Heaven help us with #5, will Lucius Malfoy be a hero? Ugh!! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",6,1,1,27 December 2005

The special effects to have 'watches' embedded as a dermal implant was very telling throughout the duration...You never really think of Time until it is no longer available as a useful commodity for one's self, like how I always felt I'd resolve my differences with my father but he died before I could truly patch things up.When the movie took old clichés and brought them to Life in this new context, it was a stark wake up call; 'DON'T WASTE MY TIME' or 'THAT KIND OF TIME CAN GET YOU KILLED' or the fact everyone is punctual, did you see anyone willingly 'Kill Time'?The revolution (a la 'Equilibrium') started when Will lost his mother, played by the beautiful Olivia Wilde and having received a gift of extra time - he decides to see how the Rich live in New Greenwich (GMT, eh?) and plays for time (literally) in Poker.The man he beats, he eventually seizes his daughter (AMANDA SEYFRIED) as hostage and one of the fastest cases of Stockholm Syndrome evolves before your very eyes - but then cinema can warp time...Chasing them like a relentless Valjean of 'Les Miserables' is another veteran Chrononaut, hailing from 'Inception' which looks at time elapsing in dreams, is Cillian Murphy as part of the Law Enforcement as what else? A Timekeeper!While not rich like New Greenwich, nevertheless by keeping the system as is the Timekeeper can live as long as the Rich do, fifty 25-year cycles and more - eventually this method of sustaining his duration will save Timberlake's and Seyfried's characters.The acting and the sub-plots are intricately meshed, so while using many tried and tested themes, nevertheless the mixture creates a new perspective which makes you truly sit back and think!Decades ago, the poet Shelley considered time in a poem giving tribute to a wind-worn statue dissolving slowly in the desert... It is equally appropriate here;-'I met a traveler from an antique land/ Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone/ Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,/ Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,/ And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,/ Tell that its sculptor well those passions read/ Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,/ The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;/ And on the pedestal these words appear:/ 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:/ Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'/ Nothing beside remains. Round the decay/ Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare/ The lone and level sands stretch far away.'",8,6,9,11 January 2012
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Rosy Lies In a Crown Affair...
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a little bit of the remake of 'The Thomas Crown Affair' with Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo; along with a piece of 'War Of The Roses' with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas; as well as a bit of 'True Lies' with Governor Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Charlton Heston, Art Malik and Tom Arnold.The 'Thomas Crown...' part is where the duo are filmed visiting a marriage counsellor, and it reminded me of the psych parts when Pierce Brosnan was visiting Faye Dunaway (Dunaway was the Russo role in the original with Steve McQueen).'True Lies' fit in with how they made puns on their kills and not letting each other know what they really up to - like Brad Pitt's pun when he bumped off an Irish Terrorist whose nickname is 'Lucky' and he was asked by Jolie how was work and he truthfully said, 'I got Lucky' (groans) - 'True Lies' also fit in that neither had a clue what the other was about... Unlike that flick though, when Jolie found out, she not upset at what he did but that he didn't trust her enough to tell her! Which means that although her character claimed she didn't love him - you know she was just lying to herself...Of course, 'War Of The Roses' fit in when they were on full assault mode with each other and a special remix of 'Express Yourself' from Charles Wright emphasised their fight scene  those clashes were awesome, with spittoons as weapons plus real cuffs and kicks! Meanwhile, there was 'Love Stinks' from the J. Geils Band, as well as 'Tainted Love' from Soft Cell with Marc Almond on lead vocals, and The Voodoo Glow Skulls' 'I Used To Love Her (But I Had To Kill Her)' among quite a few others to show the nemesis of affection.Yet Air Supply's 'Making Love (Out Of Nothing At All)' (which Brad/John Smith sang along to, and not too badly either) plus a remake of Bob Dylan's 'Lay Lady Lay' as interpreted by Magnet with Gemma Hayes in addition to Captain and Tennille's perennial handling of Neil Sedaka's 'Love Will Keep Us Together' showed why the smoochy stuff is worth it in the end.How was the rest of the picture, content- and music-wise? Go and debrief it for yourself  if I told you, I'd have to kill you!",9,1,5,12 June 2005
Love Actually," The Ultimate Romantic Comedy: Served in a British Vein (Trying for Unspoiled, cannot guarantee - Actually!)
","Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usually detest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for my part...Rowan was the Angel Of Conscience in the film he helped the son of the just-widowered Liam Neeson's character by pass Customs to pursue true love of a little school-mate who happened to be a fine young Afro-American girl(this was where love did not know Race... Color-Blind), but he did everything to make Alan Rickman as the publisher think twice before he effed up his marriage for a bit of materialistic fluff! (The gift-wrapping sequence in the department store was annoying, hilarious and Bean-esque all at the same time w/o conflicting.. Amazing!!)Bill Nighy as the old rocker who discovered platonic love was marvelous; Hugh Grant (brother of Rickman's wife in the flick) as the goofy good PM who effed up Billy Bob Thornton's 'Bushy' prez was superb and I liked the girl from EastEnders as his love interest, it shows true love knows no class! Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth's attraction to his Portuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspect of love, actually...Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought the white guy had a crush on her husband not her! Ten stories linked in the weirdest ways and showing that love is Universal! As for the tunes, they were sublime and it was weird to see Bill Nighy's send-up really did do well in the UK Xmas charts! The Power of Love, actually!",10,137,205,26 August 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Change The Channel: Spoiler News Network
","A skit that really should've run for 5 minutes - 15 at a push has been S T R E T C H E D to just over an hour & a half, was it worth it? Not particularly! There were gems shining through now and then but for the most part it was a myopic miasma of a caricature of parody of spoof that should have been left in the 'Maybe' file of SNL: Saturday Night Live... There were great cameos by Ben Stiller as a Geraldo-esque character, as well as Tim Robbins but Jack Black as the demented biker who tossed Baxter the dog over the bridge was not a favorite - but how could the plot go forward? I'm sure another way could be found... As for the cartoon/live-action sequence to describe the love-scene between C. Appplegate and Will Ferrell, hey - but, I mean as the fat-but-tells-you-to-get-skinny Dr. Phil says, 'GET REAL!!!'
The best part was about the first 15 minutes, wait? I was right after all!http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",Null,2,3,15 August 2004
Hancock," FUI: Hancock - Flying Under The Influnce, OR; I wish I can recall why I love you?
","Damn, this is a movie you have to watch many times to appreciate in full... At first go, Charlize Theron merely seems like a slut - until you discover her (very lengthy) history later on in the film.She is also literally the perfect woman for Hancock due to his strength and other powers, but rather than see him bashed for appearing like a black man looking for 'Jungle Fever,' she tried to make a new life for herself hoping he could carry on...From humid Sumer in an age before Christ, to the Civil War, to the roaring 20's - he saves her as she is punished for literally having 'Brother'-ly love. She hopes when she walks away he will get the peace he's never known.In abandoning him she creates the modern-day beneficial monstrosity known as 'Hancock,' he feels he is a misbegotten creature when no-one looks for him after recovering from the last attack 80 years ago. When Theron's character sees Will Smith (this from a perspective of a 2nd viewing) it is not lust - exactly - more, it is seeing the hero she knew devolved into an alcoholic meta-human and wondering, 'Why'?? There are some benefits to this version of the immortal invulnerable - when he advises Justin Bateman's son how to handle a bully or even deal with the French bully himself! Justin Bateman as the excellent yet underrated PR exec was a subtle 'fifth business' whose role was key in saving Hancock at the end - but the classic was when he showed Will Smith a YouTube clip of a botched whale rescue and Will's character says he has no recollection, yet Bateman not missing a beat, says 'Greenpeace does'! Of course another highspot is when the convicts mistakenly thought Hancock either refused to use, or even lost, his powers while in jail... But I am trying to understand why they used the theme from 'Sanford & Son' as the punchline for a threat he always made in the picture, but eventually made it real - although it seemed appropriate.Where I saw the plot have a thin spot is that - why did the inmates break out to SHOOT Hancock if they knew he's bullet-proof? The part when Hancock nearly returned to being an alcoholic featured a useful tip of emergency when the Sikh liquor-seller claimed 2 bottles of whiskey cost $91.10 - and then he used his finger to reveal the real clue...But even though he could not remember Theron, he knew there was a bond and his love for her was strong enough to make him let her go for both of their sakes - even though she is the only person capable of withstanding his perpetual horniness (he would kill a regular woman, think about it)! Can this movie do a prequel or sequel? I doubt, maybe a DVD could hold a Director's Cut and patch any plot gaps...",8,1,2,5 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent 9/11 Analysis: Sad but True - The Force *IS* in force!
","The fight scenes were out of this world, whether General Grievous against Obi-Wan or Obi-Wan vs. Anakin or Yoda vs. Sidious/Palpatine... Well-choreographed! It tied up about 90% of the loose ends from Parts 4, 5 and 6! Chewbacca's ancestors and friends plus Threepio and Artoo were all accounted for, hurrah! Poor Anakin Skywalker, the road to Hell is indeed paved with Good Intentions **shakes head in resigned disgust** not wishing anyone a slave like his mother nor death for his beloved Padme Amidala - he himself ends up enslaved and killing those who he honored or trusted and became an enforcer who enslaved millions across star-systems...This is Lucas' best since the original Trio (first listed as 10, 11 and 12 - then when George realised this would take him beyond his own projected death, he shortened it to 4, 5 and 6) of 'Star Wars,' 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return Of The Jedi.' For me, it is in NO way a commentary on Nixon and Vietnam as a warning against the aftermath of 9/11, Bush Jr. with Cheney and Baghdad/Afrghanistan and other underdeveloped oil-producers! Palpatine is an amalgam of 'Dubya' and Cheney, perhaps Mace Windu is an exaggeration of Colin Powell insane with remorse for having supported such money-mad maniacs.. In the end I think Mace went too far, and while Anakin was right, yet he was wrong - he should have let Mace kill Palpatine and bring Mace to justice, rather than wound and stop him from dealing the coup de grace... But I think was annoyed at Mace for denying him right to sit as a Jedi master at the Council table, However, he was afraid Padme would die without his learning the Sith secret of Life Beyond death and so he chose for the utterly craven Chancellor to live**shakes head in resigned disgust again ** Obi-Wan Kenobi to my mind loved Anakin as if he were his own son not a brother, recall how passionately he had vouched for Baby Skywalker when Yoda and Mace had their doubts in 'The Phantom Menace' over training him in the Jedi Way...Yet Anakin although was deeply reverent and loving towards Yoda and Obi-Wan at the start of 'Revenge Of The Sith,' after he incorrectly killed Count Dooku, his path began to shift in definition... Using the phrase, 'Master,' in the first half was a sign of respect and by the end of the pic it was a signal of loss of spirit and will to Palpatine/Darth Sidious - Anakin should've paid attention to the sad allegory of Darth Perilous The Wise; he didn't last but those he loved were saved! Anakin suffered a similar but worse fate, he let unfounded petty jealousy of Obi-Wan with Padme cloud his rage (even if Obi-Wan loved her, he would not have disrespected his Padawan), and in the end he lost her and his children... This in turn took away his desire to overthrow Palpatine/Sidious as he had no reason to conquer worlds untold for what and for whom? Sigh! I never thought I would say this, but poor Darth Vader - he gained a galaxy and paid with his soul, life and love, wow! Perhaps the Bush regime needs to pay attention... There is much to answer for and left unanswered!",9,1,3,21 May 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Downey is smooth - fabric of tapestry weaved in this Baker Street epic is far from Irregular
","Although I have 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' on DVD I have never watched a full Guy Ritchie event until now... I plan to make up for lost time ASAP! I am familiar with his ironic method of sending up a person based on their own foibles - as he did in his BMW feature 'Star' with then spouse Madonna. Clive Owen in that case was the Watson, while Madonna was Holmes on a bad day, or bad decade maybe...The ride was just as brisk in this totally original Sherlock Holmes venture, from when he plotted his pugilistic damage a la CSI or Sherlock/Downey Jr reverse engineering the solution to a felony in a manner reminiscent of the film based on a Philip K. Dick tale,'Paycheck.' There was a massive hue and cry against the production from the beginning, where is his Deerstalker hat? What? No Meerschaum pipe? Those were Basil Rathbone's, dearie, this Sherlock is way closer to what was in the original stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's interpretation of Dr George Bell, the real Sherlock Holmes.When noted Holmes fan club, Baker Street Irregulars - invitation only members, praised the film then this revelation tended to shut up most detractors.Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) as Holmes portrayed all of Holmes' eccentricities to perfection, he's even better here than in Iron Man. While Jude Law as a smart, efficient Dr Watson, the ex-soldier and capable of his own deductions was a marvelous foil to Holmes' self-worship! Mark Strong as the demonic Blackwood was a great villain, he already had his chops blooded in such a capacity as 'Septimus' in the cinematic version of Neil Gaiman's 'Stardust' and he easily could play a member of the Malfoys in Harry Potter! Eddie Marsan shows versatility from an American accented would-be bank robber in 'Hancock' to the Cockney-slurred Inspector Lestrade who obviously had a love-hate admiration for the eternal detective.Rachel McAdams as Sherlock's love-interest is a far cry from her usual sappy flicks such as 'The Time Traveler's Wife' with Eric Bana or in the tear-jerker 'The Notebook' which featured James Garner.Guy Ritchie's direction while at a blistering pace, never left you wondering if you missed anything nor did it speed by so fast you did not feel a part of the ride. Details on details, yet grittiness and sepia tones appeared not only appropriate but to highlight rather than detract from the overall presentation... Is it worth the price of admission? Elementary!",9,4,7,2 January 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," The truth set him free! (Spoilers in solitary confinement)
","Morgan Freeman as Red was truly inspired (even if the original story had a white guy), they even used his son for the photo of the inmate as a young man...Tim Robbins as Andy DuFresne was marvelous understatement, Clancy brown as the on/off guard-friend of Andy was a good touch and a boost for his career apart from Starship Trooper... Now, Clancy is in HBO's 'Carnivale' series and has his own website! As for the warden and 'sisters,'  they were equally well-cast and the plot of the movie flowed despite what fan-sites may or may not nit-pick about.It is a tribute to perseverance and determination combined with patience and retribution couched in careful long-term planning that any true financial head is accustomed to (remember, Andy was a Bank Manager, that knowledge saved him more than once)...Justice sometimes comes from beyond the law if you can wait long enough!

Iron Man," Ironing out the issue of Downey as Hero, the stark reality is? He rocks!
","After nearly a year of self-imposed exile (still think I'm right about Norbit's casting), the Bajan cine-phile is back!The translation from Vietnam of the 60's to Afghanistan in the 21st century is an almost flawless juxtaposition with Stark's character remaining initially a devil-may-care genius and played with sardonic perfection by Robert Downey Jr!Robert actually has a deliberate shift from playboy to hero when he asks Pepper a dangerous favour, he makes a passionate explanation why he needs the favour and you realise the character of Stark is not as Devil-May-Care as before...Casting the guy who put soul into 'Heart & Souls,' or making Ally McBeal far more interesting than the anorexic twerp of Callista Flockhart is top notch move - his real life trials and tribulations make him easy to accommodate Stark's tortured addictions only hinted in for the first chapter... I hope in reality Robert stays clean (For me his only flop was 'The Singing Detective'), us '65-ers have to stick together!Terence Howard's interpretation of James Rhodes -aka- 'Rhodey' is more of a shuck & jive sidekick than was played in the comics, but by the end of the picture, his character was more what we came to know over the years.Aspects of the original Iron Man and the Bob Layton version came through loud & clear as well as the Ultimates Marvel incarnation, it was easy to forgive the lack of 'Happy' Hogan...Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger was actually plotted better than the comics, his presence in the dead-tree version simply as a foil for Tony was sudden as I recall - but here as the virtual 2nd father of Tony made huge sense. Rather than a villain, I think he feels rejected for saving a company from dropping out of the top 5 in the Fortune 500!Yet Tony is guilty from seeing in Kandahar and elsewhere what his weapons artwork has done to disrupt others' lives, rather than perpetuate it and having been at the end of his own medicine - he decides to make amends and thus Iron Man's purpose!The technology displayed such as the mini-guns in his shoulders or the telemetry on glass is magnificent, it can be hilarious when he tried repulsor boots at ten per cent power, instead of using one per cent in the 1st place, LOL!If Stark no longer does weapons, then he will have to be cutting edge in medicine or other similar applications like mobile or laptop technologies, which was hinted by placing a child version of himself near a young Bill Gates. This, despite the use of Apple desktops and laptops throughout the whole film!I hope that Pepper and Tony do NOT get involved, the Moneypenny/Bond frisson is much better for the flow of the project, especially if it goes beyond 2010!The movie has many fantastic one-liners like 'Good Dog,' addressed to Butterfingers, the semi-dopey robot trying to help save Tony's life; or?(Trying to create a miniature Arc Reactor like Tony's pacemaker, Stane hires a battery of scientists and is clearly frustrated when no results are forthcoming...) STANE: What do you mean it's impossible? (Angrily points to huge machine) Stark built a tiny version of this out of scrap metal in a cave, for crying out loud! SCIENTIST: Sir, I am not Tony Stark!The flight sequences in the movie make 'Top Gun' look like 'Top Dud' and have you on the edge of your seat! The movie also does a good job in laying the groundwork for Avengers, Captain America, S*H*I*E*L*D and even interaction with other Marvel Universe people. As always, Stan Lee's cameo was a guffaw-maker - this time compared with Hugh Hefner!This film is not only worth its weight in GOLD but IRON too!",9,1,2,18 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman V Superman? V is for Vapid... Let me count the ways...
","If DC sought to be unlike Marvel in how to do an ensemble view, then they succeeded beyond their wildest nightmares. However, let's look at why and how it failed...They tried cramming 40 years of comics into 20 minutes, this would have been better off as expanded into 3 segments - call them Trinity, but this means Continuity which DC is clearly a stranger to?Lex Luthor - when Gene Hackman played him against Chris Reeve it was as a clown, and to a lesser extent with Kevin Spacey in the semi- worthy Brandon Routh revival. But Jesse Eisenberg as the child of an immigrant? As mentioned in a viral video, he did seem more of The Riddler a la Jim Carrey than Anthony LaPaglia's resolute yet twistedly noble villain in the animated All Star Superman. At no point in the picture did they give flesh to why he hated Bruce Wayne or Kal-El. The reason given at the end for his bald head was inadequate and implied he was about to get the Death Penalty, not just lounge about like Jeffrey Dahmer.In the mid-80s, Elliott S! Maggin wrote 2 profound and ahead of their time treatises on the Kryptonian - the novels 'Man Of Tomorrow' and 'Miracle Monday' where he explored the Lex psychose in massive detail, and it was not just a throwaway point Supes made me lose my hair, in fact, that was the least of it... Luthor was doing a once in a Lifetime experiment to create Life without gametes and zygotes with his DNA as the lynchpin of the the descendant, but Superman destroyed it and Lex could not recreate the experiment and thus his friendship for the Kryptonian translated to enmity.Then there was the Kryptonian ship which housed General Zod, it stated to Eisenberg it was 37% functional and when Lex was about to create Doomsday, the computer at first declined on the basis of the Kryptonian council, even if it knew (at 37% capacity mind you) that this arbiter was now extinct, could it not suggest a logic loop that it cannot break was that contravention of such genetics required a new decision or amendment from the same council - much like archaic Earth Programming a la Windows? Jesse should stick to 'Now You See Me'!How can Superman successfully fly holding a Kryptonite spear? How can he recover from Batman's Kryptonite dust so quickly without using the sun for recovery (clearly borrowed from Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns'), there are too many inconsistencies.Henry Cavill as Superman is competent, the portrayal of Lois Lane was Meh and never said how or why Supes loved her so, Fishburne as Perry White was a typical Editor/Publisher and Gal Godot as Wonder Woman was probably the best thing for for this sorry mess - she fought Doomsday better than Bats or Kal-El.Ben Affleck was better and more Batman as Bruce Wayne than when he wore the bat-suit, his fight to save Martha Kent was brutal and again violated the original comics code of murder, yet when placed in reality can be understood if not ratified... It also ignored Batman's early shunning of firearms precisely for the way his parents died.Luckily I won a ticket via my cell provider, I'd be very annoyed if I wasted my money for this dreck, please wait for Marvel's Civil War which demonstrates the art of plotting, continuity and character depth and motivation in the same time frame as a regular movie - maybe DC should pay Marvel to show them how?",1,6,16,27 March 2016
Casino Royale," Blondes have more fun - the name is Blond, James Blond
","I will state it from the start my two fave Bonds were Timothy Dalton & Sean Connery... The idea of a blond twit as 007? Please! What John Byrne did in comics with Superman in the 1986 series 'Man Of Steel' is what the new crew crafted for this MI6 agent... You have some old and new mixed together to create a delicious mixture of spicy sexiness indeed! Gadgets galore still abound, such as the Sony Ericsson k800i and M600 cellphones that gave 3D floorplans when the new double-Oh was at work. All of the latest Sony Vaio laptops were in gorgeous display enthralling the viewer with all of their potential! Felix Leiter is now 21st centuried into an Afro-American, and stays in form as an ally of Bond. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre Craig's villainous foil with the weeping eye had all the required chill needed for the evil counterpoint for Bond's shadowy virtue.Martin Campbell at al. had to get a newer Bond, those fight scenes could not be handled with or w/o a stuntman by a fella as advanced as Pierce Brosnan, suave as he is...The opening pursuit tableau in Uganda reminded me of those Tony Jaa chase scenes in 'Ong-Bak' and the gritty nastiness that Daniel Craig shifts in and out of like his blessed Aston Martin would not have been well manoeuvred by ye olde Brosnan! Craig's fights were extremely realistic and brutally convincing, and the film was chock-a-block with quips that can' be delivered as they give away numerous scenes... All I'll say is when I hear 'Allow me,' I'll now smirk every time! If I reveal why then I'll breach my handler then I might -- ?

300," Hot Gates? Hot Picture - Gerard Butler, Best New Action Hero; is this subliminal PR for Bush's Surge? Doubt it!
","* SPARTANS! LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!! (shields up and spears to the fore more precise than synchronised swimmers) * PERSIANS, COME AND GET THEM!!! As the 300 would say, Haaa-OOooh! This is a man-film, OK? From start to finish, women? Do not feel neglected, you have all of your stuff, it's just that it was about time they remembered there are GUYS out here...300 is a pure testosterone rush from beginning to end - when the film is over you feel like hunting something down with your bare hands for the hell of it.I understand Iranian-Americans are protesting the portrayal of themselves in the film; if it is for the dress used in the flick then that is fine but if for the deed? That is recorded historical fact! As for the Persian attire, I must admit I was taken off-guard... It was my only knock against the film - in reality, Persians almost looked like groomed Rastafarians in that day and age, their beards were tightly rolled and oiled in rows! Other than that this movie tends to follow the history of Thermopylae or the Hot Gates very closely and is relatively true - even down to selecting babies and educating Spartan women! The last was important as they wanted to ensure they gave birth to strong and smart children, their life was pure war - men were not allowed to farm or handle money... There were slaves or helots for that purpose! This film has many memorable quotes - 'THEN WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT IN THE SHADE' when told Persian arrows would blot out the sun, as for the photography and cinematography - this is very true to the spirit and style of Frank Miller's illustration technique's... He is the man who redefined Daredevil in the 80's, not the wuss that Ben Affleck loused up recently! The actors were well-cast, many of them for me are unfamiliar, but while I do not know Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes? I could tell his voice was altered and I did not agree with this - if his character was like an original historical Persian then I could understand the deepening of his voice; otherwise, Xerxes looked a bit drag-queen kind of gay...Was the picture a subtle push for Bush's surge in Iraq? I doubt it, even with the Marine like 'HAAaa-OOooh!' cry from the 300, since essentially this is backfiring in emphasising the exact reverse of Bush's view and what is happening.In other words it is Bush who is Xerxes, and Muqtada Al-Sadr who is like Leonidas - Bush is the invader with the multi-national horde who is encroaching on the small Najaf... So how can this picture relate to such Hawkish policies? Nah, this is just a guy-flick... Women if you wanna make your man feel like Tarzan for a few days and he will kill or die to do anything for you in that period? RUN and drag him to 300!

Fantastic Four," Retelling recaptures glory days of Kirby & Lee...
","Although this is based on the Marvel Universe re-telling for 'Generation 'X-ers'' this was a great rollicking ride from start to finish, with few bubbles in the paintwork, yet also recalled the days of Joltin' Joe Sinott working with Jack and Stan.Hornblower... Lancelot... Lukas Gold... The Gathering... Man And Boy... Black Hawk Down... Now? Reed Richards the leader in the sci-fi superhero series 'Fantastic 4' - for someone who is barely over 30 and from Wales, Ioan Gruffudd is more of a Thursday's child and has truly went farther than expected, Bravo! Especially as I expected a pile of un-named matter from the Negative Zone to have more personality! I still thought of a young Robert Foxworth in that role.I have to admit, while I respected Jessica Alba's work in 'Dark Angel,' to hear her as Sue Storm and playing a romantic comedy with Ioan... I was DREADING this picture even more so than the 1994 fiasco which I am yet to see, I was so GLAAAAD to be proved wrong! Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/Thing? This is Roast Beef & Yorkshire Pudding or Spaghetti + Meatballs or hand-in-glove, they were made for each other! As for turning Alicia Masters into a fine black lady, it was a masterful touch especially to see the look on Ben's face when she felt/saw him for the first time - so who will be daddy Puppet Master? Geoffrey Holder or perhaps Laurence Fishburne??As for Chris Evans, he is most definitively the quintessential Johnny Storm! And his quarrels with Ben were true to the original series...Stan Lee as mailman Willie Lumpkin was hilarious, but Doom needs more work on the arrogance but using Balthazaar the demon from Charmed was effective nevertheless! Look forward to round two, Annihilus? Puppet Master?? Doom redux??? The Wedding that nearly never was? Wow!",8,6,9,7 August 2005
Click," FFWD - No Pause nor RWD???
","Having read both Mallory's 'La Morte D'Arthur' and Terry Pratchett's 'Mort,' I had a pretty good idea who Christopher Walken was playing in Adam Sandler's latest picture, especially as he kept repeating to Adam call him 'Morty'! The way I understand the movie is that time can either hold still momentarily or go forward, rewind is merely review... But if this were a true Universal Remote, would it not have an 'Edit' button and RWD would have some extra punch? If a project could take months, then freeze your surroundings and complete the task and let time resume its regular pace? I guess I am presupposing what I should if I were blessed/cursed to have such a device...The initial stages of the film were Sandler's usual send-up slapstickery - what with how he dealt with his handsome yet idiotic and self-centred David Hassellhoff, and there was the ubiquitous Mutual Appearance Sociuety cameo from Rob Schneider as the Arabian prince Habibu with the ridiculous nose (this is the same as Sandler does when Schneider does a pic too)! Speeding up the dog and an argument, plus waiting for the shower was hilarious - but re-emphasising the value of both time and the importance of minutiae in one's existence was a bit overdone and schmaltzy to say the least... But it gives Adam a chance to look a bit like 'The Wedding Singer' again, eh?http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",7,1,3,16 July 2006
Happy Feet," Elvis Presley doing Kiss? Wow!
","Like 'Thank You For Smoking', this film is taking your limitation and making it boundless but set to penguins of all creatures - Mambo/Mumble (Elijah 'Lord Of The Rings/Frodo' Wood) was born without a singing gene and instead has a superb sense of dance comparable to Fred Astaire, Gregory Hinds or Michael Jackson (actually - it was Savion Glover's happy feet)!His 'disability' is due to his father, Memphis - an Elvis devotee as interpreted by Hugh Jackman, having dropped him as an egg while waiting for his wife Norma Jean as done by Nicole Kidman.Robin Williams had the honour of performing two parts in the same film, a crazy Latino Puffin-like Ramon as well as the Barry White/Rev. Al Sharpton-ish Lovelace (the other kind of penguin with a Don King hairdo) a self-styled guru rather like Oz/Magus from Frank L. Baum's original childhood classic.When you look at it carefully, this flick is filled with Aussies - Hugh Jackman; Hugo Weaving as the old fuddy-duddy Noah The Elder; Nicole Kidman and the late Steve Irwin as one of the sea elephants.While I am not sure if this is a true spoiler - I am curious when humans eventually do appear in the film, are they real as in live-action or simulated digital animation?For me, the purpose of the picture is to uphold the tenet of 'Vive La Difference' in that change is the one guarantee of Life, and eventually even old Noah The Elder must accept that new strange ways can sometimes save lives, rather than holding fast to an old method which may drag one into a slow extinction!Mambo/Mumble's father accepts that and actually dances while singing Prince's 'Kiss' as interpreted by Tom Jones - and truth be known? When Hugh Jack man did the Prince Classic as if he was Elvis, it made me sad the King was not around, because Elvis doing 'Kiss' would've been some seriously hot stuff!I loved this picture for the dance, songs and singing - I just can't wait to shuffle to the nearest store for a copy of the soundtrack!",8,0,0,30 January 2007
Donnie Darko," Jake Gyllenhaal and the sepulchral coney [Spoilers for the uninitiated]
","Saw 'Donnie Darko' at 12:am this morning, for me quite frankly - have no idea what the big hue and cry is over with this purported cult classic... It is vaguely reminiscent of Philip K Dick, but that's about all!It is trying real hard to simultaneously justify what is sanity, the virtue of justice vs. sacrifice and what do you do to achieve nobility - kill one or many?Jake as Donald is suitable nevertheless, he has the right parts of victim, psycho and hero - I thought that the film should have attempted to justify his questionable sanity a lot more and only went part of the way by destroying Swayze's home to reveal his charcter's secret pervitude.Should Donnie have lived? Thus killing his girlfriend, or in her living allowing the sublime - yet slime - Cunningham prevail? Where did dead Frank come from, what was his inspiration? How did the engine from The Future (interestingly off his Mother's return plane) get there? Did the second Oct. 2 hold Judgment for those who lived 28 days 6 hours and 42 minutes hence?? Use of 'the end ' held interesting connotation, Donnie was not sure nor viewer that it was for whole world, but it was narrowcasted down to Don as a singularity - does the writer see death of an individual as end of All, therefore is write potential Atheist? This is not a picture to watch while tanked up on Maui Wowie!More importantly, why did Drew Barrymore seek to pricetag this project??Just an interesting anachronism.... I heard in the picture the use of 'Duh!' as a rhetortical response, it was set in 1988??? Duh! That phrase in that particular context was not in vogue 'til circa 1994? DuH!",4,1,3,14 May 2004
Dodgeball," Real Cojones! Mild Spoilers...
","This was a film so stupid you just had to laugh! I laughed at the ex-fatboy vanity of Ben Stiller, the near-queer experiences he had for his own personal trainer and his obsession of rubbing pizza on his crotch, euughh! Pete La Fleur/Vince (hero in this one, villain in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) was great as the cool quiet guy who didn't mind geeks for buddies and as for Rip Torn, well he tore up the place as O'Houlihan!How they did that tool-scene is beyond me! But the kicker was Lance Armstrong's guest appearance and how he just don't accepts quitting, even in the face of death... wow! Go and see it as everyone in the flick, except for Rip Torn's character, got what they deserve!",8,0,0,17 October 2004
V for Vendetta," Vandalised
","At the risk of a massive flamewar, I thought it was utter crap except for the 'My Turn' or the bullets-vs-knives fight-scene and now I understand why Alan Moore is so cruel, he did not appreciate what was done with his 'LXG/League of Extraordianary Gentlemen' either (but that was cool for me though, a bit moody and dark like Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman), but he has now refused to sell the rights of any of his other and future creations... Huge chunks of the graphic novel version of '...Vendetta' were both lopped off and out - I definitely was not impressed! Hugo Weaving was wasted in his bemasked experience and so was Natalie Portman as a shave headed waif taken under Weaving's wing - you'd be better off sticking to the graphic novel! God save us if they ever 'adapt' the Watchmen (1986), a true catalyst in graphic novel history alongside 'Return Of The Dark Knight'!!",4,3,6,17 April 2006
