Blade Runner 2049," Boring, Wasted Potential
","Never have I ever been so bored watching a movie. If it wasn't for the talented Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, I would give this movie the lowest rating possible. I tried desperately to be intrigued by the world of Blade Runner and the questions it posed, but the movie could not hold my interest. Blade Runner 2049 had the opportunity expand the fanbase for this genre of film, but unfortunately it fell way short. Too slow paced, too many elephant screams, not enough dialogue, and too long. Watched with a group of four people and unfortunately, I hated it the least.",2,0,2,17 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Average and Odd, but Entertaining; Needs a Second Chance
","This is not going to go the way you think and that's the best part. Entertaining and many memorable moments. Had some flaws, too much forced humor and a slow and disjointed first half. I watched it twice back-to-back. After the first showing I was not sure if I liked it or not. I enjoyed it so much more the second time around. The first time, some of the movie's bold choices felt forced and cheesy. The second time, these odd moments were less awkward and I was able to appreciate them at their true magnitude. The acting, cinematography, and music was in line with the expectations of a Star Wars film. Even the flaws were typical to this franchise. Curious to see episode 9, as it felt more like an end to a trilogy than the middle. In my opinion, it rates somewhere in the middle of all the Star Wars movies. If you saw it once and did not like it, I strongly recommend watching it again, In the end, I was entertained and that is what truly matters.",7,0,2,17 December 2017
