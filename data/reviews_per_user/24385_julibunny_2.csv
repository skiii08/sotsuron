United 93," More than a movie....
","When I walked into the theater room, I was expecting to sit down and watch a movie that tells the sad story of the tragedy of September 11. After a while I started to realize that I was not watching a movie I was living the tragedy as all the innocent people that really were on board. I was experiencing the fear, tension, anxiety, pain and stress just as one of them. This movie is powerful, moving, shocking but I think totally necessary, because we shouldn't forget and shouldn't rest until we finally can feel free of the terrorist thread. The World our World, can not have another movie like this, won't be acceptable. For all those innocents people that pass away on September 11 all my Prays. God Bless the families of all the victims, God bless America and entire world. We deserve a world free of those evil terrorist!!!!",10,1,5,29 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," There is still to much to learn.....
","The movie was excellent!!!!! After I have read all the previous comments I think that it is not really much for me to say. Anyway I consider that this wonderful movie show us an evidence of how much still we need to learn and grow, and how small we are when the power of love take us over. It remind us that perhaps any religion we practice, for all of us there is just one simple rule and is about ' Common sense', there is nothing more simple than do not the others what you consider you wont like the others do to you. Love and you will be love, accept others no matter what and others will accept you no matter how imperfect you can be. I live in Houston, amazingly a super conservative City. Every time me and my husband try to comment this movie with friends, for our surprise they think we are totally insame because we went to watch 'that kind of movie'. I feel sorry for them they are missing one of the best movies ever!!!!!",10,18,20,5 February 2006
