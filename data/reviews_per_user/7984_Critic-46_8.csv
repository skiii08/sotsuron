The Blair Witch Project," BWP Review
","Warning!  Spoilers may be ahead!Story - 1.  Intriguing and creepy.  Three college filmmakers venture into the woods to make a documentary on the Blair Witch, but never make it home alive.Characters - 0.  2D stupid teenagers.  Nothing different from EVERY other horror film.Acting - 1.  I must say that the three gave excellent performances for first time actors.Cinematography - 1.  The low budget handheld camera work gave the film an extra and much needed touch or eerieness.Beginning - 0.  The movie dragged along for an hour making me seriously wonder if there was any reason for watching.End - 1.  The last twenty minutes were chilling, chaotic and not easily forgetable.Believability - 0.  If a sane person was in the situation would they have done the same?  No.  Nobody ventures into the unknown with out a cell phone and a weapon... sorry.Attention Holding - 0.  Feel like you need to get popcorn or use the restroom?  Go right ahead, the only thing you will miss is some kids cursing at each other.  Memorable - 1.  The last twenty minutes will haunt you for a while, depending on your imagination.Could Watch Again - 0.  It's dark and depressing and I don't like to watch films like that.
Rating - 5 out of 10.  There is no necessity to watch the Blair Witch Project.  In the end it's simply a depressing film with no point.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
The Mummy," A great Friday nite flick for all ages!
","The Mummy had it all... action, comedy, romance and horror.At a time when the originality in Hollywood is at an all time low and the 'shock-factor' is way up, with films such as Eyes Wide Shut, South Park, American Pie and SOS, it's refreshing to see a movie which is all about fun.The Mummy is 90 minutes of fun for all ages.  There is no blood or gore, but there is still a considerable amount of action to keep the older crowd interested.  The special effects where cool and just perfect for the film. Brandon Fraiser was excellent and reminded me of Harrison Ford from the Indiana Jones Trilogy.  Stephen Sommers has directed yet another excellent movie.Four stars and an 8 on the IMDB.  I'm waiting for the DVD release of Sept. 28 so I can watch it again.P.S. Stephen Sommers, if you are reading this I am still waiting for Deep Rising 2.",Null,0,0,27 July 1999

Performances by Bruce Willis and Liv Taylor were excellent and heart felt, especially in the end.Cinematography - 1.  Micheal Bay is the man!  Armageddon was gorgeously shot from beginning to end.Beginning - 1.  It was a joy watching NYC get blown to pieces.  And Mark Cooper's cameo was histerical.  'This is NYC, it's probably a terrorist bomb!'End - 1.  One of those movies that make you feel proud to be an American!Believability - 0.  I hope to God that with the BILLIONS of dollars the US gov't has, we don't have to rely on oil drillers to save our lives.Attention Holding - 1.

","Story -1.  Aliens have come to kill us all and it's up to the last surviving humans to kick their butt!  Awesome!Characters -1.  The whole gang was cool.

The Game," Game Review - from Average Man Critic
","Story -1. One of the richest men in America receives a certificate for a personalized gaming service. But as the game begins to get more dangerous, we have to wonder whos playing who. Excellent.Characters -1. Nicolas Van Orton is the main character who goes through a series of changes as the movie progresses. In the beginning he is a ruthless and cut throat, easily disliked by the audience as just another rich snob with no morals. Then as the Game unfolds he no longer is 'untouchable', he is a hunted and scared man, sleeping at bus stops and begging for money. At this point we feels sorry for him and see that he is a human being. And by the end... well you have to see it to find out.Acting -1. Douglas gives the best performance of his career since Wall St.Cinematography -1. The dark look of the film was excellent and symbolic of Douglas's trip into the unknown. When we are alone in the dark we feel vulnerable and we don't know what is ahead of us.Beginning -1. I like the 8mm video of Van Orton's life when he was a child. It set the tone for the movie.End -1. UNBELIEVABLE! What a mind trip! I loved it!Mystery/Thriller -1. It fit its genre perfectly. It will have you guessing and at the edge of your seat the entire way through.Attention Holding -1. Absolutely. From the time movie begins you don't want to move or even blink.Memorable -1. NOBODY can forget the game. Especially the end.Could Watch Again -1. I own it on DVD and I watch it again and again even though the end does not have the same impact.Game = 10. I LOVE this movie. Any person who likes to be taken on an adventure should see this film, you won't be disappointed. I can't wait for the Criterion Edition on DVD.",Null,0,1,14 August 1999
Titanic," Titanic Review - from Average Man Critic
","Story -1.  We know the story... it was good.Characters -0.  I never really gave a damn about any of these characters, because the writer wasn't sure if he should make Jack be the main character or Rose.  And it's not like either of them were interesting.  He was a poor artist and she was a rich girl.Acting -0.  Dicaprio is the worst actor on the silver screen and since most of the time he acts like a homo, I can't picture him as a leading man. Blanchett is 2D as always.Beginning -1.  Started off as a promising big budget romantic story.End -0.  Your typical romantic love story.  Naturally somebody has to die and somebody has to live to give it that 'extra' sad effect.  And since we knew from the beginning that the boat was gonna sink its not like there was ANY suspence.Score -1.  The musical score was great and added some drama to the movie.Attention Holding -0.  Not really.  The first hour and a half is the love stuff and the second is the action.  Very predictable.Memorable -0.  Just another love story.Could Watch Again -1.  If I had a different girlfriend and I needed a movie to hold her for 3 hours I would definetly choose this movie. 
Titanic = 4.  The best movie of all time?  Hell no!  The highest grossing movie of all time?  Americans can watch some stupid stuff sometimes.",Null,3,5,13 August 1999
The Matrix," Deep, well executed, Sci-fi epic.
","The Matrix is the BEST movie of 1999, as well as the best sci-fi movie ever made and also one of my favorites of all time!  The Matrix is one of those movies like Usual Suspects which holds you from the opening credits and does not let up til the lights come on in the theater.  By now we all know the story behind the Matrix and how great the special effects and action was, but I noticed that most people forgot to mention the deepth of the story.Yes!  Matrix is an action movie, but it is also Biblical in many ways.  Neo is Jesus... he is the 'one' selected to free the people from persecution. Cypher is the deciple who betrayed Christ... he sold out Morpheous for materialistic items and was then was forever banished from the real world. Morpheous is God... the all knowing, he is everywhere, yet nowhere.  And Trinity is the Virgin Mary, for it was her efforts which brought Neo to the 'real world'.  Other references include Zion,the Nebucanezhar and the Oracle.I have seen this film three times, will see it again at the theaters and I am definetly going to purchase the DVD on Oct. 5.  Forget Phantom Menace, the Matrix is IT!",10,0,0,27 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," And the award for Worst Picture of the year goes to...
","Thin Red Line!  The crowd goes wild!  Ok, let me stop joking around.  When I saw the trailer for TRL, I was impressed and said to myself 'WOW, I gotta see this movie!'.  It had a superb all-star cast; Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, George Clooney, John Travolta, etc.I went with three of my friends to a SOLD OUT showing on its first day of release and with the exception of one of the war scenes and when Woody Harrelson blows off his butt, the movie was TERRIBLE.  The beginning was too dragged out with narative that was cliche.  I will admit that the cinematography was excellent, but that alone can't hold a movie together.For me it was TOO much talk and NOT ENOUGH action.  When I pay to see a war film, I wanna see dozens upon dozens of people getting blown to pieces.  I want bullets flying every other minute and I want to see a hero with a big gun and a reason to come home.  A BIG disappointment.1 star and a 1 on the IMDB.",1,1,5,28 July 1999
