Ford v Ferrari," Entertaining 60s sports car racing flick receives full blown Hollywood treatment
","I must confess that sports car racing is probably at the bottom of my list when it comes to the type of spectator sports I like to watch. Granted, it takes a lot of courage to be a race driver. But why risk your life especially if you're married and have children? (as in the case of one of the protagonists here, Ken Miles, played quite effectively by Christian Bale).
What's more, most of the glory seems to go to the companies that put up the money for these spectacles. So in this case, we're asked to root for the Ford Motor Company with their obnoxious, win-at-all-costs boss, Henry Ford II (Tracie Letts), and his minions, who propose that Ford enter the racing game as a grand marketing promotion opportunity.
In looking at the title of this film, one can get the wrong first impression that the antagonist is Ferrari, the small Italian car manufacturer, known for its output of luxury vehicles as well as success in sports car racing. After Henry Ford attempts to buy Ferrari and is turned down, this is his impetus for getting involved in the racing game. His goal is to develop a new, blazing fast car that can usurp Ferrari's dominant position in winning one prestigious race after another (particularly on the French Le Mans circuit).
Ferrari thus has little screen time after the initial rejection of the Ford buyout. Instead, Ford hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a famous driver forced to retire due to a heart condition, now with an up and coming reputation as a top notch car designer. Shelby, an aggressive straight-shooter, hires the loose cannon Brit, Ken Miles, as his driver and mechanic consultant, just as he's about to lose his auto body shop due to non-payment of taxes.
Meanwhile, Henry Ford appoints Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) as his Senior Vice President in charge of developing the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype, the super car that's ultimately supposed to best Ferrari at Le Mans. Bebbe, a buffoon of a character, becomes the antagonist, when he opposes Shelby and his insistence that Miles take the wheel during the big race. Bebbe can't stomach such a 'politically incorrect' character as Miles and insists that other drivers test out the new Ford car at the upcoming Le Mans race. Sure enough, Ford ends up losing badly against Ferrari.
A cursory glance of the true history of all these machinations reveals that Beebe's push back against Shelby was exaggerated: the main sticking point in the film is his insistence that Davis not be the appointed driver. Historically, that never happened: the year before success, Davis actually DID race at Le Mans and lost to Ferrari.
There's more standard Hollywood treatment here with the specious suggestion that the development of the GT40 Mk 1 was mainly due to Davis's innate knowledge of car mechanics-there's a scene where Shelby rejects a computer analysis by Ford engineers and trusts Davis, with his more home-grown approach, to fine tune the car. In actuality, the Ford engineers worked in close conjunction with Shelby and Davis, and the ultimate success was truly a team effort.
While Damon's part as Shelby in the first half of the film revolves around defending Miles and convincing Ford that Beebe's approach at micro-managing will not work, in the second half, his role is really reduced to a glorified cheerleader, as Christian Bale ends up with the much juicier part of actually driving the car during the Daytona 500 'tune-up' and the ultimate challenge at Le Mans.
All the behind-the-scenes drama ends up as a kind of mixed bag. Shelby trying to rein in the aforementioned 'loose cannon' Miles can be entertaining but sometimes gets a bit much (especially when Damon and Bale fight like five year olds, tussling on the ground while Miles' wife looks on). Speaking of Miles' wife, Mollie (played by the sultry British actress Caitriona Balfe), she and their young son Peter, have little to do throughout, also often acting as glorified cheerleaders.
The aforementioned behind-the-scenes drama also applies to the goings-on at the Ford Motor Company. There's a good scene where Shelby takes Henry Ford for a test drive which causes him to have an epiphany regarding the danger of driving these type of cars. As a result, Ford entrusts Shelby with calling the shots after the initial loss to Ferrari at Le Mans.
Less successful is the way the scenarists handle Beebe who is reduced to the aforementioned buffoon. I'm thinking especially of that ridiculous scene where Shelby locks Beebe in an office, preventing him from giving orders during one of the critical test races.
Ultimately, a film such as this needs to present a credible and entertaining enough behind-the-scenes drama in addition to its actual racing sequences. On that score, I will reiterate, the Ford v Ferrari 'drama' is passable, which will hold your interest (not all of it is that 'believable' however, on the other hand).
The racing scenes (particularly the ones at Le Mans) are particularly well done and the outcome is a bit of a curve ball (SPOILERS: with Ferrari out of the race, Miles, who is way ahead, is ordered to slow down so that all three Ford cars cross the finish line at the same time!).
The film also manages some pathos at the climax, when Miles ends up being killed in a test drive accident two months after his triumph at Le Mans. Racing aficionados will probably dig this wholeheartedly. Much lesser enthusiasts (such as myself) can appreciate the screenwriting effort, despite the Hollywood treatment.",6,32,64,20 December 2019
The King's Speech," Compelling tale of King George VI's transformation despite historical inaccuracies
","On one level, 'The King's Speech' hits a home run in its moving depiction of how speech therapist Lionel Logue corrects the stammering speech of an arrogant Duke of York and transforms him into now confident monarch (and well-rounded good guy), King George VI. On a much different level, 'The Kings Speech' has a harder time in accurately depicting the true historical circumstances of the king's transformation and the complexity of the political machinations surrounding his ascent to the throne.The creators of the film admittedly took liberties as to the accuracy of the time it took Logue to correct Albert's (The Duke of York, aka 'Bertie's') speech. The film informs that Albert met Logue in 1934, when they actually met earlier in 1926. And within seven months, in 1927, under Logue's tutelage, Albert already showed marked improvement in a speech given to the Australian parliament in Canberra. The film, of course, would like us to believe that it wasn't until 1939, when the WW II had just broken out, that the King finally found his mettle. But it's also possible that the King had improved but then regressed at a certain point, requiring additional instruction on Logue's part. I recently heard Colin Firth remark that he listened to a public speech given by King George as late as 1938, and it was not at all impressive (actually downright embarrassing!).Fiddling with the time line as to how long it took Logue to truly shape the King's speech, is not such a big deal in comparison to the film's distortion of history regarding the political sympathies surrounding the Abdication and the Royal family's attitude toward Hitler. The film hardly calls attention to the fact that Albert's brother, King Edward VIII (later known as the Duke of Windsor following his abdication), was a great admirer of the Nazis (even after the war broke out). What's more, Churchill (played by a completely miscast Timothy Spall), despite having arranged a coalition against the Nazis, inexplicably supported King Edward during the Abdication crisis. Not only wasn't King George a friend of Churchill during the time of the Abdication (for the obvious reason of Churchill's support of his brother) but soon afterward sided with Churchill's political opponent, Neville Chamberlain, who advocated a policy of appeasement toward Hitler. 'The King's Speech' would like us to believe that King George was always against the Nazis, but such an attitude did not emerge, until the war broke out.Despite the historical inaccuracies, 'The King's Speech' pulls us in through the story of a unique and engaging relationship between student and teacher. The opening scene, where Albert must speak publicly for the first time at Wembley Stadium in 1925, establishes the extent of his malady—a stuttering problem that proves to be the source of profound embarrassment for both the Royal Family themselves and the public at large.When the Duke of York meets his therapist, Lionel Logue, the contrast between the two could not be more profound. While Logue exudes a child-like spontaneity, 'Bertie' is uptight and arrogant (Logue's grandson maintains that his grandfather never swore in front of the King nor did he call him 'Bertie'). As their relationship develops, Logue tries to get Albert to see the connection between his stuttering and repressed upbringing. Albert opens up enough to reveal how he had to cope with his strict father and had to endure the family's insistence that he suppress his natural left-handedness and correct a knock-knee condition through the use of painful splints.It's the Abdication and its consequences that causes the 'dark moment' of the Second Act of the narrative. After David (King Edward) accuses Albert of trying to take over the throne by attempting to make himself more competent (via the speech lessons), Albert becomes completely tongue-tied and is unable to reply to his brother's humiliating taunts, which he endured so many times during his childhood. Then when Logue suggests that Albert can be king, the Duke of York ironically takes his brother's side by accusing Logue of offering up a suggestion that could be construed as being treasonous. The Duke belittles Logue for his failed acting career as well as his lower middle class upbringing.Facing the prospect of making the most important speech of his life, the King eventually realizes that he needs Logue's help and seeks him out again. When the King apologizes, we realize that the king has had an epiphany. The act of 'eating humble pie' brings the King back down to earth; he now finally realizes that he's no better than his subjects despite his royal standing and can now relate to Logue as an equal and not a superior. And Logue must eat a little 'humble pie' of his own when the King reproaches him for likening 'The Stone of Scone' to an outdated relic. Logue comes to respect the institution of the Monarchy as it is now ably represented by King George, who exudes a new found confidence in his position as regent.Geoffrey Rush steals the show in his wonderful depiction of the empathetic and iconoclastic speech therapist. Although he bears no resemblance to the real King George, Colin Firth does an excellent job in conveying the King's inner turmoil, as he vacillates between arrogance and self-knowledge. I wonder if the film's producers might have considered Guy Pearce for the part of the King himself as Pearce bears a striking resemblance to both the Duke of Windsor and King George VI. I actually wanted to see more of him in the film. Helena Bonham Carter doesn't have much to do as the King's wife and I can't understand why she was nominated for best supporting actress.'The King's Speech' ironically is a tale about the oppressed becoming the oppressor. King George was oppressed as a child but became an 'oppressor', as an arrogant and distant monarch. Thanks to a warm and kindly mentor, the King 'turned out alright'.",8,1,2,25 February 2011
The Lobster," Clever but not enjoyable, downbeat tale of dystopian community
","I can't disagree that the subject of Yorgos Lanthimos' 'The Lobster' is a dystopian community. Dystopia is defined as a community that is undesirable or frightening but usually stories about such communities are set in the future. Lanthimos, however, provides no back story to his seemingly futuristic narrative, so it probably would be better to label it a 'fable.' From interviews I've read, Lanthimos is content to have viewers draw their own conclusions as to what the film is about. He apparently has drawn no conclusions of his own and is more devoted to the creative process in contrast to offering up a calculated 'message.'Lanthimos' vision is a bleak one at that. His protagonist is David (a one-note Colin Farrell), who finds himself at a special hotel after his wife has left him for another man. In this universe, if you don't have a mate, you have 45 days to find another one, or else you're transformed into an animal. This is perhaps the weakest part of the film, as the transformation process is never explained or shown and you just have to accept this plot point on faith--which seriously damages the overall verisimilitude of the narrative.The hotel residents can extend their stay by hunting 'loners' in the forest by shooting them with tranquilizer darts. Other rules become apparent such as no masturbation (but sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory). David befriends two men; one, Robert, is punished for masturbating by having his hand burned inside a toaster-the other, John, purposely bangs his head on tables so that his nose will bleed. The main rule for mating is that the couples should have some idiosyncrasy in common. John finds a woman who suffers from nosebleeds and the two are paired off.David ends up finding a woman who has the highest 'kill' rate in shooting loners in the forest. While in a Jacuzzi, she feigns choking, and David, desiring to prove that he's as cold as her, sits there impassively. The woman decides to partner up with David but things take a real bizarre turn when she kicks a dog to death (who happens to be David's brother-transformed earlier into a dog). When David cries, she realizes his earlier 'cruel act' was a ruse and drags him to the hotel manager, ordering that David immediately be turned into an animal.David I suppose has the last laugh, when, with the aid of a sympathetic maid at the hotel, he tranquilizes the woman, who is turned into an animal. At this point David escapes from the hotel and joins the loners in the forest. You would expect the loners to be the 'good guys' but this is where Lanthimos proffers up what might be called a 'twist' of sortsThe loners don't believe in romance at all and if you try to become a couple, they'll mutilate you. The head of the loners (Léa Seydoux) leads raids to disrupt the activities at the hotel. David breaks into John's cottage and reveals to his mate that his nosebleeds are artificially induced. Worse, the head of the loners convinces the husband of the hotel manager to willingly shoot her, which he does, only to discover that the gun is loaded with blanks.The second half of the plot deals with David meeting another loner, a shortsighted woman (Rachel Weisz). Since David is also shortsighted, they bond and plan to run away together. But a mole discovers the woman's journal and she's brought to the city in a ruse to cure her shortsightedness. Instead a doctor intentionally blinds the woman.David and the woman still decide to run away and in a bizarre climax, David enters the bathroom in a restaurant where he is about to intentionally blind himself with a knife, so the couple will still have something in common with one another.That's it folks! It's all very clever and probably designed to be a little shocking in its unrelenting, bleak view of people who are unable to rebel against the authoritarian world they find themselves in. It could be a parable for a place like North Korea but there's not enough history to explain the world we find ourselves observing. David's decision to mutilate himself suggests that he hasn't been able to escape the world he seeks to rebel against. Since there's little to cheer about here, we're left to admire the director's imagination-but his downbeat tale doesn't prove very enjoyable or even that enlightening.",5,0,2,26 December 2017
Moneyball," Computer geeks win acceptance in beer-swilling, baseball jock fraternity
","In many respects, 'Moneyball' is not any different from most 'baseball' movies that place the national pastime on its ubiquitous, saccharine pedestal. That can be expected. Where 'Moneyball' differs, is that it seeks to invite a new 'player' to the table—the computer geek. Now all the aspiring Bill Gates' of the world can take a seat with the battle-scarred, beer-swilling veterans, who've been analyzing the game for years, utilizing an intuition grounded in their 'gut' perceptions, instead of a set of statistics, organized by a computer program. This is the basic premise of Brad Pitt's overrated Academy Award nominated film, which is more about the business of baseball, than the game itself.For awhile, the story of Billy Beane, the former mediocre baseball player turned general manager of the Oakland A's baseball team, proves to be fairly interesting. After failing to beat the NY Yankees in the first round of the playoffs in 2001, the owner of the As gives Beane an ultimatum: win the World Series next year, but with a vastly reduced budget (as the A's principal players, such as Jason Giambi, have been traded away). Beane meets with his staff of scouts (played by former professional baseball players and scouts), who lend a real air of credibility to the proceedings. That group appears to be clueless and sends Beane in search of a new approach to resolve his quandary of finding underrated baseball talent, without the aid of the big bucks.While attempting to negotiate a trade with the Cleveland Indians, Beane discovers a low level Indian employee, statistician Peter Brand, a Yale graduate, who picks players by means of sophisticated computer analysis (Brand is a composite character based primarily on Beane's real-life top assistant, Paul DePodesta, who refused permission to use his name in the film). Geeky Jonah Hill plays Brand, and for half of Act 2, he advises Beane on which bargain basement players to trade for. Brand looks primarily at 'on base percentage' and Beane (with Brand in tow) makes a house call , on one occasion, to fading major league catcher, Scott Hatteberg, asking him whether he'd be interested in converting to playing first base (the answer is of course, affirmative!). Beane manages to pick up more bargains, including submarine hurler, Chad Bradford, with the aid of Brand, and by the time spring training rolls around, Beane is confident that his motley crew, can compete against the more financially endowed teams, including their ultimate nemesis: the Yanks! The drama (and one's interest), only lasts for a little while longer. There's an effective scene where Beane comes into conflict with his scouting crew, who resent the presence of Brand, and his disdain for their 'intuition'. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, manages to acquit himself nicely as A's manager, Art Howe, who doesn't like Beane telling him how to manage his team (but his part is all too brief). Sadly, the narrative eventually has nowhere to go, as there's virtually no additional interesting enough conflict, which propelled the characters so fitfully along, in the film's first half. The A's 20 game winning streak is attributed to Brand's highly questionable miracle system (it should be noted that the A's still had some 'big money' holdovers, such as pitchers Zito and Hudson, who were not selected as a result of Brand's machinations). Brand has little to do in the second half of the film, except act as Beane's glorified cheerleader, with Beane, now wheeling and dealing on his own, sometimes acting outside the purview of his brainiac assistant. Nonetheless, the film's scenarists afford the geeky Brand, with his own hagiography, now allowed to sit at the table with 'the big boys'.Without a doubt, 'Moneyball' has perhaps the most anti-climactic climax, in recent film history. Not only do the A's fail to make the first round of the Division playoffs but we're told that Beane is still trying to earn his first World Series ring. Even more embarrassing (and this is supposed to be impressive), we're told that the Red Sox, utilizing Beane and Brand's statistical approach, win their first World Series since 1918, a couple of years later. Beane's consolation prize is thus held up as some kind of great victory for humanity! 'Moneyball' is one of the few baseball films, that refuses to fictionalize the characters they are portraying. Unfortunately, we learn next to nothing about any of them, except for the fact that they have hearts of gold (again, as to be expected). Some time is spent portraying the aging David Justice, as a surly, 'non-team' player. But after a pep talk from Beane, he agrees to 'step up to the plate', and provide guidance to the 'younger players', who soon come together and accomplish the miracle 20 game winning streak.All-Star writers Sorkin and Zaillian fall flat in attempting to infuse Beane's character, with a meaningful internal arc. Beane must not only overcome his past failure as a player (which we see in a series of flashbacks), but also must bond with his teenage daughter. Beane's nobility is undercut by such pretentious pronouncements as 'money is not important', even though he's portrayed as a ruthless wheeler dealer, who uses shady tactics to gain an advantage over his rivals. According to Beane, introducing the new dry world of statistics, is what he wants to be remembered for, not earning a World Series ring.'Moneyball' must also contend with the additional deficit of another 'phone in' Brad Pitt performance. No matter how hard he tries, Pitt invariably cannot play anyone but Brad Pitt. Ultimately, Pitt should not be completely blamed for attempting to elevate Beane (and baseball) to mythic status. In the end, however, it's the general public, who, year after year, places the 'national pastime', on that saccharine pedestal. After all, baseball, is nothing more than a business and entertainment spectacle, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is, I believe, trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.",5,0,2,4 March 2012
Angels & Demons," Twist ending redeems otherwise implausible, hokey plot
","I've never been a big fan of the material Ron Howard chooses for his movies. The 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' are no exception. But by the same token I will concede that Mr. Howard has come along way as a director. Most of his films are technically brilliant and he has evolved in his abilities to direct his actors.After consulting Wikipedia's article on this film, I learned that there is actually an organization, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and there is a contraption, the 'Large Hadron Collider'. I also found out that the organization spent a good deal of time reassuring the local population that what they were doing was safe. Therefore, the whole idea that they could create anti-matter in three small cylinders, which could be capable of creating a low-grade nuclear-like explosion and then some psycho could somehow get through security at the facility and steal this anti-matter, was laughable.If you're a Vatican History buff, you'll find 'Angels and Demons' just up your alley. The story begins with the death of the pope and a papal enclave is convened to choose the pope's successor. You'll find out who the 'preferiti' are—the four most likely candidates to be elected pope; they're kidnapped and immediately the Vatican police assume that the the Vatican's nemesis, the Illuminati, a secret society persecuted by the Catholic Church dating back to the time of Galileo, is behind the nefarious deed. In a nutshell, The Illuminati were the 'free-thinkers' who were suppressed by the Church during the Enlightenment, due to their advocacy of science. Later they supposedly turned violent and held a grudge against the Church for years.Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, the Harvard symbologist who is summoned by the Vatican police to save the four cardinals. Also called in is Vittoria Vetra, the scientist at CERN who's in charge of replacing the cylinder's batteries since once they run out, the explosion will occur (where was the Energizer bunny when you needed him most?) Langdon demands access to the Vatican Secret Archives where he discovers clues in a banned book by Galileo. The clues lead to four points of the compass in Vatican City, representing the four elements—fire, earth, air and water. Langdon deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered at four altars at these four different locations.Langdon races around Vatican City along with the Vatican Police trying to save the four cardinals. The first three cardinals are dispatched in the manner associated with each particular element: Earth: Cardinal #1--suffocated by dirt; Air: Cardinal #2--lungs are punctured; and Fire: Cardinal #3—burned to death. Langdon manages to save Cardinal #4 who is dropped into a WATER fountain in a weighted gurney. The fourth Cardinal clues Langdon into the Assassin's lair—where the four cardinals had been held earlier. The police find the killer's van at a Mausoleum but conclude it's a dead end. Langdon and Vetra find a secret passageway and end up confronting the assassin who holds a gun on them. He reveals he's been hired by the Catholic church but has no orders to kill them so he lets them go (not at all credible). Langdon finds the last clue in the form of crossed keys, the Papal symbol. He concludes that the final victim will be Camerlengo McKenna (a priest who is chief administrator at the Vatican). The crafty assassin who outwits everybody, is unconvincingly outwitted himself by stepping inside a car and getting blown up by a car bomb (who worked that out, I have no idea!).Now here's how all this nonsense is saved by the twist ending (SPOILER ALERT!). We're led to believe that the Camerlengo is the good guy. He tries to convince Cardinal Strauss, the head honcho at the conclave to evacuate the Vatican, since the anti-matter is about to explode. The Cardinal, and the other stuffed shirts want to follow their protocol in choosing the pope, so they decide to rely on the Vatican police (along with Langdon) to save the day by finding the anti-matter. Also when Langdon finds the Camerlengo with the chief of the Vatican police, it appears the Illuminati have already branded him (just as they did with the four other cardinals) and the Camerlengo blurts out that the Police chief is in league with the Illuminati (so he gets killed). Finally, when the anti-matter cylinder batteries are about to run out, the Camerlengo (who believe it or not, has training as a helicopter pilot) takes the cylinder up into the clouds in a helicopter, where the anti-matter explodes but kills no one. The Camerlengo parachutes to safety and is hailed as a hero—in fact, the conclave (using an arcane rule) wants to vote him in as the new Pope.The twist is when Langdon, using a key the Vatican Police Chief gave him just before he dies, unlocks surveillance video stored on the hard drive of the Chief's private computer, revealing that it was the Camerlengo who was the bad guy all along. Not only did he kill the three cardinals but also his adoptive father, the Pope himself. It seems that the Camerlengo was mad at the Pope due to his liberal stance toward science. After Langdon reveals the plot to the Papal enclave, the Camerlengo commits suicide by setting himself on fire.Ron Howard did well in concluding that the Da Vinci sequel needed to move at a faster pace. And kudos to the production team who recreated Vatican City without having any access to shooting there. Despite the positives, I did sit through most of 'Angels and Demons' with a smirk on my face. After all, the entire premise is based on completely implausible events. But I have to admit, the twist ending at the end is so clever, that I didn't see it coming at all! And yes, I'm willing to say, despite all the hokeyness, to a certain extent, it won me over.",6,0,0,14 June 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Emperor's New Clothes
","Quentin Tarrantino tells us in the documentary which is part of the special features section of the Kill Bill Volume 2 DVD, that Volume 2 is much more an homage to spaghetti westerns than to the martial arts homage of Volume 1. Volume 2 brings us back to the beginning of Volume 1, The Massacre at Two Pines. It's a slow-moving scene where we finally get to meet Bill who ultimately rejects The Bride's deep-seated wish to leave her murderous past behind. Quite fortunately Tarrantino opts not to mimic Peckinpah westerns and show us close-ups of the massacre in slow motion. In fact none of the massacre is shown and by doing so he wisely avoids alienating his audience. Kill Bill Volume 2 ends up being more camp than horror show. Had Tarrantino decided to show the massacre of innocents it wouldn't have worked in his film precisely because the victims (aside from the 'real' people at the wedding rehearsal) are comic book villains who we are not supposed to identify with.Michael Madsen as Bill's brother, Budd, does an excellent job portraying the former assassin turned bouncer. The portrait of the wise-cracking psychopath features some of Tarrantino's best dialogue. But the whole idea that The Bride (aka Beatrix Kiddo), who has just taken down 100 Samurai swordsman in a space of few minutes in Volume 1 would allow herself to be so easily subdued by a blast of 'rock salt' from Budd's rifle is ludicrous. Obviously Tarrantino needed a way to have her overcome an even more impossible challenge than the 100 plus Samurai swordsman—in this case, she now ends up buried alive in a coffin and in Houdini-like fashion, is able to extricate herself from the situation. The absurdity of the scene reaches its apotheosis when Beatrix utilizes her zen-like martial arts training to punch a hole in the coffin with her bare hand and then miraculously levitate through mounds of earth to freedom above ground.I very much liked how Tarrantino uses Gordon Liu to play different parts in Volume 1 and 2. Liu is the martial arts master Pai Mei in Volume 2 and Beatrix's training at the hands of this gruff instructor prove to be one of the more engaging and streamlined sequences in the film. Tarrantino also uses another actor, Michael Parks, to play two different roles. He's the sheriff in the beginning of Volume 1 and transforms himself into Bill's father figure, an old pimp, Esteban Vihaio, in Volume 2. Parks really shows his mettle as an actor since he is virtually unrecognizable from one part to the next.Things get even better in the 'Elle and I' sequence. Darryl Hannah is perfect as the demented one-eyed assassin who first kills Budd with a Black Mamba poisonous snake and then gets into a fight to the death with Beatrix. The fight scene was so over the top that it can be considered a classic in terms of campy female vs. female fight sequences. It's a scene that perhaps comes closest to being funny out of all the scenes in both Volumes 1 and 2.Unlike Volume 1 which ends with a bang, Volume 2 ends with a whimper. In a very long-winded and tame confrontation, the late David Carradine (not looking very well at all) finally reveals why he 'overreacted' and went after Beatrix. It was a matter of simple jealousy—he couldn't stand the idea of Beatrix being with another man. So that's it—after one killing after another, the whole reason for Bill's actions rests on irrational jealousy. This is what we've waited for, for the entire movie. Tarrantino doesn't bother explaining who Bill is at all. We find next to nothing about him. He has no history and is merely a flimsy prop, the catalyst to get all the bloody events moving. Bill has no back story and Carradine has no character to mold here.Tarrantino is probably better served directing movies based on adaptations. As a writer of his own material, Tarrantino is the master of not only style over substance but elevating nastiness to high kitsch. Visually he'll be remembered for some classic scenes but often many of these scenes are too drawn out and need to be edited. Most disappointing is the revelation of the ultimate motivation of the antagonist—in its utter simplicity Tarrantino is revealed to be the Emperor with no clothes, an 'auteur' who puts a premium on 'shock cinema' at the expense of intellect.",5,16,23,17 June 2009
First Man," One dimensional supporting characters coupled with unemotional protagonist undermine otherwise technically proficient tale of first lunar landing
","I was a bit surprised when I saw the director of a film about the first man on the moon was Damien Chazelle. His prior films were quite different. There was that turgid melodrama, Whiplash, about an angry music teacher; and then La La Land, a musical with a mediocre script but some great music which almost won the Academy Award for best picture. Chazelle helped his cause here by again employing Justin Hurwitz to write the score which probably saved the film from complete oblivion.
Chazelle seeks to humanize his protagonist, astronaut Neil Armstrong, flatly played by Ryan Gosling. Unfortunately, attempting to turn Armstrong into a multi-dimensional character is a tall order indeed. The problem is that Armstrong was a very dry, unemotional individual, a character who doesn't lend himself to great drama.
Chazelle suggests that the death of his two year old daughter in 1962 from a brain tumor drove him into a deep emotional shell which he never completely emerged. Chazelle repeatedly reminds us of the emotional toll Armstrong's daughter's death had on him throughout the film. Armstrong's first wife Janet (Claire Foy) ends up feeling beleaguered due to her husband's emotional distancing (one notable scene occurs when Janet orders a reluctant Armstrong to sit down with his two young sons and warn them that he may not be coming back from his moon mission).
But aside from Armstrong's reticence to display much emotion and his wife's compulsion to push back at that, there is little discernible human conflict in First Man. This extends to the other characters Armstrong comes in contact with throughout the film who remain one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Had Chazelle's screenwriter, Josh Singer, been able to flesh out some of these characters more effectively, First Man probably wouldn't feel as slow moving, already hampered by its 141 minute running time.
Chazelle on the other hand shines in the technical department. The early scenes of Armstrong as a test pilot are engaging and even better is how he shows just how flawed the space program was until finally perfected when the moon landing was accomplished. Particularly harrowing is the scene in which a flash fire kills three astronauts during a cockpit simulation for Apollo 1. There's also the early Gemini 8 mission in which Armstrong almost lost his life when he and his crew almost lose control of their malfunctioning spaceship.
In the end, Chazelle can't avoid hagiography. With a better script, his aim of presenting the events leading up to the first lunar landing may have ended successfully.",4,0,0,9 December 2019
Black Swan," The Red Shoes meets Angel Heart
","Who knew? Rather than a profession peopled with a crew of dedicated professionals, the ballet world, according to director Darren Aronofsky, really consists of a bunch of back-stabbing bitches, self-mutilating neurotics, sleazy artistic directors and a 'Stage Mom' from hell.Black Swan has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this one-note tale of a dancer's quest to come out on top as she pursues the lead role in Swan Lake for a prominent (unnamed) NYC ballet company. The film is really supposed to be a cautionary tale about people who will stop at nothing to further their careers. Ironically, Natalie Portman (as the protagonist, Nina Sayers) worked herself out like a dog in order to replicate the look of a full-time ballet dancer; many internet posters have commented how unhealthy she looks on screen and seems to be just as guilty as the character she plays (where Nina will stop at nothing to become the so-called 'Swan Queen', Ms. Portman has worked herself to the bone in her quest for Oscar Gold!).Vincent Cassell plays the sleazy artistic director of the company, Thomas Leroy. Leroy has no qualms about throwing the over-the-hill principal dancer, Beth Macintrye (played by a way over the top Winona Ryder) under the bus after deciding that the younger Nina must now carry the torch. His decision is not immediate as he has reservations about whether Nina can actually play the darker 'Black Swan' part. He senses that things aren't right with Nina as she is unable to 'let herself go'. The consummate professional that he is, Leroy instructs Nina to go home and masturbate which will help her to get in touch with her more spontaneous self. When he gives her pointers on the dance floor, he says things like, 'Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!' Nina finally gets the role when Leroy tests her by attempting to kiss her while they're alone—in response, Nina bites him on the lip (that proves to Leroy, believe it or not, that Nina has what it takes!).Also in the mix is Nina's pushy mother, Erica, who she lives with in a small, unattractive apartment. The mother wanted to be a ballet dancer but never made it and ended up pushing Nina to become the driven artiste she has become. It's clear that Erica is unconsciously jealous of her daughter's success but I can't agree with others who have suggested there is an incestuous sub-text here. If anything, Nina's mother is extremely upset over the evidence that Nina has been self-mutilating and is now trying to get her to slow down and take care of herself.Finally, there's Lily, Nina's rival from San Francisco who Leroy names as alternate in the Swan Lake production. Lily sports a bunch of tattoos and has a mouth like one of the performers you might find on 'Jersey Shore'. Nina hallucinates having a steamy sexual encounter with Lily but soon finds out that it was all in her mind.Throughout 'Black Swan', Nina keeps imagining seeing her double which unnerves her no end. Aronofsky deceptively leads us to believe that Nina harbors murderous impulses. Prior to the climax, Nina fights with her double who morphs into Lily. It then appears that Nina stabs Lily to death just prior to the opening night performance. But during intermission, Lily knocks on Nina's dressing room door making it quite clear that Lily's murder was just another one of Nina's hallucinations. It turns out that Lily is not a murderer at all—rather, the murderous impulses were simply a reflection of Nina's own self-hatred. She ends up stabbing herself prior to going back out for the second act and presumably is found bleeding to death as the curtain descends and the oblivious audience roars their approval.Nina's last words regarding her performance was that 'it was perfect'. The irony of course is that although achieving her goal of mastering the role of the 'Black Swan', she sacrifices her life. In real life, those who give up a piece of themselves for their ambition, don't usually kill themselves. Rather, they end up with a feeling of a self-satisfaction and achievement of their goals. It's of course for others to judge them whether their rise to the top was conducted with a modicum of moral integrity.In the end, there are few surprises here as Nina's self-destructive internal arc is played out as if someone kept hitting the repeat button on a video monitor. All those scratch marks and peeling toenails become tedious after awhile and the potential tempting plot that Nina's actions might lead to a murder investigation turns out to be nothing more than a big tease on the part of director Aronofsky.Some may feel that Nina is the epitome of a tragic heroine—she accomplishes her goal of mastering a difficult dramatic part but throws away her life at the same time. If you are going to have a heroine who is self-destructive, why not model your character on Tennessee Wiliam's Blanche Dubois? Her back story is a real one as opposed to the one-note Nina, molded by a stereotyped Stage Mother from hell.The frenetic pacing of the Black Swan narrative will hold your interest to the end but the ride is decisively creepy. Has Aronofsky created a true cautionary tale on the dangers of careerism? Or does he revel in the excesses that he is supposedly criticizing? Somehow, all the gory goings on in The Black Swan don't seem to be a very appropriate venue for the dignified world of ballet. Better to catch a young Mickey Rourke in 'Angel Heart' if you desire a blood-fest that's a tad bit more creative.",4,5,9,23 January 2011
Changeling," Clint Eastwood's Passion Play
","In the old days, Clint Eastwood was Dirty Harry, the vigilante maverick pitted against a world of bleeding heart liberals. Now times have changed and he's drifted more toward the left. In Million Dollar Baby, spokespersons for the Roman Catholic Church are the bad guys because they're against assisted suicide. In Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood attempts to soft pedal Japanese fanaticism by offering up the quid pro quo of a 'good' Japanese soldier to balance out a 'bad' one. And here in 'Changeling', it's the corrupt LAPD from the late 1920s which is the subject of another one of Eastwood's morality plays.In Eastwood's world view, it's simply a question of good vs. evil. That's why he's always drawn to melodrama which is the perfect type of drama for reminding us that he's always on the 'right' (and winning) side! Changeling's screenwriter, Michael Straczynski, researched this true crime story for a year and then changed the facts not only to improve the narrative but to also manipulate our emotions. Part of his quandary was that he needed to integrate two tangentially related aspects of the story, the kidnapping of the 10 year old boy, Walter Collins, and the mass murders of children on the Northcott Farm (Straczynski decided not to put the killer's mother into the script even though she actually confessed to the murder of the Collins boy and was sentenced to prison).Stracyznski is much more successful simply relating the details of the investigation into the child killings. Tension builds as one of the detectives uncovers the horror quite by chance after having to track down a juvenile runaway who needs to be deported to his native Canada. Before he's shipped back home, the juvenile reveals the sickening details of what happened and this in turn leads to a series of grim scenes including the digging up of evidence, the flight and apprehension of the accused in Vancouver, flashbacks of the actual crimes and the eventual trial and execution of the murderer. James Harner as Gordon Northcott, looks a lot like the actual killer (check the old photos!) and ably conveys his creepy manic and manipulative demeanor. When dealing with the historical facts of the crime itself, Eastwood is on solid ground. He falters however when he dwells too long on the sickening circumstances of the killer's execution. What exactly is the point in drawing out this scene? Again it's part and parcel of Eastwood's strategy to champion himself as the guardian of morality. The bad guys always must get their comeuppance whether it's pointing a gun at a miscreant and blurting out 'make my day' or having a serial killer twist at the end of the hangman's rope a little longer than the viewer needs to see.Unfortunately Stracyznski appears to be at a complete loss as to what to do with the film's protagonist, Christine Collins. In real life, Collin's husband was locked up in San Quentin. Could it be that Collins wasn't the saint that Stracyznski makes her out to be? It certainly would have been more interesting to have Collins depicted as a complicated human being than the melodramatic victim depicted here. Collin's victimhood reaches its apotheosis when the police lock her up without a warrant at the Psychopathic Hospital. In a derivative scene right out of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Collins is subjected to various degradations including a strip search, imprisonment on the mental ward, a coercive interview by the institution's vile psychiatrist and shock treatment given to a prostitute who comes to her aid (Stracyznski fails to do his research since shock treatment wasn't used in mental institutions until 1937!).Angelina Jolie is not an actor of great range to begin with but here she's saddled with a script that tells us virtually nothing about its main character. Jolie is good at histrionic expression but after awhile there are a few too many scenes where she pleads, 'I want my child back'. The film's ending loses dramatic tension since the protagonist becomes a passive participant. Collins not only sits through Northcottt's trial but she also is a spectator at the City inquiry into police misconduct in her case. In addition to Christine, the good Reverand Briegleb, played by John Malkovich, is another overly self-righteous character who remains underdeveloped (I also wondered if the police were so corrupt, why didn't they at least harass the Reverand at any point?) James Donovan's J.J. Jones was much more on the mark as Christine's tormentor (although the Irish accent probably would have been more applicable to New York than Los Angeles). Despite his liberal leanings these days, Clint Eastwood will never give up his original moniker as 'Dirty Harry'. He'll always be the man to protect us from the criminal element whether they be ordinary street thugs, corrupt police and government officials, serial killers or (as in his new film, Gran Torino) Asian street gangs! As long as Eastwood continues to see himself as an arbiter of morality, we will continue to endure more melodramatic tales of stereotyped self-righteous victims triumphing over cold-hearted villains.",5,10,19,15 November 2008
Come and See," Apocalyptic vision of Nazi horrors is shocking but perhaps not shocking enough
","After spending a good deal of time wading through many of the reviews of 'Come and See', I've found that there's pretty much a consensus that the 1985 Soviet film about a Nazi massacre in a Byelorussian (Belarus) village is a cinematic masterpiece. There was one review however, that caught my eye where the film critic expressed some reservations and that was Walter Goodman of (believe it or not) The New York Times! He called the film's director, Elem Klimov, a 'master of a sort of unreal realism'. And I agree that this term, 'unreal realism', captures the essence of the director's approach.Daniel Goldhagen in his brilliant book, 'Hitler's Willing Executioneers – Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust', makes the point that Hitler could not have been successful without the overwhelming backing of the ordinary German. The great value of Goldhagen's tome is that he puts a human face on the killers. He describes in detail how police battalions, consisting of ordinary Germans who were given little training and weren't always Nazi party members, were conscripted and fought in tandem with the specialized killing regiments (such as the Eiznsatzgruppen), other SS and SD units as well as the regular Army, during various 'aktions' against the civilian populations (principally Jewish) in Eastern Europe. What I found out from reading Goldhagen's book is that the killers did not have to fear any reprisals if they decided to opt out from participating in the massacres. Quite the contrary, the commanders were only looking for volunteers and for the few who actually were part of a very small minority that found that murdering people made them too queasy, they could be given a much more benign assignment. When they weren't committing heinous crimes, these Germans were involved in ordinary pursuits such as participating in track and field events or going bowling. One officer even brought his wife to witness one of the massacres.Klimov's approach, however, is to view events at a distance. None of the Byelorussian townspeople or partisans are developed into characters of any depth. Similarly, there is little attempt to humanize the Germans (until the end when Klimov does show the SD commander begging for his life and another officer refusing to back down, spouting his racist views). For me, this could have been a more powerful (and of course a very different film) if Klimov gave his characters some personality and perhaps had focused on one particular German antagonist. Instead, ALL the Germans are lumped into a collective mass. By humanizing the killers, the cruelty of the Germans would have proved more up close and personal.Instead Klimov's distancing effect softens the horror. It's as though one is viewing a Hieronymus Bosch painting in a museum and is fascinated by the images of hell the artist has created. We never actually SEE the people who murder Florya's family; the horror is muted as Glasha only catches a fleeting glance of the dead bodies piled against Floyra's house. It's shocking but perhaps not shocking enough! Similarly, we feel nothing for the villagers who presumably fled and whose terrifying escape is never shown (and we never learn how they actually escape to the island across the bog). The great value of Come and See is that Klimov DOES show how the Germans, as a collective mass, actually enjoy what they're doing. The massacre appears as it's a drunken orgy, a macabre carnival, where murder becomes one big joke. That of course is one aspect of the horror and it's quite effectively conveyed in the final scene of the movie. In contrast, since we are not invested in any of the villagers who are herded into the locked building and then machine-gunned and set on fire nor are we acquainted with any of the killers on a personal level, the full import of the horror again feels muted. Yes, there is a shot of the villagers trapped inside, pounding on the door but it's seen from a distance. It's left up to the viewers imagination as to what's happening inside the burning building. Similarly, we see the lone woman who jumps out of the building before the conflagration and is dragged to a truck where she PRESUMABLY is raped as the truck drives off (and more soldiers pile in). Again, it's left to our imagination as to what happens to the poor woman but Klimov spares us the complete import of the horror. To repeat: it's shocking but perhaps not shocking enough.While Klimov focuses on the massacre of the Byelorussians, it should be noted that the first group of people the Germans always singled out for extermination during all their murderous forays, were the Jews. The Jews were considered 'non-human', as opposed to the various Eastern Europeans who were dubbed 'sub-human'. So I was puzzled that Klimov only shows the capture of one lone Jew (yes, it's possible the Jews in the village had already been 'disposed' of before the massacre takes place) but I wonder if that lone Jew would have been given 'special treatment' by the Germans (such as being hung in the Village square for anyone left alive to see), instead of being thrown into the building with the rest of the villagers.Unlike Sean Penn who gushes (as part of the DVD special features) that Come and See is a powerful 'anti-war' movie, I see its strength as more a cautionary tale about Fascism than the more generic polemic against war. I found Florya's loss of innocence perhaps the most 'obvious' part of the film as one would expect that war would have a most deleterious effect upon any child. In the end, one senses that the events were even worse than what is shown here. I agree with the Time's critic's appellation that 'Come and See' is a work of 'unreal realism'; at best a 'noble attempt' but certainly no masterpiece as most have insisted.",6,5,12,2 October 2010
The Monuments Men," Clooney's episodic tale of WW II team of stolen art finders, fails to work dramatically
","'Monuments Men' is based on the true life team assembled during World War II, of museum directors, curators and art historians, assigned to save pieces of art before they were destroyed by the Nazis. According to the article, 'How Accurate is Monuments Men?', featured in Slate Magazine online, the original task of what was to become MFAA (Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives), was to protect historical buildings and not recover works of art. The film is only very loosely based on the true historical events so the question arises, has Mr. George Clooney successfully adapted the story to the silver screen, so that it works dramatically? The answer, unfortunately, is no.'Monuments Men' would have worked much better as a documentary but Clooney was determined to turn this into a rip-roaring action-adventure flick with a few comic interludes. The problem of course is that there is no central antagonist throughout the film. The nature of the mission was that it occurred in different locales and at different times, hence the narrative had to be episodic in nature. So we're introduced to one villain after another--and once each one is disposed of, we move on to the next.'Monuments Men' begins with Frank Stokes (Clooney) assembling his crackerjack team of art experts who must undergo basic training, before they're thrust into combat. It's sort of like 'The Dirty Dozen' with the characters being much more low-key and with little panache. Matt Damon as James Granger is assigned to learn as much as he can from Paris curator Claire Simone (a convincing Cate Blanchett), who kept a journal of all the art work stolen by Viktor Stahl, a Nazi official, who she was forced to work with prior to the German retreat (there is an unlikely scene where Stahl fires his pistol at Claire, as she watches trains loaded with the stolen art work, leave for Germany, from the Paris train station). Later, team members Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), track Stahl down who is disguised as a farmer. Murray and Balaban manage to mine a few laughs as the hapless Stahl is unable to explain away how Rothschild property markings appear on the back of all the paintings he has on the walls of the villa he's staying at. Stahl is then promptly taken into custody.The film also covers the deaths of two team members who are killed in combat. One of the British members, Donald Jeffries, is killed at a Belgian church, as he attempts to prevent one of the Nazis from stealing the famed Michelangelo statute 'Madonna and Child' (the recovery of that particular piece along with the Van Eyck altarpiece, is the central focus of the film's narrative). A French member, Jean Claude Clermont, is also killed when he's caught in the crossfire of a battle (Clermont is an entirely fictional character as there were no French military personnel assigned to the Monuments Men team).We shift back again to James Granger who still must convince Simone to provide information on the stolen artwork (she's miffed as she's now being held as a 'collaborator', despite her clear anti-Nazi sentiments). Granger shows her a copy of Hitler's 'Nero Decree' in which he ordered that 'all military, transportation, communications, industrial, and food supply facilities' be destroyed. Historically, there was nothing about artwork being destroyed in the decree, but obviously, for dramatic purposes, Mr. Clooney added that in. This convinces Simone to finally help Granger and she provides him with her journal that contains all the names and original property owners of artwork stolen by the Nazis. By including artwork in the 'Nero Decree', (as mentioned in Slate Magazine), Historian Elizabeth Campbell Karlsgodt points out that this was inserted in order to move the plot forward; the Monuments men are seen 'racing against the Germans who are set now to destroy the art if Hitler can't have it.' Karlsgodt doesn't even believe that the Monuments Men even knew about the Nero Decree during their mission: 'The systematic destruction (as seen in the film) being carried out as a result of the Nero Decree never happened,' she says. 'Nazis destroyed art that they considered degenerate, like Cubist, Surrealist, Expressionist paintings, and we know that they burned several thousand— at least—paintings that they thought were actually toxic to the German spirit (But) they didn't destroy the art they valued.' (This included Germanic art, and the Ghent Altarpiece depicted in the film, which Hitler considered to be an example of 'Aryan genius.') The rest of 'Monuments Men' feels rushed. The team uncovers the 'mother lode' of stolen artwork in a salt mine as well as gold from teeth extracted from Jews sent to the concentration camps. Later they find another mine where the Michelangelo's 'Madonna' is located. The drama is manufactured when they're forced to remove the stolen artwork (including the Madonna) just before the Soviets arrive in the occupation zone designated for them. In reality, the Monuments Men had plenty of time to remove the artwork from the cave—a matter of days and not hours, as depicted in the film.Clooney gets his last licks in as he interrogates the Nazi colonel responsible for stealing and destroying a good deal of the pilfered artwork. In the case of both Nazis and Monuments Men alike, they're only on for a short time and there's no opportunity for the film's scenarists to develop any of the characters. Karlsgodt feels that the film's focus on Michelangelo's 'Madonna' and the Ghent Altarpiece undermines the true significance of Hitler's plans and their connection to the Holocaust. Quoted in Slate Magazine, she remarks, 'It leaves out a really crucial aspect of this history. Hitler saw it as a key way to seize the assets of Jews. He was not only eliminating Jewish influence, he was also getting their art.'",4,1,2,2 March 2014
Captain Phillips," Suspenseful high sea rescue drama succeeds in spite of slight slowdown after the midpoint
","'Captain Phillips' is British director Paul Greengrass' convincing recreation of the kidnapping and subsequent rescue of Merchant Marine Captain Richard Phillips by Somali pirates in 2009. Greengrass manages to make things quite believable by no sleight of hand. Firstly, he films most of the story on the high seas, utilizing a sister container ship, filling in for the Maersk Alabama, which four Somali pirates managed to board as it made its way to Mombassa, Kenya in the Indian Ocean.Greengrass employed three other successful strategies to give the film a heady verisimilitude. There is of course the casting of Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips, a no-nonsense New Englander, who heroically survived a brutal kidnapping. Hanks conveys Phillips' stoicism early on as he ensures that his crew practice drills to prepare themselves for any potential pirate incursions (notably Phillips dispenses with the stoic demeanor at the end of his ordeal and becomes very emotional--probably Hanks' best scene in the entire film). It should be noted that Phillips' crew in real-life, faulted their captain for sailing too close to the Somali coast, which they alleged, put them all at risk. But I believe Phillips' analysis when he comments early on in a meeting with the crew, that they could have been thousands of miles from the coast, and still could have been subject to attack.Greenbrass also utilizes the sister ship of the USS Bainbride, the Truxtun, along with most of the Navy crew, who also make the eventual rescue operation quite believable. Finally, the casting of the four Somali pirates, neophyte Somali-born actors, who moved to the US when they were young, and who Greengrass found after a casting call in Minneapolis, added greatly to the film's overall realism.The expository scene where Phillips says goodbye to his wife at the airport, goes on a tad bit too long but things are off and running when he arrives for duty as skipper on the Maersk Alabama in the port of Salalah in Oman. Greengrass then cuts to Somalia where the inciting incident occurs. The four pirates led by Muse (aka 'Skinny'), who eventually successfully board the Maersk and kidnap Phillips, along with another group of pirates, are beholden to a syndicate (headed by a warlord). While they are forced to do this gang's bidding, they don't go grudgingly, as engaging in such nefarious activities as a pirate is viewed as a 'badge of honor'. Once Phillips is on board the Maersk Alabama, we become privy to just how much knowledge is needed to run a container ship of that size. The first half of 'Captain Phillips' involves the attack and subsequent boarding of the ship by the pirates. As depicted (and as it happened during the actual event), the first attempt to board the ship was a failure. Phillips ends up bluffing one pirate group back to their mother ship after pretending that the American Navy is already on their way. The second group, headed by Muse, decides to try again, and using a ladder, manages this time to successfully board the Maersk. All this appears quite exciting on screen and in watching the Blu-ray extra documentary about the making of 'Captain Phillips' afterward, one must commend Mr. Greengrass for not only his technical expertise in filming the attack scenes but also directing actors who had no actual prior experience manning skiffs on the high seas.Most of the events depicted in 'Captain Phillips' actually happened but here and there, scenes are concocted for dramatic effect. I'm thinking particularly of the scene where the Maersk crew intentionally leave shards of broken glass near where they're hiding below deck, which leads to the injury of one of the pirates after he steps on the glass, cutting his foot. After Muse is captured by the Maersk crew and the exchange for Captain Phillips goes awry, the second half of the film begins. The scene inside the cramped lifeboat is perhaps the weakest. Greengrass attempts to establish the personal relationship that develops between Muse and Phillips with Muse claiming that Western companies destroyed their livelihood as fisherman by basically cleaning out the ocean's stock and Phillips rightfully maintaining that no way in the world, Muse and his unpleasant band, were fishermen. The pirates argue over a lack of the local narcotic khat and Phillips attempts to put a bandage on the injured foot of one of the pirates (again, an injury which did not happen during the actual event). There's little tension in the lifeboat scene and Greengrass probably should have compressed it, perhaps partially as a montage, utilizing the film's tension-producing score.Things pick up again with the arrival of the Bainbridge and the exciting sequence of events, leading to the rescue of Captain Phillips. Before three of the pirates are taken out by Navy marksmen and Muse is tricked into boarding the Bainbridge, to 'negotiate' a ransom, Hanks acquits himself quite nicely where he attempts to escape by diving off the lifeboat and swimming for his life. Greengrass doubles down on the suspense when the pirates tie Phillips up and put a gun to his head, right before they're dispensed with.Greengrass makes a big point of not being jingoistic after the SEALS take down three of the four pirate crew. Nonetheless, one cannot completely disagree with Andrew O'hehir, writing in Salon magazine, when he remarks that 'Captain Phillips', has the 'calm technological blankness of a Navy commercial, without the 1970s waka-waka guitar.' AS O'hehir sees it, there are 'billions of dollars of cutting-edge military hardware and hundreds of corn-fed, gym-toned Americans on one side, four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs on the other.'Still, one can see no justification for piracy. The emotional impact on Phillips is evident in the great final scene as Phillips begins sobbing, as he's being treated by Navy medical personnel. It's a compelling ending to the suspense that comes before.",7,0,1,4 May 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Quirky high school student misfits placed on pedestal by film's misguided Writer/Director
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is based on Writer/Director Steven Chbosky's 1999 novel of the same name. It actually would be better titled, 'The Perks of Being a Victim'. Set in 1991 Pittsburgh, 'Perks' is the coming of age story of 16 year old high school freshman 'Charlie', played by 20 year old actor, Logan Lerman.Charlie the Wallflower is an introverted kid who feels ostracized on his first day of high school. It doesn't take long for Charlie to find a clique which he can fit into--a group of senior class 'Bohemian' types led by Patrick (Ezra Miller) and step-sister Sam (Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame). Patrick is gay, carrying on a clandestine affair with one of the stars of the high school football team. When the shop teacher calls Patrick 'Patty' and he responds, 'You can call me Patrick or nothing,' the teacher pours coals on the fire by insulting him further by calling him 'nothing'(I had no idea that a school teacher would face no consequences for bullying a pupil in such a way--even in 1991!). After all the baddies (mainly high school jocks) begin calling Patrick 'Nothing', most of the rest of the kids in the school follow suit. 'Wallflower' Charlie, who also feels ostracized, ends up sticking up for perennial victim Patrick. Completely out of character (and with improbable superhuman strength), Charlie ends up knocking out half of the high school football team after they set upon Patrick in the school cafeteria (okay maybe I'm exaggerating--it wasn't half the team but notice that the awkward editing prevents us from actually seeing exactly how Charlie thwarts the entire assault on Patrick). Chbosky's characters are no different than many other films that feature a coterie of quirky characters which Patrick refers to as the 'Island of Toy Misfits'. As is usual for these films involving a clique of quirky characters, they're pitted against an unsavory group of reactionaries (in this case, jocks, along with a bunch of young, belligerent allies). Of course you can count on the quirky kids to have some mild flaws, while the group that hates them, are all pretty unsavory and despicable. What sets Chbosky's quirky misfits apart from other recent quirky characters of this ilk, is that their machinations are firmly ensconced in the era of the early 90s. If there is any charm in this heavy-handed film, it's all in the allusions to the pre-internet era. Do you remember 'Mixtapes'? The kids mix their favorite songs on cassette tapes and pass them around to each other. The quirky kids also have a penchant for the avant-garde--participating in live presentations during weekly screenings of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.Perhaps the central failing of 'Perks' is Chbosky's paper thin plot. Most of the film focuses on Charlie's puerile infatuation with Sam and all of that silly puppy love he has no desire to suppress. Why should we really care for Charlie's obsession with Sam, especially when her character is so poorly developed? Just about the only thing we learn about her is that she was molested as a child and raped by boys who get her drunk--events confirming her status as perennial victim).There is also a comic sub-plot (few laughs!) involving Charlie's brief 'romance' with 'Mary Elizabeth', a Buddhist and vegan whose big mistake is to go out with a guy like Charlie, who is clearly obsessed with 'another woman' from the get go. Charlie's obsession is made clear during the 'truth or dare' scene where he kisses Sam on the lips in front of Mary Elizabeth (this elicited a gasp from the mostly teen-aged audience populating the theater I attended).Obviously Charlie's one-note infatuation and the 'us vs. them' theme was not enough to carry an entire movie, so Chbosky had to throw in some cheap melodrama to tidy things up. I'm referring of course to Charlie's mental problems, stemming from the traumatic death of his aunt when he was a child and the purported sexual abuse he endured at the hands of said aunt before her said demise. After this 'setback' (where he joins hands as a full-fledged victim with his fellow sufferer, Patrick), he can now work his way 'back' to sanity and eventually pretentiously declare along with his fellow quirky misfits (with a straight face), 'we are infinite' (as he stares up at the sky through the roof of Patrick and Sam's pickup, hurtling through a tunnel).It's no accident that 'Perks' was produced by the very same people who gave us 'Juno', that revolting anti-abortion tearjerker. Nonetheless, 'Perks' is not a complete lost cause. Despite being acted by actors chronologically older than the high school students they portray, they uniformly do a pretty good job. Ezra Miller steals the show as the flamboyant Patrick and Paul Rudd is memorable as the sagacious and helpful English teacher. I guarantee that all those who loved 'Perks' also loved 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Both promote the unhealthy idea of a coterie of quirky misfits who are superior to a group of stick-figure reactionaries pitted against them. By promoting this illusory dichotomy, Mr. Chbosky has done a disservice to true Bohemians everywhere--certainly such true libertarians do not perceive themselves as victims and would not like other misguided souls such as Mr. Chbosky, to impugn them with such a label.",3,18,50,22 September 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Creepy conspiracy theorist is right for once in this entertaining 'Twilight Zone-like' thriller
","10 Cloverfield Lane is aptly named a 'psychological horror film' in Wikipedia. It's akin to a good Twilight Zone episode and features some top notch performances.
Nonetheless, the film starts off on shaky footing. We're introduced to the protagonist Michelle, played by a gritty and convincing Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She's just broken up with her boyfriend and gets into a terrible car accident, only to find herself waking up in an underground bunker, where she's chained to a bed by a creepy conspiracy theorist Howard, played equally convincingly by John Goodman.
It's not exactly very compelling that Howard has chained Michelle to a bed but the restraints aren't tight enough to prevent her from getting to her belongings on the other side of the room and ultimately fashioning a weapon from a crutch, which she uses to attack him.
What's more, at one point she sets a fire to draw Howard into the room to attack him without thinking that she might be overcome first by the smoke.
And why doesn't Howard tell her right away what's going on? Obviously the film scenarists want you to believe that Howard intends to keep Michelle as a sex slave or perhaps end up torturing her.
When we finally do find out why Howard keeps Michelle prisoner, the sci-fi twist is introduced. Howard claims that he's protecting her as there has been an invasion (possibly by aliens) up above on the surface and they'll need to stay in the bunker indefinitely.
The idea that Michelle is being kept as some kind of sex slave loses credence when we discover that there's a third person in the bunker: one Emmett, a young man who claims he's worked for Howard doing odd jobs in the past. Emmett also believes earth has been invaded as he witnessed an unexplained explosion prior to gaining safe refuge with Howard.
Michelle finally becomes convinced that Howard is on the level after climbing through a narrow vent (she's the only one who can do that due to her size) in order to repair a malfunctioning air pump. While in this secluded area of the bunker, she is startled by a desperate woman on the outside who appears to have lesions on her face and is pounding on the window to get in. Michelle ultimately doesn't allow the woman in and now believes Howard's claims that something dreadful indeed has occurred on the earth's surface.
The tension is further exacerbated after Michelle discovers that a young woman whom Howard refers to as his daughter is actually another woman who disappeared two years prior. While Howard's conspiracy theories about space aliens might be true, it's also become apparent that indeed Howard is a dangerous sexual predator.
Michelle's determination to escape the bunker reaches its apotheosis after Howard shoots Emmett to death after realizing that he's been plotting to stop Howard and escape with Michelle.
You can probably guess that Michelle does indeed escape, killing Howard in the process. Nonetheless, there is still a third act here which turns this film into sci-fi and not only as part of a horror genre.
Yes indeed there are actual bad looking aliens attacking humans on the earth's surface and Michelle narrowly escapes being done in by one who's piloting a space ship. It's all a little bit hokey but following the entertaining saga with Howard, one feels satisfied that the ultimate question as to how truthful Howard has been with all his conspiracy theories, has been answered.
If you're not too busy, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entertaining diversion. Goodman as the creepy Howard is right on the mark and Winstead as the intrepid Michelle will make feminists proud! If you like Twilight Zone, this story is certainly a decent enough approximation.",7,0,1,22 November 2018
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Incredulity
","When Dan Evans, one-legged Civil War veteran and impoverished rancher is having one of his barns burned down by his landlord and about to be evicted because he is unable to pay the rent, things seem credible enough. But soon, '3:10 to Yuma' stops making any sense at all. For starters, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his gang of cut-throats have little trouble in stopping a stagecoach protected by a crackerjack team of heavily armed guards contracted by the Pinkertons. To boot, the stagecoach is equipped with the new-fangled Gatling (machine) gun. Despite the heavy artillery, the escort is no match for Wade and his boys with the help of a sharpshooter in the hills who never misses. Okay, then there's the leader of the Pinkerton group, Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) who's entrusted to deliver the stagecoach cache of money to a nearby town. When Wade's psychopathic lieutenant Charlie Prince (convincingly played by Ben Foster) shoots McElroy point blank in the stomach, he doesn't die but merely doubles over. Although Wade is supposed to be this crazy outlaw responsible for a string of outlandish heists and murders, he really isn't that badhe's one of those touchy-feely bad guys with a chivalrous heart underneath. Inexplicably, he lets McElroy live. But just to show that he also has a dark side, murders one of his own men when a surviving member of the stagecoach posse takes the man hostage (Wade shoots both men). Wade first meets Evans and his two kids who have been watching the robbery of the stagecoach from afar. Even though they're witnesses to his nefarious deeds, Wade lets them go and apologetically takes their horses and lets them know where they can find them later. Even though Wade is supposed to be this brilliant criminal, he's easily trapped by local law enforcement after he tarries too long in the town with a barmaid he suddenly has the hots for. Instead of locking Wade up locally and paying for a more professional team of law enforcement or Federal soldiers to help him, Grayson Butterfield, the Southern Pacific Railroad's representative, decides to conscript Evans, McElroy and a couple of other miscreants to march Wade through hostile Indian territory where they can catch the '3:10 to Yuma' and have him transported to where he can be put on trial. Their plan is to first stop off at the Evans ranch where they create a diversion, making Wade's gang believe that they're taking Wade in a stagecoach in the opposite direction but actually have Wade remain at the ranch where he has a nice but long-winded conversation with Wade's impressionable wife. Even though they're all afraid of the mighty power of Wade's men (with the memory of the defeat of the Pinkerton group fresh in their minds), they believe this particular stagecoach can outrun the gang all the way to a local fort. Sure enough, the gang outruns the coach, kills all the drivers and chains the Wade decoy inside the stagecoach and burns him to death. What a brilliant plan! On the way through the aforementioned hostile Indian territory, McElroy keeps chugging along despite having been shot point blank in the stomach. Wade kills McElroy after we learn that McElroy was not such a good guy after all (he murdered a bunch of Apache women and children in cold blood). Somehow every time Wade kills someone it's justified because his victims are far more morally tainted than he (Wade kills another one of the posse escorting him after we learn that this is the man who was principally responsible for burning Evan's barn down). By the time we reach the town of Contention where the 3:10 to Yuma is about to arrive, we realize that all the townspeople are a bunch of cowards who are willing to accept $200 a pop by Wade's gang to kill Evans and the local sheriff and deputies who have volunteered to help Butterfield. Not only are all the townspeople in Contention browbeaten but the sheriff and his deputies also surrender their weapons to the gang (only to be blown away seconds later). You can watch one of the extras on the DVD and discover that some of the most notorious outlaws in the history of the old west were taken down by the local citizenry who were outraged by their antics. But not so here in '3:10 to Yuma'. When Evans singlehandedly attempts to move Wade to the train station where he can put him in the prison car, Wade cooperates and never tries to run away. Wade's gang fires round after round at BOTH Evans and Wade without regard to hitting their boss. Finally, when Charlie shoots Evans at the climax of the movie, Wade suddenly becomes a man of conscience and finishes off Charlie and the rest of his gang and then places himself in the prison car without batting an eyelash. If you watch the DVD Extras, you'll get a fascinating look at how they put this movie together. There's some nice cinematography, passable performances and costumes but many of the scenes are incredibly drawn out (Wade's conversation with Evans's wife at the homestead and conversation with Evans at the hotel for example) and as I have already argued, a plot that makes little sense. Given the money that was put into this project, strictly from a writing standpoint, '3:10' is a decided failure!",4,15,25,31 October 2008
Source Code," Sci-fi 'Groundhog Day' lacks verisimilitude
","The concept where a particular past juncture in time is re-visited in order to effect a change in future circumstances, was marvelously handled in the brilliant comedy-fantasy, 'Groundhog Day'. 'Source Code' utilizes a similar concept, but here it should basically be subsumed under the genre of Sci-fi Thriller. Unlike 'Groundhog Day', which repeatedly brings a time-tripping Bill Murray back to the past by sleight of hand, 'Source Code' provides a pseudo-scientific rationale, which proves in the end to be decidedly derivative of other time travel tales we've seen before.Our protagonist, former Army helicopter pilot, Colter Stevens, now severely injured and in a comatose state, is being used as part of a secret US Army project dubbed 'Source Code', to uncover the identity of an individual who bombed a Chicago commuter train, earlier that day. The creator of the project, Dr. Rutledge, and his assistant, Air Force Captain Goodwin, repeatedly keep sending Stevens back eight minutes prior to the bombing inside an experimental device which resembles a space capsule, in order to find out who planted the bomb so they can stop him from detonating an even more destructive dirty bomb in downtown Chicago, which the bomber has promised to do an hour later.Stevens learns that he's unable to change events in the future reality which Goodwin and Rutledge are a part of, and is only able to be an observer. The Source Code enables Stevens to enter the body of one of the now deceased victims, Sean Fentress, and move about on the train in a parallel universe. While the basic events in each alternate time line are the same (the bomber always plants the bomb in the same place), due to Stevens/Fentress acting differently in each time line, the exact sequence of events is changed. The concept derives from 'Groundhog Day', where the core events end up as variations on a theme. The interactive aspect of the protagonist's abilities, can also be likened to the Star Trek holodeck, where a user is able to interact with a series of images which are mere projections of reality.One can argue with all the pseudo-scientific explanations but the films' scenarists are basically asking the audience to suspend one's disbelief when it comes to the main premise. For some this is a big problem, but I found other areas of the film to take issue with. One of screenwriter Ben Ripley's big quandaries is how to develop Stevens' character arc in eight minute segments. You'll recall that Bill Murray's 'Phil' character in 'Groundhog Day' was a narcissist who needed to learn an important life's lesson about being a nice guy. He has a whole day (repeated multiple times) to transform himself. Here, we learn virtually nothing about Fentress as his back story is a cypher. When Stevens becomes Fentress, Ripley has him gradually warming up to the film's love interest, Christina Warren, after he acts gruffly toward her when Stevens makes his first 'time trip'. But Stevens/Fentress acts badly at first because Stevens is disoriented not because he has a character defect. So the transformation seems unnecessary and forced since Steven's only real goal is to prevent the bomber from causing further havoc.Equally less charming are the assorted characters Stevens must deal with on the train and the methods he employs to find out whether they might be the particular villain he's looking for. Again, a comparison to 'Groundhog Day' is instructive. All of the characters Phil interacts with in the Groundhog Day universe, are utterly quirky and charming. Here, they're stereotypical--either obnoxious (bad comedian) or ineffectual (computer geek). What's more, Ripley lacks the imagination to come up with a series of interesting variants. All Stevens/Fentress ends up doing is awkwardly confronting each one of his suspects by ripping the bags they're carrying and spilling the contents on the ground and getting into some kind of physical or verbal confrontation.Perhaps the biggest clue that 'Source Code' lacks gravitas, is in its choice of a convincing antagonist. Heaven forbid that Mr. Ripley would attempt to create a bad guy rooted in today's headlines. Instead of perhaps an Al Qaeda sympathizer, we're presented with a Mad Bomber of the 1950s dressed up as a modern day disaffected techie. When both the bad guys and the good guys in your movie don't seem very real, the stakes aren't very high and hence the tension on the 'suspense' meter, has got to be very low!Finally, there's the whole question of a so-called 'twist ending' that doesn't seem to be very surprising at all. Remember, according to the rules of the alternate time line, changing events in a parallel universe, cannot change anything in the present real world. So when Stevens sends the text message to Goodwin that he's stopped the bomber and that the Source Code experiment worked, and Goodwin and Rutledge aren't even aware that any of those events have transpired, that's not the same world we experienced at the beginning of the film. Rather, it's an alternate universe where the 'happy ending' of Sean and Christina walking off into the sunset, is a reality. One other thing that did bother a lot of other people who have posted on the internet, is what happened to Sean once Stevens takes over his consciousness? I guess he's left screaming, inside the mirror!Back in the real world, the reality of the train bombing remains unchanged. We do wonder, after all those time jumps, did Stevens have enough time to actually communicate the information about the bomber to Rutledge and Goodwin? Couldn't the bomber have easily driven to downtown Chicago and set off his dirty bomb given how much time Stevens was taking with his jumps and inside the capsule?Source Code looks and feels more like a movie made exclusively for the Syfy channel. It keeps your interest in a basic way but certainly doesn't deserve all the accolades heaped upon it to date.",4,1,3,24 June 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall fails to pass the three 'G' test (Girls, Gadgets and a Goldfinger)
","This is Daniel Craig's third performance as James Bond--why can't it be his last? Craig is a decent actor who should never have been cast as James Bond in the first place. He's certainly excellent when it comes to the physical requirements of the job as it appears he doesn't shy away from giving it his all in the action scenes. But he exudes little wit which is a key important component of this iconic role. This is borne out by Craig's reported professed desire to have his contract bought out since he's been quoted as saying that he finds acting as James Bond to be 'boring.'For a James Bond film to be successful, it needs the three g's (Good girls, gadgets and a Goldfinger). Skyfall pretty much fails in all three departments. Take the 'girls' for instance. Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny is quite pleasant to look at but is given little to do here as agent in the field turned secretary. Initially, we're led to believe that she'll be an integral part of the plot, Bond's 'point man' in the exciting chase scene where he battles mercenary/assassin Patrice on top of a speeding train. After botching the shot that takes out Bond instead of Patrice (how Bond survives the shot and subsequent fall off a bridge is never really explained), Eve is relegated to office work and has little more direct interaction with Bond for the rest of the film.Then there's Bérénice Lim Marlohe as Sévérine, a concubine of sorts of the Skyfall villain, Raoul Silva. Unfortunately Marlohe does not get the opportunity to show her stuff as an independent 'Bond woman' as she is petrified of Silva and hints that she will soon meet her own demise. There is a perfunctory shower scene with Bond on her yacht which is mercifully short. The end comes rather quickly when Silva dispatches Sévérine on the island with a bullet to the head. It would have been much more tasteful if Director Sam Mendes had chosen to depict the killing off screen but when has Sam Mendes ever been known for being tasteful? As far as gadgets, 'Skyfall' is even more disappointing in that department. The young and geeky Ben Wishaw, has now taken up the mantle of a modern day 'Q', the quartermaster of the MI6 spy service. He even spells it out quite succinctly when he tells Bond there are no fancy gadgets this time around. Instead, we're left with a miniature radio tracking device and a gun that will not fire unless it recognizes Bond's palm print. Q of course is a computer expert and he stands around trying to hack into bad guy's computer or prevent being hacked himself. The yawn factor is in full force as we've been privy to all this computer mumbo-jumbo, oh so many times before! Finally there's a 'Goldfinger': If the Bond antagonist is not larger than life, with the much needed ubiquitous charm, it's hardly likely that a Bond film can be truly successful. Unfortunately, Javier Bardem as the aforementioned Silva, hardly inspires confidence as a truly endearing Bond villain. Silva is merely a former MI6 agent who improbably was given up by M (Judi Dench) to the Chinese in exchange for a coterie of MI6 double agents. His goal is to take revenge on M as he blames her for his subsequent imprisonment and torture at the hands of MI6 opponents.For some reason, Silva acquires super powers of sorts after being released by the Chinese and now has the ability to hack into any computer, resulting first in the ridiculous theft of a list of all undercover NATO agents in terrorist organizations and subsequent bombing of MI6 headquarters itself. If that isn't absurd enough, computer genius Silva escapes from MI6 custody and then attacks politicians where M is giving testimony at a public inquiry.'Skyfall' of course does not refer to jumping out of a plane but rather, Bond's family estate where he grew up as a child. After Silva's failed try at assassinating M at the public inquiry, she decides the only way to capture the former agent is leave an electronic trail (facilitated by Q) where Silva can find her. Holed up at Skyfall is Bond, M and Kincade, the gamekeeper at the estate. Silva attacks in two waves: the first is a group of his henchmen, all wiped out by Bond and company, utilizing primitive weapons found inside the Bond mansion (how crazy Silva manages to get all his confederates to follow him, is a mystery to me). Silva then makes his grand appearance via a helicopter, which of course is shot down after Bond detonates a couple of gas canisters. Later, Bond falls through the ice and engages in a death struggle with Silva's last henchman. Like the earlier scene where he survives Eve's errant shot, it's unclear how Bond manages to extricate himself from the icy pond, after being submerged in icy water for so long.I suppose it is appropriate that Silva should meet his end not as a result of a technological advantage but simply due to the flick of an old-fashioned knife into the back. There are other satisfying moments in 'Skyfall' including some dazzling opening credits, a sultry opening number sung by Adele, the aforementioned Bond/Patrice fight on top of the speeding train, lovely panoramas shot in Istanbul and Shanghai, another unlikely but exciting train crash in the London Underground and the big fight to the death action scenes on the Skyfall estate.I have no idea whether Judi Dench also wanted out of her contract and it was her suggestion to finish off 'M' with her playing the role. Let's hope that Mr. Craig follows suit and the producers then conscript new writers and a director. With a new team, the next 'Bond' can be much better than this current hokey effort.",4,8,19,17 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Engaging drama and fascinating history lesson
","Who knew? Dowdy Queen Victoria, the plump Monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. 'The Young Victoria' not only chronicles the young Queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.The Act I 'set-up' draws you in right away. Following the death of Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent in 1820, less than a year after Victoria's birth, the Duchess of Kent eventually hooked up with former Army Officer John Conroy, who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen-to-be. Conroy insisted that Victoria be raised under the atrocious 'Kensington system', rules designed to prevent the future Queen from having any contact with other children while growing up. What's more, Victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became Queen.The film explains that in 1830 Parliament passed the Regency Act, which established that Victoria's mother would become regent (and hence Guardian) in the event that Victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor. During this time, the Duchess and Conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making Conroy her private secretary and treasurer. Strong-willed Victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with Conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans. The Duchess disliked King William as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the Monarchy; the King felt the Duchess disrespected his wife. As a result, the Duchess attempted to limit Victoria's contact with the King. In an over-the-top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history, the King berated the Duchess at his birthday banquet, stating that it was his goal to survive until Victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.King William kept his word and died a short time after Victoria became eligible to accede to the throne. Victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of Conroy, whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable. They were both banished to a secluded apartment in Buckingham Palace and for a number of years Victoria had little contact with her mother.'The Young Victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding Victoria's coronation as Queen. A good part of the film deals with Victoria's relationship with Lord Melbourne, the Whig Party Prime Minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was. In the beginning Melbourne gains the young Queen's trust and they become good friends. In the early years of her reign, she sees Melbourne as a progressive, but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician, hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing. In reality, Melbourne was more a father figure to Victoria, but the film hints at some sexual tension between the Prime Minister and Prince Albert, as though they were romantic rivals.The plot thickens when Melbourne is forced out and the Queen must commission Sir Robert Peel, of the more conservative Tory party, as the new Prime Minister. The film chronicles the events of 'The Bedchamber Crisis' in which Peel resigned after Victoria refused to replace some of her Bedchamber ladies with the wives of Tory politicians. The film leaves out another scandal which involved a Lady Hastings, one of the Duchess's ladies-in-waiting who was accused of having an affair with John Conroy and becoming pregnant by him. Because of her hatred for Conroy, Victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about Hastings' alleged pregnancy. As it turned out, Hastings only appeared pregnant—what she actually had was an abdominal tumor. Victoria's inexperience shows during the Bedchamber Crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the Hastings Affair.The rest of the 'The Young Victoria' deals with -- of course -- the romance between the Queen and Prince Albert. Victoria kept Albert waiting, as the film makes clear, since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new Sovereign. They spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until Albert returned to England and gave Victoria support during the trying times of the Bedchamber Crisis.I find a good number of parallels between Prince Albert and Prince Philip, the current Queen's husband. While Philip is mainly Danish, he went to school in Germany and had in-laws who were of German background. Both Albert and Philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the Court (there's a great scene where Albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for King George III even though he had been dead for years!). Albert's struggle was the same for Philip—as husbands of Monarchs, they had to find something to do. Both Albert and Philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever-popular wives.Fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where Albert infuriates Victoria with what she perceives as his 'interference' in her affairs. Albert doesn't want a second 'Bedchamber Crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving Victoria's bedchamber ladies. Victoria is barely talking to Albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down (in the film Albert is shot in the arm but this never happened!).The performances in the film are uniformly excellent, especially the principals, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. The Young Victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography (no mention of Victoria's depression after Albert's death). But 'Victoria' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson.",8,2,4,4 January 2010
The Hangover," Bizarre tale of Bachelor Party revelers' memory loss proves to be sleeper comedy hit of 2009
","Before seeing 'The Hangover', I heard that it was about some guys who hold a bachelor party in Las Vegas. I was expecting a night of ribaldry, chronicling the bachelor party (along the lines of 'Superbad'--except with the characters being a bit older). But the great thing about 'The Hangover' is that all the action happens AFTER the bachelor party occurs, the next day. It's a tremendously clever idea where the comedy is in the unraveling of the mystery as to what happened to the protagonists during a bachelor party which they cannot recall.In the Act One setup, we're first introduced to the principals: Doug is about to be married and along with his brother-in-law, the off-the-wall Alan, joined by Doug's buddies, Stu, a dentist, and Phil, an elementary school teacher, decide to go to Las Vegas two days before the wedding for a surreptitious bachelor party. We then cut to five hours before the wedding, with Phil making a desperate call to Doug's fiancé informing her that they've lost Doug and it looks like the wedding is off. Then we flashback to the revelers' arrival at Caesar's Palace in Vegas, where they go up to the hotel roof where loose cannon Alan toasts Doug by cutting himself with a knife—he invites everyone to join in a little blood letting as a sort of initiation rite but the others turn him down as they all think Alan is a little bit off the wall.The break into Act Two occurs with Alan, Stu and Phil waking up in a trashed hotel room sans Doug. To make matters worse, there's a live tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby in the kitchen and Stu the Dentist is missing a tooth. They go downstairs and give the parking valet a stub, only to have him drive up with a police car, with the valet addressing the bumbling threesome as 'officers' and 'wishing them a good day'.Soon it becomes clear why Alan, Stu and Phil can't remember anything that happened the night before. Alan thought he was slipping a tab of ecstasy into their drinks but it turns out that it was Rohypnol (aka 'Roofies'), a date rape drug, which he bought from a confused drug dealer (also named Doug who later figures in the plot). I'm not sure if I recall the exact sequence of what happens next but basically the three end up at a wedding chapel where they discover that the night before Stu got hitched to a Vegas stripper. They locate her and fortunately she's the baby's mother. When the bumbling buddies return to their hotel room, waiting for them there is Mike Tyson himself along with one of his handlers. It seems that the boys stole Tyson's pet tiger and in a rather amusing scene, drug the tiger and drive it back to Big Mike's mansion. More outrageous obstacles soon are placed in the protagonists' way.It seems that the night before, Alan was playing craps with a Chinese gangster, Mr. Chow. He ends up taking off with Chow's gambling winnings amounting to $80,000. Chow and his thugs confront Alan, Stu and Phil and reveal that they are holding Doug and demand that they come up with his money or else they'll never see their buddy again. In one of the few long-winded scenes in the film, Alan wins $80,000 by employing card counting techniques while playing blackjack back at the casino. They all drive out to the desert where they give Chow the money but he hands over a black guy named Doug who happens to be the drug dealer who sold Alan the 'roofies'.We're back at the point where the flashback began toward the beginning of the film. Phil is calling Doug's fiancé informing her that Doug cannot be located and the wedding is off. But suddenly Stu figures it all out. Earlier, the guys had noticed that Doug's mattress was impaled on the obelisk in front of the hotel. He realizes that Doug could not have thrown the mattress from the hotel windows since they don't open—the only conclusion is that they had brought Doug up to the roof the night before and he's been stuck up there since nightfall. All's well that ends well when the prospective groom and his three buddies drive back to Los Angeles just in time for the wedding (in a hilarious scene while they're driving on the highway, they have their tuxedos thrown to them from a tuxedo company van--obviously having ordered the tuxes beforehand from the car, using a cell phone and credit card). The final scene is one of the best—they discover a digital camera with all the pictures of the groups' hi-jinx the night before. They all agree to look at the pictures once and then erase all of them. As the credits roll, the pictures reveal the machinations of the bumbling threesome during their crazed night out on the town.Of all the characters, I thought Stu the dentist was the funniest. We finally do find out how he lost that tooth—and the scene where he stands up to his overbearing girlfriend at the film's climax was hilarious. I expected a little more with Alan's character as he was introduced as to be the really crazy one at the beginning—but somehow I wanted him to do even more crazy things at the end. Kudos especially to Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow, the foul-mouthed Chinese gangster, who was truly a hoot! Some of the jokes in 'The Hangover' don't always hit the mark—the bit about the police tasering the hapless trio in front of a bunch of schoolchildren just seemed a little too much. Nonetheless, 'The Hangover' has proved to be the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 with its one welcome bizarre situation after another.",7,1,2,14 March 2010
Deepwater Horizon," Despite lugubrious first half, chronicle of oil rig explosion and heroic crew member actions, hits the mark
","If you want to learn about the greatest oil spill ever as well as the greatest environmental disaster in US history, Deepwater Horizon is the film to watch. The most incredible thing about this film is the set—a reproduction of the semi-submersible Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) which blew up—it's as if you're watching the real thing!Deepwater is basically a great technical achievement. As far as the story—a good part of it has a documentary feel. Our protagonist is the real-life Chief Electronics Techician Mike Williams played by Mark Wahlberg. Early on we meet his wife and young daughter and unfortunately the beginning of the film is quite lugubrious as there isn't much drama involving William's family life. Only after Williams ships out to the oil rig do things become moderately interesting. Director Peter Berg, utilizing inter-titles, informs us that the rig is run by a private contractor, Transocean, and led by the stalwart safety engineer, 'Mr. Jimmy' (played by a convincing Kurt Russell). Ironically the day the rig blew up, Mr. Jimmy was receiving an award for his excellent safety record on the rig.A conflict erupts between Mr. Jimmy and the BP (British Petroleum) Manager Donald Vidrine (played by a not so recognizable John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy wants Vidrine to conduct a 'pressure test' which will ensure the stability of the entire platform. Vidrine really wants to cut corners and gives a not so plausible explanation as to why he feels the test isn't necessary.I've read that Vidrine actually didn't give the orders not to conduct the test —that was attributed to some other manager; ultimately, it was BP execs offshore who had the final word on that. But Vidrine makes a nice foil to Kurt Russell's character so there is a bit of dramatic license taken here.No need to go into great detail as far as the depiction of the explosion and its aftermath. Suffice it to say that Wahlberg does an excellent job highlighting William's heroic actions saving crew members as well as himself by jumping from the rig into water laced with burning oil.If disaster movies are your thing, then Deepwater Horizon should be for you. As a fitting memorial to those who perished (11 in total), director Berg makes good on depicting the sacrifice involved. A good half of the movie is exposition but there's enough heroic derring-do to keep you glued to your seat in the second half.",7,0,0,1 May 2017
It," King's entertaining pre-pubescent 'losers club' undermined by repetitious clown antagonist and clichéd horror plot
","Set in the late 80s, Director Andy Muschietti's second adaptation of a Stephen King novel (the first one was a 1990 TV mini-series), takes place in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. What keeps the film from drifting too far ashore as mediocre pabulum (or worse—a series of one clichéd horror film trope after another), is the hard-edged Stephen King worldview and his engaging characters (despite their one-dimensionality).Right away King treats us to an event straight out of a lurid, small-town newspaper headline: the disappearance (and ultimate murder) of a young boy, who is dragged into a sewer by King's monster (whom we'll get to in a few moments). The sense of dread is palpable throughout the narrative, with the suggestion that the town has been cursed since the last century (pictures of a mill explosion in 1908 that claimed the lives of over 100 children, permeate an old book chronicling the town's history and are brought to our attention by one of the protagonists King adroitly assembles in this coming-of-age tale).Indeed, King's motley collection of outsiders (pre-pubescents aptly self-named 'the loser's club'), each possess a particular handicap that allows them to be subjected to bullying by a small group of bad kids in town, emotional smothering and worse (including sexual abuse) by the adults in the community.They include the de facto 'leader' of the group, Bill, a stutterer who blames himself for the disappearance of his younger brother George (the young boy dragged into the sewer at the film's beginning); Ben, a short, overweight bookworm who is dubbed 'tits' by the town bullies who subject him to a savage beating; the over talkative Richie, whose foul-mouth continually gets him into trouble; Eddie, a hypochondriac, who is continually subjected to the aforementioned emotional smothering by an overbearing mother; Stan, the Jewish germ phobic, son of the town's rabbi; Mike, an African-American kid who gets little or no support from his strict granddad; and the group's only female member, Bev, who is subjected to apparent sexual abuse by her leering, creepy Dad.Beyond these entertaining characters and thei antagonists (including the effective psychopathic kid, Henry Bowers, who ends up murdering his violent, abusive police officer dad, and Alvin Marsh, Bev's depraved father), Stephen King has little elsewhere to go in developing his principal antagonist as well as offering an effective plot.The principal antagonist of course is Pennywise the clown, the 'It' of the film's title, and proves to be hardly believable or scary. That's because once he engages in his 'scare routines,' they become perfunctory and repetitious. By the time he receives his comeuppance at film's end, we hardly care whether he comes or goes. Not only that, Pennywise's powers have no basis in reality which might be good for teenagers but hardly for more critical adults.A long-winded explanation of the film's plot is completely unnecessary; suffice it to say, that the 'loser's club' does battle with the clown in a haunted house (on two occasions), and finally end up victorious. They accomplish this by realizing that the clown draws its energy from their own fears, and once they're able to rise above those fears, the clown no longer has any hold over them.The subtext underneath King's nasty fairy tale is that the bullied victims in our society may rise up and defeat the forces of evil if they join together and believe in themselves— not allowing their assorted so-called handicaps to undermine their self-confidence. King's good triumphing over evil reveals a rather simplistic weltanschauung but an appealing one to the masses who purchase tickets in droves, and who demand a resolution with few shades of gray.",5,0,3,1 October 2017
Hereditary," No scares or thrills in this dopey tale of family possessed by the devil
","It's called 'Hereditary,' and if you have any appreciation for good cinema, you must avoid it like the plague. Created by a horror aficionado, first-time feature director Ari Aster, Hereditary has managed to garner an incredible '87' on Metacritic. Don't ask me for certain why this has come to pass, but usually such reviews can be tied to the mass of misguided critics who populate both the print and online media.
The film stars Australian actress Toni Collette, who plays a beleaguered artist-mother Annie Graham, presiding over a family of misfits including her 13 year old daughter Charlie, who appears to suffer from Asperger's Syndrome, and Peter, a disaffected 16 year old who spends a good deal of time smoking marijuana. There's also the passive husband, Steve, who doesn't have much of a plan for saving the family from demonic forces.
When we first meet Annie, she's attending the funeral of her mother with the rest of the family. It's later revealed that the grandmother was some sort of devil worshiper who is responsible for turning Charlie into the disturbed child whose problems no one can find a way to ameliorate.
When Charlie freaks out at a party frothing at the mouth, Peter, high on marijuana. tries to bring her to the hospital driving furiously down a darkened road in the family SUV. Unfortunately for all parties concerned, Charlie is decapitated when she sticks her head outside the window and is hit by an emerging telephone pole.
The abject stupidity of Aster's script becomes apparent when Annie discovers Charlie's headless body the next morning. One wonders what happened to the police investigation but no intrepid investigating detectives show up at the house and Peter is left depressed with his mother unable to control her anger toward him.
The plot has a mildly interesting twist when Annie befriends Joan, a woman she meets at a support group for parents of deceased children. Later Annie finds a scrapbook with pictures of Joan and her mother together in devil worshiping ceremonies.
Nothing much makes sense after that. When Steve throws the grandmother's scrapbook into the fire, he explodes into a ball of fire. Joan disappears and eventually Peter kills himself by jumping out the window of the house. Annie beheads herself with a piano wire, Peter's corpse is inhabited by a spirit and they all convene in Charlie's tree house, where Joan hails Peter as Paimon, one of the Devil's Princes. Women's liberation takes a backseat after Peter is hailed as the new prince--liberated from Charlie, whose decapitated corpse represents a female host.
The worst part of the film is there are really no likable characters, as they all eventually morph into disciples of the devil. The potential heroine, Annie, ends up like all the others in the family. I suppose horror films are supposed to scare you-this one will only make you laugh!!!!",3,2,6,7 December 2018
Kung Fu Panda," Impressive animation marred by screenplay's dopey slapstick humor
","When Kung Fu Panda was released in China, it was praised not only for the production values but its faithfulness to Chinese culture. Suddenly people in China were asking, how can an American production company outdo their Chinese counterparts in creating an animated film that sends such a positive message about China and gets everything right? It's akin to the Russians who launched the first man into space, only to see the American overtake them, eventually landing a man on the moon. For many Chinese critics, Kung Fu Panda is the American 'first lunar landing' of animated martial arts movies. But if the Chinese critics only had a bit of critical acumen, they could easily see there's nothing to be jealous about here. Sure there's a great amount of respect for Chinese culture seen throughout the film (down to the last Chinese character in the credits) as well as some sensational animation including the opening anime 'dream' sequence as well as that incredibly difficult feat of having tons of realistic looking confetti pour down at the Kung Fu tournament where the Kung Fu Panda, Po, is crowned Dragon Warrior. But how is Chinese culture honored by turning Chinese people into a bunch of goofy, self-effacing anthropomorphic animals? Surely kids under eight will dig it, but adults? I hardly think so.While the directors of 'Panda' are firmly ensconced in the world of martial arts and action adventure films, they are neophytes when it comes to comedy. It all comes down to one silly slapstick scene after another emphasizing Po as a good natured, bumbling fool with a decided inferiority complex. Whether he fails getting up the steps into the arena for the Kung Fu tournament, or shoots himself high into the air strapped to a bunch of fireworks and then unceremoniously falling straight down and landing inside the arena, only to be crowned Dragon Warrior, the idea that we should fall in love with his lovable loser is spelled out from the beginning and repeated ad infinitum. How many times do we have to see Po chucked around like an inflatable doll whether it's by Master Shifu, Villain Tai Lung or when he finds himself caught inside the mechanical torture chamber, a device that Shifu's Dragon Warrior candidates, 'The Furious Five', in contrast, have mastered.I do confess that Master Shifu's 'epiphany' in realizing that he has to train Po in a different way so that he can succeed as the dragon warrior, might have been the most clever moment in the comic arc of the film. And certainly Po's transformation from self-effacing masochist to gleeful aggressor as he embraces his 'appetite', is a welcome plot twist after being subjected to the one joke idea of Po as a bumbling clown. Yes, there's finally a method to Po's madness, as Tai Lung is unable to harness Po's new found manic energy. It's sort of like a dominant major league batter unable to master the completely unpredictable path of a knuckle ball. But if we view Po as representing a grownup who still acts like a kid with the particularly bad habit of overeating, then the message 'be yourself', should fall on deaf ears. In this day where smart educators are trying to control the epidemic of childhood obesity, Po's unbridled enthusiasm for that extra cupcake, would not lead to his triumph as dragon warrior. It's a wishful conceit on the part of the directors that Po would end up victorious in his confrontation with the evil Tai Lung. The filmmakers' message to kids here is be happy even if you don't treat yourself well. And things will turn out alright even if you've made no effort to change yourself.As for the action adventure aspect of 'Panda', I can't help it if it seems that the 'holy trinity' of Shifu, Oogway and Tai Lung, are pilfered straight out of the Star Wars play book. Shifu appears to be a Yoda stand-in with the wise, all-knowing tortoise Oogway, reprising the Obi-Wan Kenobi role (Oogway appears to employ his own version of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse). Finally, Tai Lung can go toe to toe with Darth Vadar any day as both have no problems mixing erudition with brute force.A good deal of 'Panda' is taken up by one Kung Fu sequence after another and you really have to be a martial arts fan to be enamored with all those repetitious action sequences. Less bothersome (but still silly) was the decision to make Po's father, Mr. Ping, a goose. There's also the Wuxi Finger Hold that leads to Tai Lung's destruction (at first it seems like a nuclear explosion but it really is a clearing out of 'bad energy' or 'bad karma'). Finally, The 'Furious Five' are not distinct enough as characters despite the conscription of such luminaries as Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan to perform the voice overs. I think 'Kung Fu Panda' would have been a better film had the films' scenarists decided from the outset not to make Po into such a hapless buffoon. That would have also probably meant that the sentimental Mr. Ping and his love for noodles had to go too. In its present incarnation, Kung Fu Panda is certainly suitable for kids (although Tai Lung's antics might be too strong a draught for children under eight). As for adults, ignore the dopey screenplay and concentrate on the visuals and the music, which certainly deserve the accolades already garnered throughout the film community since the film's release in 2008.",4,0,5,20 June 2011
Rocketman," Tale of iconic pop superstar devolves into A Star is Born (but with much better music!)
","After taking over the helm of Bohemian Rhapsody when disgraced director Bryan Singer was forced out, director Dexter Fletcher is back, this time covering an even more iconic pop star, Elton John. His Rocketman has been described as a 'jukebox musical' but with all of John's songs out of chronological order. So for example, John's 2001 hit, I want love, ends up at the beginning of the picture, during John's childhood, sung by the young Elton and his parents.
John apparently wanted it this way as the songs are supposed to reflect his inner feelings at the time and since some of them are staged as over the top spectacles (during the Rocketman number, actor Taron Edgerton playing John is shot into the sky as a rocket!), one tends to ignore the haphazard chronology.
As for Edgerton, he's probably best with the choreography, staging some entertaining, up tempo dance numbers throughout (coupled with a multitude of nifty costume choices). Less successful are his vocals which are decent enough but let's face it, how can anyone equal the Elton John originals?
The film starts with a framing device as John walks into what appears to be an AA meeting and begins telling his story from the beginning. For a good part of the film, his life in flashbacks is not only entertaining (due to the great music) but quite informative as well. Especially interesting is John's musical talent as a child-he could hear a tune on the radio and play it back on the piano immediately!
Less successful is screenwriter Lee Hall's depiction of John's parents who come off as unaffectionate and distant (the father) or highly critical (the mother). This is based on John's recollections to this day; apparently the pop star was particularly distressed by memories of his father Stanley (Steven Mackintosh) showing affection to his stepbrothers later on.
But other family members (particularly John's stepmother) disputed John's portrait of a remote and unfeeling parent. She reported that she still has the receipt for John's original piano which the father purchased (not the mother, which is what John recalls). Furthermore, the stepmother maintains John's father was actually proud after he became famous and attended his concerts.
The same goes for the vindictive portrait of the mother who actually blurts out that she wished she never had children in the film. But the real life story appears more complex as John's mother Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard) often defended her son and expressed pride in his success. It might have been better if director Fletcher overruled John and his screenwriter and presented a more sympathetic, balanced picture of the parents.
John's rise to the top keeps us absorbed as we learn many things about how he became successful. Of particular interest is his stint as a child prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music; his time as a teenager with Bluesology, a rock band that ends up playing backup for a touring American soul band; how he met his lyricist, Bernie Taupin (an endearing Jamie Bell) and his doomed dalliance with manager John Reid (Richard Madden), with whom he has his first gay relationship.
Rocketman eventually morphs into the similar cinematic tale of alcohol addiction, A Star is Born (except having much better music). John's debauchery is on full display toward the last third of movie and it suffers due to the obsession with the icon's sad sack days. His resurrection into a sober and confident married father, now accepting his sexuality, is only mentioned briefly during the closing credits. Yes of course it happened but somehow there could have been a little less emphasis on this sad chapter and rather emphasizing much more of the positive in the multi-talented singer/composer's life.
For all its limitations, Rocketman still manages to entertain and inform, so it's worth a shot, even if you must wait until it appears on cable TV.",6,1,1,26 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Unworkable tale, chronicling downfall of alcoholic country rock star and enabling singer he takes under his wing, fails like all its predecessors
","Why in the world did Bradley Cooper decide to remake A Star is Born? Beats me. It's a dog of an idea for a film but you can probably guess why Hollywood players are attracted to such a project. I recommend that you check out my review of the 1954 version of A Star is Born starring Judy Garland. Despite the updated accouterments, there's little difference between what I had to say about that old chestnut and Cooper's new flashy project starring Lady Gaga.
Cooper plays the protagonist, Jackson Maine, a country rock music star with a wicked drinking problem (James Mason was 'Norman Maine' in the '54 version; instead of a musician, he played an alcoholic movie star). The plot is quite simple: Maine goes bar hopping after one of his big concerts and happens upon Ally, an aspiring singer (Lady Gaga) at a bar populated chiefly by drag queens. Maine takes Ally under his wing, sponsors her, and as he goes downhill due to his drinking, she eventually becomes a big star.
The problem with all this is that just like in all the earlier incarnations (1937, 1954 and 1977), Maine's character is simply boring and unlikable. Sad sacks never make for good drama especially when their machinations are so one-note. It's as if we're supposed to have some kind of catharsis reveling in Maine's sad decline. It's all so predictable and I have no guilt feelings in revealing that our main character commits suicide in the end. Cooper and his fellow scenarists can do nothing in fleshing out their country rock star-he's wholly generic with a sketchy back story about a cruel father and a suicide attempt when the boy was 12.
Lady Gaga isn't much better as Ally, who plays the part of an enabler. Yes she's got a great voice and tremendous stage presence, but she has little to do except attempt to prop up her alcoholic spouse and then cry at the end when he does himself in. None of the original songs here (some written by Gaga) are hardly memorable and you'll be hard pressed to find anything resembling the hits (such as 'Bad Romance'), she's known for.
The dark moment in the second act is similar to the '54 version-there Mason (as Norman Maine) makes a fool of himself at the Oscars while in a drunken stupor. Here it's Cooper as Maine falling flat on his face at the Grammy's. No matter-it's all part of similar histrionics designed to manipulate the audience to spill crocodile tears for stereotyped losers.
Cooper impressively learned how to play guitar for the film but his voice (while decent), is simply ordinary. And like Gaga, he's imprisoned in a strait jacket of this particular acting role. The only bright note is Sam Elliott as Bobby, Maine's half-brother and manager who walks out on him as he can no longer tolerate his half-brother's unrelenting drunken act. And what about Ally's father and his limousine driver buddies? They seem more like they're from New Jersey then somewhere out in the Midwest where this is supposed to be taking place.
Instead of drunken losers, how about a story about entertainment people with egos, chronicling their rise to the top along with those left behind in their wake? No instead we must endure this phony little tale hailed as a virtual masterpiece by a majority of fawning, sycophantic film critics.",3,3,10,6 November 2018
Gravity," A Space Odyssey meets Robinson Crusoe in this new American sci-fi thriller classic
","Very few American films today classified as 'entertainment', actually can rise to the level of Art. 'Gravity', the new sci-fi, 'Space Odyssey-like' thriller, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I'm happy to report, has made it into that pantheon. You would never imagine that a film that only features two actors, can be so compelling and captivating; but coupled with a barrage of extraordinary digital effects, co-writer and director Alfonso Cuarón, has pulled it off!The story begins with Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a bio-medical engineer and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), on a spacewalk outside their space shuttle, conducting routine experiments, when they're alerted by Mission Control in Houston that a Russian satellite has exploded and the debris field is headed straight for the shuttle (inciting incident). In a spectacular sequence, the shuttle is destroyed and Stone is hurled around in space still tethered to the craft, bouncing on and off of it, like a ping pong ball. When she's finally separated from the craft, Kowalski, utilizing his thruster pack to maneuver, saves her from floating out into space and they make their way back to the space shuttle, which they discover has been destroyed and the rest of the crew members dead (one of the astronauts who had been outside the craft, has his face blown off).As we break into Act II, Stone and Kowalski must make their way to the International Space Station (ISS), if they have any chance of survival. The 'ticking time clock', so inimical to thrillers, is used to great effect throughout the film. Kowalski sets his watch for 90 minutes, because that's when the debris field, will make its first orbit around the earth, and come back and possible hit them again. While floating toward the ISS, we learn of Stone's back story (her daughter was tragically killed in a schoolyard accident and she then decided to devote her life to her work). Using the thruster, Stone and Kowalski arrive at the ISS, only to find the stakes are raised again, as the ISS crew has abandoned ship and the Russian Soyuz space module has been damaged, useless for re-entry to earth. Even more thrilling and shattering is that Stone finds herself tangled in the already deployed parachute from the module and is holding on to Kowalski, whose weight is causing the parachute cords to break.Suffice it to say, 'Gravity' avoids Hollywood endings by realistically arguing that space exploration is a danger business—and may result in death. Stone finds herself alone after Kowalski 'cuts himself loose' and we approach the 'dark moment' of the second Act, as Stone must maneuver the damaged module to a Chinese space station, Tiangong. But when she discovers that the module has no more fuel, it appears there's no hope. Stone's hopelessness is highlighted when she reaches a farmer on a short wave frequency, who doesn't speak English. The dark moment of the second act, always results in the protagonist discovering a solution to the problem; that happens during her hallucination that Kowalski has returned to help her, advising that she can still use the re-entry rockets to move the craft.Now the protagonist must implement the 'solution' as we head toward the climax in Act III. There's more spectacular, edge of your seat machinations, when Stone uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster, to get herself over and into the Tiangong. I won't go into the rest of it, except to say that Stone must not only get herself out of a real pickle during the fiery re-entry to earth, but must solve a new crisis, after splashing down into a body of water, in a remote section on earth.While I've been hard on Sandra Bullock, especially for her recent lame performance in 'The Heat', here she proves (when given the right material) that she's as good as any of the top stars out there today. It's an extraordinarily nuanced, low key performance, coupled with some physically demanding stunts, which I suspect were not all dependent on digital effects. Do you hear 'Oscar' calling? Clooney too is masterful, as he also delivers just the right kind of restrained performance to make this whole thing believable.Alfonso Cuarón has admitted that not everything we see on screen is physically or scientifically possible. But so what! Much of the technical aspect is true to form and looks quite believable. 'Gravity' is much more than a spectacular visual feast—it's about a struggle against overwhelming odds. When Bullock (Stone) emerges from a watery tomb, after 'going it alone', a la 'Robinson Crusoe', there is the sense that we've just witnessed an awe-inspiring, story of survival and an uplifting paean, to the human spirit.",9,4,8,5 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Navy SEAL heroics ably highlighted in unwinnable Afghan imbroglio
","'Long Survivor' is based on the book of the same name, which recounts a small Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance mission to track (and eventually eliminate) Ahmad Shah, a dangerous Taliban commander already responsible for the deaths of a coterie of American soldiers along with Afghan allies. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of his fellow four man SEAL team who make their way into the mountains of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan.The film is divided into three main sections. The opening expository section introduces us to the Navy SEALS as they participate in grueling training to go out on these extremely difficult missions (the opening footage appears to be taken during real basic training). It's a little difficult figuring out who's who but the dialogue between the soldiers feels like it's real.We break into Act II, when Luttrell and three compatriots locate Shah while they're hidden in the bush on the side of a mountain. A sheep herder along with two boys run into the soldiers who now have to decide whether to kill, tie them up or let them go. Ultimately, it's Lutrell who argues they'll be charged with war crimes if they kill the Afghans, so they take their chances by letting them return to the village and then retreat up the mountain.The bulk of the movie involves the four Americans attempting to fend off a big number of Taliban soldiers who are heavily armed with machine guns and rocket launchers (one of young sheep herders is seen scurrying down the mountain earlier, with the intent of alerting the Taliban).Throughout Act II, 'Lone Survivor' proves to be wholly an 'action' film. It's extremely well filmed and choreographed, as the Americans heroically resist against overwhelming odds. At times, they're forced to dive off cliffs and end up rolling down the side of the mountains, injuring themselves severely, but still managing to return fire. Meanwhile, they're unable to phone in their position to headquarters until one of the soldiers manages to get to the top of the mountain, where finally there is radio reception. Unfortunately he's immediately taken down by the Taliban, once exposed with no cover.In some ways, the folly of the initial surveillance mission is exposed. Once their cover is blown, the small surveillance team has no chance of winning against such superior numbers. Certainly, a larger force was needed in the area, to back up the team. Reinforcements do arrive in the form of two manned helicopters, but one is shot down almost immediately by the Taliban and the other is forced to retreat.Once all of his buddies are killed, Luttrell must make his way out of the area after dark. He's saved by a sympathetic Afghan villager who rallies members of his tribe who resist the Taliban who come looking for Luttrell. The Americans are alerted by a mountain man who brings a map of Luttrell's position at the behest of Luttrell's Afghan protector. In reality, the Taliban did not have a face off with the villagers, as the villagers outnumbered them significantly.'Lone Survivor' highlights the heroic actions of the Navy SEALS as well as the Afghan villagers who came to Luttrell's defense. Some critics found the film to be light on characterization but in truth, it's mainly an 'action ' film. Mark Wahlberg proves to be talented as a do or die military man along with his assorted comrades in arms. In the end, nothing is sugar coated here. In a sense, the film is symptomatic of our effort in Afghanistan where noble efforts end in failure, in an unwinnable Afghan imbroglio.",7,0,1,11 July 2014
The Death of Stalin," TV comic luminary reduces Stalin's Politburo successors to a coterie of foul-mouthed, bumbling misfits
","A mainstream comedy writer, known for Veep on television, Armando Iannucci as director and co-writer, has ventured into the realm of a much darker subject, 'The Death of Stalin.' The genre is black comedy, a send-up, where the principal members of the Politburo vie for power following the death of Stalin of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 5, 1953. 
Most of the humor is sophomoric but occasionally there are a few moments of mirth. The dark atmosphere of Stalinism is ably conveyed in the film's introductory scene based on real events. A Radio Moscow producer forces an orchestra to replay a concerto so that a recording can be pressed for Stalin who demands it on a whim.  
A conductor is dragged out of bed, the audience is not permitted to leave and additional people from the streets are conscripted to fill out the hall (ironically most of these newly minted spectators are members of the proletariat, who have little to no interest in classical music). Historically the actual event occurred nine years prior to the terrifying dictator's death, but no matter-the bizarre nature of the various Russians' acquiescence, reveals the level of fear that gripped the populace during those unhappy times. 
Iannucci unfortunately attempts to extract humor not from an examination of a crazed bureaucracy designed to cope with terrifying circumstances-but by focusing on and then reducing Stalin's successors as a coterie of buffoons. Oddly no character sports a Russian accent but rather utilizes an unsuccessful mix of American and British doggerel. Steve Buscemi is particularly unconvincing as Khrushchev-not only doesn't he look like Stalin's eventual replacement but delivering his lines in colloquial American English, hardly sounds like the man who told an American audience at the United Nations that 'we will bury you.' 
The plot loosely follows how the various players attempt to grab their share of power following the leadership vacuum left wide open after Stalin's death. As in real life, the principal villain is NKVD state security head Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) who attempts to buy Foreign Minister's Molotov's (Michael Palin) loyalty by arranging for the release of his wife, denounced as a traitor and imprisoned a few years earlier by Stalin. 
Meanwhile Deputy General Secretary Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor) is nominally put in charge of the government only to prove that he is spineless, vacillating between the various factions and failing to make any decisive decisions. Eventually it's Khrushchev who conscripts World War II Army hero Marshall Zhukov, who arrests Beria and basically arranges his execution (with the approval of the rest of the Politburo). 
Iannucci's one-note characterization of the principals as a group of foul-mouthed misfits does not jibe with the reality of their personalities. Worse is the implication that Stalinism was principally the fault of men like Beria, an overt sadist and child molester who takes on the convenient role of the fall guy here. 
Samuel Goff in his article in the Calvert Journal 'The Death of Stalin: a black comic masterpiece? Don't make me laugh,' argues that Iannucci fails to discuss the 'mechanisms of power' in Stalinist Russia. It's the 'faceless pencil-pushers' who 'combine to enact mass death, the memo a more potent symbol of the system than the rifle, the whole thing a meeting of bland procedural discipline and actual murder. There is not enough banality in Iannucci's portrait of evil.' Goff rightly concludes that 'we see horror, and we see satire, but never in conjunction. The result is a lacklustre and tonally confused story about some awful men being awful to each other.' 
Whatever you believe about the men who led the Soviet Union following the tyrant Stalin's death, they were not a bunch of bumbling fools. If slapstick and a series of pratfalls are your 'thing,' then you might actually find The Death of Stalin to be humorous. More demanding critics must require a more serious examination of a ghastly historical reality.",4,3,9,27 May 2018
Star Trek," Beam me out (of this movie theater where the new Star Trek movie is playing), Scotty!
","For all those who are under 18 and this is their first exposure to the Star Trek saga, I urge you to see the greatest Star Trek movie of them all: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. 'Khan' is the standard on which all Star Trek movies and episodes must be measured against. The writers of the new 'Star Trek' movie claim that their inspiration was the 'Wrath of Khan' and would like to think that their new 'update' is equal to the earlier masterpiece. Unfortunately I must report that the new 'Star Trek' is nowhere close to Star Trek II. Quite the contrary, it is a pathetic mess of a screenplay and until you see 'The Wrath of Khan', you cannot understand what I'm talking about.The new 'Star Trek' attempts to re-imagine the characters from the original TV series when they were young, just beginning their careers. The casting director did well to choose actors who bore a resemblance to the original cast. The writers claim in interviews that they aimed to fill in the back story of the characters by detailing their past histories before, during and right after their initiation at Starfleet Academy as Federation officers. But in actuality, they do the opposite. Take Dr. McCoy, the idiosyncratic chief medical officer—the actor who plays him looks a lot like a young DeForrest Kelley (the original 'Bones') but the comparison ends there. Bones is hardly integrated into the story at all. He doesn't have the humor of the original character nor is there enough of the idiosyncratic charm. In the new 'Star Trek', the character is reduced to a buffoon, chasing Kirk around the ship, trying to inject him with a hypodermic. This is the only time we get to know anything about him.Now take Uhura. In the original, she was the cool, consummate professional, always guiding the Enterprise through tough waters by way of her technical expertise. Here she is the opposite: unprofessional and overemotional. I was embarrassed when she tries to kiss Spock numerous times in the turbolift after the planet Vulcan was destroyed. Here Spock is trying to cope with the annihilation of six million of his people and all Uhura wants to do is make out! You call that class??? And what about Chekov? All they have the character do is mimic the Russian accent of the original character. How did they make him different or improve on the original? Even worse is Sulu. All he gets to do is parachute down to what looks like the platform of an oil rig where he aids Kirk in a ridiculous fight against some bad guys. I thought Scotty had the most potential of the supporting players. At least he projected the good nature of the original character but it was kind of disappointing when he must rely on Leonard Nimoy (the old Spock) to give him the new warp speed formula.The new James T. Kirk looks like a young William Shatner but he too lacks the charm of the original. More could have done with Kirk's early days on Earth especially in showing how the future might look. I liked the cop on the flying motorcycle but a peek at a future 'watering hole' seemed quite derivative (check out the first Star Wars where Harrison Ford struts through the intergalactic bar). Depicting Kirk as a rebellious hothead seems part of the original Star Trek lore, but the humor is missing.The new Spock doesn't at all measure up to the old Spock. The early scene where a very young Spock confronts a group of Vulcan 'bullies' was cute but after that it was all downhill. The problem is that the Kirk-Spock relationship is too heavy-handed. It's one thing to show conflict between the two but when they come to blows, it just seemed so un-Spocklike. Contrast that with Spock's decision to disobey Kirk's command at the end of the 'Wrath of Khan'. Kirk and Spock are noble characters and somehow the conflict between them seems juvenile and trivial. Or maybe it was a matter of the plot where the stakes weren't high enough. The writers simply did not give the characters an opportunity to display the complexity of the relationship.Perhaps the worst part of the new Star Trek is the depiction of the villain, the disaffected Nero. I seem to recall that by Star Trek: Next Generation, the Romulans had become a group of worthy adversaries to the denizens of the Federation. But here, the last Romulan, Nero, is a bald guy with tattoos plastered all over his head. All he can do is snarl throughout the movie. Contrast that with Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan. Again, no comparison! Plotwise, the new Star Trek wasn't clever at all. Beginning with the unnecessary flashback to the tale of Kirk's father's heroism, we're treated to one tired battle scene after another. What's worse is that the film's writers have created a new alternative Star Trek universe. Can you imagine the entire planet of Vulcan being destroyed in any of the earlier movies or episodes? It would never happen. Hey Vulcan is supposed to be populated with some of the smartest guys in the universe and they let themselves be annihilated by a Romulan who looks like a skinhead using a drilling machine that creates black holes! It was nice seeing Leonard Nimoy reprising the role of the original Spock but I was sad to see just how much the actor has aged. Contrary to all the hype, the new Star Trek lacks the charm, humor and complexity of the some of the earlier incarnations. Go back and check out Wrath of Khan and some of the best of the Star Trek episodes from television. If they decide to make a second 'new' Star Trek, hopefully the studio will hire a group of better writers.",3,126,194,11 May 2009
Citizen Kane," Kane falls down in second half
","It's difficult criticizing a movie that's hailed as the greatest movie of all time. From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas. Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a 'love nest' with the 'singer'. This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script—what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc. By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career—a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact of an American classic.",8,3,5,29 October 2007
Darkest Hour," Oldman shines in impeccable performance as Director Wright narrowly avoids pitfall of complete hagiography
","Political leaders often come to represent the embodiment of a nation, particularly during wartime. In reality, they are only singular entities, part of a greater whole. The challenge in any fictional representation is to humanize them, and avoid hagiography at all costs. Joe Wright manages to do that, but comes close to putting his Churchill on a pedestal. Nonetheless, one must still admire the effort.Darkest Hour covers the period of Churchill's ascendancy to the office of the Prime Minister, through the darkest hour of Britain's retreat from Dunkirk and near capitulation to the Nazis. This particular period in British history usually is regarded as Churchill's finest hour, so the tendency to elevate the iconic figure to almost unquestioning estimable status, is ever present. But Churchill was flawed in more than ways than one, and notably he was cast out of office by popular demand, following the end of World War II.The notion that Churchill was a politically flawed candidate is ably brought to the fore by Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten. There was principally the debacle of the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, as well as his support for Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis in 1936. What's more it was Churchill's unpredictable temper (magisterially conveyed by Gary Oldman in an Oscar-worthy role), that led to great reluctance (particularly among members of his own Conservative party) to elevate him as head of state.When we first meet Oldham as Churchill, his unpredictable demeanor is on display in full relief as he berates his newly minted secretary, Elizabeth Layton, who has difficulty understanding him while taking dictation (Layton jointed Churchill's staff a year later than depicted here). In addition, Kristin Scott Thomas, in a minor part, is most convincing as Churchill's wife Clementine, who remains supportive but isn't afraid to criticize her often brusque husband, when he's in need of some choice words to mollify his often over-the-top behavior.Director Wright did a fine job of casting the principals, as they all resemble their real-life counterparts, fitfully. This is particularly true of Neville Chamberlain and King George VI, who look and sound like the real thing. One fact I was unaware of was that Churchill kept Chamberlain on in an advisory role even after he was roundly dismissed from office.Perhaps the best scenes in the film are the meetings between Churchill and the King. Ben Mendelsohn does a better job as King George VI than Colin Firth's Oscar-winning performance in 'The Kings Speech.' Not only does he look like George VI, but here the King appears more adapted to his speech disability than was depicted in the earlier film. The King's misgivings about Churchill eventually give way to admiration, as they end up on the same page in their determination to defeat Hitler.Wright's antagonist here is Lord Halifax, who declined to become Prime Minister despite strong support in his Conservative party (it was in fact the Labour and Liberal parties who were against Halifax, finding Churchill the lesser of two evils!). Halifax wanted a negotiated peace with the Germans as he feared that Britain would soon lose the war and incur massive civilian losses. In hindsight, Churchill's prescient views on Hitler and the Nazi menace appear morally superior to Halifax and the so-called 'appeasers' in the Conservative party. But in the context of the times, 'appeasement' was quite understandable, given the fear of another World War I debacle, so imprinted in the minds of all Europeans who lived through that devastating conflict.Wright's treatment of Churchill during the Dunkirk crisis is well-balanced. We discover it's Churchill's idea to institute 'Operation Dynamo,' where a flotilla of private boats were conscripted to save the Army stranded on Dunkirk beach. But it was also Churchill who ordered the garrison at Calais to stall the Germans from reaching Dunkirk before the evacuation. Wright's best visual is a shot of the beleaguered troops at Calais about to be annihilated; the camera pulls upward as the doomed troops are now a dot, with the German bombers raining bombs on their untenable position.By its very nature, the Darkest Hour narrative is inherently dialogue heavy. But Wright very cleverly follows Churchill almost as if everything is in 'real time' (yes it's over a few months but feels like days). Wright constantly is shifting scenes, taking us from Churchill's study, to the underground bunker, outside on the streets and in Parliament. The only dark stain here is Wright's decision to create that subway scene (or as the Brits call it, the 'underground') out of whole cloth.Wright argues that Churchill purportedly disappeared at times and often would go and speak with people out on the street for their input. It never happened that Churchill took a ride on the subway and spoke to the common people. It's a scene that feels forced, especially where he has Churchill take advice from a black man of Caribbean origin (it might be comforting to know Churchill harbored no ill-will toward minorities, but historically he was probably just as elitist as both his confederates and adversaries at the time!).Ultimately there is enough here to conclude that Joe Wright has avoided complete hero worship (narrowly!). With Oldman's impeccable performance and a fluid recreation of a key period in world history, Darkest Hour is one of the stronger entries in this year's Oscar pantheon.",7,0,3,4 February 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Tarrantino shoots himself in the foot as 'Basterds' devolves into puerile wish fulfillment fantasy
","Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarrantino's homage to the entertaining World War II action films of the 60s and 70s. Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining 'The Dirty Dozen'. In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.The reason why 'The Dirty Dozen' was so entertaining was that each convict 'misfit' had a distinct and extremely interesting personality. Tarrantino doesn't bother to develop any of his basterds as fleshed out people. Instead, all they can do is scalp Nazis or as one of them does (the so-called 'Bear Jew') beats Nazi brains out with a baseball bat. What's more, Tarrantino doesn't bother showing how they develop as a team and how they overcome obstacles leading to their reputation as professional killers. Instead, they're plopped down in occupied France and meet no real resistance. The whole charm of 'The Dirty Dozen' was that that they had to overcome not only the external obstacles of fighting the Nazis but deal with their own internal strife. In short, they were fairly plausible, believable characters. Not so with Tarrantino's group who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic (they're as sadistic as their Nazi opponents).The problem with Tarrantino's narrative is that it gradually becomes more and more implausible and incoherent. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Shoshanna, the Jewish girl, escapes while Landa murders her family (did his gun jam?) but how does she become the owner of a movie theater a few years later? Wouldn't the Nazis have uncovered her Jewish heritage? Tarrantino's portrait of Goebbals as a dilettante in the world of German cinema rang true but I question the assertion that he was the #2 man (next to Hitler) in the Nazi hierarchy (certainly Bormann, Heydrich and Goring had a lot more power).Visually, it was a nice touch in showing Hitler with an unflattering complexion as well as making fun of his out of control temper; but to reduce Hitler to a complete buffoon while other Nazi characters are quite believably scary, makes no sense whatsoever. Hitler, after all, was the brains behind the operation.Tarrantino does serve up some juicy characters which were highly entertaining. I liked Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) as he first appears to be a harmless, lovesick puppy dog, enamored with our Jewish cinema owner and actually exudes modesty despite having become a war hero and accidental movie star. And it makes perfect sense for him to morph into a sadistic stalker on the verge of rape when he shows his 'true colors' after confronting Shoshanna in the projection booth. In some ways, Zoller is more sinister than Landa.Kudos also to Diane Kruger as Bridget Hammersmark, the movie actress who's also a double agent. Despite its unpleasantness, the scene of Kruger's demise at the hands of the sadistic Landa pulls you in. Perhaps the best character in the movie is Major Dieter Hellstrom, played by the brilliant August Diehl, who ends up exposing Michael Fassbender's film critic turned spy in the basement tavern face-off. The way Tarrantino has the diabolical Major deduce it's 'King Kong' during the card game is utterly brilliant. Through Hellstrom's 'deduction', Tarrantino demonstrates that he has a profound understanding of the sinister nature of Nazi politics and ideology.Tarrantino, however, shoots himself in the foot in the final third of the movie. The Basterds are supposed to be a crackerjack professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English. And despite Hitler showing up at the premiere, there's absolutely no security (Shoshanna's black lover who plans to set fire to the building has free rein to walk around without being stopped once). In Tarrantino's warped universe, he somehow feels some kind of perverse satisfaction in having Shoshanna laugh at the Nazis as they are being burned to a crisp in an on screen rant. Finally, what really killed the film for me was the denouement where the sinister and charming Landa suddenly becomes a blithering idiot by offering to surrender to the Allies after allowing the Basterds' bomb plot to proceed. How could the 'Hangman' of Occupied France suddenly deceive himself into believing that Lt. Aldo Raine, the notorious Nazi killer, would agree to his ludicrous demands and then keep his word?Inglorious Basterds contains a plethora of clever references to the history of cinema. Many of the scenes are overlong and talky but the dialogue is always crisp and never boring. Tarrantino's characters are a mixed bag—he's much more successful with his Nazi antagonists than his American protagonists. Particularly disappointing is Brad Pitt who has little to do except practice a Southern accent. With the exception of Hitler and SS Landa's final scenes, Tarrantino does a credible job of humanizing his Nazis. That doesn't mean he approves of them but it shows he knows what makes them tick. Tarrantino should have consulted with Daniel Mendelsohn before making his mad revenge fantasy. Mendelsohn, writing in Newsweek, gets it right: 'An alternative, and morally superior, form of 'revenge' for Jews would be to do precisely what Jews have been doing since World War II ended: that is, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of the destruction that was visited upon them, precisely in order to help prevent the recurrence of such mass horrors in the future.'",5,15,28,31 August 2009
Coraline," Storyline fails to fulfill its potential despite excellent animation
","Coraline is a film that employs computer enhanced stop action animation. So visually it's sort of a combination of the old and the new. What's more, some theaters show it in 3-D and it was neat wearing the special glasses and occasionally being startled as images seem to be jumping out right off from the screen itself.Coraline, a young girl, who seems to be around eight or nine years old, has just moved into an old house with her parents, who can best be described as workaholics. While Coraline doesn't really dislike her parents, she feels a bit disconnected from them. The old house they've moved into is connected to a few other old houses which are occupied by some older neighbors who are flaming eccentrics (there's Mr. Bobinsky, a retired circus master and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, elderly and rather plump opera buffs). Also in the mix is a local kid, Wybie, who Coraline finds exceptionally annoying (mainly because he talks too much).Coraline is very similar to Alice in Wonderland since there is a secret portal in the house which leads to a different worldan alternate universe. Coraline follows a mouse through the portal and discovers her 'other' mother and father. They look exactly the same except they have buttons for eyes. At first, Coraline is seduced by everything the new parents have to offer. She's treated to sumptuous meals and given a tour of a garden outside the house which is full of fantastic creatures which Coraline finds enchanting.The Coraline story loses quite a bit of energy and focus in the first hour when she enters the secret world and then goes back to her ordinary world more than once. Contrast that with a story such as the Wizard of Ozwhen Dorothy enters the fantasy world of Oz , she remains there until the climax of the film. By remaining in the new extraordinary world, the protagonist now has the opportunity to be tested and go up against an evil opposing force. From the beginning of Oz, there is an arc of increasing tension which culminates in the final confrontation with the all powerful Wizard.In contrast, the tension in Coraline doesn't really become palpable until the second half of the film. That's when the 'other' parents suddenly become malevolent and attempt to imprison Coraline in their world for the rest of eternity. Where Dorothy has three charming sidekicks (The Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion) to aid her in her battle against the wicked witch, the 'other mother' in Coraline has taken Wybie's power of speech away from himwhich deprives Coraline from having a sidekick to battle the forces of evil in the other world (instead, a talking cat is substituted but we feel no emotional connection to that character). I would have liked the real Wybie to have somehow made his way through the portal and helped Coraline in her quest to escape or defeat the other mother.There also didn't seem to be enough of a contrast between the eccentric neighbors in the real world and the fantasy world. Mr. Bobinsky seemed to be contorting himself all over the place BEFORE Coraline finds him leading his group of dancing mice in the alternate universe. The same goes for Miss Sprink and Miss Forcible who seem equally weird in both worlds.In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's alienation from her family occurs after Auntie Em is unable to prevent Miss Gulch from taking Toto away from her. In contrast, the alienation between Coraline and her parents is only vaguely defined (somehow, the parents' preoccupation with their own work doesn't seem to be a strong enough reason for Coraline to be alienated from them). Somehow, there needed to be a much more compelling reason for Coraline to initially consider accepting her 'other' parents'. In other words, the stakes simply aren't high enough.In the end, Coraline suffers from a lack of originality. It's a story that we've seen too many times before without enough new twists. Furthermore, the characters (including Coraline) aren't CONSISTENTLY charming enough to engage us emotionally. Coraline has some great special effects and art design and I would recommend seeing it on that basis alone. But unfortunately one must also focus on the story, which clearly has not fulfilled its potential.",5,19,43,16 February 2009
Passengers," Clever sci-fi horror premise devolves into weak 'love conquers all' denouement
","Do you remember how they said the Titanic was unsinkable? That its water tight compartments would never give way, even if the ship hit an iceberg? The same kind of hubris is cleverly worked into the plot of Morten Tyldum's new sci-fi horror show, Passengers. We're 30 years into the 120 year journey of the Starship Avalon, where over 5,000 passengers are in suspended animation, sleeping in hibernation pods, headed for colonization on the distant planet, Homestead II. And just like the Titanic, it's posited that the sleek Avalon is impenetrable, that nothing can go wrong with the pods, with none of its passengers waking up early and trapped on the giant ship, doomed to grow old before arriving at the scheduled destination light years away.But indeed that's exactly what happens to Jim (Chris Pratt), when his pod malfunctions during some kind of massive intergalactic electrical storm that the Avalon is passing through. The extremely clever Twilight-Zone like premise is downright spooky, and we end up riveted as we watch Jim soon discover the terrible predicament he's in.It begins with an automated greetings message Jim watches as his pod opens and he slowly regains the use of his muscles. The message presumes that everyone on the ship has woken up and passengers and crew are now only four months away from the target planet. But as Jim roams the cavernous ship, he realizes no one is awake and he's all alone.Soon Jim discovers that he does have a companion in the form of an android bartender named Arthur who becomes a friend of sorts. Jim explores all that the ship has to offer but can't even get a meal with all the trimmings since he's not a 'gold star' passenger. As a mechanic in his former life on earth, Jim attempts to get his hibernation pod to work again, but to no avail. He's also locked out from the pilot's room and can't wake anyone up to reprogram the ship's computers and head back to earth.Jim attempts to divert himself by working out in the gym and dancing with a pair of holographic projections but after a year he's thinking of killing himself as he's now dying of loneliness. At this point, Jim becomes obsessed with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), an aspiring writer hibernating in one of the pods, and after some tortured deliberation, decides to wake her up.Oddly enough, a coterie of film critics on the internet view Jim's actions as sexist; others go further by arguing that he 'murdered' her. It's all nonsense since Jim's decision adds to the very cool Twilight Zone-like atmosphere of the story. In addition, while his actions can be construed as wholly selfish, anyone in his position would probably have done the same (after all, who wants to live the rest of their life on a spaceship with no one to talk to?). The story moves forward as Aurora is led to believe that she too woke up due to a malfunctioning hibernation pod. Leave it to Arthur who spills the beans that indeed it was Jim who intentionally woke her up. Aurora is now so mad at Jim that she almost kills him with a hammer. At this point I'm wondering where the story is going and suddenly the plot moves in a new, welcome direction. A third character, Gus--a chief deck officer--wakes up from another pod malfunction. He only has a short time to live as his internal organs were compromised when he woke up early. Gus lives long enough to explain to Jim that the ship's systems are failing and gives them his ID code for access to critical parts of the ship. With a nod to the film 'Gravity,' Jim is thrust out into space after repairing a damaged fusion reactor and Aurora saves him by donning a spacesuit and going outside the ship and rescuing him after he loses consciousness. Once it becomes apparent that Jim was willing to sacrifice his own life to save the rest of the crew and passengers, Aurora realizes he's really a good guy after all and forgives him for waking her up.Now here's where the story goes all wrong. It's only a short coda at the end--but it's deemed that Jim and Aurora live out their days on the ship, finding contentment in their love for one another. When the passengers and crew finally awake, they find vegetation growing everywhere and also discover Aurora's journal, explaining how she decided to grow old with Jim, despite having the opportunity to go back into hibernation through the ship's only first aid pod.It's a fanciful idea that ignores the reality of the story's powerful premise--that the two passengers are still trapped and doomed for all eternity in a place they can never escape from.The ending is a failure because it jettisons the horror component of the story for a far-fetched 'love conquers all' scenario. A much better ending would have reduced the time of the ship's journey from 120 years to say 70 years. The denouement would need no additional dialogue with a montage inserted instead, chronicling how the couple eventually settled into a dull routine after the initial rekindling of their romance. By the time the passengers and crew awake, they find Jim and Aurora still alive but withered and old in separate rooms, suggesting that the thrill of life has left them after being trapped on the spaceship for so long.",5,3,12,25 December 2016
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Loser morphs into Mensch much too late
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall chronicles the misadventures of Peter Bretter, a musician who composes music scores for TV shows. He works on a show called 'Crime Scene' (which is a satiric takeoff on shows like 'CSI'). The star of the show is a cute blonde named Sarah Marshall, who Peter has been dating for about five years. Sarah shows up one day at his apartment and announces that she's dating a rock star and their relationship is over. From the outset one wonders what Sarah sees in Peter. His apartment is a pigsty, he hates his job and it seems that his muse to create a great musical theater piece has completely left him.Peter has a stepbrother, Brian, who encourages him to start dating other women (Brian and his wife periodically pop up later in the film via a computer video link but the comic possibilities between Peter and his nutty stepbrother are never developed). Peter still can't get Sarah out of his mind so he decides to take a trip to Hawaii where Sarah liked to vacation. When he arrives at the resort hotel without a reservation, a cute brunette working at the front desk, Rachel, takes a liking to him and lets him stay at their most expensive suite for free. Meanwhile, Peter, discovers to his horror that Sarah is staying at the same hotel with her New-Age, rock star boyfriend.The first half of 'Act 2' focuses on Peter's inability to stop obsessing over the breakup of his relationship with Sarah. The main bit is Peter continually breaking down and crying whenever memories of Sarah pop up in his mind. In one particularly unfunny scene, Peter gets a call from Rachel from the front desk asking whether he can hear a woman crying in an adjacent room; of course it's Peter who's the one who's been bawling the whole time! Meanwhile, Sarah's boyfriend, Aldous Snow is an affable Brit who's avoided drinking for seven years. He invites Peter to dinner but Peter can't face Sarah with the thought that she's with someone else.At the midpoint, Peter attempts to 'forget' Sarah Marshall. He goes out on a date with Rachel who turns out to have a shady ex-boyfriend who ends up punching Peter in the face. Despite her attraction to bad boys in the past, she finds the goofy Peter amusing and attractive. Peter receives encouragement from various comic types who work at the hotel or hang out at the beach. A loony surfer instructor teaches Peter how to surf but he clumsily ends up colliding with Aldous while surfing and is knocked out cold.Peter's relationship with Rachel remains platonic. Soon Sarah is finding out that Aldous is no great catch. He announces he's going on tour and might have herpes. Before you know it, he breaks his vow of abstinence and crudely brags of sexual conquests with other women while drunk. Sarah is no longer 'into' the boyfriend and wants to start things up with Peter again. They have a brief sexual encounter but Peter realizes he's smitten with Rachel. He confesses to her of his brief fling with Sarah to prove his 'honesty' but Rachel takes it in the wrong way and rejects him. In a last moment of desperation, he tries to prove his love to her by tearing off a topless picture of Rachel pinned on the wall of a bathroom at a local club, only to be mercilessly beaten by the bartender-owner who considers the picture his property and domain.The beating appears to wake Peter up. He goes home and starts exercising and his muse returns. He's now composing a puppet musical about Dracula. In the best scene of the film, Peter puts his comic musical on before an appreciative audience. One wonders why the Dracula musical couldn't have been developed more and featured as a main part of the plot. Rachel ends up coming to see the musical and they end up reconciling.Describing the plot of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is difficult precisely because it's so disjointed. One searches in vain for a story arc that builds to a satisfying conclusion. Rather 'Marshall' feels like a series of skits thrown together that for the most part do not pay off. And when Peter, our lovable loser hero, finally redeems himself and turns into a 'mensch' at the climax, we've spent much too much time with him as a surly 'loser'; the transformation into a good guy is undeserved as he is basically quite misanthropic until the last 15 minutes of the movie.Forgetting Sarah Marshall could have been a much better comedy. There was the potential for satire, particularly in the CSI takeoffs at the beginning and end of the film that were never developed into something really clever. The same goes for the aforementioned puppet show (the most original moment in the film). Finally, the idea that Sarah would pathetically try and rekindle her romance with Peter after everything he put her through left me feeling unsatisfied. Despite Peter's positive transformation at the end, somehow I would have liked to have seen Sarah go off on her own without feeling the need to hook back up with an ex-boyfriend who treated her so poorly during most of their relationship.",3,6,11,11 March 2009
The Hunger Games," Survivor meets The Truman Show meets Demolition Man meets Marie Antoinette meets Winter's Bone meets Lord of the Flies
","'The Hunger Games' is an amalgamation of many films and TV shows we've seen before. For starters, the long-running reality show 'Survivor' comes to mind as a good part of the film is set in the forest where the characters must rely on survival skills to survive. The film's premise, in which children and teens between the ages of 12 and 18 must fight to the death as part of a televised spectacle, is reminiscent of 1998's 'The Truman Show', where Jim Carrey's entire life is put under the microscope of a reality show, broadcast to millions.The setting of Hunger Games is a post-apocalyptic dystopian future similar to the 2010 British film, 'Never Let Me Go'. Both films posit a future where a society of mindless, brainwashed automatons are unable to rebel against a totalitarian system that calls for deathly self-sacrifice of the young. With all the characters adopting such a one note conformity, there's very little wiggle room for any kind of interesting drama in the film, which relies more on the cheap thrill of watching teenagers attempt to do themselves in vis-a-vis mortal combat.The rulers of the post-apocalyptic country we're introduced to, 'Panem', are more like unpleasant fops from an 18th Century Louis VI French court than the ineffectual pacifists of the 1993 sci-fi satire, 'Demolition Man', starring Sandra Bullock. And our 'common folk' protagonists 'Katniss' and 'Peeta', from 'District 12', remind us of an Appalachian setting, similar to scenes from 'Winter's Bone', the same film in which the Hunger Games' star, Jennifer Lawrence, was nominated for a Best Actress Academy award.The Hunger Games takes an interminably long time before we get to the meat of the story. The reason for this is that the film's scenarist, Suzanne Collins, seeks to extract as many tears as possible from her teenage audience, by dwelling on the victimization on the protagonist's younger sister, Primrose, and Katniss' sacrifice, when she volunteers to take her place as part of the Hunger Games. Can the cold-hearted leaders at the 'Capitol' be stand-ins for parents in general, as the 'kids' appear to be completely at the mercy of adults who hypocritically claim to be acting beneficently on their behalf.The Hunger Games won't begin until we're treated to the next long-winded sequence where the principals are introduced to the public via the big media broadcast. The criticism of the media here seems to be all too obvious but Stanley Tucci is effective as the foppish master of ceremonies. Like many of the 'twists' throughout Hunger Games, Kantniss' dress catching on fire during her TV interview, hardly seems fantastic at all. If you want better 'magic', check out any Harry Potter flick instead! Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of the film--the fight to the death between the kids. One immediately thinks of a futuristic 'Lord of the Flies' here. Interestingly enough, director Gary Ross's herky-jerky style prevents us from really experiencing the full import of the violence. On one hand, that's commendable since the film's basic premise is wholly unappetizing. On the other hand, it prevents the film from being suspenseful, as the violence doesn't seem real, suggesting that these characters are also not real people.Hunger Games finally morphs into a completely dopey and comical spectacle as the teenagers (aided by the surly establishment) attempt to do one another in. As the games begin, the kids begin hacking each other with machetes. The rest of it is completely derivative including a dull computer-generated fire, a wasp nest falling from a tree, booby-trap explosions, more computer-generated nonsense (a pack of gnarling hounds), poisonous berries and a fight to the death on top of a weird sculpture called 'Cornucopia'.If this isn't ridiculous enough, at a certain point, the powers that be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district. This turns out to be a ruse and the new rule is rescinded which lead the protagonists to threaten mutual suicide. Although the bulk of the people are depicted as enjoying the spectacle of the mass killings at the beginning, the authorities now fear that a mutual suicide may cause unrest in the districts. Hence, the basic rules are changed, and now two are allowed to survive, instead of one.As Jennifer Lawrence appears to have signed on for three more Hunger Games sequels, she'll probably be set financially for life. Whether her overall reputation will survive after acting in such drivel, remains to be seen.The Hunger Games is really designed for young teenagers and older, less sophisticated teens who have little interest in reading anything resembling what any reasonably educated adult may refer to as 'literature'. It's a film that's mostly devoid of 'ideas' and appeals to devotees of soap operas, who always seem to end up entranced with one-dimensional villains and heroes or heroines, that inevitably end up on elevated pedestals!",3,5,12,16 September 2012
Zootopia," Anthropomorphic animals occasionally amuse but Zootopia descends into a quagmire of political correctness
","Having recently seen Pixar's entertaining computer animated comedy-drama Finding Dory, I was expecting something comparable from Disney with Zootopia. Unlike 'Dory,' which features a mixture of anthropomorphized fish characters playing off against humans, Zootopia features a world completely populated by non-human mammals (as well as some rodents thrown in to boot). The world of Zootopia posits the cessation of hostilities between the 10% of 'predators' versus 90% prey in the animal kingdom. However, that doesn't prevent the existence of prejudice among the creatures of Zootopia. The protagonist, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny from rural Bunnyburrow seeks to become the first bunny police officer. After ending up #1 in her class at the Police Academy, she becomes the first bunny officer in urban Zootropolis, a sprawling metropolis which features various ethnic neighborhoods such as Rodentia (a miniature city populated strictly by rodents), reflecting the ethnic diversity in human metropolitan centers.When Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a surly, by- the-book ram with a British accent, assigns Judy to humiliating duty as a meter maid, we realize that the discriminatory treatment she endures is a metaphor for misogyny and prejudice against women in the workplace. The appearance of the con-artist fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman)--as well as an earlier duplicitous fox character with a southern accent, Gideon Grey, back in Bunnyburrow--suggests that foxes appear to live up to their stereotyped reputations as manipulators and swindlers. Later on, Nick saves Judy and gives up a life of crime to become the first fox officer in Zootropolis. We learn that he initially went bad because of the prejudice he endured as a kid (the idea of an oppressed fox adopting the personality of his oppressor- -i.e. a criminal--doesn't seem like a far-fetched conceit at all).While the Zootopia scenarists keep us guessing (and occasionally laughing a little bit) as to how the various denizens of Zootopia mimic human behavior, the bulk of the plot is more reminiscent of a film noir. Take away all the animals and replace them with real human characters and all that remains is a rather standard detective noir. In this case, Judy and Nick are the 'detectives' who have 48 hours to find a Mr. Otterton--one of 10 predator mammals who have mysteriously disappeared from Zootropolis—or else Judy will be forced to hand in her resignation to boss Bogo.Judy and Nick's travails occasionally land them in some occasionally amusing worlds including a DMV office populated by extremely lugubrious sloths (the joke however, goes on for a little too long). Then there's 'Mr. Big,' who appears to be a takeoff on Marlon Brando as the Godfather. The twist is that he's a rodent and sits on the tiniest of thrones.Rather than humor, Zootopia is more interested in social commentary as Judy and Nick finally find the missing predators who have been imprisoned at an asylum by the city's mayor, a lion bent on protecting the public from the predators who have reverted to a 'savage' state.Nick splits with Judy after she suggests at a news conference that there might be a 'biological cause' for the predators' extreme aggressive behavior. Somehow her suggestion is interpreted the wrong way—biology becomes heredity in the eyes of animals like Nick, who represent the 10% of predators subject to discrimination. Zootopia takes on an even more heavy-handed turn when we learn that the predators have been injected with darts containing a serum made from toxic flowers. This turns out to be the 'biological' cause Judy alluded to earlier which accounts for the crazed behavior of the 'predators.' Behind all this is a 'Prey Supremacist' movement—led by the newly minted mayor, Bellwhether, a sheep who was only recently the Assistant Mayor.Could it be the 10%-- the 'predators'--are a metaphor for minority populations, subject to racism and discrimination? And the prey supremacists is just another code word for 'white supremacy'? All well and good but there's still one little problem here—those who engage in criminal activities (such as Nick the Fox), blame their immoral behavior on being victims of prejudice in childhood. Is that a valid excuse for immoral conduct? It seems that 'personal responsibility' is a value that the film's scenarists are ignoring here. Again the idea of the oppressed becoming the oppressors is a valid one, but Zootopia doesn't exactly deal with it in a completely honest way. Here the foxes are simply wily con men, with their chief (Nick), becoming completely reformed and willing to work within the system (Nick again is the first fox policeman). But what of those who choose to seek a life of violent crime? Where are these characters in the Zootopia universe? Only the 'Prey Supremacists' are guilty of extreme, nefarious conduct. The Predators (foxes), however, are practically benign—with the idea that most will go straight like Nick and Judy's reformed childhood bully (the fox, Gideon Grey).Zootopia unfortunately is an exercise in political correctness. While pointing out that prejudice is a bad thing (which of course is a very good idea)--the suggestion that the victims of such prejudice won't usually end up prejudiced themselves, is an example of wishful thinking. No one ethnic group should be held up as a paragon of moral superiority simply because they were victims of discrimination in the past.",5,4,15,3 April 2017
42," Average biopic ably covers Robinson the legend, but not so much the man
","At what point does a film biography become a hagiography? Yes of course we know that it took tremendous courage to do what Jackie Robinson did. But no matter how hard writer/director Brian Helgeland tries, he ultimately falls into the pit of placing the legendary Mr. Robinson, on a pedestal that he can't get off.Helgeland does well in introducing us to Jackie the legend but we never get a sense of who Robinson the man, really was. I'm not sure if it could really be done, but perhaps in the hands of a better writer, a lot more interesting facts about Jackie Robinson could have been revealed. I leave the digging up of those facts to those who are privy to the real behind-the-scenes look of Robinson's career and the interactions amongst the players and management of the Brooklyn Dodgers.Still, Helgeland does touch upon the basic history of what Robinson had to put up with when he entered major league baseball. I found it particularly interesting the whole affair with Ben Chapman, who was perhaps one of the most virulent racists in baseball at that time. It was bad publicity from the press that actually got the front office of the Philadelphia Phillies to force Chapman to publicly act nice toward Robinson. Note that Robinson came up with the idea of taking a picture with Chapman while holding a bat (Robinson justifiably doesn't want to shake his hand because he knows Chapman doesn't really mean what he says—he's just doing it upon orders of his bosses).Helgeland also has a number of other good scenes, particularly the one in which Robinson must suppress his rage after being taunted by Chapman, and is counseled by Branch Rickey not to let the racist manager, provoke him.Historically, Robinson's struggle against racism is an epic battle, but dramatically it's difficult to illustrate, since there isn't one antagonist which Robinson must fight until an exciting climax at film's end. Instead, in documentary style, we're treated to a series of end credits, which are designed to explain why we should feel elevated by Robinson's achievement.Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Robinson but he's limited by a script that mainly focuses on Robinson's internal struggle to keep a lid on his own justified anger and raw emotions as well as illustrating some of his celebrated moves on the base paths. Robinson's relationship with Branch Rickey is perhaps the most fleshed out of Robinson's relationships with the people who he interacted with, during his life. Helgeland gives Nicole Behaire little to do as Rachel Robinson, Robinson's devoted wife, and one keeps wondering whether Helgeland could have done more with the part.Bill Madden, the NY Daily News sports columnist, points out that the film is full of factual errors. For example, he argues that Leo Durocher was not suspended for his marital infidelities, but for gambling. He also asks how Robinson could have had a walk-off home run, in the opponent's home park? And the daughter of Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Fritz Ostermueller, maintains that her father never hit Robinson in the head with a pitch and that he merely was throwing a 'brush back' pitch. What's more she insisted that, 'My dad, to my knowledge, was not a racist,' she told TMZ. 'I was not raised in that type of home.' How much research did Helgeland actually do for this film? He has Ralph Branca asking Robinson to join him in the shower and Branca insists that never happened. Sure, a writer can take dramatic license, but at least write something that seems mildly plausible.If you want a basic history lesson about how Jackie Robinson became major league's baseball's first black ballplayer and if you're also interested in seeing a good performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, '42' is for you. But 'touching all the bases' does not make a great work of art. This is the film that needed to be a lot more subtle and it's nowhere near that.Jackie Robinson's early demise must be seen as tragic since he was only 53 when diabetes and heart disease took his life. Maybe that fact also should have been mentioned in the film, a fact equally as important as all of Jackie Robinson's great achievements on and off the baseball field.",5,7,13,4 May 2013
Argo," Affleck employs dramatic license to make CIA Iranian rescue operation more suspenseful than it actually was
","I enjoyed 'Argo', but some people are talking this flick up as an Oscar winner for best picture. That I cannot see. However, it is definitely a story worth telling as it's a fascinating tale and reminds Americans about the dangers of a country like Iran.Perhaps the most gripping part of the film is the opening, as the US embassy is about to be taken over by fanatical 'students' and supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who just returned to Iran as a result of the 1979 revolution. Ben Affleck does a great job in chronicling how US embassy staff members went about shredding classified documents, minutes before the embassy compound is taken over by the fanatics. Equally fascinating is the way in which the six US staff members make their escape, as they simply walk out on to the street from an adjoining building, while the crazed Iranians are focusing on attacking the main part of the compound.When I first heard about 'Argo', I thought the whole operation was much more extensive, involving a whole film crew entering Iran and actually beginning to film a phony movie there. It wasn't quite that complicated. CIA operative Tony Mendez's plan was simply to create the illusion that a movie was going to be made in Hollywood, by taking out an ad in a trade paper and holding a 'table read' of the script, which was covered by the press. Interestingly enough, the producer played by Alan Arkin is a fictional construct; only John Goodman's character, John Chambers, the Hollywood make-up artist, actually existed.As the Argo story develops, with Mendez flying to Iran posing as a Canadian film producer and establishing contact with the Iranian film board, it all seemed quite plausible. And when Mendez takes the six members to a bazaar in the city, where their cover is almost blown when confronted by an angry crowd, that also seemed quite real. But when we finally arrive at the crucial scene, where the six must get past an Iranian ticket taker at the airport, without any proof that they actually came into the country, I wondered if that happened the way it's depicted in the film. It turns out that in reality, the Canadian ambassador's wife purchased three separate sets of tickets on three different airlines for the six embassy staff members. Even more historically inaccurate is the suspenseful scene in the film, in which the Carter administration cancels the mission just as Mendez is about to attempt to whisk his charges out of Iran. In reality, the mission was canceled for only thirty minutes and that occurred BEFORE Mendez left the United States.Finally, perhaps the most suspenseful part of the film, the confrontation with the Revolutionary guards at the departure gate, the call to Hollywood to confirm Mendez's cover and big chase out on the runway—none of that ever happened. Even without prior knowledge of the true history of the events depicted here, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the chase on the runway was pure Hollywood.Does Affleck's 'dramatic license', diminish the film's overall impact? Frankly, yes. Too much of what goes on, seems a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless, 'Argo' is still quite entertaining and is worth the price of admission. More credit should have gone to the Canadian ambassador Taylor, in his role in saving the US embassy staff members (the closing credits merely allude to the great co-operation between the US and Canada and say nothing specifically of Taylor's heroics). Finally, I was most impressed by the casting choices for the six embassy staff members. The ID cards of the actual escapees are shown during the closing credits, juxtaposed with the actors playing them. Take a look at the resemblance between the real and the fictional characters. It's uncanny!",6,4,7,2 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Despite the derivative plot, Reboot #2, far outshines Reboot #1
","I'm happy to report that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superior to the ho-hum 2009 initial Reboot. Here you get two villains for the price of one; they manage to be much more fleshed out than the bald Romulan, Nero, in the 2009 film, an unlikeable sadist of a character, who viewers could never warm up to.At least the two villains in 'Into Darkness', Starfleet's Admiral Marcus, and the genetically engineered superhuman, rogue Starfleet agent, John Harrison (aka 'Khan'), operate on the surface, with some sort of (albeit twisted), moral imperative. Marcus is sort of a futuristic Dick Cheney run amok, determined to provoke a war with the Klingons, who he fears will soon destroy the Federation. And Khan, who resorts to terrorism when he blows up a secret Starfleet installation in London, is actually trying to get back at Marcus, who has stashed 72 of his superhuman comrades inside photon torpedoes, which end up on the Enterprise.After Kirk's mentor, Admiral Pike, is killed by Khan, in a direct attack on Starfleet headquarters in San Francisco, Marcus correctly calculates that the impulsive Kirk, will gladly follow his 'shoot to kill' orders, and take out Khan, who has fled to Chronos, the Klingon home world. Kirk's impulsivity is what makes him interesting. Don't ask me why it's necessary for Marcus to place the 72 'pod people' in the photon torpedoes, because after all, Kirk could eventually disobey his orders and they could be discovered, which could mean bad news for Marcus, back at Starfleet. But that's exactly what happens. So why didn't Marcus dispose of Khan's 72 buddies before he orders Kirk to go after Khan? Some internet posters have suggested that Marcus wants to 'stick it to' Khan after he becomes a turncoat. Khan will die with the knowledge that all members of his race will die with him, at the same moment.If Kirk happens to have a little of 'Marcus' in him in his thirst for revenge, it's up to his 'United Nations' crew members, to become more 'balanced' and bring Kirk back into the fold, so he conforms to acceptable behavior, within the context of international (or shall we say, 'universal') law. 'Scotty' is first to sound the trumpet of 'lawful behavior', when he resigns his commission after he's banned from inspecting the torpedoes. And then Spock, Bones and Uhura, who today would make a great team on a Commission of Human Rights, convince Kirk to take Khan alive.'Into Darkness' really picks up in terms of plot, when a series of reversals keep us guessing as what's going to happen next. Marcus attacks the Enterprise and disables it; Kirk offers to give up Khan and the 72 cryogenically frozen ones but before Marcus can kill everyone, Scotty infiltrates Marcus' unmarked Federation starship, the USS Vengeance, and causes a power outage; after Kirk and Khan do a 'space jump' to the Vengeance, Khan manages to kill Marcus and take over the ship. But Spock manages to beam the torpedoes onto the USS Vengeance, explode them, causing the ship to become incapacitated, just like the Enterprise.There's a spectacular scene as Khan crashes the USS Vengeance into Starfleet Academy in San Francisco as well as his apprehension by Spock and Uhura (please rest assured that in the future, there are still cable cars operating in San Francisco!).'Into Darkness' could have been a masterpiece except for the unfortunate fact that it is wholly derivative. Kids who are not familiar with earlier Trek movies, might not realize that when Kirk saves the ship by going into the radiation chamber and has an emotional farewell with Spock, that's almost a direct rip-off from Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Except in the earlier film, the roles are reversed: it's Spock who gets radiated, dies and saves the ship! I know this is supposed to be a tribute to Wrath of Khan, but tributes should not be direct copies. It's an example of LAZY Screen writing.Examples of additional laziness abound in Reboot #2. Consider how easy it is that Kirk is revived when they discover Khan's blood has restorative properties. One unexplored implication is that many people on earth will now be resurrected from death, by simply tapping into the blood supply of the 72 pod people, once they are brought out of suspended animation.There are plenty of more scenes that are copies from earlier Trek incarnations. Take for example, the opening scene, where the Prime Directive is violated. How many times did we see that before? Another group of indigenous peoples, being saved by the noble crew of the Enterprise. Or how about the 'machine gun' attack on Starfleet Headquarters or when Kirk and Khan, do the 'space jump'? You'll just have to ignore In Darkness' lack of originality, if you want to enjoy this film.The story is also enhanced by how the screenwriters give the supporting players, their moment in the sun. I happen to favor Simon Pegg as the best actor in the film and enjoyed how he disabled the ship, in the proud tradition of the original Scotty, James Doohan. Bones is nicely utilized when he helps out arming the torpedoes and saves Kirk; Uhura helps Spock subdue Khan and Chekov has some nifty moments, below deck. Sulu also manages to get in the act by some death-defying piloting.Spare me all the little petty arguments between Kirk and Spock as well as the aforementioned copycat radiation chamber scene. Nonetheless, Chris Pine and Zachary Quintero, are becoming much more comfortable as worthy precursors of Shatner and Nimoy.Now that J.J. Abrams has improved his reboot, it's high time that he steps up his game and comes up with a truly original screenplay for the third installment. Keep the copycat stuff to a minimum. 'In Darkness' passes the testbarely.",6,0,2,20 June 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Occasionally amusing tale of bad boy mentor devolves into sentimental romance
","'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is billed as a romantic comedy but ends up much more as a sentimental romance. The inciting incident comes up quite quickly: Wife Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces she wants out of her 25 year marriage to husband Cal (Steve Carrell), after revealing that she's been having an affair with a colleague at work. It's a poorly written scene as Cal meekly acquiesces to Emily's demand and we never really find out why she's so dissatisfied in the first place.After some rather long-winded scenes where Cal drowns his sorrows in drink at a local bar, bemoaning his fate as a marriage castaway, he finally meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and we break into the second act of the story. Jacob is a womanizer, a 'player' of great skill, if you will, who takes pity on Cal and decides to teach him how to pick up women. This is perhaps the best and most amusing part of the movie where Jacob first picks out a new wardrobe for Cal and then orders him to watch him in action, as he seduces women step-by-step. At first Cal is resistant but soon learns how to imitate Jacob's every line and he ends up bedding nine women, one of whom happens to be Kate, the public school teacher of Cal's son Robbie, played by Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, Kate is one of Tomei's least likable roles in awhile, as she is an over the top nymphomaniac, who ends up continually giving Cal the finger later in the story, for bedding her and then leaving her high and dry.Meanwhile, other ditsy complications accrue. Robbie becomes obsessed with he and his sister's babysitter, Jessica, who in turn develops a crush on Cal. There's a rather unfunny bit where Jessica, upon the advice of a seductive high school student rival, takes nude pictures of herself with the plan of sending them to Cal, only to have them fall, way too easily, into the hands of her hot head father. Even worse is the obnoxious infatuation that festers in Robbie throughout the film. How much can an audience take of a 13 year old's creepy obsession that only abates at just about the final scene of the movie?'Crazy, Stupid, Love' becomes a lot less 'crazy' in the second half, more stupid and pours on the 'love', a little too thick. It seems that the cool Jacob character turns into a cream puff when he falls for Hannah, who happens to be the adult daughter of Emily and Cal. There are virtually no clues (except for Cal's reference early in the narrative, to 'Nana', Hannah's childhood appellation), so the big 'twist' feels forced and unearned, on the part of the film's scenarists. Now the tables are turned and Jacob is turning to Cal for 'advice' on how to handle relationships. Cal's insecurity and goofiness is a now a badge of honor, as he can show Jacob how to 'be himself'.While Cal wants to cut off all ties with Jacob, now that he's fallen for his daughter, it doesn't take long before an extra dose of 'love', becomes the more prominent moniker in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Yes, Cal soon sees the light and is willing to embrace ex-bad boy Jacob, as his new, potential son-in-law. He interrupts Robbie's speech as Salutatorian of the school, who is in the middle of a put down about true love, due to his rejection by Jessica. Cal recounts his courtship of Emily, affirming his love for her. After the graduation ceremony, Cal hands Robbie the nude photos of Jessica, as his 'consolation prize'. Robbie agrees to call off his stalking of Jessica, by shaking her hand and promising to look her up only once he finally begins to look more like his Dad in a few years. As if we couldn't predict it, Cal and Emily are seen reminiscing about the events of the past year and the implication is of course, that they soon will be back together.Even more disappointing than the transformation of bad boy Jacob into into a virtual milquetoast, Julianne Moore is saddled with the weakest role in the film. We learn little about Emily throughout the film—and the pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is occasionally amusing, especially when Carrell and Gosling face off in the first half. But by the denouement, we're back in the realm of the predictable, and even worse: an egregious, sentimental, happy-ending. Try this once but see it a second time at your own peril!",4,1,4,24 December 2011
Public Enemies," Depp serves up chivalrous romantic in place of wise-cracking psychopath
","Here we go again with another John Dillinger movie. There have been a fair number of them over the years and the question arises, do we really need another one? The answer is, not really! But if one is insistent on making another movie about the legendary Depression-era bank robber, as Michael Mann has done here, one should at least provide us with a convincing protagonist as well as a realistic atmosphere.One of Director Mann's big mistakes was to film 'Public Enemies' in high definition. It's ironic that the original concept was to shoot the film as a TV mini-series based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book about early 30s gangsters and the origins of the FBI. The HD cinematography gives the film too modern a look as though we're watching an HBO special. What's more, some of the action is hard to make out during the scenes shot during the night. I also found the soundtrack to be irritating as the music was also much too modern at times. The fault lies with composer Elliot Goldenthal who admitted that his job was 'chiefly composing dramatic music that didn't necessarily have to sound like it came from 1931 or 1933. It could be timeless.'But Mann's biggest mistake was to cast Johnny Depp as Dillinger. Depp might be good playing offbeat characters such as Captain Jack Sparrow or Ichabod Crane but he's no gangster. Just look at his smooth, almost feminine face—it's a face of an artistic type not of a criminal or someone who has experience dealing with the underworld. Before he became successful as an actor, Depp was involved in the rock music world as a musician and songwriter. No doubt Depp was drawn to the films' scenarists conception of Dillinger as a misunderstood romantic. Their Dillinger makes it a point to cover a female hostage with a coat following a bank robbery. He's also adamant about not committing any kidnappings as bank robberies are his modus operandi. The only time we see the Depp Dillinger get really violent is when he slugs a man who's acting impolite toward his love interest, coat-check girl Billie Frechette. Depp Dillinger's chivalry reaches its apotheosis when he makes tender love to Billie in an early drawn-out sex scene. Now the real Dillinger was known to be quite personable and perhaps at times could be chivalrous—but what's missing here from Mr. Depp is the notion that Dillinger was a dangerous psychopath and capable of many fits of violence. There is a complete disconnect in this film with Dillinger's character (who we're supposed to sympathize with) and his true-life actions. Somehow Dillinger is excused for his behavior because deep down he's simply misunderstood—he's not really violent. In his place is a surrogate--Baby Face Nelson (very convincingly played by Stephen Graham) who we can blame for the violence while the Depp Dillinger gets his free pass. Even lawman Purvis' associates end up being worse than Dillinger—they torture one of the gang members to extract information and rough up Billie before Purvis intercedes on her behalf.Another big mistake in this script is that it totally lacks humor. Compare the humorless Depp Dillinger with the wise-cracking psychopath conceived by Warren Oates in John Millius' 1973 take on the notorious outlaw. In the 1973 'Dillinger', Oates is far more believable because he can be both funny (likeable) and scary. Sometimes the violence is too over the top when he slugs Billie (played by Michelle Phillips) in the face but there are enough moments of black humor that give the 1973 film its charm. Despite being too old for the part, Ben Johnson was a far superior Melvin Purvis in the '73 version to Christian Bale's virtual automaton. Johnson's phone conversation with Oates is hilarious as he makes it clear that their relationship is 'nothing personal' and everything is kept on a 'friendly' level. On the other hand, Bale, with no coolness whatsoever, simply informs Depp while he's in the jail cell that the only time he'll get out is once he's executed!Just as in the 1973 version, all the main bases are touched in the Dillinger story: Dillinger's arrest and escape from the Crown Point, Indiana jail; the shootout at the Little Bohemia Lodge and Dillinger's death in front of the Biograph theater. What the new film has over its predecessor is some nice on-location cinematography. However, the opening scene gives more credit to Dillinger than is his due: he never directly participated in the escape of his associates at the Indiana State Prison.My main problem with 'Public Enemies' was that it deliberately attempted to distort and perhaps glorify a criminal who terrorized innocent people. Even if Dillinger never killed anyone (although he supposedly was responsible for the death of at least one bank guard), good citizens feared for their lives whenever he robbed a bank or took people hostage. What's more, 'Public Enemies' only presents the basic outline of the Dillinger story. We never get a sense of a fleshed-out human being, replete with all the behind-the scene tidbits that could have made this film something truly special. It's hard to believe that Michael Mann is the same director who gave us the excellent 'Last of the Mohicans'. But the aging process will take its toll on even some of the most creative among us.",3,1,1,8 November 2010
The Other Boleyn Girl," The Other Boleyn can't hold a candle to 'Anne of the Thousand Days'
","For those who give high ratings to 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can only suggest that you either rent or buy the superb 1969 film, 'Anne of the Thousand Days'. Both films basically deal with the same subject but there's really no comparison. Where 'Anne' is a complex historical recreation and magisterial drama, 'The Other Boleyn' is a ponderous soap opera, where numerous film-goers today have been taken in by the film's lavish production values (shot in High Definition), along with the three big name Hollywood stars who can't hold a candle to predecessors such as Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold who really make you feel like you're watching flesh and blood human beings who lived in the 16th century.I haven't read the book which the movie was based on but I question why it was necessary to tell Anne Boleyn's story through the eyes of her older sister Mary (inaccurately depicted as the younger sister here in this film). Mary's part in 'Anne of the Thousand Days' is wisely depicted as brief and her bitterness toward her father for 'pimping her out' to King Henry VIII is much more believable than Scarlett Johansson's Mary who continues to hold a soft spot for the King despite being unceremoniously dumped by him and bearing a child who was dubbed a bastard. Mary is basically depicted as a saint who we're supposed to identify with because she has a 'good heart'. Unfortunately, most saints make for boring drama and Johansson's Mary is no exception. Johansson did well in Woody Allen's well-scripted 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' but she is completely out of her element in the 16th century. Instead of a world weary traveler in the Tudor court, Johansson's Mary is more like an Amish-like simpleton whose grim and ponderous expressions suggest that she is an actor of extremely limited range. Mary has little to do in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. Her two big scenes (the love scene with King Henry and the birth of her son) are devoid of substantial dramatic conflict.What's worse is the suggestion that Anne and Mary were competitors for Henry's approval. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there was no competition between the two sisters. Mary's story was over when Anne comes on the scene. Genevieve Bujold defiantly states that she will never let the King do what he did to her sister and it takes a very long time in that film before Anne changes her mind. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Natalie Portman's Anne is a cold and calculating schemer from the beginning, inexplicably accusing her sister from taking the King from her. Later, she blames Mary for being responsible for the breakup of her secret union with Henry Percy. Ann's Uncle, the Duke of Northrop, orders that the two lovers separate. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', the breakup is a matter of state policy. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wolsey, threatens Ann's lover and they're forced to part due to the King's designs on Anne. In 'The Other Boleyn Girl', Anne's undoing is attributed to what appears to be something like a bi-polar episode. After Henry rejects her because she can't bear a male heir, she becomes unhinged and ends up slapping him. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Anne is both the victim of Henry's cruelty and her own ambition to see her daughter declared the first in succession to the English throne.Screenwriter Peter Morgan's view of Henry VIII is way off the mark. Thanks to Morgan's superficial portrait, Eric Bana, turns Henry into a GQ model rather than the petty but complex Henry of history. For those who are offended that I dare suggest that Bana isn't right for the part, I strongly urge you to watch Richard Burton in 'Anne of the Thousand Days'; afterward, come back and tell me with a straight face that you think Bana was right for this part. What's missing in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is how Henry relates to members of his Court. Who are his friends and confidants? And of course there's the whole political intrigue of the court which is glossed over in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. The key players, Cardinal Wolsey and the King's adviser, the deadly Thomas Cromwell, are missing. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there are a myriad of characters interacting with the King and as a result of these interactions, a full portrait of Henry's personality comes through. Here, Bana's Henry is dull and witless. What's more, Morgan's view of Henry and Anne's relationship has no real grace or drama. The best Morgan can come up with is a crude rape scene which reduces Henry to a comic book villain.'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without a few good points. Ana Torrent is brilliant as Katherine of Aragon, depicting the quiet dignity of a woman terribly wronged. David Morrissey is credible as the steely social-climbing uncle who holds the strings in the family. Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyn mother acquits herself well but she's a bit too much of a feminist icon for 16 century England. Mark Rylance was much too ineffectual as Sir Thomas Boleyn but he looks very good as a 16th century nobleman.Production-wise, 'The Other Boleyn' is filmed in sumptuous high definition and the scenes in the English countryside are a pleasure to watch. The camera work is for the most part pretty good with first-time director Justin Chardwick shooting scenes from a multiplicity of angles.In the end, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not the other Boleyn's Girl story. If you want the 'real McCoy', then you must see Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold together. They are master craftsmen and you will be truly moved by their performances. The remake connects the dots but can never hold a candle to the 1969 production. Sometimes it's best to leave things well enough alone!",5,2,3,28 November 2009
The Danish Girl," Story of transgender pioneer will grab you but still needs more character development
","Director Tim Hooper, responsible for the excellent Oscar winner 'The King's Speech,' is now back with a much more obscure but fascinating historical tale, 'The Danish Girl.' I was completely unaware of the story of Lili Elbe, the first man to undergo gender reassignment surgery, who lived her last tragic years as a woman.The film begins slowly as we meet newlyweds Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) in Copenhagen during the 1920s. Einar is a mediocre landscape painter but Gerda is a much more talented portrait artist. We finally break into Act 2 when Einar puts on a pair of stockings to take the place of a female model who fails to show up for one of Gerda's sessions. The stockings trigger the gushing out of Einar's repressed feelings that deep inside he's really a woman. Soon Einar's alter ego emerges as Lili, and Gerda brings him to a party, passing him off as Einar's cousin. The game is short-lived when Gerda catches a possible gay suitor kissing Lili and she expresses her fears that she might be losing a husband. Einar can no longer accept leading a double life and decides he's much more comfortable as Lili than Einar.Perhaps the most dramatic scenes in the film involve Lili attempting to get help for all the anxiety she's experiencing in her transition to life as a woman. The reactionary character of the medical establishment appears in high relief when one professional after another labels her as a deviant. Lili must flee these phony 'helpers' with the threat she may be institutionalized and possibly lobotomized. The average man on the street also shows their brutal intolerance when Lili is beaten up by a couple of thugs who are offended by her effeminate mannerisms.The Danish Girl is based on a novel and one gets the feeling that the true life Lili Elbe was a bit more interesting and complicated than the way she is depicted here. Redmayne does well in conveying Lili's angst in transitioning to the opposite gender but appears also to fall in love with the character's affectations as opposed to conveying different aspects of her personality. When Lili takes a job as a salesgirl, all she aspires to is enjoying gossipy conversations with her co-workers. In contrast, Gerda is a woman feminists can be proud of—her career takes off when she sells portraits of Lili that rival any of the well-known artists of the day.There is no doubt that Lili was a pioneer and very brave in attempting gender reassignment at a time when the odds of such a procedure being successful were extremely low. But I would argue that this seemingly virtuous act is not enough to classify the Lili depicted here as a compelling character. Hooper does indeed attempt to flesh Lili out a bit by suggesting that her neediness bordered on narcissism. This is reflected particularly on how we're supposed to feel about Gerda's reaction to the loss of Einar—in the film she's conflicted when Einar's childhood friend, Hans Axgil, wants to become involved with her. Hans is actually a fictional character and in real life, Gerda was bisexual and lived for quite a while with Lili. It appears Gerda's despair over the loss of her 'husband' was invented, in order to create some additional drama, to move the story along.The Danish Girl ends on a wistful note. It's implied that because Lili did not wait to heal after her first operation, this led to her death. According to history, she had a series of operations and the last one, which involved in the implantation of a womb, led to her early demise. Whatever the case, Lili's desire to live as a woman was so strong that she was willing to take the risk of surgery, despite the obvious odds of failure. The Danish Girl is worth seeing as a fascinating history lesson but keep in mind some of it is probably more fiction than fact.",6,5,16,5 December 2015
Knives Out," Standard update of Agatha Christie-like murder mystery featuring solid performances by an all-star cast
","Writer/Director Rian Johnson is best known for his last 2017 effort, 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi,' which did very well on both Metacritic (85%) and Rotten Tomatoes (91%). Less successful in my opinion was Johnson's 2012 Looper, which was quite successful at the box office but featured a rather convoluted sci-fi narrative that didn't work very well. Here with Knives Out, he's decided to channel Agatha Christie, in a contemporary murder mystery with an all-star cast.
Knives Out is virtually 'all plot' with stock character types typical of the genre. Case in point is the main character, private detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig who sports a notable southern accent. Craig does well in the part but just about any other marquee star could have taken on the role and done an equally decent job as Craig.
As the story unfolds, Blanc is called into investigate the murder of famed mystery writer, Harlan Thrombey (winningly played by Christopher Plummer), following his 85th birthday party celebration at the Thrombey mansion.
The quirky family members all soon learn they've been cut out of Harlan's will. They include Harlan's daughter: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), a real estate mogul initially bankrolled by her father; her husband Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's son-in-law, who's having an affair which Harlan was about to expose, and Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), an arrogant, spoiled playboy who proves to be the principal antagonist.
Also in mix are: Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), Harlan's youngest son who runs his publishing empire; Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette), Harlan's daughter-in-law, who was married to Harlan's deceased son Neil; and Meg Thrombey, Joni's daughter (Katherine Langford). There are other characters here, mostly too numerous to list.
The other principal character is Harlan's nurse and caretaker, Marta Cabrera (a very solid Ana de Armas) who is implicated in Harlan's murder after she accidentally gives him a fatal dose of morphine. Instead of rehashing the plot, suffice it to say Johnson wisely keeps us guessing for a while as to who is responsible for Harlan's death.
The actual circumstances of the murder are well thought out, as Marta actually gives him the correct dose of medication through instinct but then comes to believe otherwise after the murderer switches labels on the bottle. Later it's revealed through a toxicology report that Harlan did not receive a fatal overdose, but following Marta's unintentional but false confession to him that she mistakenly gave him the wrong dose, he promptly commits suicide by slashing his throat.
The rest of Knives Out involves only a modicum of suspense with Blanc following Marta around the mansion (upon his orders), as she continues to dispose of any clues that might implicate her.
The basic problem with the narrative once we break into the Second Act (SPOILERS AHEAD) is that the most unsavory character here turns out to be the prime suspect and ultimately the guilty party. Without revealing who that character is, I can only say that I was expecting a little bit more of a twist ending, given the already evident presence of such an unsavory antagonist.
The question remains, do we need another one of these updated Agatha Christie-like murder mysteries? I say, why not? This one, however, is rather standard but it does contain a few moments of suspense coupled with solid performances all-around, from an all-star cast.",6,2,3,8 December 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," Academy Award winner, a gritty crime thriller with credibility issues, is truly a mixed bag
","'The Secret in Their Eyes' won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2009. Some critics have criticized the film for a lack of verisimilitude, but others, the greater majority, were quite impressed by the way in which the sordid underbelly of Argentina in the 70s is revealed, when it was ruled with an iron hand by the Peronistas and their fascist supporters.The protagonist here is Benjamín Espósito who pays a visit to Judge Irene Menéndez-Hastings, who was his boss back in the 70s in Buenos Aires. Espósito is now retired but used to work as a Federal Police Officer in the courthouse. He tells Menéndez-Hastings that he plans to write a novel about the rape/murder case he investigated involving the attractive victim, Liliana Coloto, married to an unassuming bank employee, Ricardo Morales. Most of the rest of the film involves flashbacks to the time Espósito investigated the crime.As we flash back, Campanella puts us right square in the middle of the down and dirty world of these 'federales', who are entrusted with bringing criminals to the bar of justice. Espósito is aided by his good buddy in the office, Pablo Sandoval, a deputy clerk who has a drinking problem. The machinations involving Sandoval add to the film's believability as the 'good guys' are shown not to be 'squeaky clean' or overly heroic. Initially, two construction workers are fingered by one of Espósito's colleague, Romano, as the culprits in the murder of Coloto; but after Espósito interviews them, he concludes that they're wholly innocent and were beaten and framed by Romano. Espósito goes so far as to file a formal complaint against Romano, who is transferred to another city.The real suspect, Isidoro Gómez, is revealed after Espósito notices pictures in Coloto's old photo album who are given to him by Morales. In these pictures, Gómez is seen staring at Coloto and this is enough for Espósito to conclude that Gómez is his man (merely by the look of his eyes). Many internet posters found Espósito's conclusion not to be believable at all but sometimes old fashioned police work involves mere 'hunches'. Gómez's guilt becomes more apparent when he intentionally disappears after Espósito and Sandoval are hot on his trail.Espósito (much to the chagrin of boss Menéndez-Hastings) engages in some extra-judicial shenanigans of his own when he breaks into Gómez's mother's home and steals some of his cryptic letters. Again, the good guys are not always so good. Menéndez-Hastings shuts down the case but a year later, Espósito runs into Morales in a train station, who informs him that he goes to various stations and sits there for hours, hoping he'll find his wife's killer. Espósito is so impressed by Morales' determination, that he convinces his boss to re-open the investigation into Coloto's murder.It's Sandoval who has the brilliant insight that the purloined letters reveal Gómez's passion for soccer (Sandoval's meditation on mens' passion, is a critical component later in the plot). Specifically, Gómez is a fanatical fan of a particular soccer team, the Racing Club, so Espósito and Sandoval have been attending Racing Club's games in the hope of finding him in the crowd. And again, many internet posters found it unbelievable that the intrepid investigators would be able to find such a 'needle in a haystack'. Nonetheless, they do and Gómez now finds himself in their custody.It's rather neat how Menéndez-Hastings takes over the interrogation of Gómez and pretends that he's not their suspect because he doesn't fit the profile of a 'real man' who could possibly rape and kill the victim. She insults him by claiming that he is not well endowed at all and eventually he loses his cool, takes out his member (as proof that he is well-endowed), calls her a 'bitch', punches her in the face and inadvertently confesses. It's a very 'cinematic' scene but the wily killer (who soon is smart enough to escape the bar of justice) is not a very clever psychopath at this juncture at all!Perhaps the best twist in the plot is when Gómez is released from prison after his conviction and is seen on TV, behind Eva Perón, as an apparent bodyguard. Now it's Romano's turn to get 'revenge' as he tells Espósito and Menéndez-Hastings to get lost, as the killer has become a trusted lieutenant for the bad guys. It's chilling when Gómez flashes his gun in the elevator in front of Espósito and his naïve boss and even more chilling when Sandoval is mistakenly shot at Espósito's home, in a case of mistaken identity.The years pass and we're now back in the present. Espósito's ending for his novel isn't satisfying to either one of them (he paints a hackneyed portrait of himself and Menéndez-Hastings—with her having second thoughts about rejecting him, chasing him in the train station, as he leaves Buenos Aires on the train for good, seeking protection from Gómez and his associates).With the Judge's help, Espósito tracks down Morales (hence now, a better ending!). The climax is designed to shock but is it believable? After Espósito doubles back to Morales' house, he realizes that the story that Morales told (that he killed Gómez), couldn't be true since Morales had made it clear years ago that life imprisonment was far more a vengeful (and satisfactory) punishment than the death penalty, where a killer merely peacefully 'goes to sleep', after receiving a lethal injection. Given the situation he was in, trapped like a rat by Morales, do you really believe that Gómez would not have taken his own life? And furthermore, I wasn't convinced that it was so easy for Morales to abduct Gómez in the first place.Ultimately, 'The Secret in Their Eyes' kept my interest, although some of it was slow-moving and not always believable. As for an Academy Award—some voters may have gone overboard just a bit.",6,0,4,15 October 2014
The Irishman," Scorsese's tale of famed union leader hit compromised by slow pacing and a sense of déjà vu
","The Irishman is based on the life of the film's narrator, Frank Sheeran, a truck driver turned hitman, who claims he killed both the notorious Mafioso Joey Gallo and famed Teamsters union leader, Jimmy Hoffa.
Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) begins the narration as an old man in a nursing home. His account presents two flashbacks: the first recounting how he started out as a Teamster union truck driver in his 20s and a second, when he's driving with his mentor Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the head of a Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family, along with their two wives, to attend the wedding of Bufalino's cousin's daughter in Detroit in the 1970s.
The 'drive to Detroit' foreshadows the events leading up to the second act 'dark moment' (where Sheeran ends up murdering Hoffa). Like many scenes in this 3 ½ hour film, the extended 'pit stops' depicting the banal conversations between Bufalino and Sheeran in the car (and on the road), just end up slowing the film's pace down considerably. It's designed to emphasize one of the film's major themes: the banality of evil of Mafia goons-a point made in almost every scene in this film ad infinitum.
Scorsese uses special effects to de-age his principals in the flashbacks, so DeNiro is supposed to look in his 20s when we first meet him. Unfortunately, he looks nowhere what he used to look like (in real life) when he was in Taxi Driver back in the 70s. Here he looks more like he's in his mid-40s. But Scorsese is much more successful in de-aging Pesci, who appears true to his chronological age in the early part of the film.
The first part of the film-the expository scenes- is long-winded for sure but it kept my interest. This is where the Teamsters' union lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano) gets Sheeran off the hook when he's accused of theft by his company after a load of meat disappears from the back of Sheeran's truck following a delivery.
You could say that the film's 'inciting incident' occurs when Sheeran is formally introduced to Russell Bufalino. It's under Bufalino's direction that Sheeran gets further immersed in crime to the point where he begins murdering people.
Unlike DeNiro, who not only does not look Irish but basically recapitulates his usual gangster performance, Pesci steals the show as Sheeran's low-key protector, who appears quite menacing despite his demeanor as an insincere mediator.
The break into the second act is when Sheeran begins working for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) as his assistant. The first half of act two proves to be the weakest part of the film since the focus is lost on Sheeran as our protagonist, with Hoffa suddenly emerging as the key player. Pacino's acting, like DeNiro, is already too familiar, to convince us that we're watching Jimmy Hoffa.
Instead of dramatizing the conflicts between the characters, Scorsese resorts to his old bag of tricks, using narration to move the plot along. What it all amounts to is a history lesson about Bobby Kennedy's vendetta (as attorney general) against Hoffa, which only ended after JFK's assassination.
Things pick up again at the midpoint when the focus is back on Sheeran who ends up killing Joey Gallo in Little Italy. While this scene effectively recreates the Gallo 'hit'-necessary to emphasize the escalating nature of Sheeran's growing involvement as a mobster--Scorsese also appears to revel in the violence which he appears to condemn (why is the 1971 murder of Joseph Columbo filmed in slow motion?).
There is a good scene in prison involving Anthony 'Pro' Provenzano (Stephen Graham), a union boss, who has bad blood with Hoffa over being denied his pension (Hoffa explains he gets his due to the more violent nature of Pro's criminal conviction).
Eventually a group of mobsters conclude that Hoffa, once released from prison (and now trying to get his old job back as union boss), has been manipulating pension funds and cutting them out of profits in their respective rackets. Bufalino in one of the best scenes asks Sheeran to 'talk some sense' into Hoffa, but the hothead ex-union boss 'won't listen to reason.'
This takes place at a testimonial dinner for Sheeran where Hoffa is the keynote speaker. With more judicious editing, Scorsese could have gotten right to the point in the dramatic scene where Sheeran attempts to 'read the riot act' to Hoffa. But the dinner scene just goes on for too long which is the case for many of the scenes here in this movie.
The same slow pacing applies to the scene leading up to Hoffa's murder. Often Scorsese resorts to seemingly improvised dialogue, again highlighting his 'banality of evil' theme. Particularly ineffective is all the patter about the smelly 'fish' in the car right before Hoffa is driven to the death house. The comic relief might have worked in 'Good Fellas,' but now it all seems shop worn.
Scorsese does a good job recapitulating the various fates of his mobsters. Sheeran, in his final days, comes off as an empty vessel, particularly in highlighting the estrangement of his daughter Peggy (she blames him for Hoffa's murder, a man she was close to during her childhood).
Probably Scorsese's best point about Sheeran is that he's unable to acknowledge his own involvement in immoral acts-instead he rationalizes his behavior to another daughter-by claiming he was simply trying to 'protect' his family.
The Irishman could have been much better had Scorsese used more judicious editing but even so, his tale of gangsters' banality of evil also seems to have been told one too many times before.",6,1,3,3 January 2020
127 Hours," Carbon copy of real event still ends as a riveting tale of survival
","I wanted to see '127 Hours' because I kept wondering how anyone can make a film about a guy who gets his arm stuck under a boulder while hiking in the desert and then has to cut it off. Not only was I aware of the whole concept of the film and the ending but I also was wondering how do you make an interesting film about someone who is stuck in one small place for such a long period of time.To my great surprise, '127 Hours' is a riveting tale of one man's survival in the face of certain death. How does director Danny Boyle pull it off? For starters, James Franco is a brilliant casting choice to play Aron Ralston, the daredevil hiker who ends up between a 'rock and a hard place'. Franco is an immensely likable fellow who conveys Ralston's reckless and devil may care attitude that leads him to his date with destiny. When Ralston meets the two female hikers and escorts them to an underground grotto where they go swimming, Boyle uses that scene to reinforce our perception of Ralston as a daredevil, who risks his own life (as well as the lives of two strangers) as he seeks one more thrill, sliding between a crevice, and diving into the grotto, from a distance that an ordinary person would consider to be unsafe.The incredible thing about '127 Hours' (and I found this out after I watched the film) is that almost everything that we see actually happened. Ralston did have a video camera and filmed himself while his arm was stuck under the rock. And the video camera that was used in the film, was also the actual camera Ralston used when he was trapped! Boyle builds the tension simply by documenting everything that happened. At first Ralston believes he can move the rock through sheer strength. When that fails, he tries to be more calculating by using a pocket knife to chip away at the rock but soon discovers that plan is completely ineffectual (adding to the tension is the scene where Ralston drops the knife and must retrieve it by attaching a bent wire and guiding it down to where the knife has fallen, by placing the wire between his toes).Calling upon his survival skills, Ralston then designs an elaborate pulley system, hoping he'll be able to lift the rock, by using the weight of his body to move it. Finally, when that fails, he must concentrate on conserving the little water he has left, and figure out some other plan to extricate himself from his dire predicament. Boyle switches things up by introducing scenes in which Ralston begins hallucinating. In one such harrowing scene, after a cloud burst above in the desert, water cascades down into the crevice where Ralston is trapped, and he sees himself drowning. In another hallucinatory scene, Boyle introduces some comic relief by having Ralston imagine himself as a game show contestant, mocked by canned laughter due to his short-sightedness in failing to tell anyone where he was going.As to the amputation itself, I was relieved it wasn't as gruesome as I had anticipated. Actually, it was more fascinating than terrifying. In an earlier scene, Ralston discovers that he is unable to sever his arm using his small dull knife. Later, however, he figures out that he must break his arm in two places and then use the plier part of his knife kit to literally grind and twist until he cuts off his arm.As a result of this life changing event, Ralston has the epiphany that he had taken his family and friends for granted. Visions of the family and friends appear during the denouement and at the very end, Ralston himself, swimming in a pool, without his prosthesis, This of course suggests that the amputation has not squelched Ralston's love of the outdoors and taste for adventure. But one thing is for sure: when he takes a trip, he'll never again fail to tell those he is close to, where he is going.The cinematography and the editing is superb here in both the expansive exterior shots and in the claustrophobic area where Franco maneuvers. True, '127 Hours' is basically a carbon copy of a true event, but Director Danny Boyle manages to take a story where we already know the ending and still made it gripping and compelling. That, of course, is no easy feat!",8,1,5,22 February 2011
"I Love You, Man"," Quirky 'bromance' vacillates between moments of mirth and outright crudity
","'I love you, man' reminds me of Seinfeld: it's much more farce than comedy. Like Seinfeld, the protagonists are likable but offbeat and quirky and the antagonists who oppose them are far more neurotic (proverbial 'damaged goods') than the protagonists. It should be noted that one of the co-writers is Larry Levin, who wrote for 'Seinfeld' back in the 90s.Peter Klaven (played by the amiable Paul Rudd) is a real estate broker in Southern California who's about to get married to Zooey (Rashida Jones). Peter feels embarrassed by the fact that he has no close male friends and is determined to find a best man for his wedding. It's made clear at a family gathering that Peter always felt more comfortable around women in contrast to gay brother Robbie who of course has no trouble meeting men and his father Oswald, who boasts about having a lifetime male best friend.Peter then goes out on a series of unsuccessful 'man-dates' where he meets one loser after another. One of those dates is Robbie's crazy personal trainer colleague who has a funny bit 'losing it' at an LA Galaxy soccer game. There's also another weird guy Peter's mother fixes him up with; it turns out he's gay and ends up kissing Peter outside the restaurant they went to for dinner. This character pops up later and he's amusing as a frustrated stalker.Less successful is the gruff Barry, husband of Zooey's good friend, Denise. Peter is reluctantly invited over for some male bonding at a poker game and ends up throwing up all over Barry after a night of drinking. I didn't really see the humor in the Barry character, as he is supposed to be some humorless macho guy who is continually reminding Peter that he doesn't fit into the world of male camaraderie. Finally there's Tevin, Peter's fellow real estate associate, who obnoxiously keeps asking Peter whether he'll consider going partners on selling an expensive house which Peter has been rep-ping for real-life actor Lou Ferrigno (TV's 'Hulk'). Tevin is not a very funny or endearing character especially when he suggests that Peter promote himself by putting his image on urinal cakes in well-known, local restaurants.It takes about 25 minutes into the film when Peter finally meets his 'bro', Sydney Fife, at an open house which Peter has organized in an attempt to sell Lou Ferrigno's house. Sydney reveals to Peter that the only reason he shows up at these open houses is for the food and to possibly pick up available divorcées. Peter is drawn to the aggressive, single Sydney after he proves to be quite intuitive in discerning the true motives of some of Peter's prospective buyers. In a bizarre bit, Sydney observes how one prospective client sends his date to look at another room in the house as he doesn't want her around when he farts. Even when we learn that Sydney refuses to clean up after his dog defecates on a Venice boardwalk, Peter is more fascinated than repulsed by the extremely eccentric Sydney. Sydney's belief that dog doody is good for the environment is a turn-off but it IS funny when he morphs into a lunatic and begins screaming at the guy who tries to call him on his refusal to clean up, after his dog relieves himself.Peter proves to be just as quirky as Sydney but in a much more good-natured way. One of Peter's perennial tics is his blurting out of things he doesn't mean to say as well as assigning nicknames to Sydney which make no sense. For awhile, Sydney's single life proves attractive to Peter. They bond at Sydney's cluttered bachelor pad even though Sydney reveals he has a small 'station' in his house reserved for masturbation. Peter also has no objection to Sydney's firm conviction that no discussions about their sex lives are off-limits. The only 'normal' thing that the odd couple seem to share is a love for the rock band 'Rush'. After revealing that he used to play bass in high school, Peter accompanies Sydney (who plays guitar), as they jam to Rush songs at the bachelor pad.Eventually, Sydney's confrontational style gets Peter into hot water at his engagement party. Cryptically, Sydney reveals that Peter is somewhat unhappy with Zooey as she doesn't appear to enjoy oral sex. Peter escapes Zooey's condemnation during the car ride home, when he calls her on her earlier revelations of their sex life to her friends.Peter and Sydney's relationship reaches its apotheosis when Peter lends his buddy $8,000. But he also plants doubts in Peter's mind as to why he's involved with Zooey at all. When Peter foolishly expresses the same doubts to Zooey directly, she leaves him to stay with her girlfriends. Peter has had enough, dumps Sydney and makes up with Zooey. Meanwhile, Sydney uses the $8,000 to buy billboard space, promoting Peter as a hot shot realtor. All's well that end's well when Sydney's efforts lead to a great amount of new business for Peter while Zooey ends up calling Sydney at the last minute to attend their wedding as Peter's best man.'I love you, man' loses its comic edge when Peter and Sydney get real serious and break up. The sentimental ending could have been much improved, had the film's scenarists decided to have Peter's life unravel more intensely than merely depicting the short breakup between him and Zooey. One alternative could have been to have Peter lose his job and then being saved after Sydney's billboard plan is brought to fruition.In the end, I wondered why some of the film's foul language couldn't have been toned down a bit. What's more, jokes such as likening Anwar Sadat to a dog can be interpreted as a true insult in the Muslim World. While not a laugh out loud farce, 'Man' has its moments of mirth.",6,1,2,19 December 2010
Creed," Worthy later sequel in Rocky franchise despite unlikable protagonist
","In my review of Ryan Coogler's well-received 'Fruitvale Station,' I concluded with the following suggestion for the fledgling filmmaker: 'The neophyte director has bit off more than he can chew, attempting to dissect a topic infused with racial animus. Next time he would be much better served churning out a less controversial, commercial product.' And somehow Mr. Coogler did just that by collaborating with sound designer and fellow screenwriter, Aaron Covington, crafting Creed, a mainstream tribute to and seventh installment in the Sly Stallone Rocky Balboa franchise.Ironically, the weakest part of Creed is its main character, Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa's opponent in the first episode. As Coogler and Covington fashion it, Apollo dies before Adonis is born—the young boy passes through the foster care system until he's rescued by Apollo's widow (played by a rather stiff Phyilicia Rashad) who decides to adopt him. Despite being raised in the lap of luxury, Adonis quits his job in finance, and runs off to Mexico where he wins a series of club fights against lesser opponents. Unlike Rocky who must pull himself up by his own bootstraps, Adonis never has to really about financial security. It's not clear whether Adonis still has gobs of money in his checking account when he decides to move to a not so well off neighborhood in Philadelphia but for some reason it's all about proving to himself that he can live up to the family legacy. Nonetheless, Adonis' lack of a rags to riches story turns out to be a non-fatal impediment to caring for the character. Our interest in Adonis however, is seriously undermined by his one-dimensional character flaw: self-hatred. The film's opening scenes establishes that when we see how Adonis the youth has a serious anger management problem. As an adult, we must endure Adonis' continuing chip-on-my-shoulder routine. Can we really care for such a cliché of a character despite his eventual reformation at the hands of a good woman and success in the ring? I think not. Don't blame leading man Michael B. Jordan for injecting little pizazz into the film's protagonist. It's strictly a failure on the part of the films' scenarists who are unable to transfer the charms of a Rocky Balboa to their modern-day counterpart.Despite dropping the ball somewhat in the screen writing department, Coogler still proves himself to be a talented director. Fans of the previous Rocky installments will love how he directs Sylvester Stallone, who plays Rocky, as the retired boxer who agrees to manage Adonis, first out of obligation to Apollo, but later out of respect for the talents of the up-and-coming son. The only sour note is when Rocky finds out he has cancer and agrees to chemotherapy despite all the bad memories of what happened to his beloved Adrian (doctors and their deadly chemotherapy remain sacred cows in Coogler's Weltanschauung).Coogler shines best in the technical aspects of filmmaking. The fight scenes in Creed are expertly choreographed and real-life boxer Tony Bellew steals the show as the malevolent Liverpudlian prizefighter Ricky Conlan, who fights Adonis to a split-decision win in the climactic scene.Tessa Thompson, who was so dynamic in Dear White People, has a lot less to do here as Adonis' love interest, Bianca, playing a singer/songwriter who is slowly losing her hearing. The dark moment of Act 2 involves more of Adonis' ubiquitous anger management problem--he gets into a fight with a musician who has top billing at the club where Bianca is making her debut. Of course all's well that ends well when the cooing couple make up and Adonis goes on to acquit himself nicely in the ring. With Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler created a 'calling card' for bigger and better things. Now with Creed, he has proved himself as a 'mainstream' director and is sure to get more work in Hollywood. I am impressed by Mr. Coogler's technical talents; as a writer he should avoid the tendency toward melodrama and embrace an all-encompassing verisimilitude.",6,1,5,25 December 2015
The Hustler," Overrated pool hall drama has seen better days
","'The Hustler' is one of those films that shows its age. What seemed so dramatic back then, is really old hat now. Isn't Paul Newman's character 'Fast Eddie' rather obvious and one dimensional? We find out so little about him except for the fact that he's obsessed with making money and being 'top dog' in the seedy world he inhabits. This goes on ad infinitum. And of course, Sarah Packard, the wounded but insightful woman who attempts to steer Eddie away from his pointless existence, fails to make an impression on him until it's too late.I don't like films about 'sad sacks'. I've made this point in countless number of my reviews. It's as though the screenwriter is crying out for recognition: 'you see, I'm really a genius for recognizing just how down and out my characters are.' We're all supposed to experience some kind of catharsis when there's a moment of insight. But the problem is that there's so little to the characters to begin with. Yes we 'get it' that Fast Eddie is a loser and that when he beats Minnesota Fats at the end, it's a pyrrhic victory since Sarah is now dead (by her own hands) and Bert points out that Eddie won't be playing in anymore high stakes pool games ever again. When a character's transformation is so predictable, as it is here with Eddie's 'punishment' for his lack of empathy and general cluelessness, why heap accolade upon accolade on a screenplay that doesn't deserve it? Further evidence of the screenwriters' ineptitude is the treatment of the antagonist, Bert, played by George C. Scott. Is there a more unlikeable antagonist than this? There's really nothing good about him from the '75% stake' to his wretched treatment of poor Sarah. The word 'villain' is rubber stamped over his face from the beginning and it shows a complete misunderstanding of what psychopaths are like in the real world. In short, they're charming and likable—the exact opposite the way Bert is depicted here. To their credit, Robert Rossen (who wrote the novel the film is based on) and the adapter, Sidney Carroll, manage to have the bad guys win out in the end, but their antagonist is so devoid of charm, that we can hardly believe any of it. Pull out your Sopranos DVDs if you want some verisimilitude.Plot-wise, 'The Hustler' is a slow-moving affair. There's the long drawn-out pool hall 'battle' between Newman and Jackie Gleason, who has little to do except hit a few balls around on a pool table. Then there's a lot of cuddling between Newman and Piper Laurie as Sarah followed by the big 'action' scene, where Eddie gets his thumbs broken by the local riff-raff. Newman ends up winning against a high-society billiards player and he's back playing against Minnesota Fats. Oh yes, I forgot about the suicide scene where Sarah can't take it anymore.'The Hustler', shot in black and white, has some decent cinematography and acting, despite the hokey script. As a piece of film history, it's worth seeing once but please don't try and convince me this is some kind of masterpiece. I can assure you that Roger Ebert's pronouncement that this film will grow in your 'memories' is just another example of how wrong he often is in his evaluation of the top films that are out there.",4,9,21,15 July 2012
Spotlight," Despite being overloaded with expository dialogue, deft director manages exposé of church corruption with aplomb
","Tom McCarthy, an actor who's scrounged around for roles in both movies and TV for a good number of years, appears to have found his mettle as a director. Known principally for a couple of mediocre efforts ('The Visitor' and 'Win, Win'), he now has taken on more heady material in Spotlight, which chronicles the 2001 Boston Globe investigation into pedophile priests and subsequent cover-up by the Archdiocese of Boston.Spotolight begins with the arrival of a new editor at the Globe, Marty Baron, played by a rather taciturn Lev Schreiber. Baron is Jewish and finds himself a bit of an outsider in the majority Catholic city. Nonetheless he is determined that the Globe's crackerjack 'Spotlight' squad of reporters dig deeper into this potential blockbuster crime story. The two standouts amongst the reporters who investigate the minions and higher-ups within the Boston archdiocese are Michael Keaton as editor Walter 'Robby' Robinson and reporter Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo). Keaton, proves after his pretentious role in the unfortunately acclaimed 'Birdman,' that he can still really act. And Rufallo is nicely quirky as the ace reporter who uncovers the critical documents that prove that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou of Blue Bloods fame) shielded pedophile priests on his watch.Keaton and Ruffalo appear to have the best roles in this ensemble cast, as they play off two other characters throughout most of the narrative. Keaton's Robinson faces off against an old friend, Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan), an attorney who represents the Church, who seeks to stymie his inquiries at every turn. And Rufallo's Rezendes is constantly trying to pry information out of attorney Mitchell Garabedian (played by a most believable Stanley Tucci) who seeks the protect his clients, victims of sexual abuse by parish priests.The other members of the Spotlight team don't have as much to do: Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll has his most memorable moment when he discovers the Catholic Church's annual reports that list all the priests who have been given special leave, suggesting that most of them have been involved in the sexual abuse scandal. Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer has a non-descript part tracking down victims of abuse as well as briefly discovering one pedophile priest who is willing to admit to nefarious acts. There's also John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr., the section chief, who appears reluctant at first to delve deep into the church's conduct but eventually comes on board as his crew makes headway into their investigation.The actors in lesser roles in the film do quite well. A particular standout is Neal Huff as Phil Saviano, the head of a church victims sex abuse organization as well as Billy Crudup who plays Eric Macleish, an attorney who brokered deals with the Church to hush up victims' complaints. Macleish has the shocking last word after being accused of orchestrating the cover-up by claiming he had sent names of victims to the Globe years earlier and nothing was done. Robinson confirms this at the end in a mea culpa, admitting he was the reporter who sat on the story.Spotlight in many ways is all narrative and there is little focus on developing the internal arcs of the principal characters. It's also overloaded with expository dialogue—at one point director McCarthy holds the camera static as one of the reporters collects information from an expert on pedophile priests who lives in another city and is someone we never get to see on screen. With all that dialogue, Spotlight might have been better on television. Nonetheless, Tom McCarthy has taken a great leap forward as a director, putting together a story that doesn't lend itself to great visuals but remains fascinating in the vein of any well done police procedural.",7,2,6,15 December 2015
Terminator Salvation," Decently paced but pedestrian sequel to Schwarznegger's more engaging Terminator roles
","I've tried to come up with a reason why so many internet posters are virulently against this film. The best I can come up with is that they're comparing it to the earlier Terminator films starring Arnold Schwarznegger (who they loved) and were simply turned off by the lack of a central antagonist. In some ways, they're right--'Salvation' lacks that one fascinating villain so prominent in the early Terminator sagas. But to claim that this is the 'worst movie' they've ever seen, is way off the mark.Salvation picks up the story of the fight between the Resistance and Skynet in the year 2018. 'Judgment Day' is long past but it'll be about ten more years before the final victory over Skynet is accomplished. Somehow in this new Terminator, the Resistance has a lot more hardware to work with (helicopters, rocket launchers, etc.) and the chain of command is delineated in much greater detail. Who knew that John Connor actually had a commanding officer? Probably the best sequence director McG came up with in 'Salvation', is the Giant Terminator attacking the gas station. It's a non-stop, pulsating spectacle which also features a great car chase; watch the Giant Terminator belch out two 'motorcycle terminators' who attempt to chase down the neat little trio of Kyle Reese, the child mute, Star, and part-cyborg Marcus Wright. Wright escapes, but Reese and the kid get chucked into a dumpster, consisting of hostages taken by Skynet. Scenes of a post-apocalyptic holocaust are evoked as the prisoners are packed in like sardines in Skynet's holding pens.Without the interesting part-man, part-machine character, Marcus Wright, 'Salvation' would be stuck with the interminably boring Christian Bale playing John Connor as a sole protagonist. Bale's performance is akin to Russell Crowe in 'Robin Hood'. Both display no wit or humor and play each part as hard-assed macho men. Boring, boring, boring! After the car chase, the Resistance somehow learns of some kind of electronic signal which might have the potential to destroy their mechanized enemy. Why it never occurs to anyone that this might be a trick on Skynet's part is one of the weaknesses in the Salvation plot. After all, an all-in-one, immediate solution to the Skynet juggernaut comes a little too easy to the commanders of the Resistance. No one seems to suggest that this might be a Trojan Horse type of situation.We now arrive at Salvation's second main sequence: the capture of Marcus Wright. I can understand the Resistance being awfully paranoid and the fact that Wright himself is unable to recall the circumstances of his early life, but wasn't it obvious that Wright was markedly different than the Terminators who they were familiar with? The real terminators never had a 'conversation' with anyone in the Resistance and were programmed to kill; on the other hand, this Marcus character is being quite sociable with his captors. Even if you buy all the paranoia and the need for the soldiers in the Resistance to cut Wright no slack, certainly Wright's escape and manhunt could have been cut down in the editing room to a more manageable size. The silly chase seems just like filler to me.Finally, Salvation ends with a whimper. With Connor's blessing, Marcus somehow gets past all of Skynet's security grids and ends up in the main console room. There, a computerized image of the female doctor who stitched him together before 'Judgement Day', reads him the riot act: Marcus actually had a computer chip in his brain that was placed there by Skynet. Marcus was used by Skynet in order to lure John Connor to Skynet's headquarters. Connor came to save his father, Kyle Reese, who Skynet had earlier snatched following the fight at the gas station. Bingo! Marcus simply doesn't want to be part of Skynet's game so he pulls out the computer chip from the back of his head. Whoopee doo! Contrast that with the machinations of the Star Trek Next Generation Crew when they have to figure out how to save Captain Picard from the Borg. Hey, it wasn't so easy to extricate Picard from the collective consciousness of the Borg until Data brilliantly figures out that the command to sleep will do the trick. Nothing like that here! Marcus simply tugs on the strap on the back of his head, and he's free from the diabolical Skynet!Connor's liberation from the bowels of Skynet also wasn't much of a big deal. The Schwarznegger-like clone is a bit of a surprise, but all he ends up doing is tossing Connor around like a rag doll, instead of crushing him like an ant. And what happened to all the terminators inside headquarters? They've got one machine operational, and it's already 2018! As to Salvation's ending—many purists were appalled that the noble Connor had to be saved by the second light half-Cyborg Marcus Wright via a heart transplant. Given Christian Bale's non-performance, any organ donations from outside the cold-hearted Thespian, can only improve John Connor next time around.Salvation is certainly a flawed movie. As pointed out before, it lacks a central antagonist and relies on a series of fight scenes with an assortment of killing machines to entertain. It's a hit or miss affair with some battles with the machines more gripping than others. Although Salvation suffers from a lack of originality, the cinematography and editing are well done and the story moves along at a brisk enough pace to keep one's interest. Repeated viewings however, are not really recommended.",6,1,2,5 January 2011
500 Days of Summer," Mediocre Romantic Comedy cannot be saved by quirky fantasy sequences
","500 Days of Summer attempts to dissect the rise and fall of a relationship between two young people who work together at a greeting card company. For most of the film, we're constantly shifting around at different points in time in the couples' relationship (the number of days that have passed in the relationship constantly appear to remind the viewer at which point in time we're looking at).The protagonist is Tom Hansen, played by the likable and handsome Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He meets Summer Finn (the quintessential Indie actor, Zooey Deschanel), a mercurial waif of sorts, who only wants to have a 'casual' relationship. Not only does Tom put Summer on a pedestal but the screenwriters do as well—we find out next to nothing about her except for the fact that she believes that Ringo was the greatest Beatle and she's willing to pattern some of her behavior in the bedroom based on a porno tape the couple has rented.In short, Tom is guilty of puppy dog love—and it's the examination of his obsession that we're forced to watch for about an hour and a half. One wonders what Tom sees in Summer but that doesn't really concern the film's scenarists. We're treated to a series of gimmicky 'fantasy' sequences that chronicle Tom's mood changes as his relationship with Summer begins to deteriorate.In the beginning, after he makes love to Summer for the first time, he's out on the streets, leading a huge crowd of people in song and dance, accompanied by a marching band. Then there are nods to the great film directors such as Fellini (Summer and Tom are now characters in their own version of 'La Dolce Vita') and Bergman (Tom becomes the brooding Knight in a takeoff on the famous playing chess with Death scene). As things get bad, a split screen displays Tom's expectations and 'reality', when the feuding lovebirds attend a party together. Finally, at his darkest moment, Tom morphs into a fading pencil drawn figure against an animated background.'Summer' aims at some comic relief as the Greeting Card company that Tom and Summer work at are populated with quirky characters who always are trying to come up with new pithy sayings for the wacky greeting cards they're attempting to compose. Also in the mix are Tom's two best friends who appear to have less than stellar love lives. Perhaps the least humorous of the comic relief is Tom's younger sister, who occasionally pops up and offers obnoxious advice about dating etiquette.Tom eventually overcomes his depression over losing Summer by quitting his job at the greeting card company and going on job interviews at architectural firms, where he seeks to pursue his life-long job working at a 'legitimate' job as an architect. As for Summer, Tom is confused by her sudden decision not to pursue 'casual' relationships anymore, and get married.'500 Days' has a very nice look to it and its witty pop culture reference will keep your interest. But in the end, it has little to offer in terms of appealing to the intellect. Do we really care about Summer, a cipher of a character who's put on a pedestal ? And what's so captivating about Tom's obsession and decline into depression? If you're looking for escapist entertainment to pass some time, '500 Days' fits the bill. But ultimately, I doubt that this film will be remembered in the coming years as a romantic comedy classic, or even remembered at all.",5,3,5,5 February 2010
Juno," For lovers of Oprah
","Those who love Oprah will probably love this movie along with aficionados of daytime soap operas. The strategy of such movies is to give the characters a few quirks but make sure they all have hearts of gold. Juno is full of witty quips (improbable for most 16 year olds) and her boyfriend Bleeker loves tic-tacs (that's about all we found out about him throughout the entire movie). Juno's parents blandly accept her pregnancy and they have nothing much to do except wheel her into the maternity ward when she's about to give birth (funny how the father disappears for most of the movie--he's nothing more than a kind-hearted cheerleader for his daughter when we do get to see him). The screenwriter, Diablo Cody, takes a stab at creating an antagonist in the character of Mark Loring, who decides to divorce his wife and foil Juno's plans of having the couple adopt her baby. But even though he decides to leave, he's also still a good guy--albeit a person who simply needs to 'find himself'. Ultimately 'Juno' doesn't have enough conflict to keep one's attention for a full hour and a half. Cody falls back on predictable, saccharine moments to fill the void. Did I forget to mention Jennifer Garner? Her 'Vanessa' is probably the dullest of all the characters in the movie. Many on this board who gave the film a low rating fault it for trivializing teen pregnancy. That might be true but the worse failing is the lack of character development coupled with a predictable and sentimental denouement.",3,29,52,23 February 2008
Concussion," Lack of a central antagonist and suspense relegates tale of eccentric forensic pathologist to the realm of standard fare
","On the surface, Concussion has a promising premise: Dr. Bennett Omalu, an eccentric Nigerian forensic pathologist, takes on the orthodox medical establishment and the NFL after discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head, experienced daily by professional football players. But as the Times critic, Mahnola Dargis, adroitly points out, Concussion is basically done in by a lack of a central antagonist.In fact, what director/writer Peter Landesmann ends up doing is creating a series of antagonists (some real, some completely fictional) who collectively attempt to take Omalu down. Omalu is depicted as outside of the mainstream, talking to cadavers as he works on them and defending his practice of disposing of new surgical instruments (despite orders from his boss, chief coroner Cyril Wecht, not to do that). One of Omalu's co-workers takes exception to his unorthodox style of working and is constantly threatening him. It's a good way of suggesting that the eccentrics of society often are the subject of bullying—the only problem is that the co-worker is a completely fictional character, and Omalu was never subject to that level of persecution.Much more egregious in regards to overstepping dramatic license, is the implication that the FBI, prodded by the NFL, went after Omalu's boss, Dr. Wecht, as a warning to Omalu. While it was true at one point Dr. Wecht was arrested for corruption (the charges were later dropped), this occurred before Omalu published his findings about CTE. The arrest had nothing to do with Omalu's beef with the NFL, but Landesmann is intent on making us believe that Omalu was perennially threatened.The theme of victimization is emphasized further in Landesmann's suggestion that Omalu's wife Prema suffered a miscarriage after being followed by a mysterious car while driving home. Again, this is a complete fabrication, undoubtedly designed to suggest that Omalu's opponents were far worse than they actually were.More troubling is the widely accepted view that Dr. Omalu's findings are actually true. He based his conclusions on a small group of football players who apparently suffered brain trauma during their football careers. But Daniel Enber, writing in Slate Magazine, cites a 2012 study that 'several thousand NFL retirees, conducted by researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, found that the former football players lived significantly longer than race- and age-matched controls.' Enber went further by arguing that 'CTE is indeed a widespread epidemic among former contact-athletes butits clinical effects are pretty modest, since most men who have it are not depressed or otherwise impaired.' In the sport of boxing, it's been said Muhammed Ali actually suffered from brain trauma and not Parkinson's Disease, due to repeated blows to the head. But George Foreman, who fought during roughly the same time period, appears healthy to this day—despite also sustaining the same kind of trauma to which Ali was subjected to.It's also difficult to conclude that, for those football players who exhibit symptoms related to years of concussion, CTE is the only cause of their symptoms. Indeed, Dr. Omalu's first patient, the former star football player, Mike Webster, had a history of both steroid use as well as mental illness in his family. Webster was also hooked on painkillers due to chronic back pain. Was his suicide primarily due to CTE and not those other factors? Quite possibly, but one cannot say for sure.Dr. Omalu did indeed suffer from being ostracized, particularly by his peers. Perhaps one of the strongest scenes in the film is when one of the NFL's hand-picked physicians attempts to berate Omalu and defend the NFL's policies. This is where Will Smith does a fine job of depicting Omalu's righteous indignation against an orthodox medical establishment.In the end, Concussion lacks suspense and tension. Omalu is depicted for the most part as a saint, supported by Prema, who is nothing more than a glorified cheerleader. Ironically, it was the players themselves who finally realized they could band together and take on their NFL bosses by instituting a lawsuit. It seems now that the NFL has become much more 'sensitive' to the issue of traumatic brain injury as a result of CTE. It's also probably true this was as much about money— the players having probably made out more than 'okay' after their lawsuit was settled in a court of law.",5,4,6,24 July 2016
Don Jon," Entertaining but repetitive tale of NJ Guido transformed into a mensch through the love of a good woman
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed and starred as 'Don Jon', about a New Jersey 'Guido' who is addicted to pornography. When we first meet 'Don Jon', he's hanging out with his pals at a bar, and has no trouble picking up women. There's a good deal of banter between the guys as they rate the women they see in the bar, on a scale of 1 to 10. Jon makes it clear that porn is still superior to having sex with real, live women.Eventually, Jon hooks up with Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), who has a decided 'New Joisy' accent. She attempts to make a man of him by urging him to go to night school to get a more professional job and he indulges her tastes in romantic movies. Barbara keeps him on a leash for a while before they have sex but soon discovers his mean addiction to porn. Jon promises Barbara that he doesn't watch porn and brings her over to meet his over the top parents, who fall in love with her (the parents, are written as over-bearing Italian stereotypes). Finally, Barbara becomes aware that indeed Jon has been lying to her, after discovering that his browser history indicates that he frequents porn sites all the time. Barbara then promptly dumps Jon around the midpoint of the film.Up until this point, the problem with Gordon-Levitt's screen writing is that there's too much repetition. We're constantly bombarded with near X-rated images illustrating Jon's addiction. There's also all those repetitious scenes where Jon is constantly at his local church's confession box, reporting his sexual escapades and porn excesses, to the local priest.Finally, the story takes a more refreshing turn when Jon forms a relationship with Esther (Julianne Moore), a middle-aged widow, who lost her husband and son in a car crash a couple of years before. Esther turns Jon into a 'mensch' by impressing upon him that sex should be much more intimate, leading to a union of souls. Jon takes the bait and now 'Don Jon' has morphed into an updated 'Marty' (the 1955 drama starring Ernest Borgnine, who plays a working class stiff who grows to maturity through the love of a good woman).Would the 'Guidos' of this world, end up opening themselves up to expanding their self-consciousness? In most real-life scenarios, unlikely. But here, after being bombarded with scenes of the boorish Jon 'doing his thing', it's a refreshing twist to have this clueless Guido, suddenly transformed into a sensitive guy, who relates to women as human beings. Many critics found 'Don Jon' to be one-dimensional in many places, which it is—but it also entertains to a good degree and features a neat shift in the protagonist's internal arc.",6,1,2,10 February 2014
Midnight in Paris," Watchable, but forgettable Woody Allen time travel fluff
","There's an old Twilight Zone episode, a fantasy-drama called 'The Trouble with Templeton' which came out during the iconic show's second season. It's a similar concept to 'Midnight in Paris'. Templeton is a fading stage director who believes that his glory days were back in the 20s and gets the opportunity go back there and learn an important lesson. Unlike the Twilight Zone episode, Woody Allen's story is more of a romantic comedy. It features Owen Wilson as a hack Hollywood screenwriter who aspires for more as a high brow novelist. Wilson is the protagonist, Gil, who's vacationing in Paris with his fiancée and her parents. Wilson delivers many of Woody Allen's expressions in the same way as 'The Master' and that's probably why Woody praises him vociferously during the news conference extra in the DVD bonus section.As in many other Woody Allen films, the protagonist is friendly with another couple, with the male partner depicted as a pretentious intellectual. Woody also gets his ubiquitous digs in at right wingers, making jokes at the Tea Party's expense, through the mouth of the father-in-law to be, a corporate executive who decidedly is in the Republican camp. As usual, Woody's protagonist must move on from a failed relationship with a woman at the end; in this case, it's the fiancé, Inez, perkily played by Rachel McAdams.The central conceit of 'Midnight in Paris' is Gil's time traveling back to the 1920s in Paris. Woody doesn't come up with a very clever mode of transport: a limousine from the 20s appears out of the blue at midnight on a Parisian street and whisks our protagonist back to those heady days where he runs into the likes of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.During the news conference on the DVD, Woody makes it clear that his intent is to satirize the artistes whom Gil runs into. At first, it's rather neat to watch a perennially intoxicated Zelda Fitzgerald do her thing as well as listen to Cole Porter at the piano, but soon we realize that Woody has little to say about these iconic figures. Hemingway isn't very amusing blathering about all his macho concerns and Picasso shows up merely as a buffoon, seducing one woman after another. Adrien Brody tries his best to suck out humor from a pretentious Salvador Dali but ultimately is unable to come up with anything funny. There's a brief, slightly humorous bit where Gil suggests to the surrealist film director, Bunuel, the concept for his classic picture, 'The Exterminating Angel', with the exasperated director rejecting it since he tells Gil that it doesn't make any sense. Kathy Bates has little to do as Gertrude Stein, except offering her critique of Gil's new manuscript.A good part of 'Midnight' has to do with Gil's infatuation with Adriana, one of Picasso's cast-offs. When Gil finds Adriana's autobiography at a bookseller in the present, he learns that he gave her a pair of earrings back in the 20s. This leads to an awkward scene where he attempts to steal Inez's earrings in order to fulfill the prophetic passage in Adriana's book. Gil is interrupted by Inez and her parents, who have returned to the hotel room after the father has some kind of heart scare. Gil's machinations, attempting to prevent Inez from discovering that he stole the earrings, don't cut it since he could have avoided the whole predicament by buying earrings for Adriana at a store the next day (and that's what predictably transpires!).Gil finally learns an important life lesson that living in the past is useless when he joins Adriana in traveling back to her golden age of the 1890s. Back in the 20s, Hemingway speculates that Inez has been cheating on Gil, who confronts her when he returns to the present time.'Midnight in Paris' is watchable but I guarantee you'll forget about this film after a few days. Please note that Lea Seydoux is sensational as Gabrielle, the bookseller babe that Owen Wilson walks off into the sunset with at film's end!",4,10,18,16 January 2012
Youth," Great cinematography can't save downbeat tale of composer who has lost his mojo
","After his big success with 'The Great Beauty,' Paolo Sorrentino is back with an English language version of essentially the same story. In place of Toni Servilo as Jep Gambardella, an aging Rome journalist facing a mid-life crisis, we now have Sir Michael Caine as Fred Ballinger, a slightly older composer who also finds that he's stuck in a rut.The setting here in Youth is a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. The inciting incident resolves around an invitation from a representative of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip for Ballinger to conduct his most famous piece, 'Simple Songs,' at Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Wouldn't you guess but Fred, the curmudgeon that he is, refuses, citing a lack of interest in pursuing music as a career at this late date.There are other assorted characters at the resort including Ballinger's daughter, Lena, winningly played by Rachel Weisz. Lena works as her father's assistant but is also married to the son of Ballinger's good friend, Mick Boyle (played by an impressive Harvey Keitel), an aging filmmaker who also appears to have lost his mojo. When Lena is dumped by her husband she goes into a tailspin until she finds romance with a strange guy with a beard, a mountain climber, also at the resort.Meanwhile Fred and Mick trade stories about women they used to know, particularly one who they both had an unconsummated relationship with. Unlike Fred, who still is talented, Mick has seen his better days, deceiving himself that his latest film which he is working on with a bunch of young screenwriters, is a 'testament' of sorts.Other odd characters show up including Paul Dano as Jimmy Tree, a frustrated actor remembered only for a commercially successful but aesthetically bankrupt role as a robot, Roly Serrano as a very overweight former soccer star Maradona, Luna Mijovic as a young masseuse who imparts sage advice to Fred, and Madalina Ghenea as an enigmatic and alluring Miss Universe who catches the eyes of both Fred and Mick while bathing.Despite Keitel's efforts, he's unable to do much with the character of Mick, who turns out to be a real sad sack, particularly after his long-time leading lady Brenda Morel (sensationally performed by Jane Fonda), changes her mind about acting in his latest project and instead has agreed instead to act in a new television series. Brenda's decision results in (super spoilers ahead) Mick's suicide.Ballinger's story is equally downbeat as he continually reiterates the fact that he's no longer interested in music mainly due to his invalid wife being unable to perform the part he wrote for her. Whether it was Mick's death or a visit to his wife who we find out has dementia (or a combination thereof), Ballinger rather predictably changes his mind, and ends up accepting the Queen's invitation.Jep Gambardella's epiphany in The Great Beauty appears better thought out than Ballinger's, and the characters and situations in general are more compelling than what Sorrentino has proffered up here in Youth. Sorrentino's regular cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi, continues to impress with all kinds of sensational shots and Youth is certainly worth watching for the visuals, instead of the feeble story.One wonders if Mr. Sorrentino really has much more to say about life in general. Fred Ballinger's reclamation is hardly something to get excited about after experiencing all his downbeat ruminations throughout a narrative which was told much better in Sorrentino's earlier and much more impressive masterpiece.",5,6,11,20 December 2015
Milk," Van Sant's realistic approach eschews most biopic clichés
","Many people thought that Brokeback Mountain would be the first gay-themed film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Alas, it was not meant to be. Now Milk has taken its shot but despite it earnestness, it too has fallen short.Milk had a bit more going for it than Brokeback in terms of public acceptance. Its principal advantage was that Harvey Milk (very well-played by Sean Penn) is an extremely likable character who championed a cause that most Americans were in favor of (we find out in 'Milk' that even Ronald Reagan was opposed to the bigoted Proposition 6). Brokeback, on the other hand focused on two closeted gay characters, one who ends up consorting with male prostitutes. Despite the tragic murder of Harvey Milk, the film's theme is a positive and uplifting one; Brokeback on the other hand was more tragic and downbeat.The film's screenplay relies on actual tape recordings recorded shortly before Milk's death. Much of the story is held together by Milk's posthumous narration. Some critics objected to the use of this device but I thought it worked well along with director Van Slant's creative use of old documentary footage from that era.The film begins with Milk at age 40, just as he is about to leave for San Francisco. (Check out Wikipedia for his earlier biographybelieve it or not, he supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 elections!). While Milk's private life is examined in some detail, most of the film focuses on his political activism.Milk is most successful when it avoids (as one critic puts it) 'agenda-driven agitprop'. The best scenes are the most historical and revelatory: Milk's rejection of established gay leaders (the leading gay newspaper, The Advocate initially supports straight candidates when Milk starts running for office), the initiation of a blacklist of businesses that are hostile to gays and his ability to control angry crowds of gays during emotionally charged street demonstrations.The strongest part of the film involves Milk challenging the proponents of Proposition 6 and successfully defeating a bill that had the potential to erode constitutional freedoms (Milk has the courage to go face to face in hostile venues with John Briggs, the California State Senator, primarily responsible for championing Proposition 6). The film is less successful in the depiction of Milk's failed campaigns for political office (basically due to the lack of a primary antagonist such as an Anita Bryant/John Briggs character introduced in the film's second half).Milk's personal life revolved around three main characters: his first lover Scott Smith (a character I remember little about); Cleve Jones (a flamboyant street activist who helps Milk on his campaign and who's a prominent presence throughout the story) and Jack Lira (Milk's second lover, emotionally insecure, who commits suicide after feeling that Milk is neglecting him). Some critics questioned why Milk stuck with Lira for so long. It's explained simply during the film: Milk needed someone who wasn't involved in politics who he could relax with after a grinding day at the office.Milk is bolstered tremendously by an extremely strong performance by Josh Brolin as Dan White, Harvey Milk's assassin. Brolin looks like White and conveys the deep contempt and menace under the surface. Ironically, Milk predicts his assassination by anti-gay fanatics. But White's anger toward Milk is much more personal: he's a disgruntled, jealous colleague who not only murders Milk but shoots the straight mayor as well! Milk has a great look to it. It has a simplistic but strong message: intolerance is unacceptable. While most of the characters that revolve around Milk are not depicted as saints, they basically all have hearts of gold (that's perhaps Milk's principal weakness). Furthermore, the activists weren't as well-behaved in real-life as the film suggests (anti-Proposition 6 proponents sometimes reacted violently during street demonstrations).Now that the The Academy Awards are in, I must confess that I believed 'Milk' had a chance for best picture. But looking back, it's obvious that it's a picture that wasn't big enough in scope to take the top award. Nonetheless, Director Gus Van Sant managed to avoid turning 'Milk' into a hagiography and admirably eschewed the kind of sentimental plotting that has sunk other biopics in the past.",7,2,5,2 January 2009
The Prestige," Cloning technology comes to turn-of-the-century Victorian England
","Adapting the novel which 'The Prestige' was based on was no easy feat. The film's scenarists, brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wisely jettisoned the subplot from the novel set in the present time which chronicled the machinations of the descendants of the two principal characters. The Nolans also should be congratulated for turning the novel (which features separate diaries of the principal characters written in the first person) into a more coherent third person narrative. Some of the first person diary narration is retained in a series of voice overs but it's not overdone thus preserving the flavor of the novel.'The Prestige' concerns the running battle between the two well known stage magicians in turn of the century Victorian England, Borden and Angier. In the novel, Borden, a total stranger, initiates the conflict by attempting to expose his rival as a charlatan while Angier moonlights as a medium. In the film, Borden and Angier already know each other while working as apprentice magicians. The Nolans seek to create a stronger motivation for the conflict between the two. They introduce Angier as already being married. Borden is warned by Cutter (the engineer/impresario played by Michael Caine) not to use a certain knot because it's too dangerous when tying Angier's wife's hands during a magic trick. Borden ignores Cutter's advice and as a result of his pig-headedness, Angier's wife drowns when she is unable to untie the knot after being placed underwater in a glass booth. Visually it's a stunning scene but not all that convincing. Borden is depicted as being almost monstrous in the way he crassly ignores all safety procedures; what's more, others take no concrete action during the performance to prevent the mishap from occurring.Borden's pettiness is matched by Angier later on when he seeks to sabotage a series of Borden's stage acts. As the story develops, Angier shows up in a disguise at Borden's performances on more than one occasion. At one point he rigs a pistol causing it to misfire, which seriously injures Borden's hand. Soon afterward, Borden introduces a new stage act, 'The Transported Man', where he steps into one door and then amazingly steps out of another door on the other side of the stage almost instantaneously. We later learn that Borden's assistant is actually his twin brother and the two have been working together to fool the public into believing that 'The Transported Man' is not an illusion.Angier ends up hiring a look-a-like so he can duplicate Borden's act. For a time it works, but his double is a drunkard who ends up blackmailing him for more money. Angier wants to know the secret to Borden's act, so he enlists his assistant, Olivia, to steal Borden's diary. When he gets his hands on the diary, he realizes he is unable to decode it, so with the help of Cutter, he kidnaps Borden's assistant and holds him for ransom. In exchange for his assistant (who is actually his twin brother), Borden gives him the 'key word' to decode the diary: 'Tesla'.Tesla of course is a real character in history who was Edison's rival in the early development of electricity. Borden had met Tesla earlier and employs electrical sparks from Tesla's 'alternating current' generator in his act. Angier goes to Colorado to meet Tesla and offers to buy his generator which he believes can transport matter. As it turns out (and this undermines the film's entire plot), the machine doesn't transport people but actually clones them. Angier goes back to London and every time he uses Tesla's device, a new Angier appears. After each act, ludicrously, Angier is forced to murder each newly created double (and stores the corpses in tanks underneath the stage).The Prestige has a subplot involving Borden's wife. Sarah, who is unaware of the existence of his twin brother. She learns of Olivia but doesn't understand that its Borden's twin brother who is having the affair with her. Ultimately she commits suicide.The film's scenarists introduce a new twist in the story's climax different than the novel: Borden ends up murdering Angier by placing an open water-filled glass booth under a trapdoor during one of Angier's performances. Borden is arrested and found guilty at trial of the murder. After Borden is executed, Borden #2 shows up and murders Angier #2. We learn that the man executed was actually Borden's twin brother and the Angier who ended up drowning was actually one of Angier's clones. Borden returns to his daughter and in classic Citizen Kane 'Rosebud' style, Angier's nefarious plan is revealed to the audience. As Tesla's machine along with Angier's 'glass tanks' go up in flames beneath the stage, we can see inside one of them: it's one of the 100 Angier clones, still preserved and evidence of the failed career of a monomaniac. 'The Prestige' must get high marks for art design. The costumes and sets make you feel like you're right there in turn of the century Victorian England. Generally the actors acquit themselves well especially Michael Caine as Cutter (a very minor part in the novel). Christian Bale is convincing as Borden but Hugh Jackman's Angier is ordinary. Surprisingly, David Bowie does quite well as the enigmatic Tesla. The women are not developed at all in the novel and unfortunately nothing much is done with them here in the film.The principal characters' obsession in attempting to undermine one another takes on a one-note quality thus exposing the characters as one-dimensional. In addition, once the plot veers off into science fiction/fantasy where people are cloned in a blink of an eye, the best one can say about the film is that it would be more fitting as a third-rate Twilight Zone episode. Nonetheless, 'The Prestige' still manages to hold one's interest as it is 'different' and wins points for mood and atmosphere, providing a glimpse into the rarely looked at world of magic during the Victorian era.",5,2,8,1 August 2009
Ready Player One," Master Auteur of Special Effects and Pop Culture also reveals obsession with futuristic virtual reality world too reminiscent of today's unhealthy fixation on video games
","Steven Spielberg is fast becoming a connoisseur of the pyrrhic victory. In his previous missive, The Post, the Supreme Court rules in favor of the editor-in-chief along with the owner of the Washington Post, in their quest to have the Pentagon Papers published in spite of government opposition. Unfortunately, no one is held to account for the very crimes the Papers expose.  Similarly, here in Spielberg's latest, Ready Player One, his adolescent protagonist, Wade Watts (aka 'Parzival'), triumphs over CEO Nolan Sorrento, head of Innovative Online Industries (IOI), who's been trying to gain control of the OASIS, a virtual reality world, created by the now deceased (Steve Jobs-like) James Halliday.  Even Spielberg concedes at film's end that maybe the OASIS is not such a good thing, when he has Watts (after gaining control of the OASIS), declare that the world is off limits on Tuesdays and Thursdays (teenage addiction to video games is indeed a big, big problem in our contemporary society). There are some other problems with Ready Player One. Chief among them are the small stakes Watts and his buddies are fighting for. IOI simply wants to place ads for profit in the OASIS as opposed to blocking content which is a chief sticking point in the overall net neutrality debate.  It's a rather clever conceit that Watts and the vast majority of the denizens of a futuristic 2045 Columbus, Ohio, live in trailer homes stacked on top of one another (The 'STACKS); but the urban area (controlled by IOI) is not as clever-in fact rather derivative as one is reminded of the run-down Detroit in the original Robocop.  And IOI's power in the real world is rather sketchily defined. The 'Sixers' are debtors turned indentured servants coupled with researchers who are attempting to solve all the clues Halliday left in the OASIS to gain control of the virtual world. Sorrento and his minions will even go as far as blowing up Watts' aunt's STACKS residence (perhaps the most distasteful and out of place event in the film-designed to demonize the IOI crowd much more than they should be!).  When IOI does commit murder, where is law enforcement in all this? Presumably IOI controls them. But why is Sorrento so easily taken down by the police at film's end? Yes Wade's pal Aech sends the police the recording of Sorrento ordering the bombing; but again wouldn't the police be in Sorrento's pockets? They apparently have been looking the other way all this time in regards to the 'Sixers,' who are being used by the corporation for nefarious purposes. So if the police do have an 'independent streak,' that needs to be better defined. Spielberg of course is on more solid ground in his mastery of special effects. The plot is divided into three parts, with Watts solving each aspect of Halliday's puzzle, obtaining three special keys that lead to the acquisition of the special Easter egg and ultimately a contract that gives him control of the OASIS. In the first sequence, Watts' vehicle is blocked by King Kong who prevents all from encountering the wizard-looking Halliday who holds the first key. Watts finds an important clue in Halliday's archives, a virtual diary which Watts plays repeatedly until he uncovers the clue to finding the first key (the solution involves going 'backward,' instead of 'forward). In the second sequence, Watts becomes more involved with love interest Samantha Cook (the avatar Art3mis in the OASIS) and discovered that Halliday's main regret was that he never kissed Kira, on a movie date to a screening of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining.' Aficionados of that film will dig the references and attendant special effects but the closer parallel is to the Spielberg's executive-produced 'Back to the Future.' In addition to actually working in a DeLorean during one of the action sequences, there is the whole idea of the equation of success with heterosexuality. That of course was the theme in Back to the Future where McFly Sr. 'gets the girl.' And Watts makes certain of not making Halliday's mistake, by kissing Samantha in the end. By the way, it's the holographic projection of Kira, who hands Watts the second key. The third sequence (or Act III), gets a little convoluted especially when a series of plot twists prove rather far-fetched such as Samantha easily getting a hold of Sorrento's password into his station which allows Watts to recruit OASIS players to join in the all-out assault at the big fortress where the key to Halliday's puzzle awaits (Along with Samantha, he's aided by his online buddies, all whom just happen to live in close proximity to Watt's residence, in Columbus, Ohio).  There is a force field that must be neutralized and finally Watts is clever enough not to sign the contract (which was Halliday's big mistake, having dissolved a partnership with his long-term friend and business partner Morrow who shows up as the curator at Halliday's archives). In addition to extracting solid performances from his actors (notably Tye Sheridan as Wade and Mark Rylance as Halliday), Spielberg remains the master of special effects and also of pop culture, as the film is chock full of references to music and film from the era of the auteur's younger days (80s music is particularly prominent here). It's a wild, entertaining ride (if that's your sort of thing) but also predictably inconsequential, given the trivial obsession with the virtual world-too reminiscent of today's unhealthy fixation on video games!",6,0,3,11 May 2018
"I, Tonya"," Janney shines as 'mother from hell' but Robbie as 'trailer trash' skating champ is all wrong for the part
","I, Tonya, is director Craig Gillespie's take on the mercurial rise and fall of Tonya Harding, the figure skating champion who threw away her career through her association with an abusive ex-husband. Gillespie tells Harding's story through a series of interviews with the principals, most made up to appear how they might look in the present time, speaking directly to the camera, and insisting that their version of events is the correct one.The real star of the film is not the actress who plays Tonya (Margot Robbie) but Allison Janney, who steals the show as Tonya's mother from hell, LaVona Golden, a serial psychological abuser, who still manages to garner sympathy through her abrasively witty comments directed toward Tonya throughout her childhood and into adulthood (as well as directed toward us, the enraptured audience). One can't help sense that LaVona heaped abuse on her daughter both out of love and jealousy-love in the sense that she wanted Tonya to be more successful in life than she was (LaVona being a waitress at a greasy spoon) and jealous once Tonya had achieved the fame and recognition that eluded her mother who was nonetheless a highly intelligent woman. If it wasn't for Janney, I, Tonya, might have been a complete flop, as Robbie, the Australian actress who plays Tonya, is all wrong for the part. This is especially true when Robbie plays Tonya as a teenager-she simply looks too old to be believable. What's worse is how Robbie is unable to convey Tonya's likable qualities-that odd mixture of naivety and 'trailer trash' aggression that initially endeared the public to her. Instead, Robbie comes off as too harsh, compromising her attempts to convey Tonya's more vulnerable side. While Robbie is an accomplished skater (and this is probably the reason why she was cast), I think it was a big mistake for Gillespie to use her for that reason. Without a compelling protagonist, the necessary verisimilitude is lost.Gillespie's approach, akin to the Japanese classic, Rashomon, works best when Tonya's and husband Jeff Gillooly's differing points of view are contrasted in high relief. Gillooly denied that he ever physically assaulted Tonya but that seems highly unlikely as Tonya's description of what happened has the ring of truth. At a certain point, Tonya had enough of the abuse and decided to walk away from Gillooly-she even had to get a restraining order as he continued to stalk her (once putting a gun to her head, threatening to shoot her). But why did Tonya feel that she needed to go back to Gillooly after separating?-even though she claimed it was only a temporary arrangement. Despite being on the verge of complete success in the skating world, the old demons reared their ugly head-her crushing insecurities from her mother's put-downs and lack of a father figure-this led to her inevitable fall from grace.The bizarre plot to injure Tonya's rival, Nancy Kerrigan concocted by Gillooly's moronic pal, Sean Eckhardt, is so ludicrous that it's hard to believe that he actually thought he could pull something like this off undetected. I happen to believe both Gillooly and Harding's assertions that they were unaware that the plot was going to turn into a physical attack on Kerrigan. Gillooly insisted the initial plan was to send Kerrigan some threatening letters which might perhaps cause her to withdraw from the tournament or throw her off her game. It makes sense that Gillooly would confront Eckhardt over his lame-brain decision to have one of his confederates actually break Kerrigan's knee cap with a baton, suggesting that Gillooly had no idea what Eckhardt was ultimately up to.Much of what happens after the attack on Kerrigan, is anti-climactic. Gillespie basically presents a basic recap as to what happened as the story reaches its not so fitful conclusion. Of interest of course are the courtroom machinations, particularly Tonya's decision to take a plea bargain and accept a lifetime ban from figure skating. Benjamin Lee, writing in the Guardian, sums it up perfectly when he writes: 'The zippy fun of the first half dissipates once we reach the overly familiar scenes of the second, the focus on the harebrained criminal scheme feeling particularly sub-Coenesque. It's hardly dull but it's not quite as biting and sharply realized as it could be given the wealth of stranger-than-fiction drama surrounding Harding.'With a more convincing protagonist in the lead role, I, Tonya, might have been a tad bit more enjoyable; nonetheless, there's still Janney's performance to marvel at. And for all those who long for nostalgia, Tonya's story will bring you back to the heady days of the early 1990s, a time that feels way distant from our own.",5,49,100,17 November 2017
Molly's Game," Reasonably entertaining take on private high stakes poker world but depiction of hostess as feminist icon proves dubious
","Noted screenwriter and TV writer Aaron Sorkin is back with his take on the short career of high-stakes poker game hostess Molly Bloom, based on her book of the same name. A good part of it violates one of screenwriting's cardinal precepts: 'Show don't tell'-due to the reliance on off-screen narration. I can understand why Sorkin resorted to the voiceover however, as Molly's story doesn't always lend itself to great moments of dramatic conflict as the narrative is much more dependent on mere character description, which turns out to be (pardon the pun) one of the film's stronger suits.Molly's back story is quite interesting and Sorkin begins the film with his young protagonist on the ski slopes, competing for a place on the Olympic team. A freak encounter with a patch of shrubbery on the slope derails the fledgling athlete's career sending her off to California where her fate is eventually sealed as high stakes poker hostess.Sorkin flash forwards to the present time with Molly consulting with an attorney Charlie Jaffrey (Idris Elba) to see whether he'll take her case, after she's been arrested on federal racketeering and illegal gambling charges. Perhaps Sorkin liked the idea of writing a part for an African-American actor or wished to suggest that Molly was not only not racist but liked black people, but the real-life story has it that her attorney was actually an ordinary white guy.Most of Idris's dialogue is invented out of whole cloth and the interaction between client and attorney is the least interesting aspect of the film. Sorkin attempts to inject some drama into his Jaffrey character by having him agonize over whether he should take Molly's case (her lack of funds is the issue leading to his indecision). It's his high opinion of Molly's character (reflecting Sorkin's high opinion of his protagonist) that leads the attorney to take on her case (initially) pro bono. Later, Elba delivers an impassioned speech to the federal prosecutor arguing (rightly) that she was not directly involved with any of the gangsters who attended her poker games and was only guilty of a low level crime (taking a 'rake' from each hand dealt at the poker table). The 'meat' of the film is Molly's description of the various outlandish characters that inhabit the shady world of private high-stakes poker games. Of particular interest is Jeremy Strong as Dean Keith, a real estate agent who initially hires Molly to run the poker games, constantly berating and abusing her before she quits and begins running her own games; Michael Cera as 'Player X,' principally based on a ruthless Tobey Maguire, who eventually has her replaced, resulting in Molly moving to New York City; Brian d'Arcy James as Brad, a hedge fund manager, who bets using funds accumulated from a Ponzi scheme and Chris O'Dowd as Douglas Downey, the man who introduces Molly to the Russian mob.There is a sub-plot involving Kevin Costner as Molly's over-achieving psychology professor dad who is held up as the motivation for Molly's decision to get involved in the risky, illegal world of private high stakes poker (in addition to the father, both Molly's brothers are over-achievers, one an NFL player and the other, a physician). An unlikely scene of the father confronting the daughter takes place at film's end which serves as a confession of misguided filial concern.Despite the colorful stories, Sorkin's moral integrity remains highly questionable as he has cast Molly as some sort of feminist icon, bravely taking on men in a man's world and supposedly (albeit for a short time) ending up as a triumphant pioneer. In reality, there is nothing brave or admirable about his protagonist, as Molly (using her own free will) chose to become involved in a sleazy world of illegal operators. As the film ably illustrates, she almost lost her life at the hands of a Mafia goon, who robbed and beat in her the confines of her supposedly safe, doorman attached, high rise apartment.Following Sorkin's lead, Jessica Chastain is bent on depicting Molly not so much as a self-serving illegal businesswoman, but as that pioneer, bent on providing those sleazy (male) poker players with a dose of certified comeuppance.Ignore Sorkin's attitudinizing and you might find Molly's Game reasonably entertaining and a decent enough 'docudrama,' depicting a world of fringe players who have now come to light as a result of Ms. Bloom's perceptive observations.",6,11,23,20 January 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Adults will dig all the 3D motion capture technical wizardry but its narrative is best viewed by prepubescent boys
","'The Adventures of Tintin' has been described as a '3D motion capture computer-animated epic adventure.' Like many Spielberg productions, the story represents a hearkening back to yesteryear. It's similar to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' series, in that it involves a search for lost treasure, in the spirit of the old radio and movie serials. It also involves the struggle between a clear cut noble protagonist and calculating, villainous antagonist.I never really was able to figure out how old Tintin, the young journalist protagonist, is supposed to be. Somehow probably between 16 and possibly 22. Anyway, the plot is not overly complicated. Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn, at a flea market and it's actually one of three models, that contain a scroll. When pieced together, the three scrolls, reveal the location of sunken treasure. Tintin's model ship is stolen by Sakharine, the antagonist, who later is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham, a pirate who attempted to gain possession of the actual 17th century ship, The Unicorn; but he ends up being thwarted by the ship's captain, Sir Francis Haddock, who intentionally sank The Unicorn, in order to prevent Rackham from taking possession of the treasure on board. It turns out that Haddock's descendant, Captain Haddock, is manning an old freighter, which Sakharine takes over by inducing a mutiny amongst the ship's crew, in order to pilot it to Bagghar, a fictional port city in colonial French Morocco, where he intends to steal the third model ship, from a powerful, well-to-do sheik. Where 'Tintin' really takes off is in the deliriously choreographed 3D motion capture computer-animated sequences. There's a chase involving Silk, a pickpocket, in late 40s (?) or early 50s (?) Brussels, who has stolen Tinton's scroll from Unicorn #1. Then there's another great sequence where Tinton and a drunken Haddock escape the freighter in a lifeboat and eventually make their way to Morocco in a stolen seaplane. If that isn't enough, Sakharine steals the third scroll during an operatic concert for the Sheikh, given by a woman who reminded me of Margaret Dumont (from the Marx Brothers). Finally, there's a great chase scene, where the good guys finally apprehend Sakharine.'Tintin' falls flat in its attempt to be periodically humorous. There are two Scotland Yard detectives, Thompson and Thompson, who are too inept to be funny and then there's Captain Haddock, whose drunk act, proves ultimately tiresome. Tintin himself simply doesn't have enough idiosyncrasies to be a compelling protagonist, and comes across as a generic sleuth. What really kills 'Tintin' in terms of narrative, is the lack of a romantic interest for Tintin or at least some kind of female foil, that could spark things up. Tintin has a lot of action for prepubescent boys, but adults will probably find quite a bit of this stuff, simply juvenile. I recommend Tintin for all the technical wizardry, but the target audience is really best suited for ages eight through twelve!",5,0,0,2 September 2013
BlacKkKlansman," Cautionary tale of Black Police Officer's infiltration of the KKK proves of great interest but fictional plot strands fail to convince
","Spike Lee's latest is based on the memoir Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth, the first black police officer in the Colorado Springs police department. Setting the film in 1972, Lee employs dramatic license by embellishing, changing some of the facts and developing a plot that provides the narrative with a concrete through-line. 
On the plus side, Lee rather bravely links the ideological roots of the Klan with anti-semitism. Not only does he emphasize the constant anti-semitic language coming out of the mouths of the Klansmen but he also highlights David Duke's dangerous belief that an international Jewish conspiracy threatens the 'purity' of the White race and the United States as well. 
Lee's stance is welcome as it's a mainstream attempt to link the history of cooperation between African-Americans and the Jewish people, both historical victims of oppression. Notably there are others in the black community who disagree and blame Jews (particularly those who are well off and are in positions of power) for oppressing them.  
Lee of course still has a great deal of sympathy for more militant voices and that's why he has Stallworth speak approvingly of Kwame Ture's speech during the early part of the film (unfortunately Lee's decision to present the entire long-winded speech results in slowing the narrative down considerably-all in an attempt to prove his social cred with his more militant brothers). Still, by making the undercover officer a Jew, there is no doubt that Lee recognizes there is a bond between the two groups. 
Lee also must be commended for creating a great deal of believable dialogue coming out of the mouths of his fictional group of Klansmen. Despite their repugnant beliefs, there is something oddly humorous in the dialogue and one senses that Lee had a bit of fun creating all the racist 'talk.' The same goes for the purported true to life dialogue between Stallworth and David Duke in those phone conversations in which Stallworth gets his comeuppance over the racist KKK leader. 
Among the scenes that pretty much were true to life were as follows: 1) Stallworth infiltrated the Klan by making contact with them over the phone; 2) an Undercover officer was utilized to infiltrate the Klan; 3) Stallworth was assigned to infiltrate a black college student union while they were watching a speech by Kwame Ture (the former Stokely Carmichael); 4) Stallworth had multiple conversations with David Duke (the leader of the Klan) over the phone, tricking him into believing he was white; 5) Stallworth was assigned as David Duke's bodyguard on one occasion; (6) at a Klan social club, Klan members viewed D.W. Griffith's racist 1915 film, Birth of a Nartion; and (7) the investigation into the Klan was abruptly shut down by the Colorado Police Department. 
The actual investigation into the Klan by the Colorado Springs police department lasted a scant nine months or so and aside from the infiltration of the group by the undercover officer and Stallworth's one time experience as David Duke's bodyguard; this is a story that does not lend itself to much action or detailed plot developments. 
Thus Lee was forced to create a few events out of whole cloth to move things along. Not all of it is successful. There is a scene where Stallworth throws a rock through a Klansmen's home in order to interrupt him from giving the undercover officer a 'lie-detector test,' to prove whether he's Jewish or not (plausible? Perhaps but I'm not sure). 
The scene in which the Klansman entrusts his wife with attempting to bomb the black college student union (and later the home of the student union's leader), is awkward and doesn't feel like it could have happened at all (historically, there was some talk of the Klan bombing a gay bar but this never came to fruition).  
Worse is Lee's invented scene in which a racist member of the police department gets his comeuppance after he's recorded on tape, admitting that he harassed the black college student union leader. This scene is particularly poor because in reality, entrenched racists usually remain in their posts and receive support from a whole network of colleagues. Here, as a matter of wish fulfillment, Lee takes him down! 
The divergent scenes from the true history are basically as follows: 1) The Undercover officer was not Jewish; 2) the individual Klansmen depicted are fictional; 3) there was no bomb plot involving one of the Klansmen and his wife who were going to blow up a black college student union; 4) there was no racist fellow officer of Stallworth who gets his comeuppance in the end and 5) there was no apparent romance between Stallworth and the leader of the black student union.
There are also the usual Spike Lee 'asides,' which populate so many of his films. That is, he throws in gratuitous scenes which are not directly integrated into the plot. Here there's a clip from the 1939 Gone with the Wind as well as a make believe 1950s outtake tape of Alec Baldwin as a racist attempting to create a racist public service announcement (but looking bad in the process). 
On the other hand, Lee's final aside is a good one: clips from the incident at Charlottesville last year in which a woman is run over by a racist in a car. The images include a now much older David Duke inciting the populace down there as well as President Trump delivering his insensitive remark citing an incorrect moral equivalence between the protesters against racism and white supremacists. The moral of course is that the Klan is alive and well in the United States even today. 
Blackkklansman is a film certainly worth seeing as it tells an interesting story and serves as a cautionary tale of the incipient racism that has plagued this country since its founding. On the other hand, Lee's plotting is weak, suggesting that overall this could have been an even stronger entry in the pantheon of films that serve as a catalyst toward explaining and exposing the underbelly of fanaticism, which continues to plague this country today.",6,3,8,28 August 2018
Megamind," Blue-skinned, Oz-like Conehead is a non-stop charmer despite presence of mean-spirited Titan antagonist
","Despite its rather conventional ending, 'Megamind' proves to be a highly entertaining twist on the superhero genre. Satirizing the origin of the Superman comics stories, we're introduced to two different superheros, Megamind and Metroman, as they arrive on earth from separate dying planets, in space capsules at the same time. Metroman's flight is smooth but Megamind's is anything but—crashing into various meteors and debris like an out of control bumper car. A flashback chronicles how Metroman ends up with an all-American family but Megamind plops down in middle of the Metro City prison where he's raised by inmates to be a 'villain'. But Megamind is actually more like The Wizard of Oz than a hardened criminal—his dark side can best be described as a mischievous youthful offender, capable of rehabilitation.If Megamind's delinquent mindset is his Achilles heel, Metroman is also trapped by his celebrity status. An Adonis with a chiseled jaw, Metroman flings babies in the air with aplomb as police officer shoot their guns as part of a blind celebratory approbation. Megamind and Metroman periodically battle one another for the affection of love object Roxanne (Roxie) Ritchie, a perky TV newscaster voiced by the talented Tina Fey. Roxie isn't impressed by their clumsy attempts to win her affections. She's bored after being kidnapped by Megamind and after being brought to his lair bluntly tells Megamind that your 'plan never works'. When Metroman arrives and engages Megamind in yet another physical confrontation that always ends in a stalemate, Roxie wittily queries: 'Girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?' 'Megamind' breaks into its second act when Metroman fakes his own death and the blue-skinned Conehead finds himself experiencing an 'existential crisis'. Without Metroman, Megamind laments, 'it's just too easy now'. In his 'despair', Megamind's delinquency in Metro City (or 'Metrocity' as he puts it) multiplies exponentially. Megamind steals all the artwork in the city's museums and places them inside his own office inside City Hall. He throws currency all over the streets as if it's confetti, but none of the mischief makes him happy. Finally, using an idea he misappropriates from Roxie, he decides to create his own superhero so he can once again find some meaning in his existence. NY Times critic Stephen Holden puts it most succinctly: 'The movie's central joke — that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition — is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie.'Megamind's new opponent turns out to be Roxie's cameraman, Hal, a geek who expects women to flock to him without mustering any effort to charm them. Before being injected with Megamind's new preparation that alters his DNA, Hal is a harmless nerd who reminds me of a caricature of Bill Murray's cameraman in the classic comedy, 'Groundhog Day'.There are tons of funny moments in 'Megamind'. Here a few that come to mind: when Megamind tells Roxie they're making renovations at the Metroman Museum ('we're having the walls and ceilings removed'); when Megamind throws the dynamite at his mini-bots and apologizes ('Daddy's sorry'); Minion's expression when he leaves Megamind (stifling his tears and then displaying a stiff upper lip); Titan's lame comment after Roxie rejects him ('Wow, our first fight'); the reaction of the man with the baby in the restaurant when Bernard is transformed back to Megamind (his eyes are wide open in disbelief!).Despite all the good stuff, 'Megamind' loses its way when introducing 'Titan', a character that diminishes the comic tone of the film's second half. Although Megamind was always up to mischief , he never had murderous intentions (remember how surprised he was, when he thought he had killed Metroman). Before Megamind's misguided intervention, Hal was like many other geeky guys who simply hadn't discovered the right way to charm women. Remember it was Roxanne herself who confronted Titan and reminded him that he was not such a bad guy after all, BEFORE he was transformed. This is what Roxanne says to Titan right before he ties her up on the tower: 'I want to talk to the real Hal...I want to talk to the guy who liked being a cameraman, and eating dip and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal.' In Roxanne's view, before the injection, Hal may have been 'self-absorbed' and perhaps a little 'selfish', but certainly not in her eyes, a creepy stalker. He had his 'issues' just like Megamind and Metroman, but they were all multi-dimensional characters. Only Titan is a one-note character. He has no charm and doesn't really fit in the Megamind universe due to his unpleasant attitude and non-stop nastiness. When he actually tries to kill Roxanne by lobbing the bus at her, the movie suddenly turns in a rather sour, unfunny direction. I realize that once he was injected, all of Hal's bad points were magnified to the point where he became a psychopath. But why was that? Why couldn't Hal remain the goofy nerd, even after Megamind injected him? Everything else in the movie was FUN, but once Titan turned into who he was, things weren't much fun anymore. In essence, there needed to be some kind of explanation in the script as to WHY Titan became a psychopath. Perhaps he encountered some Kryptonite type substance that made him act that way or perhaps Minion used the wrong DNA when the formula was being prepared. Some may believe on the other hand that Hal was innately bad and Titan merely represented a magnification of his evil nature. Whatever the case, the Titan character was so unlikeable that the film's denouement turned into the standard comic book 'good triumphs over evil' narrative.Why belabor Megamind's obvious shortcomings? There's enough excellent, clever stuff here to keep the critical film goer eminently satisfied. 'Megamind' is without a doubt, worth more than just one viewing. Check it out!",8,0,1,3 December 2011
Black Mass," A mobster story that flows even if you've seen something like this before
","If you've already seen 'The Departed', Martin Scorsese's Academy Award- winning film loosely based on the Whitey Bulger story or the excellent documentary by Joe Berlinger, 'Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger,' you might ask if there's room for just one more film about the notorious criminal who wreaked havoc in South Boston during the 1970s and early 1980s. The answer is that 'Black Mass,' director Scott Cooper's new entry in the Bulger pantheon, fits the bill pretty well, even if you're already familiar with most of the facts regarding the turf war between Bulger's Winter Hill gang and their notorious rivals, the Angiulo brothers.Black Mass makes its case against Whitey in the style of a police procedural. It begins with flashbacks set forth in a series of FBI interviews of two Bulger associates, right-hand man Steve Flemmi and neophyte Kevin Weeks (who unfortunately end up with light sentences due to their cooperation in bringing Bulger down). Bulger's brutality is highlighted almost immediately after he takes revenge on an associate who beat up Weeks up in a confrontation outside a local pub. Soon afterward he murders one of his own enforcers, Tommy King, who disses him while intoxicated inside a favorite watering hole. Johnny Depp finally finds his stride in a welcome bad boy role as Whitey and the script wisely highlights a confounding kind side-- Whitey stops to help carry packages for an old lady in the neighborhood, is attentive to his elderly mother and feels real despair when his young son falls into a coma. He's not all that kind to his wife however, by threatening her when she refers in a moment of grief to the dying child as 'my son,' and immediately wants to take him off life support.Bulger the sadistic psychopath is not what makes Black Mass so interesting. It's really the story of renegade FBI agent, John Connolly, winningly played by Joel Edgerton. Connolly was a childhood friend of both Whitey and brother Billy Bulger, who became president of the Massachusetts State Senate. Connolly really shouldn't have become an FBI agent in the first place given his close ties to Whitey and disposition toward the criminal life. The FBI ended up giving Connolly free reign to use Whitey as an informant who eventually convinced Whitey to provide the FBI with a wiretap location for the Angiulo brothers. Seduced by Whitey, Connolly invited him over along with his associates, much to the chagrin of his wife Marianne, who soon became decidedly distressed over her husband's most apparent change in personality.The tension in the Black Mass plot escalates when Whitey decides to murder the new executive of a Jai Alai arena in Florida who refuses to take kickback money. Whitey pays an associate, Halloran, 20K to keep silent but he ends up going to the FBI who refuse to use his testimony after he refuses a polygraph. After Whitey gets wind of this, Halloran and a friend, are murdered in broad daylight.The stakes are raised when Bulger questions Flemmi's stepdaughter prostitute girlfriend whether she revealed anything about the Winter Hill gang to the police. In a great scene, the prostitute, Deborah Hussey, seems convincingly innocent when she answers Bulger's questions about her police interrogation. But after taking her home, he strangles her in front of Flemmi, who does a good job at hiding how appalled he is at Bulger's viciousness.The denouement is set in motion when the informant McIntyre is forced to confess to the rival DEA that he was responsible for the intercepted arms shipment to the IRA, ordered by Bulger. McIntyre is then tortured and murdered by Whitey a la Hannibal Lecter. Pitbull prosecutor Wyshak, along with Connolly associate John Morris, realize that Connolly's 'tips' are a cut and paste job from past reports of low-level informants.After Morris spills all the beans to two Boston Globe reporters, the ensuing news exposé leads to the collapse of Bulger's empire and his subsequent exile. Connolly's arrest is foreshadowed by the scene in which his wife locks him out of their house (preceding this turn of events is the best scene in the film when Whitey both caresses and threatens Connolly's wife after she refuses to join him and his associates at the dinner table).Some critics complained about a failure of to show how Bulger's empire operated—they wanted more scenes involving the shakedowns, etc. Instead what was proffered was simply a short montage. It seems to me that such an abridged gambit was superior to the suggestion of added footage. All in all, Black Mass is a well-done recapitulation of the story of the twisted relationship between Whitey Bulger and John Connolly. Even if one was familiar with this story from previous attempts at chronicling it, the story as it's told—a straightforward police procedural of sorts— keeps one interested to the end. There might be little new here but Black Mass is a narrative that flows in an admirable way.",8,0,1,7 November 2015
The Town," Entertaining heist flick that wears out its welcome at the denouement
","'The Town' refers to 'Charlestown', once a predominantly Irish-Catholic section of Boston known for criminal activity. Crime apparently reached its apotheosis around 1995 in Charlestown when a series of bank robberies were committed. In more recent times, however, the area has become gentrified and probably most of its residents now would express surprise that Charlestown is currently associated with the serious type of crimes depicted in this film. Nonetheless, the filmmakers advise their audience in the trailer that 'there are over 300 bank robberies in Boston every year' and 'most of these professionals live in a 1-square-mile neighborhood called Charlestown.' According to Wikipedia, however, there were 23 reported bank robberies in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the first quarter of 2010. So much for verisimilitude!'The Town' works best when depicting the dark underside of the criminal underclass in Charlestown (albeit, a depiction that is decidedly anachronistic, as discussed above). My favorite character is 'Fergie', played by the late character actor, Pete Postlethwaite. He's a local crime boss who runs a floral shop as a front for his criminal activities. In perhaps the best scene in the film, Fergie confronts Ben Afleck's 'Doug MacRay', insisting that MacRay participate in the next bank robbery he's got planned, despite the fact that MacRay now wants out. MacRay is practically left speechless when Fergie reveals that years ago, he got MacRay's mother hooked on drugs in retaliation for his father wanting to leave Fergie's gang. The kicker is that the mother committed suicide. Fergie ups the stakes (like all good criminals) when he threatens to kill MacRay's girlfriend, Claire, the sweet bank manager turned hostage. Postlethwaite is perfect as the scraggy-faced long-time tough guy who'll stop at nothing to protect his turf.There are a few other good things about 'The Town' including the excellent performance of Jeremy Renner as 'Jem', Doug's boyhood friend, who's now Doug's right hand man. Renner is utterly believable as the hot-headed psycho who always wants to take things a step further than Doug, his level-headed comrade in crime. There are also a collection of local Boston characters in the form of armored car guards, police officers and Fenway Park workers, who all show up, adding to the foreboding atmosphere. Blake Lively also acquits herself well as the McRay's jealous ex-girlfriend who can't accept the fact that she's the odd woman out. Should I also mention the first two bank robberies are neatly shot and edited and add to the overall fast pace of the film's narrative?Unfortunately, a good deal of the rest of 'The Town' is typical Hollywood claptrap, which disqualifies it from being in the same league as that old chestnut, the gritty 1970 crime drama shot in the Boston area, 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle'. At the outset, it doesn't make a lot of sense that Jem decides to take Claire hostage as it soon becomes apparent that she lives in the neighborhood and could perhaps identify one (or all of them) as the perpetrators of the bank robbery.The hostage 'faux pas' is a necessary contrivance in order to allow Doug to hook up with Claire. Many have criticized Affleck's performance, arguing that he seems out of place as a local boy from Charlestown. Maybe so, but Affleck is really saddled by a script that calls for a character working at complete cross purposes. The screenwriters want us to believe that McCray is on one hand, a bit of a psychopath who doesn't hesitate to join his pals in committing bank robberies where people are killed (although McCray insists he never does any killing himself). But when his chivalrous heart is offended after girlfriend Claire informs him some local bully has been harassing her, he has no qualms in breaking into the apartment of the bully in question and beating this guy (along with psycho buddy Jem), to a bloody pulp. As long as he's doing it for 'a good woman', McCray's violent outbursts are 'justified'.Rebecca Hall is equally saddled by the film's unconvincing script. In one of the worst scenes in the film, when Jem intrudes on Doug and Claire's luncheon date, no bells and whistles go off in Claire's mind after she meets him. It's quite obvious that Jem is not only from 'the other side of the tracks' but is also thoroughly unsavory, and Claire ends up saying nothing to Doug afterward about him. You would think that that it might occur to good girl Claire that Doug's 'buddy' also puts her new boyfriend in a bad light too. The films' scenarists also lose points when they have Claire and the FBI agents standing at an open window where Doug can easily see that they're forcing her to entice him to her apartment. Hey, how about standing inside the living room, away from the window, where Doug can't draw any definitive conclusions as to whether the FBI is at the apartment or not.'The Town' wears out its welcome completely in the final (third) bank robbery scene. While the first bank robbery was quick and for the most part fairly believable and the second one featured some comic relief with the gang dressed in Nun masks, the third heist appears to be simply derivative. Doug and Jem simply dress up as cops and rob the payroll room at Fenway Park. There is the obligatory shootout, with Jem doing his 'suicide-by-cop' routine. Meanwhile, Special Agent Frawley, stares mindlessly, as Doug makes his getaway in a cop car, right in front of his eyes. In a nod to the 'Shawshank Redemption', all's well that ends well when Claire digs up the stolen cash in her garden and donates it for the renovation of a local kids' hockey rink.There you have it. 'The Town' manages to entertain in some respects but ultimately must resort to the tired trappings of the heist genre. It's a mixed bag that should at best, engender mixed reviews!",6,6,9,15 March 2011
Shutter Island," Thoroughly entertaining despite far-fetched role-play plot
","I have to liken 'Shutter Island' to another mystery-thriller: 'The Sixth Sense'. Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders. Before you know it, there are rumors that lobotomies are being performed at the lighthouse, on a different part of the island.I became quite confused after the hurricane when Teddy and his partner Chuck (later revealed to be psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan) are so easily able to walk into Ward C, where the most dangerous patients are housed. After all, if this was where all the really bad things were happening, wouldn't Cawley and his guards make it a point to prevent Teddy from learning Ward C's dark secrets? My best reasoning held that the marshals were able to slip into the off-limits area due to the confusion in the aftermath of the storm. But it didn't look right; the guards supposedly knew who Teddy was and they were simply letting him casually walk into the house of horrors where he does in fact learn that patients are being mistreated (i.e. lobotomized).Was this simply an example of poor screen writing or was something more sinister afoot? As it turns out, Teddy's beliefs that everyone was out to get him on Shutter Island, was simply a paranoid fantasy. In fact, Teddy's 'investigation' was simply an elaborate role-play set up by Dr. Cawley, designed to break down Teddy's defenses. The ubiquitous Rachel Solando, who supposedly murdered her three children, was one of Dr. Cawley's staff members, pretending that she was a murderer in order to help Teddy realize that it was actually he who had murdered his wife after discovering that she had murdered their three children.Because all of this calls for a great suspension of disbelief, Shutter Island ranks up there as a solid piece of film entertainment but holds it back from being considered a true 'artistic masterpiece' (as some have argued it is). There are three big problems with the film's narrative.Firstly, there's a big assumption here that such role-playing could ever lead to such a huge improvement in a paranoid schizophrenic's psyche. Cawley and Sheehan concede that the role-playing can lead to a regression (as it did with Teddy nine months earlier, as they candidly admit). They call it a new 'experimental therapy' but role-playing has been around for centuries. It looks awful nice how they get Teddy to confront his demons, but I would think that role-playing (as it's shown here) would tend to aggravate the patient, much more than it would lead to any kind of meaningful revelations.That leads to the second problem: why would the Board of Overseers countenance such a therapy? After all, those are the guys who approve the lobotomies at the slightest hint of violence amongst the mentally ill population. Back in 1954, lobotomies were actually believed to be helpful for patients. Why would such do-gooders, such as Cawley and Sheehan, be given the chance to turn Teddy around? Not only don't I believe such people would be in charge of a Federal lock-up for the criminally insane but even if they were, they would not be allowed to conduct such a role-play experiment.In reality such an experiment would place both the staff and the prison population in jeopardy. In a ridiculous scene, after Teddy bursts into the lighthouse, Cawley asks him, 'did you hurt the guard very badly?' In real life, he would never have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy. Just imagine if Teddy actually had killed the guard by slugging him over the head with the rifle? And would Dr. Cawley allow his expensive European convertible to go up in smoke just to help the most dangerous patient on Stutter Island—simply out of the goodness of his heart?. I know he's a liberal but no one's that liberal when it comes to their own property that's worth so much money.So without the role-play taking place, there's no twist ending and no accolades for Dennis Lehane, the author of the novel along with Director Martin Scorsese. Nonetheless, there's much to admire about this picture. Scorsese has a terrific way with camera angles. I love all the subtle closeups such as when the Dachau Commandant reaches for his gun, as he lays wounded in his office along with the old Victrola, with the record playing over and over. Scorsese sometimes overdoes things, especially with those scenes involving the murdered children at the end of the film (just a little too much blood for my tastes). All the performances are quite good here including Kingsley (as noted earlier) along with a very cool Max Von Sydow (who at first glance is supposed to be the bad guy but on second viewing, is quite benign).Scorsese also smartly added the ambiguous line at the end suggesting that Teddy is cured but pretends to be insane since he can no longer live with the guilt of failing to save his children at the hands of his murderous wife.This is the type of picture worth watching twice. The first time around you'll be in the dark; the second time you'll watch it for all the clues missed. But after that, there are no profound ideas here to sift through. In other words, an Ingmar Bergman film it ain't! But as a solid entertainment—it hits the mark!",6,3,7,24 June 2010
Life of Pi," 2nd Act shines; 1st & 3rd Acts not as much due to dependence on narration and alternative offscreen ending
","Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who his father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.In the end, the Life of Pi 'main course' will be remembered for Pi's 'story #1' and Ang Lee's masterful visual presentation. The rest, including the lumbering narration, simplistic spiritual stance and ambiguous alternative ending, are the leftovers.",7,8,16,27 December 2012
Interstellar," Despite great visuals, Nolan's adolescent reverie features a bloated screenplay with too much exposition and 'science-speak'
","Let's face it—when it comes to visuals, Christopher Nolan is up there with some of the best directors today (Spielberg, Cameron, etc.). But when it comes to writing, why can't Christopher and his screen writing brother, Jonathan, hire some professional writers to hash out their ideas and sculpt them into a professional screenplay? It's through their insistence on doing all the work themselves, that we end up with the bloated 'Interstellar'.It becomes apparent in the first act just how amateurish the Nolan brothers really are. They posit a future world where climate conditions have turned earth into a virtual dust bowl, on the brink of extinction. Enter Cooper, widowed former astronaut who must save earth from destruction. It's imperative that Cooper get to his space journey in Act Two as quickly as possible, so we can find out what the solution to earth's conundrum is in a reasonable amount of time. But no, the Nolan's insist on dragging things out so that Act I is all interminable exposition.We're introduced to Cooper's family who go on a long-winded drive through a corn field with a flat tire, chasing a mysterious drone. Later, Cooper's 10 year old daughter, Murphy, discovers a 'ghost' in the dust, which turns out to be a coded message from benign aliens who seek to rescue mankind from their big problem on earth (why the aliens are so helpful is never explained but it's rather convenient that stricken earth has someone in their corner!). Cooper and Murphy are led to the secret NASA installation where we're treated to tortured explanations about binary codes, a wormhole which might lead to three different planets on the other side, possibly hospitable to earth colonists, and a very Twilight Zone-like 'gravitational time dilation', where one hour on the surface of one of the planets that's too close to the wormhole, equals 7 earth years. Throughout the film, it's much more 'tell' than 'show' as the Nolan's insist on explaining all the science behind what's happening, undoubtedly provided mostly by the film's consultant, theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. I was squirming in my seat since it took so long to get to the meat and potatoes of the story: whether Cooper and his crew find out if any of the three planets prove hospitable for earth colonization. Indeed, Act 2 features what Nolan is good at: action scenes featuring some fantastic visuals. On the first planet, prepare yourself as Cooper and crew battle a giant tsunami and later on Planet 2 when Matt Damon, as Mann, a villainous astronaut, attempts to kill Cooper by smashing his visor and then hijacks a shuttle craft and unsuccessfully attempts to dock with the mother ship.Unfortunately, 'Interstellar' features a hokey climax where a now grown Murphy must figure out how NASA space ships can be launched via gravity. Initially, she's despondent when the leader of the NASA project, Brand (Michael Cane), admits that his equation to launch the space ships was bogus. But somehow (and don't ask me how), if Murphy is able to glean additional data from the black hole's 'singularity', she can solve the equation. Enter Cooper who has left (love interest) Amelia, his good-looking co-astronaut, to touch down on the third planet, while he somehow tries to figure out how to communicate with the aliens, so he can send Murphy the crucial data.Again, but don't me ask how, despite the fact that Cooper is out of fuel in his shuttle and finds himself floating in space, he ends up in an extra-dimensional spatial dimension where he's able to communicate with Murphy by sending Morse Code through a watch she had as a child. Cooper is assisted by his robot, TARS, who awkwardly resembles a triple-hinged Gumby. Man and robot successfully communicate with Murphy who is now able to save earth by completing Brand's equation.Nolan's message, however, has nothing to do with the fictional salvation of humanity. Quite the contrary, it's all about 'family'. Cooper's promise to meet up with Murphy after his journey, is fulfilled. The problem is, due to that gravitational time dilation, Murphy is an old woman, now on her deathbed. Cooper and daughter still get to bond and she smartly tells Cooper to join Amelia on the third planet, where presumably they can live happily ever after. 'Interstellar' shines only when Nolan pulls out all the stops with his fantastic visuals. Story wise, a narrative replete with benign aliens and wormholes, is straight out of the original Star Trek play-book. Nolan doesn't help things with all the science-speak, that slows the action down considerably. With judicious editing, 'Interstellar' could have been a better picture but the premise behind it all, is unfortunately that some may term, a 'reverie of adolescence'.",5,2,6,13 December 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Overrated quirk-fest from playwright turned screenwriter, seeks redemption for vigilantes
","Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year's most overrated 'black comedy,' Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who's been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn't he stick with the stage if that's his primary area of expertise?).McDonagh's strategy is to appeal to both liberals and conservatives but in the end he remains squarely in the liberal camp. He serves up absurd characters that appeal to the baser elements in our culture but infuses them with 'hearts of gold' so they appear to straddle both liberal and reactionary fences, but actually exist in none.Take for example his main character, Mildred Hayes (played by a haggard-looking, one-note Frances McDormand) who puts up the three billboards outside of town, frustrated by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his small town police department's inability to catch the man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier. The foul-mouthed Hayes functions outside the law and McDonagh throws a bone to reactionaries, asking us to approve of Hayes' desire for revenge and endorsement of vigilantism.McDonagh's other rebel is Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a racist who tries to top Hayes in her quest to be the top-rated anti-social misfit in town. First he arrests Hayes' co- worker pal Denise on trumped up marijuana possession charges and after he learns of Sheriff Willoughby's suicide following the revelation of a cancer diagnosis, he goes after Red (the man responsible for renting the billboards to Hayes) and throws him out a second floor window (instead of arresting him, the new black police chief merely fires him! What's up with that?).Just like Hayes, Dixon finds a scapegoat to assuage his guilt over Sheriff's Willoughby's death. When Hayes finds her billboards ablaze, she naturally pins the blame on Dixon and firebombs police headquarters. It's at this point that McDonagh rather simplistically attempts to redeem his protagonists. The saintly, all- knowing Willoughby, in a letter he leaves for Dixon after his death, reassures the errant former officer that he's not such a bad guy after all, provided that he gives up his bigoted ways.After Dixon survives the firebombing at the police station where he went to read Willoughby's letter, he decides to help Hayes after overhearing a potential suspect who might have killed her daughter. During a fight with the suspect in the bar, he manages to obtain the man's DNA. In an original plot twist, the DNA does not match and the potential murderer is ruled out as a suspect in Hayes' daughter's death.With Hayes apologizing to Dixon for the firebombing of the police station (she escapes being charged aided by an alibi from a dwarf who lives in town), the two vigilantes make their way to Idaho to seek revenge on the now ruled out suspect in Hayes' daughter's death, as they are convinced he's guilty of other crimes of rape, and deserves punishment.McDonagh, however, is uneasy with the idea that Hayes and Dixon would actually go through with their extra-judicial act-so he throws in a caveat. As they're talking to one another in the car, it's probably the unheard voice of the goodly Sheriff Willoughby which is still in the air. Hayes and Dixon express doubts about actually going through with the plan-the implication of course is that they will not engage in another act of violence-that they in fact have 'learned their lesson,' and now are ready to act as law-abiding citizens.It might be reassuring to a liberal audience that the bad guys suddenly become 'good'-that there is a measure of redemption for the two who have become unhinged by the deaths of people close to them. In reality, vigilantes remain vigilantes, and such reversals in outlook are highly unlikely. But even if one accepts the improbable Deus ex machina, McDonagh's willingness to excuse all the prior bad conduct, suggests a crack in the screenwriter's moral compass.Ultimately, McDonagh wants his quirk-fest both ways. He revels in the bad acts of vigilantism, appealing to the aforementioned 'baser instincts'; but offers up redemption for his bad actors, in the form of a martyred lawman, who like a saint from above, offers words of wisdom for the ages.",3,180,350,2 December 2017
Pacific Rim," Attempt to update Godzilla genre is strictly for aficionados of violent video games
","'Pacific Rim', noted director Guillermo Del Toro's attempt to update the old Japanese Godzilla monster genre, can best be described as a colossal waste of money. The setting is a decade from now. The monsters, called Kaiijus, have escaped from an inter-dimensional rift on the ocean floor and wreak havoc all over earth. In response, mankind have developed Jaegers, giant humanoid contraptions, piloted by two humans, who work in tandem via a mind meld of sorts. We're introduced to Raleigh Becket, a former Jaeger pilot who lost his brother while they were battling one of the Kaiijus a few years before. Becket is called out of retirement as the commander of the Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, believes he's the best for the job.Right off the bat, the plot makes little sense. The Jaeger program is discontinued as the giant machines are no match for the overpowering Kaiijus. Instead, the powers that be decide to construct giant walls to protect earth's population from the monsters. The only problem is that the walls are completely flimsy and collapse after the first Kaiiju attack. Why then did they believe the walls would work at all? Despite the order to discontinue the Jaeger program, Pentecost seeks to throw one last 'Hail Mary' by dropping a thermonuclear bomb into the rift, cutting off the Kaiiju's portal to earth. Instead of simply showing one big monster battle after another, most of Act II involves finding a new partner for Becket. He ends up with Mako Mori, a Japanese director of a Jaeger refurbishment project, who also happens to be Pentecost's adopted daughter. Mori wants to team up with Becket, but her over protective parent, Pentecost, is against it. Mori almost blows her chance when memories of a Kaiiju killing her parents interferes with the mind meld with Becket, causing the Jaeger they're testing, to go berserk. If this isn't enough, there's also a sub-plot concerning two scientists, one of whom, Geiszler, establishes a mental link with the Kaiiju brain. He goes to Hong Kong where he meets up with Chau, played by an over the top Ron Perlman, who is a black market dealer in Kaiiju body parts. Keiszler figures out that the good guys can only gain access to the portal if the Kaiiju recognize their own DNA.No need to rehash the rest of the plot. It's pretty obvious that the good guys manage to drop the bomb into the portal and cut off the Kaiiju access. Of course there's a whole bunch of boring Monster-Humanoid battle scenes before that, probably most enjoyed by aficionados of violent video games.Pacific Rim didn't do that well at the box office here in the US but cleaned up overseas. Casting pretty Japanese Rinko Kakuchi as the co-star was a brilliant casting move, which undoubtedly had a lot to do with the film's success in the Asian market. In the end, Pacific Rim is a pointless attempt to update the Godzilla genre. The action sequences are repetitious and the human drama is stilted and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed in the entire film is when Ron Perlman cuts himself out of the baby Kaiiju, during the post-credit sequence. That at least WAS amusing!",2,5,11,5 December 2013
American Sniper," Eastwood's portrait of famed sniper is pretty much a white wash but that does not preclude the film from being entertaining
","'American Sniper' is based on the best-selling memoir of sniper extraordinaire, Chris Kyle, aka 'The Legend,' responsible for those '160 kills' during the war in Iraq. It's basically an action film focusing on Kyle's four tours of duty in Iraq as well as the relationship he had with his wife, when he was back on the home front.Director Clint Eastwood's main dilemma is how to flesh out Kyle without turning him into a saint. The best Eastwood can come up with is to suggest that Kyle may have been a victim of PTSD (this is suggested when Kyle tells his wife he's coming home after enduring a particularly hellish encounter with a mass of armed insurgents, at the end of his fourth tour of duty). Eastwood might have felt it necessary to play down Kyle's 'gung-ho' attitude toward the war a bit as it might not sit well with those who can't imagine that some soldiers simply enjoyed being in combat (like Kyle) and weren't all victims of PTSD. But significantly Eastwood leaves in a scene toward the climax when Kyle emphatically denies that he's a PTSD victim to an Army psychiatrist, after almost losing it when a dog gets a little too frisky with one of his kids during a family barbecue. This seems much more realistic than the film's scenarist's apparently invented explanation that he finally came home due to 'stress.' Amy Nicholson, of The Village Voice, is on to something when she writes that, 'the humble Kyle on screen is Kyle with his flaws written out. We're not watching a biopic. We're watching a drama about an idealized soldier, a patriot beyond reproach, which bolsters Kyle's legend while gutting the man.' Nicholson is mainly referring to three troubling facts about Kyle that Eastwood conveniently leaves out of his hagiography. First and foremost is the troubling lawsuit that Jesse Ventura won against Kyle's estate after his death. Ventura claimed that Kyle defamed him, falsely claiming that they had engaged in a barroom brawl. There were also troubling unsubstantiated stories such as Kyle's claims that he picked off looters during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and killed two carjackers in Texas after they tried to rob him.Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune also promotes this idea that Eastwood plays down some of the more troubling aspects of Kyle's character: 'American Sniper,' from a script by Jason Hall, soft-pedals the book's version of Kyle's bar-brawling, God-fearing zealotry, making him a more humble and companionable movie hero caught in a war Eastwood has no interest in putting up for geopolitical discussion.' Xan Brooks of The Guardian, also bemoans Eastwood's simplistic analysis of the Iraqi War: 'It's just that American Sniper is so conditioned by its first-person shooter aesthetic that it never widens its focus or pans left or right. Kyle's wife is left hanging, while the war on Iraq is a just, noble cause. Meanwhile the Iraqis are reduced to a band of shadowy savages, darting like phantoms through the alleyways and led by a terrorist Satan who likes killing small boys with a drill. No doubt this sensibility reflects Kyle's experience and if so, that's fine. But I couldn't help feeling that the film rather risks letting its man off the hook. In failing to interrogate the raw matter of Kyle's book, it simply decides to print the legend instead.' The early sequences in the film prove effective as they are true to Kyle's recollections of a strict father who trained him how to shoot and emphasized the importance of finishing a fight. But it's surprising to discover that the confrontation with a cheating girlfriend never happened and Kyle's motivation for joining the SEALS had nothing to do with watching the bombing of the American Embassy in Kenya on TV (Kyle had always intended to join the military after he finished attending school).Kyle's relations with his wife Taya is pretty accurately portrayed, including their many arguments about being away from his family. In one action scene, Kyle drops his phone and Taya is horrified to hear the sounds of battle, without Kyle responding. This is an event that actually happened. Kyle's decision to finally return home after the fourth tour was much more likely related to his fears that Taya was going to divorce him than being depressed about killing the rival sniper Mustafa or being almost killed during the culminating firefight.One scene that's not mentioned in Kyle's memoir is when he and his fellow soldiers are invited to dinner by an Iraqi man and his family. During this dinner, Kyle leaves the dinner table and discovers a cache of guns under a floorboard. While it's quite an exciting scene, Kyle as an intrepid investigator, proves to be a fictional conceit! The big dramatic moment when Kyle kills rival sniper, Mustafa, is also a work of fiction. Kyle only mentions Mustafa in one paragraph in his memoir and stated that other snipers may have killed him (but this was never confirmed).'American Sniper' has some excellent combat sequences and will keep you glued to your seat while those are going on. But the scenes of domestic disharmony between Kyle and his wife prove to be somewhat repetitious and lugubrious. If you're looking for a complex portrait of an American soldier, you will not find it here. Eastwood's take is pretty much a white wash, although this does not preclude the film from being pretty entertaining.",6,1,26,7 April 2015
Lion," Incredibly moving tale of family reunion marred by less than gripping second act machinations
","Lion is based on Saroo Brierly's book 'A Long Way Home,' which chronicles his search for his biological mother from whom he was separated under strange and devastating circumstances when he was five years old. The first third of the film (the best part), details how Saroo (brilliantly played by youngster Sunny Pawa) was living in a poor village in India with his mother. Despite protests from his older brother Guddu who insisted he was too young to accompany him to steal coal for resale at the local market, Saroo accompanies him anyway. While Guddu wanders off after telling Saroo to wait for him at a nearby train station, the younger boy falls asleep and when he wakes up, Guddu is nowhere to be found.Thus begins the tragic saga of Saroo, who, looking for his brother, found himself trapped on a decommissioned train headed for the eastern part of India, thousands of miles away. He ends up in Calcutta where they only speak Bengali and is forced to fend for himself in a teeming strange city where he doesn't know his surname and is unable to pronounce the name of his hometown correctly.It's a gripping, brilliant first third of a film, chronicling how Saroo almost ends up in the hands of a child sex smuggler, braves horrendous conditions at a state orphanage and is finally adopted by loving Australian parents, who bring him back to Tasmania and raise him as their own.Flash forward to 2007 when Saroo is now a grown man and is determined to find his lost family. Unfortunately, Act 2 of this compelling story is nowhere as good as the first. The film's scenarists have trouble fleshing out the character of the adult Saroo, now played by the noted Indian actor, Dev Patel. The problem is that his one-note obsession transforms him into a one-dimensional depressive. Saroo's downbeat demeanor prevents us from embracing him as we did when he appeared as that endearing five year old.The elder Saroo's angst causes him significant alienation from his girlfriend, his brooding mother (Nicole Kidman)--who feels she's being rejected for the biological mother--and his adopted brother, who has learning disabilities and emotional problems that he is unable to overcome.Ironically it's not the melodramatic troubled family machinations that lead us back to a positive spin in Act Three, but modern day technology. Saroo solves the mystery of his lost hometown by obsessively poring over Google Maps until he hits pay dirt— there he glimpses the water tower that loomed in front of him as he sat on a bench at the train station so many years before.Act Three turns out to be quite moving as Saroo has a joyous reunion with his mother. The homecoming however proves bittersweet upon his discovery that his older brother passed away shortly after he was lost. Lion also features some additional moving closing credit clips of Saroo's adoptive parents journeying to India to meet his biological mother.Lion's mother/son reunification coupled with a brilliant first act is worth the price of admission despite some not so solid second act machinations involving that family angst.",6,6,14,11 December 2016
21 Jump Street," Few laughs in this 'Animal House meets Lethal Weapon' misfire
","Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?; not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place, without authorization.The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members, who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House', where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one, it doesn't really work in the police setting, since as stated above, improprieties are simply not tolerated.While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature, on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow, we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor', Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say, that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric', the eco-friendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer, and his supplier, Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher, whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off, an assorted bunch of nasties, consisting of bikers and gang members, led by the menacing 'Domingo', lend an air of verisimilitude, not found in the antics of the principals, Jenko and Schmidt.Occasionally, there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see, when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole, Jonah Hill and co-writer Michael Bacall's frat-boy humor, lacks subtlety and relies on low-level slapstick routines, to get by. At this point, America is so desperate for something humorous in the movies these days, that a mediocre exercise such as this, is hailed as a comic masterpiece!",4,46,79,4 April 2012
American Hustle," Critics end up getting hustled by this cinematic 'Goodfellas' wannabe
","David O. Russell, now a shining light in the American film industry, has returned after his recent success with 'Silver Linings Playbook.' His new entry for the Oscar competition is 'American Hustle,' which is loosely based on the ABSCAM scandals of the late 70s and early 80s.Russell's new picture aspires to be an updated 'Goodfellas;' except here, the protagonists are not Mafiosi but low-rent con artists. The story begins slowly as a narrator fills in the background of the story's anti-hero, Irving Rosenfeld--part legitimate owner of a couple of dry cleaning establishments out on Long Island and part unsavory loan shark and middleman for art forgers. Christian Bale as Rosenfeld does the most convincing job of the principal actors in conveying just how this petty criminal fell from grace (notably Bale gained fifty pounds for the role).Less successful is Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, Rosenfeld's con artist girlfriend who pretends to be a British aristocrat ('Lady Edith Greensley'). There's just something about Adams that prevents me (no matter how hard she tries) from believing that she can play the role of a true 'bad girl' (others, of course, are free to disagree).The break into Act Two occurs when the FBI catches Irving and Sydney perpetuating one of their loan scams and forces them to help flush out four new marks. Sydney wants to flee the country, but Irving refuses, since he's still married and has a young son. As it turns out, the film's antagonist really is Richie, played by an over-the-top Bradley Cooper--a belligerent FBI agent, who continually pressures Irving to cooperate and browbeats his own boss to accept some of his far-fetched plans.Russell has been quoted as saying that he concentrated more on the characters' stories, rather than the overall plot. Nonetheless, a good deal of the dialogue is improvised and I found many of the interpersonal scenes to be unnecessarily drawn out (Jennifer Lawrence has little to do as Rosalyn, Irving's over emotional wife, who eventually comes to accept that Irving is no longer attracted to her).Many of the principals' machinations are supposed to be comic in nature—-particularly those of Richie, who at one point slugs his boss in the face with a telephone. Ritchie reminds me of Cooper's character in 'Silver Linings.' who also can't control his temper.Unfortunately, it's really the 'Hustle' story itself that leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a story virtually devoid of any high stakes. The whole idea of course is that this is a story of low stakes-—and we're supposed to feel bemused by the characters' pettiness. But much of the pettiness simply isn't very compelling at all.We have such low moments in Act II, as Sydney convinces the FBI secretary to make the $2 million unauthorized wire transfer and then Richie's boss' boss, Amado, inexplicably green lights Richie's escapades. The bulk of the machinations involve Richie's quest to entrap Polito, the corrupt Camden, New Jersey mayor. The closest we get to high drama is when Polito brings Irving's fake sheik to a casino party, where they end up meeting a real mobster, Victor Tellegio, a former Meyer Lansky associate played by Robert DeNiro. Tellegio tries to outfox the 'sheik' by speaking Arabic, but Irving's friend turns the tables by showing that he knows Arabic too.The rest of 'American Hustle' is anti-climactic. With the Camden mayor's assistance, a number of Congressmen are taken down, after they accept bribes. The big 'twist' at the end is too little and too late. It's not necessary to reveal the ending, but suffice it to say that the FBI's plan to fry some bigger fish, goes awry.I'm not sure whether it was that I didn't really care too much about the principals and their back stories, or whether the twists and turns in the plot amounted to nothing more than 'small potatoes.' I do know that the film's Hollywood happy ending has nothing to do with what happened in real life (the wife committed suicide and the mistress divorced Mel Weinberg, Irving's real-life prototype, and no longer talks to him).If there's anything good to say about this film, it has more to do with the re-creation of the late 70s era, replete with all those golden oldies on the soundtrack. It's too bad that most of the characters here never rise above the level of caricature.The subjects of the real hustle appear to have been all those critics, who lapped up this overrated cinematic sleight of hand, in their desperate desire to discover a new Scorsese-like auteur.",4,16,30,17 January 2014
Incendies," Contrived motivations and director's political bias undermine Lebanese Civil War victim's compelling tale of survival
","Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film, but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.With such an unforgettable iconic scene, as listed above (along with a few others, such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film), why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters, Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country, along with the right wing Arab Christian party, the 'Phalangists', are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover, they refer to him as a 'refugee' not as a 'Palestinian'. Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context, Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a 'kindly' Muslim warlord ('Chamseddine') happens to tell Narwan's son, Simon, the truth during the search for the 'son' and the 'father'. And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat—one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War, but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.As to why the film should be considered contrived, it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase, making them face the truth about HER situation, instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend, the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon, dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position—why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all, the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father, basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country, asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.While a series of chilling events, clearly molded Narwan's character, there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool), but for most of the film, he is an unwelcome, one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that 'everything is okay' is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides, ending up in the Christian Arab prison, as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine, it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so, there's no 'twist ending', designed to shock.I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again, why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son, will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know, Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings, as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias. It's worth seeing but hardly deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its heralded release.",5,56,105,20 November 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," More cheap shots at the CIA
","Having just watched the Bourne Supremacy recently for a second time, I must confess that I was a bit disappointed in The Bourne Ultimatum, the third installment in the Bourne series. The Ultimatum is basically a continuation of The Supremacy. It has all the good elements of Installment #2 which include a series of memorable chase scenes. The opening chase scene where Bourne (unsuccessfully) attempts to save a British journalist from being assassinated is deftly choreographed as Bourne and his hapless charge try to escape from CIA goons and a shadowy hit-man in Waterloo station in London. The second excellent chase scene is shot in Morocco as Bourne attempts to save a CIA operative played by Julia Stiles. That scene is shot in two parts with Bourne following a CIA hit-man on a motorbike and then later on foot through the winding streets of Tangiers. The chase culminates in a violent fight to the death between Bourne and the hit-man. The final chase scene which packs punch is shot in New York City as Bourne breaks into CIA headquarters and steals incriminating documents from the safe belonging to a high level deputy chief played by David Strathairn and then eluding his pursuers by driving his car off of the roof in a parking garage (it looks like all the Bourne movies must end with the obligatory car chase).The plot in the Ultimatum is a bit clearer than in the Supremacy. It seems that Operation Treadstone has now been replaced by Operation Blackbriar, which basically represents an escalation and expansion of the malicious and illegal CIA program. This time the stakes have been raised: it's the CIA director and his chief Deputy themselves who have the primary responsibility for the program's operation in contrast to the lone traitor in the CIA's midst, Abbott, who committed suicide at the end of The Supremacy.If you feel it necessary to criticize the CIA, why not utilize a fair and balanced approach? Unfortunately, the writers of The Bourne Ultimatum stack the deck with comic book villains which suggest that the higher-ups at the CIA are all odious bad guys. Don't they do any good at all? What about the fight against international terrorism? According to the Bourne Ultimatum, the people who give the orders at the CIA have went way beyond their mandatethat the use of torture is common and is used not only on opponents but on their own agents (as evidenced by the brainwashing of David Webbnow Jason Bourne). In the comic book, black and white world of The Bourne Ultimatum, leave it to (a now redeemed) Jason Bourne along with his two leading ladies (Joan Allen and Julia Stiles) to fight the out of control CIA bad guys.Despite the specious subtext of The Ultimatum, with its juvenile view of the CIA and how it operates, The Bourne Ultimatium is still a slick and well choreographed action flick. I'm downgrading The Ultimatum to a '6' as opposed to the '7' I gave to The Supremacy. Let's hope that the producers decide to rehabilitate the image of the CIA somewhat in the fourth installment of Jason Bourne. I'm a registered Democrat but I loathe cheap shots.",6,2,4,19 January 2009
Nightcrawler," Fable of charming but sinister freelance video journalist, proves vastly entertaining
","'Nightcrawler' is an amazing directorial debut for writer/director Dan Gilroy. The film could best be described as a 'guilty pleasure,' in that the film's protagonist, Lou Bloom, is far from what you would call a sympathetic paragon of virtue. Quite the contrary, Bloom is a sleaze-bag who you will still (to a certain extent), end up rooting for.'Nightcrawler' is more of a fable than a docudrama. I say this because in reality a character such as Bloom could not succeed in the real world of television news. His beating the cops to the punch at a triple homicide crime scene seems most unlikely but even more implausible is that the TV news show would ever broadcast his footage (c'mon folks, have you EVER seen such graphic footage appear on television news?). Let's face it, the station would never subject itself to the liability of broadcasting such carnage anytime of the day, let alone the prime time evening news. Nonetheless, Mr. Gilroy is still making a great point: there's a voyeur in almost every one of us and the powers that be in the media will capitalize on this, for any kind of buck. 'Nightcrawler' succeeds as a rollicking entertainment due to its deftly plotted script. After Bloom finds his calling as a freelance video journalist specializing in accidents and crime scenes in affluent areas, we immediately see there's something a little different about this self-appointed entrepreneur: Bloom is much more aggressive than his rival Joe Loder, who has been shooting video footage for years.In each scene where Bloom plies his trade, Gilroy keeps raising the stakes. As a neophyte, Bloom gets in a little closer than Loder does while shooting footage of a carjacking victim; and later, Bloom re-arranges the position of a car crash victim, in order to get a better shot. In his personal life, Bloom raises the stakes with Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the morning news director: he'll give her exclusive footage only if she sleeps with him.Bloom has a momentary setback when Loder beats him to the scene of a small plane crash but Bloom then takes Loder out of the game by sabotaging his van (resulting in serious injuries to Loder when the van crashes). The penultimate, heart-pounding event occurs when Bloom (along with Rick Carey, the down on his luck assistant, Bloom hires) come upon a home invasion, just as the assailants are leaving the area. Bloom gets footage of the criminals and also videotapes the victims inside the house, all dead from gunshot wounds.Gilroy ups the stakes even higher when Bloom locates the criminals who were responsible for the murders during the home invasion. Instead of initially telling the police who they are, he follows them to a fast food store and then calls 911, intending to videotape the confrontation the police end up having with the bad guys at the store. When one of the bad guys escapes the shootout, Bloom and Carey follows him in a heart-pounding chase. Bloom's sleaziness is seen in high relief when he orders Rick to videotape the remaining criminal, who appears badly injured after his SUV crashes. Bloom insists the man is dead but throws caution to the wind, still ordering Rick to get in close for some good shots. Sure enough the bad guy is still alive and shoots Rick in the chest. As he lays dying, Bloom has no guilt feelings about videotaping his fallen employee, who he knows will bring in more income when he offers the footage to Romina.As it turns out, the footage that Bloom has garnered, is a big sexual turn-on for the now-impressed Romina. Bloom's desire to get ahead is in effect rewarded by society as he now purchases two new vans and hires a group of interns to assist him. While the police have no evidence to prove it, Bloom's unethical behavior is ignored by his patrons, who reward him for his brazenness.'Nightcrawler' is a most impressive debut for Mr. Gilroy, whose fairy tale/fable succeeds in its depiction of a charming rogue, who will stop at nothing, to succeed in the television news business. 'Nightcrawler' manages to not only entertain greatly but in its satirical overview, it castigates a society much more interested in rewarding those who wish to get ahead at the expense of ethical behavior.",8,0,0,15 March 2015
Oblivion," Big plot twist is not enough to save this standard Cruise sci-fi actioner from mediocrity
","In the U.S., 'Oblivion' grossed approximately $89 million. Overseas it was close to $197 million. What does this tell us? For all those non-English speaking people, the Oblivion narrative perhaps wasn't all that important—special effects and one action scene after another, were the key to the overseas success. Here perhaps word got out that this Tom Cruise vehicle was not as gripping in terms of narrative, as the Oblivion marketing people, led us to believe. There were possible reasons for this, mainly having to do with the nature of the story itself.As I found this sci-fi, action adventure film to be mediocre at best, I have no trepidations about giving away the main twist that the main plot rests its head on. So if you haven't seen the film, I strongly suggest you quit reading here and read some of the more critical reviews found at Metacritic, which don't give away the whole kit and caboodle.We're led to believe that Tom Cruises' 'Jack Harper', is a drone repairman in charge of servicing various sphere-shaped drones that emanate from a tetrahedral space station dubbed 'Tet', run by the 'good 'guys'—the surviving humans, represented by the mission commander, 'Sally', who it turns out is a computer generated entity, similar to the 'HAL' of 'A Space Odyssey'. Harper has been told that the drones service and protect fusion power generators on earth that are supposedly extracting the necessary energy for a plan to have the rest of humanity migrate to the Saturn moon, Titan. All this after an apocalypse on earth, caused by alien 'Scavengers'. Harper believes that humans defeated the 'Scavs' after they destroyed the moon, decimating earth due to the resulting gravitational shifts. Remnants of the Scavengers still remain on earth, attempting to destroy the drones which must keep the power generators operating.Before the break into the second act of the story, 'Oblivion' operates as a typical sci-fi action adventure flick. Harper's significant other, Victoria (aka Vika), has dramatically little to do, operating the computer console and assisting Harper keep track of the drones back at their house 'in the clouds'. At a certain point, Harper gets involved in a chase with the drones very reminiscent of the chase inside the death star in Star Wars. Finally, things get mildly interesting when Harper saves Julia, a human astronaut in stasis from before the apocalypse on earth. Harper has vague memories of Julia, despite having his memory 'wiped' by his overseers.When Harper discovers that he's a clone, he finally figures out that the 'Scavs' are actually the good guys as they are not aliens but humans who are battling the true aliens, represented by 'Sally' up in the 'mother ship'. So the second half has Harper joining forces with the Scavs, in their effort to destroy the aliens. It turns out that right before the alien invasion, there was a mission to Titan with the original Harper and Vika as the astronauts at the controls. Those two turn back to engage the aliens but before doing so, jettison the rest of the crew (including Julia), who turns out to be Jack's wife before the apocalypse. Harper and Vika are the prototypes used by the aliens to create the clones.'Oblivion' asks us to applaud the twists and turns in the plot, particularly the revelation that Harper is a clone and the Scavs are actually human. But it's not enough to make this compelling drama. The problem is that Cruise is not pitted against a well drawn out antagonist throughout the narrative. Before the 'big twist', Cruise as Harper battles the faceless 'Scavs', who look like rejects from the first Star Wars series. Even after it's revealed that Sally and her minions, are the true villains, Harper spends most of his time battling the antagonists' surrogates: the drones who are constantly trying to annihilate him. This is also true of the first half of Act II—it's the opposition to the drones that basically fuels most of the conflict in the script. 'Oblivion' really is reduced to a standard sci-fi actioner for most of the time.'Oblivion' also feels like an amalgam of many sci-fi predecessors. We've already alluded to 'Star Wars' but one is also reminded of 'Planet of the Apes', in its scenes of a ruined New York City after the apocalypse (here it's the shell of the Empire State Building which triggers Harper's memories of meeting Julia for the first time)—of course in 'Planet', it's the 'Statue Liberty' that gets the end of the world treatment.Both 'Oblivion' and 'I, Robot' have similar antagonists—a female voice which represents an entire computer network. Both 'Sally' and 'VIKKI', serve similar functions and both Will Smith and Tom Cruise must destroy the network in order to save the day. 'I, Robot', however, is much more compelling since Will Smith's character has a complex ally to play off of ('Sonny' the robot). Not so for Cruise, whose strongest ally is Julia (who is hardly what you would call a foil at all).'Oblivion' just rates an average 5.0 out of 10.0 in my book. It's got some nice special effects and that one big aforementioned twist. But in the end, 'Oblivion' is nothing more than a glorified 'shoot em up', with Cruise playing his usual 'good guy' part. I certainly wouldn't discourage the first time viewer from watching it but it's not something I would want to take a peek at, on a second go-round at all.",5,2,6,21 November 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Formulaic but respectable treatment of iconic pop star featuring Malek's Oscar-winning performance
","Growing up in the 60s and 70s, I was a rabid Beatles fan (and of course still am!). And there were countless other bands and solo performers that followed in their noble footsteps, and I was a big fan of them too. But one of the groups I had no interest in was Queen. There was something about their music that left me cold-maybe I just couldn't stomach the weird combination of musical theater with hard rock. And I hated bombastic (crowd singing) lyrics like 'we are the champions.' Occasionally they had a bona fide, really catchy hit like 'Killer Queen,' or 'You're My Best Friend' (despite the poorly mixed and over prominent bass part on the original recording).
So you might surmise that I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody (the film) given my history with the band. Actually, however, I found it thoroughly watchable. And yes many critics condemned it as 'formulaic,' which it was probably was. But my response to that is, 'so what?' You don't go to see a film about Freddie Mercury to study intellectual history-you basically want to find out why the band was so popular and what the nature of Mercury's charisma was.
Much of the film's success is dependent on Rami Malek's Oscar-winning performance. His is a bravura performance, mainly highlighting Mercury's talent as a performer. But he also does well in the more dramatic moments--particularly his love/hate relationship with his bandmates: guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee), Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) and bass guitarist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello).
Aside from his being gay and contracting AIDS toward the end of his life, I knew nothing about Freddie Mercury's biography and found all the information about his family background quite interesting (which included the fact he was born in Zanzibar and his family was of Indian Farsi ancestry).
The film keeps your interest through a series of escalating conflicts. In the early stage it's Mercury's rebellion against a strict and traditional father. Once Mercury joins the band, they must find a way to raise money for their first album-after selling the van the band uses to travel around for concerts, they battle a record executive over the six plus minutes length of their eventual hit, Bohemian Rhapsody (the A&R rep is actually a fictional character played by Mike Myers of all people!).
Less interesting is Mercury's relationship with a girlfriend, Mary Austin. Despite his purported devotion to her, she's merely a sounding board for Mercury's initial profession of his sexuality (he tells her he's 'bisexual,' but she insists that he's gay).
The band eventually leaves its record company EMI after they refuse to release Bohemian Rhapsody as a single. There's more conflict propping up when the bandmates resent Mercury for starting a relationship with his day-t0-day manager, Paul Prenter (who is later cast as the villain, spilling all the gossip about his relationship with Mercury, in a tell-all TV interview).
Mercury's liaison with Prenter as well his more successful relationship with Jim Hutton, is hardly fleshed out at all and one gets the feeling that there's a lot more known about his dealing with his bandmates then what went on in his private sex life.
Bohemian Rhapsody eventually wears out its welcome with some convenient fudging of historical events. The rift between Mercury and the rest of Queen supposedly occurred after the mercurial singer decided to cut a solo album. But truth be told, two of Queen's other players cut solo albums first. And Queen never broke up before the Live Aid concert.
Then there's the matter of AIDS diagnosis-in the film he's contracted AIDS right before Live Aid-but in reality, Mercury came down with AIDS a few years afterward. Thus all the angst before the concert, proves untrue (and hence manipulative).
Critics also were aghast over the bandmates getting their digs in against Mercury. There's the scene where they force Mercury to leave the room and discuss whether they wish to take him back into the group. Again: never happened. I don't begrudge the bandmates for sticking up for themselves however-indeed Mercury didn't write all of Queen's hits.
The Live Aid concert also proves a bit anti-climactic (better to watch the original on Youtube). I would have rather heard the full version of 'Killer Queen' at some point then to have to sit through all the truncated numbers of the Live Aid concert (most of which were not necessarily their biggest hits).
I was actually glad there was little emphasis on Mercury's illness and declining years. Yes it appears he indulged himself in later years with lavish parties often characterized as 'orgies.' But somehow none of that diminishes Mercury's status as a cultural icon.
While I'm still not convinced of Queen's ascendancy in the pantheon of great rock groups, Bohemian Rhapsody nonetheless made me a believer in Mercury's talent more as a performer than songwriter. Like another great 'performer,' the iconic Michael Jackson, Mercury died way too young!",6,0,2,14 March 2019
Man of Steel," Human characters get short shrift in this unimpressive effects laden superhero slug-fest
","For those who are not completely convinced that the latest Superman reboot, 'Man of Steel', is nothing more than a bloated, overwrought mess, please consult the CinemaSins series on Youtube entitled, 'Everything Wrong With Man Of Steel In 8 Minutes Or Less'. This hilarious video summarizes all the absurdities of the 'Man of Steel' narrative as promised (In 8 Minutes Or less!). Perhaps the most absurd scene highlighted is when Superman saves Lois Lane while she's falling toward earth while everything else is being sucked into a vortex in the other direction.Superman begins with an incredibly long twenty minute or so sequence chronicling the destruction of the planet Krypton which could have been done in a much more compact five minutes. When General Zod (played by Michael Shannon of Boardwalk Empire fame, sporting a bowl cut haircut) attempts to stop Superman's father Jor-EL from sending his newborn son, the future Superman, in a spaceship to earth, he fails to stop the launch after getting into an absurd fistfight with Jor-EL without the assistance of any of his minions (who could have easily accompanied him to the launch site and destroyed the launch console).If all signs pointed to the fact that Krypton was doomed, why does the council of Elders sentence Zod and his crew to the Phantom Zone? The destruction of the planet means that the device that controls the Phantom Zone will be destroyed, thus releasing Zod from his eternal prison. They would have known this. Instead, Zod and company could have been put into stasis and launched in a spaceship, where it would have been much more likely they would have never been found in the vastness of outer space.If you're expecting to see Superman disguised as 'mild mannered reporter' Clark Kent, working for the Daily Planet, you will be disappointed. Clark Kent the reporter only appears at the end of the film and now you will have to wait for the sequel to see him. Instead, Clark pursues a nomadic lifestyle working in such places as a fishing trawler and using his superpowers to save lives (for example) during the collapse of an oil rig. During these sequences, we're also treated to flashbacks detailing Clark's ostracism amongst his peers while he's growing up and how he redeems himself (again for example) by saving his schoolmates after a bus plunges into a river. Kevin Costner and Diana Lane do an excellent, understated job as Ma and Pa Kent but the scene in which Jonathan Kent chooses to sacrifice himself, to save the family dog, doesn't ring true. Why doesn't Clark try to save his father as the tornado bears down? After depositing his mother at the underpass, using his super speed, no one would have seen him, as he could have flown into the tornado and shifted its direction, so that his father wouldn't have been swept away.Somehow Clark then manages to get a job working at a secret military site investigating what turns out to be a Kryptonian ship buried in the Artic ice. There he learns about his origins from a hologram of Jor-EL. The hologram is so prescient that he later even recognizes Lois Lane. In the sci-fi universe, I was always under the impression that the ability of holograms to communicate with humans was quite limited (perhaps answering yes and no questions, as in the film, 'I, Robot'). But here Russell Crowe's ability to communicate appears unlimited.And another thing while Clark is down there in the ice, snooping around. Why doesn't Superman, utilizing his super hearing, hear Lois enter the cave and prevent her from being injured? Instead, he ends up using his X-ray vision to repair Lois' wound, and she's in agony while undergoing the procedure.Even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief concerning all these contrivances, the rest of 'Man of Steel' is a big bore. The problem is that the human characters here are an afterthought. Compared to the superpowers of Superman and Zod, humans are absolutely helpless as the good guy and bad guys from Krypton, battle it out. Perry White (played by a solid Lawrence Fishburne) has little to do except save one of his employees after she's trapped when a piece of concrete falls on her. Lois Lane is given the small task of using a special key to jump start the craft that Superman came to earth in, which is used by the US military to send Zod's minions, back to the phantom zone.Before battling Zod in Metropolis, Superman must dispose of the Krypton bad girl, Faora and another Kryptonian. Those sequences are no different than the final battle with Zod, where trucks are thrown into buildings and each principal punch one another, where they themselves end up being thrown great distances into such recognizable structures as the International House of Pancakes (IHOP). As so cogently pointed out in 'CinemaSins' on Youtube, after the ridiculously long battle between Zod and Superman, the Man of Steel ends the whole thing by merely snapping Zod's neck. Before that, even with Zod being thrown into a building which collapses on him, that isn't enough, to do the trick. Presumably, Zod is so spent that Superman is then able to kill him by such a sleight of hand. But after all the grand CGI effects, the snapping of the neck, is a big let down (and not very believable, to boot).If your thing is special effects, then 'Man of Steel' is for you. But if you require that Superman be all about the human interactions between the characters, then go elsewhere. May I suggest purchasing the complete collection of the original 1950s Superman TV Series? The special effects back then were nothing to jump up and down about, but the 50s incarnations of the iconic characters of Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, were all so endearing.",4,2,7,15 December 2013
The Revenant," Iñárritu's remarkable tale of early frontier survival is marred by fictional tale of revenge
","Wikipedia informs us that Chinese Whispers or The telephone game we played as kids 'is a game played around the world, in which one person whispers a message to another, which is passed through a line of people until the last player announces the message to the entire group.' Director and co-writer Alejandro G. Iñárritu decided to play this game when he made The Revenant. The original message was based on the story of one Hugh Glass, a fur trapper, who joined a trapping expedition searching for beaver pelts in what is now South Dakota in the early part of 1823. According to historical accounts, Glass joined a party led by General William Ashley who met up with the Indian tribe Arikara (aka The Rees) and negotiated a trade of horses for gunpowder. After a trapper ended up having carnal relations with an Indian maiden (and got his throat slit), the Rees attacked the next day which is thrillingly depicted in Iñárritu's opening scene (some have argued that the scene is too long, but hey isn't this the movies?). Iñárritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith now begin to tamper with the historical record by introducing the idea that Glass fathered a son, Hawk, with an Indian maiden, and she was killed during an early Indian massacre by U.S. troops. Hawk accompanies Glass on the expedition.The break into second Act occurs when Glass is mauled by a bear. Whether the story is true or not, it was widely publicized throughout the United States, sealing Glass's status as a legendary figure. The bear attack scene is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking; Iñárritu, using CGI effects, re-creates the attack on Glass, who despite shooting and stabbing the creature, still ends up an inch from death (the bear seems to forget that he's attacked Glass, ending up pawing and sniffing him before it walks away!).The next sequence appears to adhere to the basic facts of what happened. After attempting to lug the badly wounded Glass over hostile terrain in an improvised lean-to, the expedition's leader, Henry, offered cash if two in the group would stay with Glass until he expired. There were two volunteers, John Fitzgerald and a teenager named Bridger. After the rest of trappers left, Iñárritu then turns The Revenant into a tale of revenge. Fitzgerald murders Glass's half-Pawnee son and takes off with his tools and weapons, with Bridger in tow. In the film, Glass eventually seeks to exact revenge for the murder of his son. In reality, Glass went after Fitzgerald merely for stealing his rifle!Glass then attempts to survive in the wilderness and make his way to Fort Kiowa. Glass's account has him crawling part of the way there, with a broken leg and unable to speak, due to wounds to his throat caused by the bear. He might have survived in part by eating a rattlesnake. Iñárritu has him initially finding a minimal amount of meat in the crevices of carcasses of dead animals. Iñárritu embellishes the Glass legend by creating the character of a Pawnee refugee, Hikuc, whose family is murdered by the Sioux. Hikuc helps Glass by attending to his wounds, setting him up in a tepee where he's able to sleep and recuperate. When Glass wakes up, he discovers Hikuc hanging from a tree, murdered by French traders (the French here are particularly noxious and evil, responsible for not only killing Glass's friend Hikuc but also raping the Arikara chief's daughter, Powaqa). Glass manages to free Powaqa and kill two of the French traders before escaping from them. Before making it back to civilization, Iñárritu has Glass endure one last great ordeal. Chased by Arikara, Glass is forced to jump off a cliff while on horseback. His fall is broken by a pine tree below but his horse isn't so lucky. To endure the cold, Glass slits open the horse carcass and takes a pleasant nap inside its belly. It's all very cinematic but of course it never happened.As history has it, Fitzgerald joined the Army as a scout and this prevented Glass from exacting vigilante justice. Instead, after he got his rifle back, the story goes that Glass forgave Fitzgerald. So much for a fight to death on the freezing tundra!Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades for toughing it out in an environment which would make most actors quite squeamish. And Tom Hardy is a fine villain, going up against the noble Glass. Nonetheless, put on your English sub-titles, since it's often difficult to understand the dialogue, which often sounds quite garbled. According to Wikipedia, Iñárritu stated that 'there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.' It's an odd statement since his protagonist Glass is bent on revenge throughout and the audience is asked to cheer him on. Just as he disparages revenge as a way to administer justice, Iñárritu revels in it to tell his story. And while Glass chooses not to issue the coup de grace at film's end (and has the Arikara finish the evil Fitzgerald off), it's not enough to suggest somehow Glass is absolved from his monomaniacal stand.Iñárritu's telephone game is complete when he has his protagonist go off on into the mountains, communing with his dead wife, incorporating all the wisdom she imparted while she was alive. Unfortunately, the real Glass was not such a recipient of kindly Native American wisdom, having ended up victim of an Arikara scalping party in the spring of 1833.",6,1,3,19 August 2016
Bridge of Spies," Good acting can't save true-life lugubrious Cold War tale that lacks suspense
","What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as 'Bridge of Spies?' I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that story—the combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soil—packs little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense.The 'Bridge of Spies' narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident.As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The 'heart-pounding' moment is hardly heart pounding at all—as Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain.Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of 'saving face').With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including 'luminaries' Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a 'thriller' that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall.Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies 'Goofs' section on IMDb.'Bridge of Spies' is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity.",5,39,64,3 November 2015
Hugo," Scorsese's clever but sycophantic tribute to early film pioneer submerged by tangential, plodding children's narrative
","For those who believe that 'Hugo' is all about the title character, think again. Martin Scorsese only uses a fanciful child's tale to arrive at his true intent: a tribute to film pioneer, Georges Méliès. Visually, one can argue that the film is a tour de force, with some fantastic special effects as well as a sumptuous score, but until we arrive at said tribute, Scorsese's tale lacks the requisite tension and charm.The film starts off rather nicely as Scorsese takes us into the heart of a Paris train station, circa 1930. We meet Hugo, an orphan, who's being raised by his alcoholic uncle, after Hugo's watchmaker father is killed in a fire. The uncle teaches Hugo how to maintain the vast array of clocks, hidden inside the station but their relationship remains completely underdeveloped. The real tension is supposed to be between Hugo and the autocratic station inspector (awkwardly played by Sacha Baron Cohen), who is bent on sending the orphan away to a reform school. Scorsese relies on a series of slapstick chase scenes between Hugo and the inspector to move the plot along, and adults should not find much interest in such shenanigans.The connection between Hugo and Méliès is made through a keepsake bequeathed to Hugo from his father. It's an 'automaton', a mechanical man which the father could not get to work, and now Hugo has taken to stealing mechanical parts from a toy store owned by Méliès, now a virtual recluse, in the hope that those parts will enable him to start the device up. Méliès ends up confiscating Hugo's notebook, which contains drawings of the Automaton and his efforts to repair it. Eventually, Méliès hires Hugo to work in the toy store, in order to pay off the debt for the mechanical parts he stole from the store.Hugo finally gets the Automaton to operate when he discovers that Méliès' goddaughter, Isabelle, is wearing the key (that starts the device), around her neck. Wouldn't you know it but the Automaton draws a screen shot from Méliès' most famous film, 'A Trip to the Moon', proving that the 'great man' is still alive (unbeknownst to an indifferent public). The two kids manage (with the help of a kindly film historian), to bring Méliès back into the public eye, and Méliès ends up getting the recognition he 'deserves', from the French film society.In the best part of the film, Scorsese shines, as he offers up a film hagiography of Méliès' career. The flashback, which includes how Méliès actually created 'A Trip to the Moon', features that glass house, where the pioneer's seminal feature film, was made. Nonetheless, one gets the feeling that Scorsese's embrace of the past, has gone too far. The reverence for Méliès has gotten to the point where Scorsese has placed the film pioneer, on a saintly pedestal. Yes, he is an important figure in the history of cinema and he was extremely talented, especially in a day when film was in its infancy and no one had yet grasped the concept of film as spectacle —but Méliès was still a product of his time, and those ancient images belong in the context of the times they were made in. If it was up to Scorsese, Méliès would be placed in the same pantheon as Shakespeare and Dickens; but Méliès' films were not designed to appeal to the intellect. Méliès' appeal to Scorsese is on the technical level and that's why he admires him so much. To a certain extent, there's nothing wrong in that. But for Scorsese to expect the average film goer to worship Méliès as some kind of film 'deity', I would suggest he's gone a little too far out on a limb.Karina Longworth, in her review of 'Hugo' in the Village Voice, sums it up best by arguing that the 'ticking clocks' are the true antagonist in the film: 'In the story of Méliès's life as recounted by Scorsese—and by extension, the story of the movies—time is the enemy that alters the tastes of audiences, decays film prints, and turns today's fetish objects into tomorrow's relics.' 'Hugo' in many ways, feels more like a documentary in parts than a clever children's story, fraught with conflict. The conflict here is manufactured and the two child actors end up with little to do except act as impresarios for the Méliès main act. Relationships here are never really developed or explored and we're asked by Scorsese, to simply applaud the hagiography. If you were to take out all the spoken dialogue in the film and leave only the musical soundtrack, you wouldn't miss much. Perhaps, ironically, that's what Scorsese was really aiming for: a stunning visual tribute, to the technical wizardry of an early film pioneer.",4,1,4,24 March 2012
Wanted," Morgan and Angelina laugh all the way to the bank
","'Wanted' begins with a shootout between two professional assassins in a high-rise office building. One off the assassins jumps to the rooftop of the other building where he murders all the people who are trying to kill him. However, when he jumps, he's able to fly across horizontally without falling to the ground. He's also able to control the bullets he fires from his gun making them bend around potential victims and then striking the targets he seeks. All this comic book nonsense wouldn't be so offensive except for the fact that the director enjoys reveling in the violence throughout the film. Bullets fly in slow motion and always seems to strike their victims in the center of the head with gobs of blood oozing all over the place. Brian McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an office worker hooked on anti-anxiety medication. He's a wuss surrounded by his unlikeable boss, an obese woman who berates him all the time. His best friend humiliates him by having sex with his girlfriend in front of him on multiple occasions. Gibson is recruited by a 1000-year old secret society of assassins called 'The Fraternity' led by Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman) who informs him that one of their renegade members, Cross, has murdered one of their best members, who just happens to be Gibson's father who he never knew. Apparently The Fraternity wants to train the hopeless Gibson because they feel being an assassin is in his blood. He goes through a very long-winded training period where various members of the group (including 'Fox' played by Angelina Jolie) toughen him up by punching, stabbing and shooting him all over his body. Gibson must be subjected to numerous rounds of torture until he becomes 'egoless' and finally adopts the steel-like mindset of the professional assassin. The Fraternity is not without its new age pretensions for every time they beat Gibson to a pulp during their training session, they then put him in a bath, place some kind of clay all over his body (including his face) and fill him with vodka. Miraculously the bath and the vodka do the trick and he's up and about to face another round of beatings until he's ready to go forth and battle Cross. Meanwhile, Sloan reveals to Gibson how members are given their assignments. They work in some sort of textile factory where a loom weaves a tapestry which produces messages with some kind of secret code discernible within the fabric. Sloan seems to be the only one who knows how to decipher the messages and hence doles out the assignments. Gibson along with Fox end up shooting some guy in an office building while they're running from one subway train to another on an elevated track.Things get worse when Gibson finally is able to track down Cross and kills him but not before finding out that Cross was actually his Dad and the Fraternity had double-crossed him. In the laughable finale, Gibson drives a garbage truck full of rats armed with miniature time bombs and dumps them inside some European castle where the Fraternity are all ensconced. The rats explode and most of the assassins are killed. Sloan somehow escapes but Gibson dupes him (we never find out how) by planting a double in his old office cubicle.Just about like every other death in this film, Sloan takes a bullet in the forehead. The last shot in the film is Gibson holding his machine gun, cursing all his opponents and basically bragging what a macho guy he is. 'Wanted' is basically trash for mindless 14-year-olds. The director is from Russia and famous for Vampire films. This would have been a much better film if he threw a few vampires into the mix. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie merely show up to cash their paychecks. Not only does 'Wanted' promote violence, it revels in it. In the perverted moral universe of 'Wanted', a winner is defined as the last thug left standing. Hopefully you won't pay $12 to see this trash. When it comes to cable, just flick your remote to the next channel.",1,17,34,11 July 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," 'Crazies' bond as 'Dancing With The Stars' meets 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'
","I had some trepidations about 'Silver Linings Playbook' because I heard it was another one of those quirky indies, which I usually don't care for. Usually in films that have quirky characters like 'Little Miss Sunshine' or 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', there's a quirky group of misfits who end triumphing over a bunch of straw men reactionaries (school bullies often end up in these straw men roles, for example). Fortunately, director David O. Russell's quirky misfits in 'Silver Linings Playbook', Pat Solitano, a bi-polar former substitute teacher and Tiffany Maxwell, an emotionally disturbed widow, are only pitted against one another; thus this particular quirky indie, isn't burdened with an us vs. them subtext.'Silver Linings', however, is not without its problems. It's a film about a burgeoning romance between two emotionally disturbed people. Russell tries to find humor in people who are emotionally unstable. Anyone who's known people who have been diagnosed as 'bipolar', will tell you it's no laughing matter. But Russell wants us to laugh at Pat during the first act of 'Silver Linings. After he's released from a mental health facility in Baltimore as a result of an eight month court ordered commitment, Pat still remains obsessed with his ex-wife, Nikki, and throws tantrums in front of his parents because he doesn't like the 'unhappy ending' to a Hemingway novel and on another occasion, is unable to find an old wedding video.In addition to the unpleasant tantrums, a flashback reveals why Pat was sent to a mental health facility in the first place--he caught a teacher from their mutual school, in the shower with his wife, and then proceeded to pummel him senseless. His court-ordered therapist, Dr. Patel (wonderfully played by a prominent Indian actor, Anupam Kher), manages to be a settling influence on Pat, who recognizes that he needs to look at the positive aspects in life (hence the title, 'silver linings playbook').'Silver Linings' invariably picks up in the second act, when Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence, with her manic energy, proves she has comic chops--a nice contrast to her more serious role in 'Winter Bones' (let's forget about her throw away part in 'Hunger Games). The comic banter between the two 'crazies', is the high point of the film and is probably why it's garnered so many positive reviews. There's a highly amusing scene where Pat and Tiffany compare the ill effects of various psychotropic medications they've both taken in the past. They also bump into one another in the neighborhood while taking their daily runs--both feel their personal space is being invaded and they end up trading blunt insults with one another.In the best scene in the film, when Pat goes on a date with Tiffany at a diner, Pat goes too far and implies that Tiffany's illness is far worse than his. Tiffany storms out of the diner, knocking over all the plates on the table, and then out on the street accuses him of being arrogant and putting her down, in a moment where she's revealed her vulnerable side to him. But Tiffany also goes too far, falsely accusing Pat of 'harassment' in front of a crowd of people, who believe he's about to assault her. The unlikely appearance of the police officer who has been assigned to monitor Pat, prevents the crowd from assaulting him.The rest of 'Silver Linings' is pure 'Hollywood'. Tiffany agrees to give Nikki, Pat's letter, in exchange for him helping her in the dance competition. Wouldn't you know it, but suddenly Pat is becoming much more serious and responsible as he practices with Tiffany for the competition. More unlikely goings on: Pat's father makes a parley bet with his friend that if his beloved Eagles beats the Dallas Cowboys in an upcoming football game and Pat and Tiffany score at least a 5 out of 10 in the dance competition, he'll win enough money to open a restaurant.The outcome of the bet, of course, is a fait acompli, and sure enough, 'crazy' Pat ends up crazy only in the sense that he falls in love with Tiffany, and decides that Nikki is a thing of the past.You've really got to suspend your disbelief that bipolar people such as Pat can so easily overcome their problems, merely through the love of a good woman. In the end, however, 'Silver Linings' strives to be simple, good, clean fun, with a Hollywood ending to boot. But I can't help but feel that the initial 'edginess' of the principals is lost, when they finally do shack up. Thus whatever comic energy is extant during the second act, pretty much dissipates by the end of the third. If you like the trade-off, you won't have any problems with the denouement. For me, the air in the 'Silver Linings' tire, ended up being sucked out faster than you can say, 'failed eccentric romantic dramedy.'",5,4,9,20 January 2013
Ender's Game," Battlestar Galactica meets Lord of the Flies as absurd premise of kid space cadets fighting aliens sinks this flick from the get-go
","After watching 'Ender's Game' for the first five minutes and understanding the film's premise, my immediate reaction was 'Yikes!— look's like I'm in for a long ride.' Yes I must confess that my initial impression that the premise was ludicrous, was borne out by the rest of the plot and attendant hokey character machinations. Why exactly does humanity choose to employ children to battle insect-like aliens (aka Formics) who attacked and almost successfully destroyed earth fifty years earlier? That's a good question for Orson Scott Card, the author of the original source material, who wrote the book (of the same title) which the movie is based on. It's an easier question for profit-hungry producers, who speculated that allowing prepubescent kids to act out their fantasies in what essentially is one monotonous video game on screen, would translate into mega-profits at the box office. At the end of the day, 'Ender's Game', only made a very small profit due to its reliance on a slew of computer generated effects.As for the Ender's plot, it revolves around a kid who has the same apocalyptic sounding name (does it mean he 'ends' the threat of the alien invasion or earth is at an end?) Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin (played by an overly intense Asa Butterfield), is a cadet who catches the eye of Commander Graff, who sees potential in the reserved and thoughtful twelve or thirteen year old. Graff is played by Harrison Ford who manages to be unpleasant throughout, barking orders at Ender and generally conforming to the script's call to play the boss as a boorish martinet. While in a regular training school, Ender gets into his first physical confrontation with classmate Stilson, after defeating him in a space ship simulation. He also impresses Graff's subordinate, Gwen Anderson, when he figures out how to defeat a giant troll-like creature in a 'mind game' program designed as a no-win scenario (the CGI-effects here, along with a later scene involving one of Ender's visions, are perhaps the best parts of the film). Ender then graduates to the much more fancy battle school where students fire laser guns at each other in a giant sphere dubbed the 'Battle Room' in a zero gravity atmosphere. Kids who love video games will probably find all of this endearing but for me, most of it reminded me of the typical dated paeans to military school cadet culture (here now with the students dressed up in spacesuits). When Ender is appointed the 'commander' of his own band of 'misfits' and defeats his former commander, Bonzo Madrid (no, not Bonzo the chimp!) in one of those battles inside the sphere, the second clichéd fight occurs between the two afterward, inside a shower room. Ender decides it's 'Bedtime for Bonzo' after he puts Madrid into a coma (again Commander Braff is impressed by Ender channeling his hardly utilized inner Rambo).Ender ends up being promoted to Commander of all forces and is transferred to a base of a former Formic colony. There he meets Rackham, the legendary commander who found the key to defeating the Formics in the epic battle fifty years ago. Ben Kingsley manages to out growl Harrison Ford, as another over aggressive mentor assisting the heralded lap dog, Ender (and yes, Kingsley's atrocious tattoos all over his face, are certainly not endearing at all). I have no guilt feelings about revealing the film's deus ex machina, so SUPER SPOILERS are ahead: the simulation that Ender (along with all of his pals from Battle School) engage in, which annihilates the Formic planet, was for real. Thus Graff turns out to be a true martinet, a stand-in for over-aggressive, right wing, American military types. Ender, however, feels horribly guilty about being duped into wiping out the Formics. He realizes that the earlier mind game scene he involves himself in, is right outside the base and after encountering a dying Formic Queen, he vows to take the Queen's egg and colonize a new world with it. Ender justifies his actions by claiming that the Formics attempted to communicate with him, before Graff and his minions did their 'dirty work'. The problem is the Formics did indeed try to destroy the earth's population but the film's scenarists provide no explanation as to the original reason for the invasion. Therefore, Ender's assumption that their attempt to communicate is not justification enough for him to save the Formic species. Ender is unable to refute Graff, who implicitly argues that any attempt to communicate could very well have been a ruse. Unfortunately, the idea of kids being put in charge of a fighting team in place of adults, seems to be an absurd conceit. And at a certain point, it isn't difficult to figure out that the filmmakers intentionally allowed Ender to take the moral high ground after he gets oh so 'touchy feely' with the that one last Formic egg (damning Graff for encouraging the kids' aggression, deceiving them but not explaining why he was wrong in the first place about the danger of another Formic invasion).There were a few moments here and there which were nicely done, particularly Ender's mind game where he encounters the Formics for the first time inside the castle that was destroyed during the initial invasion. But watching juveniles beat each other up or blast one another in simulated war games, was not my cup of tea. This despite the films' scenarists wishful thinking that killing is bad if you don't give a dangerous, former adversary, a chance to redeem themselves, in the face of the flimsiest of evidence. Others might dub all this 'liberalism run amok'; as for me I'll simply return this disc to Netflix as fast as possible and move on to something more worthwhile!",3,1,2,5 May 2014
The White Ribbon," Specious attempt at explaining roots of 20th Century Fascism
","We're told at the beginning of 'The White Ribbon', that this is a story that seeks to 'clarify things that happened in this country', as if to imply that we're about to gain some insight into the origins of Nazism. But director Michael Haneke has made it clear that he was aiming for a more generic understanding of the roots of Fascism when he was quoted as saying that the film is about 'the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature.' Note that Haneke doesn't speak of 'Nazism' or 'Fascism' but uses the modern term 'terrorism' to describe the actions of many of the characters in his film. The setting of Haneke's tale is the fictional village of Eichwald, right before World War I. There is virtually no effort to link the story to actual historical events except for the specific reference to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand and the start of World War I at the film's end. Haneke does this because his story is really a PARABLE; by making it (in part) applicable to all nationalities and to different historical epochs, Haneke, in effect, minimizes the responsibility of the German and Austrian peoples who lived during the time leading up to the Holocaust and participated in it, either directly or indirectly. If his parable is universally applied, the unique horror of Nazism can't really be any worse than any other atrocities committed by other groups in history. The generic nature of his story (or parable), bears this out.Despite his insistence to the contrary, it remains obvious that 'Ribbon' IS also Haneke's attempt to explain the rise of the Third Reich. He is not unlike a bevy of German and Austrian filmmakers who utilize a fictional melodramatic narrative to assuage their own guilt (as well as an attempt to speak for the collective guilt of a nation). It's not easy being German or Austrian when your recent ancestors are linked to mass murderers. If the ancestors are portrayed as likable, normal people but also capable of violence (or supporting violence), this would lead to unpleasant feelings of cognitive dissonance. But what if the history is reduced to a more simplistic formula consisting of monsters, victims and saints? The viewer no longer has to be confused rooting for a complex Tony Soprano type of character—an extremely violent man who is also likable and sympathetic.In 'The Reader', the monsters are the cold Concentration Camp guards in the docket, who won't admit their guilt. The victim, however, is Hanna Schmitz, the guard who is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape. The saint is the protagonist, Michael Berg, who can still have sympathy for the 'tragic' Hanna as well as offer to pay money to a Holocaust victim's foundation.Haneke also must create his share of monsters. In doing so, a guilty populace no longer has to believe that their grandparents were part of a 'normal' silent majority that supported Hitler. How could anyone's ancestors be like the Eichwald town doctor, pastor or baron? The doctor is someone who sexually humiliates his long-term mistress, the midwife, as well as sexually abuses his own daughter. The pastor utilizes corporal punishment to raise his children, which leads to acts of revenge on their part. What's more, he promotes unhealthy sexual feelings in his children, by denouncing masturbation as a sin. The Baron neglects workers on his estate, leading to the death of a worker's wife in a work-place accident. He also neglects his wife, the Countess, who ultimately leaves, after she accuses him of allowing a lot of unhealthy stuff to go on in the village.Like Hanna Schmitz whose behavior was excused on the basis of being raised in a bad environment, the White Ribbon kids also get a free pass. They are the 'victims' of the monstrous fathers and enabling mothers. How can any child be completely responsible for crimes committed as an adult if the upbringing was so horrendous? This is the film's 'hook'--it's the kids who committed most (or all) of the crimes in the village: the doctor is injured after his horse falls in an encounter with a trip wire; the baron's son is hung upside down in the forest and caned; and a mentally challenged kid is tortured. The kids cover their tracks by appearing en masse at the victim's home, asking if they can be of any help.Finally, there is the 'saint'--here is the character which a guilty audience can identify with ('Hey my grandfather didn't support Hitler at all—he was apolitical and a nice guy to boot!) The school teacher fits the bill perfectly. Not only does he save the hapless Eva after she's fired but figures out who's responsible for the crimes committed in the village and has the guts to reveal the ugly truth to the town's power broker, the Pastor! While it is very wrong to blame today's generation in Austria and Germany for the sins of the parents and grandparents, it is equally disturbing to realize that there is a pattern of denial amongst the younger generation in regards to the idea that the enablers of the Holocaust were not the monsters, victims and saints depicted by Mr. Haneke but rather ordinary people who one could easily identify with.Despite its facile explanation of the roots of Fascism, the White Ribbon has some value, precisely because it sparks debate. With its austere, Bergman-like, black and white cinematography, and recreation of a bygone era, Haneke scores points for atmosphere. But instead of focusing on 'why' the Holocaust occurred, the 'what' and 'how' would have been more than sufficient.",4,26,62,14 July 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," Mildly entertaining but flat animated sci-fi comedy
","Monsters vs Aliens had the potential to become a Sci-Fi comedy classic along the lines of a 'Coneheads' or 'Galaxy Quest' but didn't quite make it. There were a few scenes that really hit the mark however, due to the satirical content. My favorite scene was President Hathaway (voiced by Stephen Colbert) trying to make personal contact with the alien robot. The President is depicted as sort of a twisted Madison Avenue Ad exec type from the 60s surrounded by prototypical yes men. First he plays the theme from 'Close Encounters' on a DX7 Yamaha synth and then breaks into Axel F, the theme from the 1984 Beverly Hills Cop movie (the anachronisms just seemed to jell perfectly). When the robot makes it clear that he's not interested in 'peaceful co-existence', President Hathaway just manages to escape with his life. The president's transition from feckless appeaser to impulsive warmonger in a matter of a few minutes is priceless! The film's inciting incident draws you in at first. That's where Susan is infected by the meteorite and is transformed into a giant monster on her wedding day. We break into the 'second act' when Susan is transported to the secret government facility where she's imprisoned with other monsters who have been captured over the last fifty years. I just couldn't understand how the secret government monster unit could have so easily muzzled all the guests at the wedding who were witnesses to Susan's amazing transformation. And that especially includes Derek, Susan's social-climbing TV anchor boyfriend, who would have been first in line to promote the media scoop.I was further disappointed when we soon learn that the government has 'collected' a total of only four monsters (not including the newly minted Susan, now dubbed 'Ginormica') over the past five decades. And it seemed crazy that such an enormous facility was needed to house such a limited collection (I guess that was the joke—the government was so paranoid about the monsters escaping that they built such a giant facility despite the fact that their prisoners were a completely sorry and ineffectual bunch). The bottom line is that it would have been much more fun if there were more monsters released to combat the invading aliens. The film's scenarists could have worked the additional monsters in without taking away from the principals (the other monsters could have been designated as less intelligent and unable to speak—at the same time, their ineptitude could have been highlighted through various visual scenes without the need for dialogue).The monsters of 'Monsters vs Aliens' seem to be created in order to emulate Dorothy's allies in 'The Wizard of Oz'. Susan (having been separated from her family and propelled into a new world) can be likened to Dorothy. Then there's Dr. Cockroach as the brainy Scarecrow, The Missing Link as the Tin Man without a heart and BOB equivalent to the cowardly lion (since this is a comedy, BOB's 'cowardice' is due to stupidity rather than a lack of nerve). And Insectosaurus, the lovable moth, functions as a sort of Toto character, beloved by the protagonist and her allies.I found the Monsters to be a rather unfunny lot. There wasn't much difference between the Dr. Cockroach character and the principal villain, Gallaxhar (both had that maniacal laugh). And what about the 'Missing Link'? I guess he was supposed to be some sort of Loch Ness Monster but there was nothing distinctive about his comic persona. BOB, the gelatinous mass, who couldn't think straight, was perhaps the most amusing of the motley trio. The bit about him falling in love with the jello mold was one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie.As the Monster vs Alien's plot develops, it becomes obvious that the vapid Susan, who defines herself in relation to the obnoxious Derek, finally gains confidence and is no longer dependent on men to go forward in life. That's her 'internal arc' and I had no problem with the way the story was going in that regard. But the 'external arc' of the story was underdeveloped and derivative. Take for example when Susan first stops the alien robot (but must destroy the Golden Gate Bridge in the process). Although the city of San Francisco had been evacuated, I would have thought that the battle with the alien robot would still have been covered by the news media. The film's screenwriters missed a big opportunity to depict Susan as the new hero and media darling after destroying the alien robot. And for awhile, it would have been nice to see Susan distracted by fame and seduced by the culture of celebrity.Finally, Gallaxhar and his spaceship, seemed to be like a cheap imitation of the brilliant Coneheads. Contrast the sharp, satirical portraits of various narcissistic characters in the Coneheads with Gallaxhar —reminiscent of the mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama.Monsters vs Aliens has quite a bit of very neat animation along with a positive message of self-empowerment. But by the film's end, it becomes too much like the kind of films it seeks to satirize. Yes, another 'mother ship' blows up after being set on 'auto-destruct', thanks to the heroic efforts of a group of motley but lovable losers. 'Monsters' has its moments but it's not consistently funny enough to be ranked as one of the better comic animations.",5,0,1,2 April 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Scandinavian 'Blowup' that keeps your interest despite significant contrivances
","On the surface, the American version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' directed by David Fincher, has a lot going for it. Despite the slow exposition, the story picks up when Daniel Craig as journalist-investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, is hired by Swedish magnate, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, who vanished from the family compound forty years earlier in 1966.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is how Blomkvist, with the assistance of Goth-like computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, partially solves the mystery, mainly by discovering clues buried in old photos taken at the time of Harriet's disappearance. One is reminded of Antonioni's 1966 film 'Blowup', which was released in the same year the murder mystery in 'Tattoo' is supposed to take place.There are other well done scenes in 'Tattoo', particularly the harrowing rape scenes where Lisbeth is violated by her court appointed guardian and later when she turns the tables on him, an example of vigilante justice. Equally as gripping is when Blomkvist is imprisoned by Vanger's serial-killer nephew, Martin, who tortures the journalist but is saved by Salander, who arrives in the nick of time.The acting is mostly excellent, including Rooney Mara, who plays the glum, rebellious 'damaged goods' ward of the state, with aplomb as well as the always solid Christopher Plummer. The bad guys are equally as menacing--only Daniel Craig, seems out of place, as he doesn't seem like he's from Scandinavia. To be fair to Craig, the script saddles him with a rather deadpan part, with Blomkvist the least interesting of the principal players. One unfortunate shortcoming in the Hollywood version is that there's mention of a number of characters with a 'Nazi' past, but the nature of that connection is never explored in any detail whatsoever.Despite a thriller that keeps one's interest to the end, nagging questions remain which tend to lessen the film's overall impact. For starters, we find out little about the nature of the lawsuit, which Blomkvist loses at the beginning of the film. Why is the crooked businessmen, Wennerström, so evil? Vanger seems to think so, and promises to give Blomkvist the evidence once he completes his assignment. But Blomkvist tells Vanger at film's end that the 'evidence' is meaningless and we never find out what it's about. I realize that in a film such as this, which is already quite long, the scenarists don't really have a lot of time to explain all the, but still, the reason why the whole story is put in motion is principally due to the main character losing this lawsuit. And when Lisbeth hacks into Wennerström's computers and steals all his millions, do we really care? And do we really care when he's murdered? In reality, Wennerström is really a cypher of a character.I also wonder why Vanger hires Blomkvist in the first place. Wouldn't he have done better to have hired a private investigator or someone involved closer to law enforcement? I realize Blomkvist is an investigative reporter but he's also the co-owner of a hip magazine--hardly the type of person to take on such an assignment. Yes, of course, he's just lost his life savings and he's desperate but the entire arrangements seems a bit odd. There's also the issue of Blomkvist's competency--he's just lost that lawsuit and even though Vanger likes the idea that he opposed Wennerström (who's a long term rival), the fact that he made accusations without proof, wouldn't have impressed a real life Vanger, who would have probably gone for someone whose past, in contrast, was squeaky clean.Even if one is willing to suspend one's disbelief regarding Blomkvist taking on Vanger's proposal, the whole idea that the brilliant Lisbeth would allow herself to fall into her evil guardian's clutches more than once, seems pretty incredible. Just like Blomkvist, who stupidly 'miscalculated' about the lawsuit, Lisbeth admits to misjudging just how sick (as she puts it) Guardian Bjurman really is. And what about Lisbeth running out of money? Wasn't she paid a fair amount by Vanger to investigate Blomkvist before he hires him? You would have thought she would have had some money left over to the buy that new computer. And since she's so clever, why couldn't she just go out and get another freelance assignment to pay the bills, instead of relying on her pervert guardian? If she's smart enough to steal three billion dollars from a mega-rich businessmen, couldn't she have hacked into a lesser fry criminal early on, put a few bucks into her account, and avoided being dependent on Bjurman?Regarding Lisbeth, there were a couple of other things that seemed a little 'too easy'--for example, Martin forgetting to lock the doors behind him when he went downstairs to torture Blomkvist. Lisbeth just walks right into the house (no alarm is triggered to warn hi-tech guru, Martin) and she then all too easily slips into Martin's torture chamber and saves Blomkvist from a horrible death. And wasn't it sort of a little too easy for Lisbeth, to hack into Wennerström's accounts? But this is Hollywood, so anything can happen, no? Finally, I was curious about Vanger's assumption that Harriet had been murdered. He states that Harriet couldn't have gotten off the island since none of the boats had been used and the police had prevented everyone from leaving. But the next day, the police relented...SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD...and that's exactly how Harriet escaped--in the trunk of her cousin Anita's car, who had helped her. Why didn't this scenario occur to Vanger? Had he followed through on such an assumption, of course there would have been no movie!If you're not too picky about Tattoo's contrivances, you may find yourself enjoying this tale of suspense. For more critical and/or discerning viewers, you may end up with the conclusion that this is by no means a masterpiece.",6,1,6,10 June 2012
Dunkirk," Standard action scenes predominate over character development as Nolan views rescue at Dunkirk as more tragic than uplifting
","I haven't seen the original 'Dunkirk' film which came out in 1958, but of what I know of that plot the main focus is on a British troop's battle against the Germans before they arrive at Dunkirk, with the rescue at the beach as the stirring climax. Christopher Nolan rejected that whole approach and decided that all the action should be centered around the events that occurred at Dunkirk proper—hence, we never see one German during the entire film.I am forced to argue that Nolan's approach is wrong-headed and despite his signature visual acumen, Dunkirk (2017) ultimately lacks punch. What happened at Dunkirk simply doesn't lend itself to much drama. Since the British were stranded on the beach and were unable to take any pro-active steps against the encroaching enemy, they basically played the role of 'sitting ducks' until their miracle deliverance. Nolan's best scenes involve the British troops, unable to take cover on the beach, or lined up like sardines on the 'mole' as they're unmercifully cut down by Luftwaffe pilots. The sense of fear is truly palpable as the defenseless men have nowhere to go.It's the attendant fear, masterfully conveyed by Nolan, that grips us in the early part of the picture. But soon the scenes of dive bombing destruction give way to more conventional war action tropes, involving the sinking of various boats (the scenes of drowning victims are reminiscent of scenes from Titanic). In the middle of the action is one of the protagonists, Tommy, a British private, who survives two sinkings of boats intended to ferry the soldiers across the Channel—one boat is destroyed from the air and the other torpedoed.Soon Nolan has Tommy along with a number of his confederates hook up with some Scottish soldiers who find a grounded fishing trawler in what I'm told (by Wikipedia) is the 'intertidal zone outside of the Allied perimeter.' Would soldiers have actually left the perimeter and put themselves at risk, with the unlikely hope of being able to get the trawler to float? And where do those unseen Germans come from who end up taking target practice? Somehow the soldiers inside the trawler miraculously escape being killed by machine gun fire. The trawler sinks too but not before Gibson, a French soldier masquerading as British, gets tangled in some chains inside the trawler, and drowns. Nolan is determined to continually reiterate his 'wall is hell' theme and serves up one additional destruction of a boat—this time Tommy and fellow soldier Alex surviving the destruction of a minesweeper —only to be rescued by a pleasure craft manned by its civilian captain Davidson, along with his teenage son Peter, and Peter's friend, George.Davidson's saga forms the second in a triptych of stories, this time focusing on one of the hundreds of pleasure crafts conscripted by the British to sail across the Channel and save the beleaguered troops. In this tale, Davidson picks up a shell-shocked RAF pilot who's just been shot down by the Germans and wouldn't you know it, he can't handle the idea that they're headed right back into harm's way at the beaches of Dunkirk. Basically the pilot freaks out, hits poor George in the head while Davidson and son are trying to calm him down, and the poor kid sustains a severe head injury and ends up (as later reported in the local press) a 'casualty of war.' All of this unlikely turn of events seems rather heavy-handed or forced if you will, but Nolan is determined again to remind us that Dunkirk was more tragic than something to celebrate about.The third story is told from the perspective of three RAF pilots who do battle with their Luftwaffe counterparts out above the open sea. It's noteworthy that the action takes place far from where the troops are stranded, none of whom who are able to appreciate the sacrifices the pilots make. (Since the pilots couldn't be in all places at once, they were unable to stop some of the dive bombers responsible for the all the carnage we see at the beginning of the film.) Hence, a familiar query was sounded after the battle with the troops asking the pilots, 'where were you?'Nolan's attention to detail is evident in the battle scenes in the air. But after a while, it feels a bit perfunctory and one longs for some character development in place of one plane being shot down after another. Nolan continues to commit himself to a non-glamorous view of war—when the last pilot runs out of fuel and sets his plane down—he ends up burning it so it won't fall into the hands of the enemy. And the pilot ultimately is taken prisoner (again no heroics).In addition to lack of character development, Dunkirk suffers from the lack of a visible antagonist. Instead of the Germans, war itself becomes the antagonist and the film becomes more a generic anti-war film than a film rooted in history. If there were real heroes here, Nolan ignores them. Those would be the French troops who fought the Germans inland, to give the British time to put their rescue mission into action.If you like seeing ships being bombed or torpedoed, scenes of men drowning, the unlikely death of a civilian at the hands of a shell-shocked soldier as well as a series of somewhat repetitious aerial battles, all presented on a non-linear time line, Dunkirk might be for you. Ultimately I understand what Nolan is driving at—that in the larger context, the rescue at Dunkirk was still part of the overall tragedy of war. All well and good but the tragedy is conveyed through a series of standard war scenes without character development, so necessary for compelling drama.",5,6,11,4 August 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," McConaughey is superb as redneck homophobe transformed into compassionate, alternative health activist
","'The Dallas Buyers Club' is the first mainstream film that has the guts to question both the efficacy and legitimacy of Orthodox Medicine's early AIDS medication research as well as highlighting the unhealthy relationship between the researchers, doctors and pharmaceutical companies, who pushed toxic treatments on an unsuspecting public. The man who led the valiant crusade against this nasty coterie of entrenched interests was the unlikely Texas electrician and part-time rodeo cowboy, Ron Woodroof (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaghey), who went from being a redneck homophobe to a tolerant, alternative health activist.When we're first introduced to Woodroof, he's the epitome of what some may call 'Trailer Trash'. Woodroof pals around with his homophobic buddies, has sex with prostitutes and uses drugs like candy. After sustaining a work-related injury (he's zapped by a faulty electrical current), Woodroof's brought to the hospital to recover. The tests reveal that he's got AIDS and he's told he has 30 days to live. First Woodroof's in denial but remembers that he had unprotected sex with an intravenous drug user. As he researches causes of AIDS in the library, it dawns on him that his drug use in general probably was also a big factor leading to his illness. As we break into Act II, Woodruff's life is upended as he's ostracized by his community and must fend for himself as he seeks a cure.When AZT first came out, the double blind experiments prevented subjects from knowing whether they were getting the real thing or a placebo. Woodroof is forced to bribe a hospital worker to obtain the drug but after using it for a short time, finds his health getting worse. When his supply at the hospital runs out, it's then that he hears about a doctor in Mexico, Vass, who might have some AZT. It turns out that Dr. Vass was barred from practicing in the US after giving his patients non- approved, alternative medications. It's this Dr. Vass who enlightens Woodroof about the dangers of AZT and how it's completely toxic. He gives him the protein, peptide T, along with some other non-toxic medication and Woodroof finds himself getting better. I'm not sure if the medication did the trick or it simply was the lack of flooding his body with toxic stuff like AZT that stabilized the very ill Woodroof, but whatever the case, this Dr. Vass was on to something.After his health begins to improve, Woodroof gets the idea that he can make money by importing the alternative AIDS medications and selling them by subscription (Dallas Buyers Club members must pay $400 per month to get the medications); he smuggles them into the US dressed as a priest and claiming they're for his personal use. Earlier, Woodroof met a transsexual diagnosed with AIDS by the name of Rayon (Jared Leto) who he tries to avoid due to his homophobia. But after his own bout with the illness, Woodroof becomes more accepting of Rayon, who becomes his business partner, bringing in new clients from her contacts in the gay community. 'Dallas Buyers Club' is perhaps the first mainstream film that criticizes both allopathic medicine and big Pharma. When Dr. Sevard finds out about the buyer's club, he castigates Woodroof because his efforts are interfering with his AZT trials. It's obvious that in the doctor's view of things, only orthodox medicine has the right to grant access to treatment for AIDS sufferers. Worse is the attitude of the FDA in the form of point man Richard Barkley, who ends up confiscating Woodroof's medications and threatens to have him jailed. Later, Woodroof attempts to challenge the FDA's new rules which make it illegal to dispense alternative medications for AIDS sufferers. While Woodroof loses in Federal Court (the Judge sympathizes but argues that legally, his hands are tied), he emerges as a hero to the gay community along with progressive sympathizers.Not everyone in the medical community views Woodroof as a demon. Gradually, Dr. Eve Saks comes around to his point of view. She's right however, when Woodroof gets angry over the fact that Rayon was taken to the hospital and given AZT while he was away. Dr. Saks tells Woodroof that ultimately Rayon died from her own drug usage and not from one or two days of AZT treatment. The idea that Woodroof would lash out like that is understandable given the fact that he had just learned of Rayon's death. But ultimately,Woodroof's blaming Rayon's death solely on AZT (especially for the short time she was administered the drug), was irrational.If there is one sour note in the film, it's in one of the closing credits. We're informed that due to Woodroof's efforts, AZT was modified so that it was less toxic and millions of AIDS sufferers were saved. I hardly believe that Woodroof would have been happy with such a statement. The whole point of the film was that Woodruff was a crusader who fought for alternative medications and he himself lived longer, not because of toxic pharmaceutical products but because he took benign alternative ones--which perhaps gave his body a better chance than the kind of medicines touted by mainstream physicians and their government minions.In the end, even Woodroof's alternative medications were not enough to prevent him from dying of AIDS. But he lived seven years longer than his initial diagnosis of 30 days. 'Dallas Buyers Club' not only bravely holds up a mirror to a medical establishment that has for too long been given a free pass in regards to increased scrutiny but it's also a perceptive tale of a man who transformed himself from a bigot and self-centered materialist to a compassionate healer with a moral and humanitarian core.",9,2,2,26 February 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Excellent production design is not enough to save convoluted plot involving ho-hum magic world derring-do
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is J.K. Rowling's first screenplay. Rowling's tale is a prequel to her Harry Potter franchise neatly set in a Roaring Twenties New York City. The production design is probably the best thing about the film and for those (like myself) who yearn for such nostalgic enterprises, one can remain glued to the screen until the film's climax, despite the limitations of a paltry script.In truth, Fantastic Beasts probably could have used a better appellation such as 'Much Ado about Nothing.' Until the convoluted plot kicks in, Rowling serves up a decent enough protagonist in the form of author/researcher/ magizoologist Newt Scamander (winningly played by Eddie Redmayne). He carries around a beat up briefcase which is a portal to a magical world filled with the aforementioned beasts. When the so-called fantastic creatures start escaping, Newt falls afoul of the Magic Congress of the United States (aka MACUSA), who have strict rules about non-magic people knowing about their secret world. A defrocked enforcer, a witch by the name of Tina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterson, in a part where there's little to do) tries to rehabilitate her position by bringing Newt in to answer to the Congress for violating their rules. Only problem is that his briefcase was inadvertently switched in an encounter with an ex-factory worker, the 'No-Maj' Jacob Kowalski and Newt is unceremoniously released.Kowalski is the comic relief here and Rowling has some fun in contrasting the sophisticated Newt with the unkempt American. There is a rather good scene where Kowalski interacts with Newt's beasts after falling into the briefcase and emerging inside the magizoologist's world of wonders.Rowling gets into trouble by introducing too many antagonists and by the denouement we're thoroughly confused as to who we should be mainly rooting against. First there's Mary Lou Barebone, a no-Maj crusader against the magic world, who is reminiscent of the Temperance League fanatics from the Prohibition era. Barebone's main claim to fame is she's the abusive mother of Credence, a problematic teen who we'll get to in a minute.Worse is MACUSA's Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves, who blames one of Newt's creatures for killing prominent senator Henry Shaw Jr. Before you know it, Graves accuses Newt and Tina of conspiring with the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (another one of Rowling's antagonists who shows up much later), and the unlikely couple are sentenced to death. I'm not sure why Graves is so sinister but I suppose Rowling needs such a character to root against as a representative of rabid intolerance. No need to explain how Tina and Newt escape but suffice it to say, they do!Things get more convoluted when we find out that Credence is the host of an Obscurus, some kind destructive energy creature that wreaks havoc on New York City. When the MACUSA enforcers show up, they're forced to kill Credence as he's the host of the uncontrollable Obscurus. Newt somehow reveals that Graves is actually Grindelwald, who ends up arrested by MAGUSA, not before surprisingly objecting to their non- fraternization policy between Maj and Non-Majers.I couldn't help being reminded of the scene in the Wizard of Oz when the Good Witch Glenda puts everyone to sleep in the poppy field and a similar sequence of events happens here. With the Obscurus revealing its power to ordinary folk, Newt enlists one of his creatures to fly throughout the city, dropping a magic potion on all the inhabitants, erasing their memories and ensuring that the secret magical world will continue to remain incognito.Fantastic Beasts features some whimsical, romantic scenes between Tina's sister, Queenie, a telepath who falls for Kowalski, who ends up (with Newt's help) in opening up his own bakery store. Much more disappointing are the fantastic beasts themselves--seen in similar incarnations, in fantasy films, of the last few decades.Maybe it's a question of a lack of true stakes here or simply Rowling's inability to bring her tale to a fitful and truly exciting conclusion. See the 'Beasts' for the visuals and don't focus too much on the plot.",5,1,3,16 September 2017
Jackie," Portman's 'Jackie' is much more neurotic than poised
","There are few films that I question the necessity of making in the first place. Jackie, a historical drama chronicling our former first lady's practical and emotional reactions to the events leading up to and during the funeral of our 35th president, is one such film. What possibly can be learned about someone's life chronicling the time period leading up to a funeral—an event where any person would be most vulnerable? Instead of perhaps imagining what kind of relationship Jackie had with Jack Kennedy when he was alive, director Pablo Larrain prefers to bring us pale imitations of historical TV broadcasts (such as Jackie's famed 1962 televised tour of the White House) or the more salacious exploding head of JFK when he's hit by the assassin's bullet (haven't we seen enough of that on Youtube in clip after clip of the Zapruder film?).Larrain, utilizing a screenplay by Noah Oppenheim, creates a fictional framing device, an imagined interview between Jackie Kennedy and a fictional reporter (played by a somewhat unkempt Billy Crudup) at Hyannisport, asking a slew of inappropriate questions of Jackie regarding her recent recollection as to the the events leading up to JFK's funeral.Even if one concedes there is a necessity in presenting such a behind the scenes look, there has to be a determined verisimilitude in the presentation. Actors have to look and sound like the historical personages they're playing; otherwise, the events won't seem real at all, and one will get the impression that we're looking at a mere imitation of the events as opposed to the real McCoy.The number one offender here is of course Natalie Portman, who does fairly well in re-creating Jackie's way of speaking which reminds one of a muted Carol Channing, but is unable to convey any of her poise or gravitas. Instead, she aims to present Jackie as a neurotic, perhaps made more unhinged by the assassination. Mick LaSalle, writing in the SF Chronicle, hits the nail on the head when he writes: 'But no insight can be gleaned or arrived at through a portrayal of Jackie Kennedy as having been a fragile, emotional cripple at the height of her influence and popularity. Once that happens, we're just not talking about the same woman anymore, and all that's left is an actress playing dress-up in a bloodstained pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat.'Worse than Portman is Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby Kennedy. In perhaps the worst casting choice in a few decades, Sarasgaard doesn't look or sound like Bobby in the least and appears as a strange interloper opposite Portman. John Carroll Lynch as LBJ also doesn't feel like he inhabits the body of our former president but Beth Grant is great as Lady Bird and Caspar Phillipson is decent enough as JFK, during the brief scenes in which he appears.In addition to the salacious moments of the assassination itself, the Jackie 'plot' mainly focuses on her indecision as to whether the participants at the funeral should walk with the casket, causing security concerns. There are more effective moments where Jackie must explain JFK's death to Caroline and John Jr., but even those somehow feel intrusive, even after all these years. Speaking of intrusive, director Larrain is determined to inject Mica Levi's overly mournful music into almost scene, reminding us that we're continually in the midst of a funeral.Only the late John Hurt as a consoling priest to Jackie brings any true gravitas to the overall proceedings. If you wish to learn about Jackie Kennedy there are many documentaries and features that are way better than this one. Kyle Smith writing in the NY Post perhaps provides the most efficient benediction for this hapless project: 'Jackie' does more than a disservice — bordering on an insult — to its subject: It's so obtuse about the history of mores that it's the equivalent of showing Abraham Lincoln reading the Gettysburg Address off a teleprompter.'",2,24,46,4 February 2017
Tropic Thunder," Stiller's Vietnam War action film spoof is as bad as the films it attempts to satirize
","When Ben Stiller first approached Robert Downey Jr. about acting in 'Tropic Thunder', Downey was quoted as saying, 'this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.'  Stiller reportedly replied, 'Yeah, I know—isn't it great?'  Somehow, in Stiller's mind, 'stupid' is equated with 'funny'.  Nonetheless, 'Tropic Thunder' was tremendously successful at the box office which I believe had little to do with the puerile script but more with the action sequences and special effects that appealed to the male teenage and young adult audience.  I'm reluctant to concede that Stiller has any talent in the area of screen writing but as a director of action sequences, he probably can hold his own with most of the action sequence directors out there today.  'Tropic Thunder' begins with some mildly amusing takeoffs on movie trailers and commercials. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon Jackson) promotes his 'Booty Sweat' energy drink and Stiller as Tugg Speedman in Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown where each sequel seems the same as the other.  Less successful is Jack Black's obnoxious 'The Fatties: Fart 2' which consists of Black playing each character in a fat suit and farting continuously. The final trailer, 'Satan's Alley', starring Downey's 'Kirk Lazarus' and Tobey MacGuire feature two monks attempting to repress their sexual longings for one another.  The takeoff is obviously designed to satirize such gay-themed movies as 'Brokeback Mountain'; it's a good way to start a comedy but things begin going downhill almost immediately after the opening sequence.   'Thunder' calls for a complete suspension of disbelief as to the plausibility of the plot.  I wondered why Vietnam would ever allow an American film crew to film a movie written in the style of the jingoistic 'Green Berets'.  That's where the film-within-a-film is initially being shot but the locale shifts to Laos (or possibly Myanmar) after the spineless Brit director Damien Cockburn is ordered by studio head Les Grossman to get his actors back in shape after the picture goes way beyond budget in the first week of filming.  At the suggestion of the author the film is based on, Tayback (who is later unmasked as a fake Vietnam veteran), Cockburn sets up cameras in the jungle and is assisted by his pyrotechnics expert, Cody, to create explosions which are designed to bring verisimilitude to the film. The cast is ordered by their newly self-actualized director to take a trek through the jungle with a hastily patched-together script as their guide. I realize that 'Thunder' is not to be taken seriously at all but how do the filmmakers actually capture the footage which is later turned into an Academy Award winning documentary at the film's end?  They would have to have thousands upon thousands of cameras placed in every nook and cranny of the jungle to capture what the actors are doing.  I assume they later used surveillance footage from the Dragons' own cameras when the cast were being held captive in the heroin dealers' lair. But even so, Tayback and Cockburn's idea to create the documentary is too ludicrous for even a silly film such as this.  There is little to gain by rehashing Thunder's amateurish plot.  Suffice it to say it involves the kidnapping of Stiller's Speedman character along with Cody and Tayback (Nick Nolte) by a goofy Flaming Dragons gang.  The rest of the cast must earn their mettle by saving their buddies from the gang, despite the fact that all their weapons are mere props.  'Thunder' is supposed to be a satire on action films but by the time Stiller and his gang win their brownie points, you can't tell if this is really a satire or simply a bad action picture.Stiller's main problem is a lack of imagination. For example, he'll come up with the bit about Kirk Lazarus dying his skin black and refusing to break character until we almost reach the film's end. How much can we take of Downey doing his shtick ad infinitum? The same goes for Stiller's 'Simple Jack'. According to Stiller, 'Jack' is not making fun of mentally handicapped people per se but rather actors like Dustin Hoffman who portray a caricature of an idiot savant in 'Rainman'. Stiller doesn't seem to realize that the idiot 'Simple Jack', is a far cry from Hoffman's brainy eccentric. Some people might find a Goofy Gumby such as 'Simple Jack' to be funny but after about ten minutes, can't we move on to something else? 'Thunder' intentionally is designed to be in bad taste but occasionally the films' scenarists ruin the comic tone by going too far. One such moment is when they actually kill off the director Cockburn; another moment is when Speedman kills a lovable Panda.I wouldn't go so far as to say that 'Tropic Thunder' is the worst film of 2008 but it comes close. The make-up department however does deserve an award for making Tom Cruise unrecognizable as a sleazy, Hollywood producer.",2,13,25,29 December 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Pacman meets Tarrantino meets MTV meets Batman, the 60s TV Show
","For those who have been trying to figure out which media influenced the scenarists of 'Scott Pilgrim', how about MTV, old 80s video games, comic books and Quentin Tarrantino? There's one other that may only occur to the older population watching this film: Batman, the 60s TV show. Remember all the zany titles which would appear whenever something dramatic happened (titles such as 'Sock!', 'Pow!', 'Bong!')? A similar technique is employed here with Scott Pilgrim but the titles are often inserted for a more farcical comic book effect (for example, when a phone rings, the title 'ring' zips across the screen). One or two word titles are also utilized to describe each character (so if the narrator mentions someone is 'clueless', it's also mentioned again as a title description). 'Pilgrim' wins points for its original visual style, featuring nifty camera work and spectacular special effects which often makes one feel as if one is inside of a crazy video game.Unfortunately, Pilgrim's story is as bland as the title character. Michael Cera (playing another geeky role) is awful as a 22 year old garage band musician who first dates a perky high school student ('Knives Chau') but then dumps her for the more mysterious Ramona Flowers (winningly played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Cera's Pilgrim can do nothing more than act like a love sick puppy dog opposite the much more aggressive Flowers from beginning to end.In real life, the enigmatic Flowers would never go for the wimpy Pilgrim who always seems to be kow-towing to her during their many platonic interactions. Somehow, Flowers decides to give Pilgrim a second chance after he defeats her 7th ex-boyfriend Gideon (Pilgrim's ex-bands' new sponsor) in a long-winded fight scene (Flowers is not really 'attracted' to boyfriend #7; actually, he's planted a micro-chip in her brain causing her to fall for him!).That's basically the crux of the Pilgrim plot—our 'hero' must go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation. The seven confrontations (which include a woman, one of Ramona's bi-flings) are nothing more than a device to stage a series of silly fight scenes reminiscent of Tarrantino's stylized sword fights in 'Kill Bill'. None of it makes any sense, especially when perky and cute Knives attacks Ramona out of jealousy over her relationship with Pilgrim. Should I also mention that Pilgrim is stabbed to death, goes to limbo but discovers he has an 'extra life' that enables him to return to earth so he can do battle with Gideon all over again.None of the supporting players exhibit any charm. Pilgrim's gay roommate, for example, puts Pilgrim down when he advises Knives not to get involved with him during their first meet up. And then there's Pilgrim's drummer and ex-girlfriend Kim Pine; why exactly does she have a dour expression on her face throughout the film? There's also little humor in the film—one attempt (if you can call it that) occurs with Ramona's third ex, Todd; he's stymied when he's stripped of his 'vegan psychic' powers by the 'vegan police' who have discovered that he's been putting half and half (non-vegan milk substitute) in his coffee.In the end, one can only conclude that 'Pilgrim' is a pointless endeavor. Should we regard 'Pilgrim' as an honorable character after he engages in these violent confrontations with a group of one-dimensional, comic book villains? Even worse is how emasculated Pilgrim comes off as he is led around on a leash by a much more hip Ramona. This is a film strictly for teenagers. Its failure to appeal to an older, more sophisticated crowd spelled doom at the box office in the American market.",4,5,11,27 March 2011
Inside Out," Enjoyable look inside pre-teen's mind also needs a bit more of a malevolent antagonist
","'Inside Out,' is director and co-writer Pete Docter's Pixar computer animated comedy-drama set primarily inside the brain of a troubled pre-teen, the film's protagonist, Riley. The 'outside' story begins with a content Riley and her parents moving from their idyllic home in Minnesota to San Francisco where Riley is unable to cope with her new environment, causing havoc inside her conscious mind represented by 'headquarters' run by her five emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger.All of Riley's memories are represented by colored orbs which are stored in vast storage areas inside her mind when she falls asleep. However, a set of 'core memories' are controlled by the emotions via a control console, which power a set of islands (resembling amusement parks) that represent aspects of Riley's personality.The main conflict emerges between Joy and Sadness, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler as a perky, bundle of energy who seeks to contain Sadness who continually imbues the orbs with a depressing blue hue whenever she touches them. Oddly, Sadness is depicted as a dumpy overweight girl with a passive-aggressive personality—hardly the stuff of true melancholia. Nonetheless the tussle between the two proves to be the welcome comic relief in relation to Riley's depressing circumstances in the 'outside world.'The plot picks up as we break into Act 2: during a tussle over the creation of one of Riley's new core memories, both Joy and Sadness along with the other core memories, are accidentally ejected out of Riley's 'memory tube,' into the vast, uncharted wilderness of Riley's mind. The goal is for Joy and Sadness to make it back to headquarters before Riley has a total breakdown (the pre-teen decides to run away after feeling rejected at school).Meanwhile Riley's 'islands' are beginning to crumble with Fear, Disgust and Anger left to run the show back at headquarters. Unfortunately the scenarists here are not as successful at assigning distinctive personalities to the three bumbling emotions as they are with Joy and Sadness. I can't remember much about Fear, Disgust and Anger, and due to their lack of distinctiveness, part of the comic potential of the narrative, is lost.Just like 'Toy Story,' where a child's companions find themselves far away from 'home,' Riley's emotions also find themselves struggling to get back to 'headquarters,' which represent a home base for the pre-teen's emotions. Most of the Act II machinations are food for thought for adults who can revel in all the clever, satirical asides the film's scenarists proffer up. But there's also the neat 'Bing Bong,' an hybrid elephant-dolphin creature, who aids Joy and Sadness as well as providing comforting grist for the mill for juvenile viewers. The fate of 'Bing Bong,' however, proves more affecting for adults than kids (he's ends up hero but also the forgotten child playmate consigned to Riley's subconscious, after sacrificing himself for the benefit of Joy and Sadness, in their last chance to make it 'home.'The rest of Act II consists of a set of clever, satirical asides highlighting different realms of the internal world (there's a 'Land of the Imagination,' 'Realm of the Abstract,' and the dark 'Subconscious'). The animators, in particular, get to show off their craft as they depict our protagonists cast about in different dimensions in the Land of the Abstract. The scenarists have their fun with show business mocking the machinations in a dream production factory. There's also a nod to Stephen King, when a sinister Clown ends up running amok. When Joy and Sadness finally do make it back to headquarters via a 'Train of Thought,' the perky Joy gives up on her monopoly of feelings and concedes that without some Sadness, their pre-teen charge cannot function effectively. If 'Inside Out' suffers from anything, it probably has to do with the lack of singular, compelling antagonist. While Riley's possible breakdown in the real world serves as a compelling force for part of the narrative, Joy and Sadness's conflict only is good for the comic relief. Sadness is more a wayward friend to Joy than a malevolent entity. What might have been more interesting is if Riley had been pitted against a bully at school and we could see how their different minds operated. The closing credits give us the finest moments in the film—there we see the potential for exploring different minds (including the howlingly funny mind of a cat!).'Inside Out,' is enjoyable for both kids and adults. The happy ending, where parents and child have their reconciliation, is rather predictable. But there are enough clever ideas, illustrated both visually and through dialogue, which is worth the price of admission.",6,5,27,20 July 2015
The Duchess," The Duke gets short shrift but the Duchess never bores!
","The Duchess is based on the true life story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire who married William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire in England in 1774. The facts of Georgiana's life form the basis of the film's plot. We're introduced to the Duchess when she is 17 years old; her family (including Georgiana) is excited that she is being married off to the Duke. After the marriage, she's soon disappointed that the Duke never talks to her and appears to be emotionally distant. Despite this, the Duchess becomes extremely popular in aristocratic circles and eventually involves herself in politics, campaigning for Whig candidates and supporting liberal causes.Time passes and Georgiana has two daughters but is unable to produce a male heir. The Duke bitterly resents her for this. On a trip to Bath, the Duchess meets Lady Elizabeth Foster who is a victim of domestic violence—her husband has forbidden her to see her children again and she has been put out of their house. With nowhere to go, Georgiana takes pity on Lady Elizabeth and persuades the Duke to let her stay with them. In a move to get her children back, Lady Elizabeth sleeps with the Duke and Georgiana feels betrayed and orders her to leave. But the Duke overrules her and the three end up living together until the Duchess's death many years later.Meanwhile, Georgiana has fallen for Charles Grey, later to become Prime Minister. She wants to make a 'deal' with the Duke, allowing her to see Charles while he continues his adulterous relationship with Lady Elizabeth. The Duke is so outraged by the Duchess's proposition that he ends up raping her. The Duchess ends up pregnant and finally produces a son. But the Duchess cannot stay away from Charles and she ends up pregnant. After a daughter, Eliza, is born, the Duke sends the child away to live with Grey's family. In the film's climax, the Duke demands that Georgiana return to live with the family but she decides to live with Charles. After the Duke threatens to bar her from seeing all of her children ever again, she changes her mind about Grey and returns to her husband and children and lives out the rest of her days on the family estate.Some critics and posters here have complained that The Duchess is a story that we've seen too many times before. Maybe so, but it never bores. All the plot points are covered effectively as the protagonist's journey is etched in stark relief. There's the inciting incident where the Duchess learns of her betrothal to the Duke. The break into the Second Act occurs when the Duchess's leaves her 'ordinary' world and marries the Duke. The Midpoint where the stakes are raised, occurs when the Duchess invites Lady Elizabeth into their household leading to further complications. In the words of Christopher Vogler, the protagonist approaches 'the inmost cave' at the end of Act II where the protagonist must undergo an ordeal. In The Duchess, Georgiana attempts to defy the Duke and ends up being raped. This is her 'All is lost' moment or 'Dark Moment of the Soul'.The Dark moment is actually a delayed crisis. It's a huge setback but the protagonist must regroup and once again must push forward. In the beginning of Act III, the protagonist must have some kind of respite before pushing forward into the final battle. In The Duchess, Georgiana's respite is the birth of her son. The Duke's double standard perhaps pushes Georgiana forward into the final battle. She's determined to have her affair with Charles Grey despite her husband's damning prohibition. The Duke however turns the tables on her. He forces her to choose her children over her relationship with Grey and in the end, she surrenders and returns to the family.Because this is a true story, Georgiana's victory is bittersweet. Due to the time she lived in, women were not permitted the same rights as men. The hypocrisy of the Duke is evident: he is allowed to live in an adulterous relationship with Lady Elizabeth under the same roof but the Duchess is not allowed to see her lover. Nonetheless, the protagonist must 'seize the stone' and take possession of what was being sought in the 'special world' (in this case, Georgiana's quest for the special world of freedom and self-actualization). Since this is 18th century England, the Duchess doesn't exactly 'change the world' but at least she gets her children back, so in that sense she has restored some semblance of balance within her world.I'm not in agreement with those who disparage Keira Knightley's performance as the Duchess. I found her to be believable and compelling as a woman who heroically asserted herself in the male-dominated society of the time. Ralph Fiennes didn't have much to work with in the role of the Duke. One gets the feeling that the film's writers didn't know much about the Duke of Devonshire historically so they decided to turn him into a stock villain. There was an attempt to mitigate the character's unsympathetic portrait at the end, softening him up by depicting him as being slightly more sympathetic toward the Duchess but it was a little too late. We needed to know more about the Duke—a more nuanced portrait. All we get to know about him is that he liked his dogs and often complained about the food on his plate. And is there any evidence that he actually raped his wife? I think that scene was inserted strictly for dramatic effect but I doubt that it happened.The Duchess might not be the most original 'period piece' out there, but its focus on domestic violence and how women must cope with it is as relevant today as it was back then.",7,1,1,24 May 2009
Quantum of Solace," Bond as Killing Machine
","After being extremely disappointed with 'Casino Royale' (with an ordinary poker game as its primary action sequence), I was happy to see that the producers of Quantum of Solace decided to bring back 'Bond' to its action-packed roots. I am still trying to get used to Daniel Craig as Bond however. He's about the opposite of the urbane, sophisticated and witty character initially developed by the greatest Bond of them all, Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is closer to a Steve McQueen type but unable to capture McQueen's true 'bad boy' persona. Craig's interest in women is minimal (he spends a very short time in bed in Quantum of Solace). In this new version of Bond, he's a trained killer who rarely shows emotion (there is a brief scene where he cradles the head of an associate who's been shot) but for the most part, Craig's Bond is as cold and ruthless as the villains he's trying to hunt down. While not very handsome, Craig is in extremely good shape and handles all the action sequences with gusto.There are plenty of excellent action sequences in Quantum of Solace which will keep you entertained. These sequences run the gamut from car, boat and plane chases to a dazzlingly choreographed face off between Bond and the primary villain's henchmen at an opera house.Olga Kurylenko as Camille is a more proactive 'Bond girl' than usual. She seeks to take revenge on General Medrano (Quantum's #2 villain) who killed her family members when she was a child. Bond 'rescues' her when she finds herself alone on boat with the General and his goons. Later she's angry with Bond for 'rescuing' her, upsetting her plans to kill Medrano on the boat (it's never made clear how Camille could kill Medrano without getting killed herselfand also how would she have been able to kill him as it did not appear she was carrying a weapon).Dominic Greene is the primary villain played by Mathieu Amalric. He's a sleazy businessman masquerading as an environmental crusader. Bond discovers that instead of trying to aid the local populace, he's dammed off all their water causing a drought. At the end of the film, Bond captures Greene and leaves him in the desert with a can of (what looks like) draino (presumably which he can use to commit suicide). I was expecting something more dramatic such as Bond destroying the dam and having the water cascade into the drought stricken area, replenishing the water supply and killing Greene in the process.Judi Dench is excellent as usual as 'M' but I still miss the wonderful gadgets Bond uses to defeat his opponents. The signature 007 music comes on at the end but why not use it at the beginning too? In a nod to be relevant to today, the opening theme song unfortunately is greatly influenced by rap music. It's basically a tuneless song and detracts from the film's opening.For now, the James Bond franchise appears to be successfully emulating the non-stop action stunts of the Jason Bourne series. But the producers should be forewarned: start giving Bond more of a personality or the Bond fan base will start clamoring for Daniel Craig's replacement.",6,6,8,30 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," More hokum from the Coen Brothers
","More semi-entertaining hokum from the Coen Brothers. It's quite curious that the mass killings by a sophisticated serial killer only garners the attention of one hick small-town sheriff and his staff. What happened to the FBI? Yes the DEA is mentioned but we never see them. What happened to all the media coverage? The serial killers picture would probably have made the national news and he should have been on the FBI's 10 most wanted list but we see none of that. Yes I know it's supposed to be 1980 but still the pursuit of this fugitive would have been a big story. The reason why the Coens don't show that is because they've created a totally unrealistic character that exists totally in their specious imagination. In real life there would have been hundreds of law enforcement agents tracking this guy but we never get a sense of that in this laughable scenario.Although the story is supposed to be 25 years before our own time, the killer seems more like a specially trained Matt Damon CIA agent straight out of the Bourne Identity. He's so good that he knows how to create the perfect diversion to obtain the proper drugs and has the medical training to remove a bullet from his leg. He almost seems like a superman, gunning down anyone who comes into his path without a whimper from law enforcement. What's more he always seems to know how to find anybody he plans on eliminating. We also never completely understand his motives for killing the many innocent people he comes across. Is he simply a thrill killer who enjoys terrorizing the public at large? We never really learn anything about his past history. Usually there's a discussion amongst law enforcement officials detailing a killer's background--we never get a sense of that during this movie.Just as we must have a Superman for an antagonist, we must also have a Superman for a protagonist. Josh Brolin, a welder who lives in a trailer park, seems like the perfect match for the evil Chigurh. Brolin's 'Llewelyn Moss' shows absolutely no fear taking $2 million from Mexicans, mostly all massacred at a crime scene. But suddenly, he has a pang of conscience which propels him back to the crime scene with a gallon of water to help one of the dying drug dealers. The average person would have called the police had they come upon such a scene; if he was amoral (as he is initially depicted), then he certainly wouldn't have been so stupid to return to the scene and put himself in such jeopardy. When he does return to the scene of the slaughter, suddenly he's a superman again, eluding a truck full of drug dealers shooting at him, swimming in the rapids and fending off a vicious dog who swims after him in the river. Then he devises this incredible plan where he stuffs the $2 million bucks in a ventilator shaft at the motel, has the drug dealers occupy his motel room (didn't they also have a transponder and would have discovered the bag in the shaft?) and has the serial killer eliminate the drug dealers and evades being eliminated himself.Meanwhile, Tommie Lee Jones, our hick sheriff as well as all the other stereotypical Texans depicted in this film, seem powerless against this maniacal killer. One gets the impression that just about all ordinary folk who lived in the South in 1980 are a bunch of dumb yokels. To be fair, the Coens also depict their hired killers as dumb yokels too. Woody Harrelson suddenly comes out of nowhere, is presented as some fantastic hired killer who's going to track down the serial killer and within half an hour, ends up the killer's hostage in a hotel room and is blown away (not before however he just happens to be strolling along the bridge near the US-Mexican Border and just happens to glance downward and discovers the bag full of money! What a coincidence!)The Coens' view of life is basically nihilistic and pessimistic. What they're saying here is that evil is stronger than those with a moral compass and that we live in a universe where we have no control over random events (even the serial killer is almost killed himself in a random car accident at the end of the film). Sure, bad things sometimes happen to good people but those who have a moral purpose in this world are not ineffectual pushovers (as depicted by a character like the Sheriff who basically concedes that he will be the serial killer's next victim and that he is powerless to stop him). When the deck is stacked as it is here in this movie, evil is the clear winner. But in reality, it's not so easy for the bad guys to walk away without being brought to the bar of justice. The Coens are trying to say that we are only observers here--that sometimes men are powerless in the face of evil. There is nothing profound about their observations; and their strategy is dishonest because their antagonist is way too smart for his opponents. When the opponents are nothing but a bunch of stereotypical hicks and losers of every stripe, it's easy to understand why the bad guy walks away with nothing more than a broken arm carefully held in place by a self-constructed sling.",4,6,12,22 February 2008
District 9," Alien Nation meets Waiting for Guffman meets The Fly
","Right away 'District 9', with the giant alien mother ship hovering in the sky, reminded me of the earlier movie and TV series 'Alien Nation'. That TV Series actually was an improvement over the original movie as the characters had some wonderful idiosyncrasies and you could easily identify with them as they represented a new (and also familiar) ethnic group. Not so with District 9. The aliens look part insect, part crab and have an unintelligible language consisting mainly of clicks and other weird sounds (somehow the aliens can easily understand English but we viewers must watch subtitles; it's not very clear whether humans in the story can understand the 'prawns' very well—you never see any interpreters assisting any of the soldiers when they enter District 9 and attempt to evict the prawns). Even worse is the fact that the prawns are not a very likable bunch as they are scavengers and as we are informed from the outset, constantly committing crimes against the human population which leads for the call for them to be relocated.The first half hour of 'District 9' is devoted to what I would call a mockumentary (similar to the film 'Waiting for Guffman'). The film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and various people are interviewed providing the back story of the alien arrival and subsequent colonization on earth. The filmmakers were lucky to find an abandoned shantytown in Soweto where set designers ably created a massive junkyard inhabited by the prawns. During the mockumentary, it's established that some kind of command module floated down to earth from the mother ship but for some reason, after 20 years, it's never been located inside District 9. I would think that if an alien ship actually landed here on earth, there would have been a huge team of international investigators searching for that module and no doubt finding it after a short search.District 9 becomes more confusing when we're introduced to the protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe. He's a bureaucrat who also happens to be the son-in-law of the director at MNU (Multinational United), the corporate group of military contractors who have been awarded a contract to relocate the prawns to a cleaner district outside of Johannesburg. I could never understand why the company needs to have the prawns EACH sign an eviction notice before being relocated. The explanation is that it's a 'cover' but how could the company possibly have 1.8 million uncooperative creatures sign an agreement? If they kept the operation closed to the public, there would have been no need for those eviction notices. Wikus looks ridiculous traipsing around trying to collect signatures and he's such a buffoon of a character that one wonders if the filmmakers were actually going for comedy toward the beginning of their narrative. Certainly the prawns' ravenous desire for cat food adds to the comedy and a group of Nigerian criminals also get short shrift here too as they have no regrets about living inside the odious District 9 and scamming the prawns for alien weapons (which they don't know how to use) in exchange for cat food.The mockumentary is pretty much dispensed with as we break into the second act of the story. A prawn and his son have been working for years developing some kind of fuel to power the command module back to the mother ship. Wikus manages to ingest some of the black goo and much like the movie 'The Fly', he grows a prawn hand. The bad guys from MNU (they're all bad!) decide to cut Wikus up and sell his body parts to the highest bidder (there's some mumble jumble talk about how his 50-50 human/prawn DNA will sell very well on the black market). Wikus of course escapes and begs for help from the prawn and his son inside the underground module. The prawn can possibly help him in three years after returning to the mother ship but only if they can get the container containing the black goo from MNU headquarters which Wikus had confiscated when he first found it. Much like Terminator 2, Wikus and the prawn break into the impenetrable building and grab the container, only to be chased by MNU's top killer.Wikus is then captured by the Nigerians but manages to escape by fitting himself into a giant robotic fighting machine (shades of Transformers and Iron Man!). Our Bad guy killer from MNU manages to finally disable the robot and Wikus falls to the ground almost unconscious. Wikus however is saved when a bunch of prawns rip the MNU guy's head off (fortunately there are no close-ups). Oh yeah—the prawn and his son use the goo to power the module back to the mother ship. Everyone's thrilled when the ship leaves our atmosphere. Back to the mockumentary where we learn the prawns have been resettled.From a confused and awkward stab at comedy, District 9 tries to get real emotional when Wikus and the Prawn and his son BOND! Suddenly the prawns are actually sensitive creatures and Wikus is a hero for saving them! None of it works, since we haven't been invested in the unsavory Prawns from the beginning nor do we care about Wikus, despite all the pseudo-heroic machinations.If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that the script was patched together by the director and a co-writer on the fly and that the director really didn't have much of a clue as to what he was doing as he went along. I'll confess that the editing team saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Nonetheless, it's clear that the filmmakers tried to straddle between the worlds of both comedy and pathos and ended up with a hybrid of pure goofiness.",2,24,47,3 June 2010
Bridesmaids," Passive-aggressive character types inhabit inconsistently funny and often crude comic spectacle
","Many people compared 'Bridesmaids' to 'The Hangover' but in terms of the comic tone of its characters, I found it much more similar to a recent indie film, 'Cyrus'. Both films attempt to get laughs by introducing a series of passive-aggressive types. The passive-aggressive credentials of the film's protagonist, Annie Walker, is established very early on when she sleeps with a boyfriend who also is afflicted with a passive-aggressive personality. When the boyfriend aggressively declares he has a rule about not sleeping over, instead of acting angrily, Annie lamely declares, 'you're funny in the morning.'The interesting thing about the passive-aggressive type is that the passivity masks a deeply repressed reservoir of anger. When the anger finally rises to the surface, it often comes out as a challenge, marked by a hurried retreat. We see this when Annie and her best friend Lillian (the bride to be) attempt to take an exercise class in the park without paying. When they're found out by the instructor, they run off with the excuse that they can no longer afford the high price of admission (despite actually costing $12).Annie's lack of self-esteem is on display when she turns off her customers by telling them that you can't trust anybody, while working as a salesperson at the jewelry store. As is often the case with a lot of the characters here, there's a thin line between the unsavoriness of their blatant aggression and viewing that aggression as humorous.Often the language of the passive-aggressive character is cloaked in overly diplomatic terms; the underlying sub-text of course, is an insult. For example, when Annie's mother (played by Jill Clayburgh in her last film role) tries to put a positive spin on Annie's negative life situation, she relates a story of a floundering gay prostitute she met at an AA meeting, concluding that 'hitting bottom is a good thing.'Screenwriters Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumulo try to mine as many laughs as possible from Lillian's assorted bridesmaids with mixed results. Lillian's cousin Rita can't stand her 'disgusting' three teenagers and the joke about semen being all over the house is too crude to be funny. Becca, Lillian's friend from work and Megan, the groom's sister, ineptly conclude that Annie isn't single when they spot her next to two successive creepy guys who they should have known she would have no interest in. Little is done with newly married Becca character throughout the film but Megan (Melissa McCarthy from the 'Mike & Molly' TV series) proves to be one of the more amusing aggressive characters in the passive-aggressive pantheon. Megan not only can bond with a dolphin while on vacation but isn't afraid to make her sexual wants known (in spying one particular tall guy at the wedding, she proclaims, 'I'm going to climb that like a tree').It's Helen, the snippy Trophy wife of the groom's boss, who turns out to be Bridesmaid's central antagonist. Again, the dialectic between her passive and aggressive side is evident when we first meet her. Helen aggressively attempts to steal Annie's thunder as they lock horns with their back and forth toasts to Lillian at the engagement party (the joke becomes tiresome as it goes on for much too long). There's more silly shenanigans during the tennis game, when we view Helen and Annie blasting one another with tennis balls in slow motion. Only Helen's completely lame, passive remark to the stepson's expletive ('put a quarter in the smear jar') hits the mark! Annie begins to lose Lillian's affections when she brings the bridesmaids to the Brazilian restaurant and most of them end up with food poisoning later on at the fitting room. It's a scene that doesn't work at all as it's too divorced from any kind of recognizable reality (both Megan and Lillian end up defecating in inappropriate places including a sink and outside in the middle of the street). Annie's meltdown on the plane to Vegas proves to be only slightly more amusing. Most of it relies on Annie's face-off with the flight attendant while she's intoxicated. The bit with Annie in sunglasses pretending to be a first-class passenger is something a real drunk would do—but when Annie exclaims that there's a 'colonial woman' churning butter out on the wing—that is truly a line of inspired lunacy! Meanwhile we do take some pleasure in Megan's vindication over her insistence that the man sitting next to her on the plane indeed turns out to be an air marshal.There's one more truly amusing moment before 'Bridesmaids' devolves into sentimental romantic comedy—that's Annie's confrontation with the young woman back at the jewelry store, resulting in her being fired (in substance: Young lady: Did you take your Xanax? Annie: You have four boyfriends—have fun having a baby at your prom).Once Annie has her final meltdown at Lillian's shower, Lillian expresses her true feelings toward Annie (how she's truly screwed up the pre-wedding preparations). Events are now set in motion where whatever comedy remains in this very spotty laugh-fest, is lost. Megan drops her animosity toward Annie and conscripts her to help find Lillian who's gotten cold feet about going through with the wedding. I haven't mentioned Officer Rhodes as he's the least interesting character in the film. After Rhodes reluctantly agrees to help locate Lillian (he traces through her cell phone messages), it's only inevitable that he and Annie will end up together after Annie's initial sabotage of their relationship.'Bridesmaids' probably has gotten more accolades than it deserves as it's one of the few films today that features an ensemble of women in comic roles. Unfortunately those roles are formulaic, as the passive-aggressive types proffered up here, could probably fit into any situation featuring contemporary mores. Occasionally there's a clever line or two but the humor quickly devolves into silly slapstick or outright crudity. Perhaps with some tighter editing, 'Bridesmaids' might have proved more palatable in the end.",3,2,4,12 August 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," In the Anderson oeuvre, there's a lot to see, but he has hardly anything to say
","Wes Anderson is back at it again with another one of his quirkfests, this time entirely convincing most critics that he's crafted a masterpiece. Most are mesmerized by the production design, which truly deserves an Academy Award. Anderson opted to use miniatures for wide shots of the hotel and did extensive research for the interiors. The Görlitzer Warenhaus, a defunct German department store which survived World War II, was a stand-in for the Grand Budapest's lobby. Anderson's cinematography, which features all kinds of shots from unusual angles was probably another reason the critics were so impressed with the film (take note of the prison escape scene in particular). But I believe critic Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gets it right when she concludes that Anderson's narrative, is wholly one-note in nature: 'This meticulously appointed doll house of a movie just went on and on, making me want to smash many miniature plates of plaster food in frustration.'The narrative begins when a famous author in 1985 recounts a visit he made to the then decaying Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968; he then met the owner, Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who recounts his days as a lobby boy at the hotel in 1932. The hotel is located in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a remnant of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. One is reminded of the Marx Brother's take on their own fictional Balkan Republic, 'Freedonia,' but alas in Anderson's 'homage,' there are no laughs!Ralph Fiennes plays M. Gustave, the concierge at the hotel, who takes Zero, the young lobby boy (who is the narrator of the story in his old age), under his wing. Gustave, an admitted bisexual, has been having a very brief affair with the elderly owner of the hotel, 'Madame D,' who soon dies under mysterious circumstances. She bequeaths a rare painting, 'Boy with Apple,' which enrages the Madame's son, Dmitri (Adrian Brody), who insists Gustave is not entitled to it. Despite Dmitri's opposition, Gustave steals the painting anyway (aided by Zero), and returns it to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where he places it in the hotel safe. Gustave makes Zero his heir, in return for his help.The Madame's secretary, Serge X, is forced into accusing Gustave of murdering the old lady and Gustave ends up in prison. Gustave remarks that he earned the respect of hardened criminals by 'beating the sh-t out of one of them for challenging his 'virility.' To make a long story short, Gustave digs his way out of prison using tools hidden in cakes baked by Zero's fiancée, Agatha. He and Zero are pursued by an assassin hired by Dmitri, Jopling (William Dafoe) who ends up murdering Serge. Jopling gets his comeuppance at the hands of Zero, who pushes him off a cliff. If this isn't enough, there's also a gunfight with Dmitri and the discovery of a second will inside the painting, proving Gustave's innocence. The reason, most of this hokum isn't funny, is because Anderson's antagonists are unlikeable. Take for example Dmitri—when he first encounters Gustave he calls him a 'fagg-t' and slaps him in the face. While Anderson attempts to lighten the scene up when other characters start hitting each other in the face, the damage cannot be undone: Dmitri remains an unpleasant villain throughout. In real farce, we experience the outrage without the consequences. But there are consequences aplenty when Serge is murdered up at the rectory. Even Gustave's death during the epilogue, at the hands of those fascist-like soldiers on the train, sounds the wrong note for a film that should be light-hearted (just like 'Duck Soup'). And why all those anachronistic expletives throughout the movie? Why must the elegant Gustave say things that he beat the 'sh-t' out of that prisoner? Anderson relies on these out-of-character remarks, to obtain a few cheap laughs.Dana Stevens wonders in Slate Magazine, what Anderson is really trying to say here: 'As played with a melancholy rakishness by the handsomer-than-ever Fiennes, M. Gustave is one of Anderson's more memorable creations—but he's stranded in a movie that, for all its gorgeous frills and furbelows (including a lush musical score by Alexandre Desplat and a surfeit of charming cameos from Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray), never seemed to me to be quite sure what it was about. Youth, age, rivalry, and mentorship? Nostalgia for a lost way of life? The ineluctable slaughterhouse of 20th-century European history? These are big, dark themes, ideas that the director (who also wrote the screenplay, with a story assist from his friend Hugo Guinness) seems both obsessed by and game to explore. But somehow Anderson never quite lets himself (or his characters, or by extension, us) get to the deepest, darkest places those paths might lead.' Stevens gets it right when she concludes that with Anderson 'everything remains in that familiar register of chilly, stylish remove.'Ultimately, one can never care for any of Anderson's characters. They are written intentionally not to be taken seriously. Take Agatha and her death from 'the Prussian Grippe.' Not only does Agatha die but so does her infant son. Agatha is supposed to be one of the sympathetic characters, but here Anderson bumps her off too with a cheap aside.Why do so many people find Anderson's vision so enchanting? Perhaps it's the pleasure they feel when his quirky misfits triumph over a coterie of reactionaries (as the evil Dmitri fails to deprive Gustave of his inheritance). Underneath all the slapstick, is standard melodrama (the bad guys getting their comeuppance), mixed with a touch of black humor. In the Anderson oeuvre, there's a lot to see, but he has hardly anything to say.",4,7,12,20 January 2015
The Favourite," Quirky director Lanthimos can't decide whether he's laughing at or sympathizing with his characters in early 18th century tale of royal shenanigans
","Deborah Davis is the screenwriter of The Favourite, best described as a black comedy focused principally on the reign of England's Queen Anne in the early 18th century. Davis began writing the screenplay in 1998 so kudos to her in persisting in getting this made. You can tell that there is a serious underside to the narrative but at the hands of director Yorgos Lanthimos, his weird farcical take is imprinted all over it.
The Favourite is a story about a love triangle involving the Queen and two women vying for her attention and power within the Court. It's very loosely based on fact and Lanthimos focuses on the most salacious aspects, attempting to convince us there was an actual intimate (physical) relationship between the principals. The majority of historians would probably disagree including Winston Churchill who wrote about one of the principals in the love triangle, his ancestor, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.
When we're first introduced to Queen Anne, it becomes apparent that she's a seriously disturbed woman, who has endured the deaths of 17 children (she keeps 17 rabbits that represent each of her deceased children). Today the Queen might have been diagnosed as bipolar, prone to frequent bursts of uncontrollable anger which members of the Court end up obsequiously enduring.
Sarah is initially the Queen's primary adviser (as well as lover); today she would probably be seen as a conservative as she wholeheartedly supports the war effort with France. The political opposition is represented by Robert Harley, a member of Parliament and wealthy landowner.
We're soon introduced to Abigail Hill, a distant cousin of Sarah, who must work as a scullery maid after her father loses his fortune due to gambling debts. Abigail seizes the opportunity to ingratiate herself with the Queen (craftily massaging Anne's inflamed legs with herbs), eventually usurping Sarah's position as lady-in-waiting. Marley uses Abigail to spy on Sarah to gain insight into her schemes.
The plot takes a nasty turn when Abigail poisons Sarah, who then falls off her horse while taking a trip, and sustains a large cut on her face. Anne makes it clear she no longer wants to speak with Sarah. The Queen rewards Abigail by granting Nobleman Samuel Masham's wish to marry her-thus restoring Abigail's aristocratic standing.
Sarah blackmails the Queen by threatening to release letters of their secret (lesbian) relationship. Despite changing her mind and burning the letters, the Queen ends up banishing Sarah from the Court for life.
All of these shenanigans might not have been too bad, but unfortunately Lanthimos doesn't know whether he's laughing at or sympathizing with his characters. The narrative morphs into an unpleasant hybrid of some believable historical fiction coupled with a coterie of buffoonish, cartoon-like characters. One particularly ridiculous scene has Abigail wrestling with Masham out in the woods. Lanthimos attempts to get mileage out of all the fawning sycophants who are constantly forced to kow-tow to their ruler-we get the point about the fawning early on and what it ultimately amounts to is massive overkill!
Olivia Colman gives a standout performance as the over the top queen along with Rachel Weisz, who presents the Duchess of Marlborough as wonderfully cold and calculating. Emma Stone as Abigail perhaps has the best scene with Colman at film's end: the Queen humiliates Abigail after she mistreats one of her precious rabbits, revealing herself to be just as cold and sadistic as her banished rival, Sarah. Scenes like that are few and far between in The Favourite, as its quirky director seeks instead to find laughs where few exist.",4,6,15,26 December 2018
Revolutionary Road," Grim put-down of 50s Suburbia
","Instead of blaming Hollywood for their self-congratulatory tales of suburban angst, why not blame a gullible public? For it's the public that laps up these specious and false tales. Why was 'The Graduate' such a success? Because it gave the average person the right to feel that 'I'm better than you'. It's easy to sneer at a Mrs. Robinson, an adult woman who manipulates the emotions of Dustin Hoffman's 'innocent' college student, Benjamin. She's willing to not only ruin his life but also that of her daughters. Her narcissism knows no bounds. In a nutshell, she's a character who's easy to hate. Hollywood has the formula down pat: give us an innocent rebel who 'doesn't fit in' and have him or her pitted against the 'monster'—the hissing mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama has evolved into the 'conformist' post-war suburbanite.In Revolutionary Road there is nary a laugh to be heard throughout the entire 118 minutes of the film. No one seems to like themselves at all. At the film's beginning, the suburbanites' community theater production is a complete failure. And the worst performance in the play is given by our protagonist, Kate Winslett's April Wheeler. Heaven forbid people can have fun performing in a community theater production or even laugh at themselves if the production is a little off. No, the point is made from the outset that our community of post-war suburbanites is one of 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness'. This is the profound 'epiphany' that the makers of Revolutionary Road want us to experience and they are going to reveal these 'profound insights' to us. But the truth is, there is no such thing as suburban 'angst'—back then and now the vast majority of people have egos—in short, they like themselves! Those who have written negative things about Revolutionary Road seem to agree that there is little character development when it comes to April Wheeler. When Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) tells April that she always felt she was someone 'special', the camera comes in close and we see the blank expression on her face. April is not to be blamed for her depression—society has made her into what she is. It's a trite idea that people are not responsible for their own lives but that's what Revolutionary Road serves up here. April is a Bohemian, a free spirit whose main goal is to move to Paris. For half the movie, her plan of liberation is about the only thing we find out about her. Certainly we find out nothing about her personality vis-à-vis her children—they are barely seen in this film and can be best thought of as a set of props in this overblown passion play.Additional 'props' can be found in the characters of the Wheelers' neighbors, Shep and Millie Campbell. When April and Frank tell them of their plans to move to Paris, they later castigate them in the comfort of their own bedroom as 'immature'. The film's scenarists wish us to identify the Campbells as being arrogant and part of the overall suburban 'emptiness'. Shep loses further points when he beds April just before her final breakdown.One wonders why Frank is so easily convinced by April to chuck his house and job and run off to Paris with her and the kids. After all, he screams at her for her illusions of becoming a great actress in the opening scene. But somehow she appeals to his earlier idealistic desires to be free and independent before the kids came along. In the blink of an eye, the empty and uncaring suburbanite who has no compunctions about bedding the new pretty office worker suddenly is transformed into a caring, self-actualized mensch who will go along with his wife's bold plan to go where no other suburban couple has gone before.Don't despair, Frank returns to his vile ways quite soon enough. With a job promotion hanging over his head and the news that April is pregnant, he decides to 'sell out'. Aha, we've finally found out who the antagonist is in this film! Fortunately there is one bright note in Revolutionary Road and that is Michael Shannon's electroshock victim, John Givings. John is basically an ally of April since they both don't fit into society and are labeled as deviant (note that at one point, Frank recommends that April see a shrink!). Before Frank 'sells out', he and April have a nice 'heart-to-heart' talk in the woods with John who echoes the film's theme: people in suburbia might 'get' emptiness but April and (pre-sell-out) Frank 'feel' hopelessness. The non-conformist blesses the free-spirit couple for their 'bravery'. But once Frank takes the new job and decides not to go to Paris, he is the recipient of John's full wrath. A real person would have parried John's blows with perhaps a sense of humor, but since Frank is merely a stand-in for all the ills of suburbia (and hence American society), he comes off as arrogant, defensive and with a severe anger management problem.The only truly enjoyable moment in Revolutionary Road is when John turns on April for a millisecond. After berating Frank, he whispers in HER ear and tells her in effect that maybe she's no great shakes either! The suggestion that maybe April is not an angel is short-lived. Before you know it, April has done herself in by means of a self-induced abortion. Our beloved bohemian is now enshrined as sacrificial lamb.Ironically, Revolutionary Road is well-acted and directed. What's more the art design of the film, with its attention to period detail, is a work to behold. The score, while repetitious, is also haunting. But somehow the histrionics of the principal characters do not impress since people are not like that in real life. Stories about people living 'lives of quiet desperation' is not only a myth but 'old hat'. The 'Road' is more empty than the mythic society it creates and attempts to tear down.",4,5,9,3 August 2009
Foxcatcher," Not all of it rings true, but tale of creepy, demented heir, proves oddly fascinating
","In order for 'Foxcatcher' to work, it has to believable. How many liberties did the screenwriters take in depicting the sad seduction of brothers Mark and David Schultz, both Gold Medal winters in the 1984 Olympics, into the clutches of the troubled and deranged heir to the Du Pont family fortune and wrestling coach wannabe, John Du Pont?The main liberties taken it would seem, were with the character of Mark Schultz. The films' scenarists would like us to believe that Schultz was sort of a mindless jock who perhaps didn't have the insight to realize he was getting involved with such a duplicitous and dangerous individual. According to the film, it was both Mark's naivety and insatiable need to be #1, that led him to be manipulated by Du Pont; but this is in part disputed by Schultz himself in his book, written after the tragic murder of his brother. Before discussing this issue of Mark Schultz's naivety, one must acknowledge that 'Foxcatcher' gets it right in depicting him as being quite 'down and out' prior to being contacted by Du Pont. Both brothers were working as assistant coaches at Stanford but it was Mark who was fired and Dave who was kept; according to Slate Magazine, 'someone who feigned interest in managing his career,' swindled him out of most of his money. Mark was living in a rented apartment in his father's house when Du Pont called.According to Mark, unlike the way he was depicted in the film, he was deeply suspicious of Du Pont from the get-go. His main concern was that Du Pont had little wrestling knowledge and he 'cautiously' arranged to meet Du Pont while he was training for the Worlds in Indiana. He saw Du Pont as a loser and didn't like the fact that his teeth were 'dark yellow and caked with food.' When Du Pont told him that he would be referred to as 'Coach,' only in the media guide and that he would only pop in once in a while to check on how things were going, he didn't agree to talk right away but only after the trials were over.Slate Magazine also points out that Mark didn't stay at Du Pont's estate when he first got there and actually looked at him as a 'loser'—someone who he had disdain and also pity for. So Mark's lack of skepticism early on in regards to Du Pont as depicted in the film, is not borne out by the facts. Nor was it particularly believable that none of the characters in the film (such as the other wrestlers who were training at the Foxcatcher facility) seemed to discuss what a creepy guy Du Pont was and that he might have some kind of mental illness. Indeed, while Du Pont was found competent to stand trial, he was ultimately convicted of Third Degree Murder but mentally ill.Despite the lack of verisimilitude in regards to Mark's early encounters with Du Pont, the best part of the film chronicles Du Pont's bizarre behavior and underlying psychopathology. Donning a prosthetic nose, Steve Carrell, a comic by trade, transforms himself into a very creepy psychopath. Carrell watched a good deal of video footage to imitate Du Pont's mannerisms and those who had encounters with the real Du Pont indicate that Carrell successfully captures the essence of the demented heir.Du Pont's obsession with guns is ably highlighted (and it was certainly true he often had the local police over for shooting practice), along with his passion for ornithology and philately. While wrapping himself in the mantle of ethical living and unbridled patriotism, Du Pont hypocritically used cocaine and insisted Mark Schultz try it too. The filmmakers argue that Du Pont's 'dementia' was rooted in his resentment toward his mother. Mark Schultz doesn't mention this in his book but the filmmakers speculate that Du Pont hated his mother's love for horses and that the mother looked at her son's obsession with wrestling as a 'low' preoccupation. Du Pont's pettiness is correctly depicted by the film's scenarists when he rigs wrestling matches for seniors, and has his opponents intentionally throw the matches, so he can be declared the victor.Recently Mark Schultz withdrew his support for the film's director over accusations that there was a homo-erotic component to his relationship with Du Pont. While not explicitly stated, one particular scene where Mark and Du Pont wrestle together in a suggestive way, might lead one to conclude that there was something going on between the two. But Schultz makes it clear in his book that he made it quite clear to Du Pont that he wasn't gay and had no desire to engage in any sexual encounters with him. According to Slate Magazine, Mark's relationship with Du Pont fell apart after his brother Dave took over as coach. 'In reality, Dave never worked at Foxcatcher while Mark was there, and Mark was fired shortly after an angry confrontation with John over not much' 'Foxcatcher' doesn't make it clear at all, but once Dave was hired as coach, he lived there with his family for 7 years.As to the motive as to why Du Pont shot Dave Schultz, 'Foxcatcher' fails to go into Du Pont's interest in one Valentin Jordanov, a Bulgarian wrestler, who he ultimately gave 80% of his fortune to in his will. The day he shot Dave Schultz was Jordanov's birthday and perhaps he was trying to prove to Jordanov that Dave was no longer a rival and was out of their way.Why did the Schultz brothers fall victim to Du Pont's seduction? Perhaps it was a puerile obsession with winning. Ultimately, just as big honchos of American wrestling were paid off by Du Pont, so the Schultz brothers also found themselves tempted by his greenbacks. Despite its flaws, the tale of the 'crazy as a loon' benefactor, proves oddly fascinating.",6,2,6,8 January 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 'Apes' causes you to suspend your disbelief one too many times
","If you're willing to accept the basic premise of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', then clearly you'll have to suspend your disbelief. I was initially willing to do that because a true-life similar idea—the genetic modification in our food supply--is very much part of the public consciousness today. Is it that far off to suggest that in the near future, scientists might develop some kind of retrovirus that will alter the genetic makeup of advanced mammals, such as both chimps and humans alike? While the whole idea of chimps becoming intelligent as humans is far-fetched, the possibility still bears some relationship to a set of plausible, scientific ideas.In its simplistic way, 'Apes' is a cautionary tale that points to the limits of scientific knowledge. Will Rodman's retrovirus initially cures his father of Alzheimer's disease but eventually it proves to be a complete failure. Even worse, the virus ends up infecting all of humanity and the apes eventually take over. The desire for profits outweighs safety concerns involving scientific research. How many times have we seen that?Unfortunately, the suspension of one's disbelief happens one too many times throughout this film. Take for example the opening scene where the female chimpanzee 'Bright Eyes' goes on a rampage, in an attempt to protect her baby (later adopted by Rodman and named 'Caesar', consistent with the earlier Planet of the Ape storyline.) It's curious that none of the scientists at the laboratory noticed Bright Eyes was pregnant. More unbelievable is that Jacobs, Rodman's boss, doesn't fire him on the spot as he is responsible for Bright Eyes' mayhem and the obvious bad publicity engendered by the crazed chimpanzee's rampage.Another aspect of the film I had trouble accepting was that no one got wind of Caesar during the three years he was living with Rodman at his house. Given the chimp's growth and curiosity, I would have thought that Rodman and his girlfriend could have hardly kept him locked up in the house all that time. When they do go to see the Redwoods, at a major tourist spot, there are few people there and only one person there notes that a chimpanzee is present. I doubt Rodman would have escaped the scrutiny of a park ranger who could have easily been notified via cellphone by anyone horrified to see a chimpanzee being led around on a leash.Another awkward moment was the fight between the nasty neighbor and Rodman's Alzheimer's afflicted father. Why was the neighbor such a nasty character to begin with? Rodman could have easily took him aside when he moved in and mentioned that his father had Alzheimer's. That way he would not have reacted the way he did when the father got inside his car and started wrecking it! Perhaps the most unbelievable moments in the film is when Rodman's boss suddenly reverses his decision to fund Rodman's experiments a second time around. You remember how vehement he was in shutting the over eager neuroscientist down the first time around? Not only that, Jacobs made it quite clear that Rodman was in the doghouse since the Bright Eyes fiasco. But all of a sudden, he's willing to back him merely on Rodman's assertions that the retrovirus had worked on his father, temporarily!!! No proof whatsoever—Jacobs suddenly believes Rodman, merely upon his word and nothing else! 'Apes' really goes 'ape' when Caesar 'sprays' his fellow simian crew and they now have the ability to break out of the primate facility where they've been imprisoned. How is it that the chimps and apes they release from the San Francisco Zoo (who were NOT sprayed with the virus) are able to join the team of intelligent simians, and successfully defeat their human opponents? In a big city such as San Francisco, it sure seemed like there were a lot more apes available for combat than would have been available in reality. And where was the Army for that matter? This would have been a major news event and certainly wouldn't have been left to the local police force. More incredible is that the simian rampage is never shown as a breaking news story in any media, local or national.It appears that the films' scenarists attempt to justify the 'revolt' of the apes as they are depicted as being victims of unethical scientists allied with rapacious businessmen as well as gamekeepers guilty of animal cruelty. Humans get short shrift here and only Rodman, his girlfriend and Rodman's temporarily aware Dad (sans the Alzeheimer's), appear to have some kind of moral conscience. In this light, one sees that most of the characters here are pretty one-dimensional.Finally, 'Apes' gets pretty lazy in finding a way to dispose of most of humanity, which will explain the rise of the simians. It's simply your basic 'contagion', where a virus leads to nosebleeds and the implied demise of millions. Somehow, I wanted something a little more clever than such a trite explanation explaining the end of humans' dominion over the animal kingdom.'Apes' does well in the CGI department and despite the hokey storyline, keeps your interest. Perhaps the best moments involve Rodman's bonding with Caesar as he grows up. I only wish the screenwriters tried to make things a bit more plausible. Even science fiction must have some credibility if it's going to work at all!",4,9,19,18 August 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Cool TV nostalgia and late 60s neo-noir sabotaged (once again) by master of adolescent revenge fantasy
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's tribute to the glory days of 50s TV replete with reconstructions of old TV westerns and their attendant commercials. Tarantino's main 'present day' story is set in the heady days of 1969 and strictly neo-noir in tone.
The protagonist here is Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), the former star of a successful 50s TV series, 'Bounty Law,' whose career has taken a nose dive, now playing the villain on various contemporary television shows. His sidekick is Cliff Booth (an impressive Brad Pitt), an Army vet, who has been working for him in the capacity of stunt double as well as driver and handyman for about a decade.
The film begins with Dalton meeting with Schwarz (Al Pacino), Dalton's agent who provides a dire analysis of his career prospects and suggests that he take on work in Italy, acting in spaghetti westerns, which could be quite profitable. Dalton balks at the prospect of working as part of such cheesy enterprises and initially declines to travel to Italy. The scene is long-winded despite providing a great cameo for Pacino.
Despite its slow pace, 'Hollywood' has a palpable sense of dread to it as the principals Dalton and Booth have rented a house right next to the infamous residence where Sharon Tate and her friends were murdered by the Manson gang. For a while, it actually feels like the fictional characters of Dalton and Booth could have been there, crossing paths with the real-life Manson and his crazy crew of murdering sycophants.
There's also a flashback as Booth reminiscences about a physical confrontation he got into with Bruce Lee years earlier on the set of the film The Green Hornet. It's another one of Tarantino's self-indulgent scenes which is supposed to foreshadow Booth's physical prowess. It's unfair to Lee, who is depicted as a macho bully, who purportedly wasn't as cocky and arrogant as that in real life.
Tarantino shines in his scene where Booth picks up a member of the Manson gang while hitchhiking and gives her a ride back to the Spahn Movie Ranch, where Manson's followers are holed up. Booth remembers George Spahn from his work as a stunt double at the ranch years before and wants to check on him. He's menaced by the Manson miscreants, especially Squeaky Fromme, and soon beats up Grogan, an unsavory hippie who first slashes Booth's tire. Tarantino's dialogue is particularly good here, with the Manson crew appearing quite scary and believable.
Meanwhile, more real-life personages are introduced by Tarantino, including the doomed Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), who's seen taking in her own flick (The Wrecking Crew) at a local movie theater. How much this contributes to the overall story is debatable-I understand it's supposed to add to the atmosphere of the times, but the Tate part again doesn't seem well integrated into the plot.
Less successful is another long-winded sequence involving Dalton who is hired to play the heavy on a new western series, 'Lancer.' DiCaprio is actually quite good depicting Dalton as having a nervous breakdown on the set after forgetting his lines and then returning to give a powerful performance, impressing the series director. It's only less successful because it again just goes on for too long and needs more editing. But Tarantino can't help himself, as he loves the old TV shows, and doesn't understand that his audience might not appreciate his long-winded homages, as much as he does.
Prior to the climax, Dalton's agent convinces him to finally take on some work in Italy, where he's hired to do a few spaghetti westerns, ends up getting married and splits with Booth. All this is rather unconvincingly related by a narrator who sums up the action in a series of voice overs.
That bring us to the unfortunate denouement where once again Tarantino shows his inevitable true colors. Dalton and Booth decide to have one last drunken bender where they end up inebriated back at Dalton's house. The crazed Manson killers end up at Dalton's home where (in an alternate history), Booth and Dalton dispatch them in salacious ways (Booth ends up wounded, with a knife stuck in his leg) and Dalton uses a blowtorch (which he still happens to possess from one of his World War II pictures) to set Susan Atkins, one of the more notable of Manson's crazed followers, on fire in the backyard swimming pool.
An appropriate reaction to all this should be, 'Oy vey.' Once again, Tarantino invokes his unconscious cinematic mantra which is of course, let's have another puerile, adolescent revenge fantasy. Whether it be Nazis ('Inglorious Basterds'), racist slaveholders ('Django Unchained') or now hippies and the Manson Family, Tarantino takes the easy way out by shooting down a group of straw men that people just love to hate.
Why does Tarantino sabotage his movies with revenge fantasy? Deep down this is the way Tarantino can garner acceptance in the film critics' community. By dreaming up alternate historical scenarios (such as killing Hitler), it allows his audience to avoid the painful truth of reality: that the good guys don't always win and there is actual tragedy in the world where innocent people are killed (like Sharon Tate).
Don't count on Tarantino to ever dispense with his deceptive and morally bankrupt strategies. Despite his talents (and he has many!), 'Hollywood' will remain part of Tarantino's standard oeuvre: entertaining exercises in nostalgia that appeal to an adolescent base thirsting for revenge, decidedly incapable of facing reality.",5,12,18,9 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Decent enough recreation of Liberace's behind-the-scenes, mundane, closeted lifestyle
","While he was alive, Liberace did everything he could to prevent his adoring fans (mostly elderly women) from learning that he was gay. 'Behind the Candelabra' focuses on the flamboyant entertainer's private life, particularly on his long-term relationship with his much younger lover, Scott Thorson.Thorson met Liberace through a mutual acquaintance and gave up on his aspirations to become a veterinarian. Instead, in exchange for material (and sometimes) emotional support, Thorson became both Liberace's lover and personal assistant. Later, Liberace entertained ideas that Thorson could become his adopted son (much to Thorsen's chagrin, Liberace never made this official by signing the legal paperwork).Early on in this docudrama, Thorson receives a prophetic warning from one of Liberace's former 'concubines', that he too will be discarded by a younger rival. Along the way, Thorson agrees to undergo plastic surgery at Liberace's behest, who seeks to transform the younger man, into the spitting image of Liberace himself. As a result of the surgery, Thorson eventually becomes addicted to drugs, a situation which Liberace comes to despise.On the other hand, Liberace's penchant for patronizing pornographic shops bothers Thorson, who points out that doing so, could undermine all of Liberace's efforts to remain closeted. The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Liberace tosses Thorson aside for a younger rival, leading to Thorson's big meltdown, where he is unceremoniously escorted from Liberace's mansion, never to return until Liberace's final days.Take away the fact that this is Liberace, the over the top entertainer, known to millions, the domestic imbroglios between this gay couple, are nothing out of the ordinary. Should we really care when Thorson 'loses it' when Liberace dumps him? After all, it was strictly his decision to live an empty life where an elder benefactor provides all his material wants, at the expense of his own self-satisfaction. And does it really matter who's 'on top', during bouts of anal sex? Despite the mundane source material, which highlights the couples' self-destructive behavior, there are moments which suggest that both Liberace and Thorson, were at heart, decent people. Take Liberace doing so much for Thorson upon the death of his foster mother (like hiring the chartered plane); by the same token, Thorson is willing to forgive Liberace, and visits him at his deathbed, just as he's about to die from AIDS.Michael Douglas and Matt Damon do a decent enough job, recreating the roles of the two lovers; but I wonder if it would have been better if two actors who were actually gay, could have brought more to the parts. Debbie Reynolds is great, as well as unrecognizable in the role of Liberace's mother. And director Steven Soderburgh acquits himself well, in presenting this 'warts and all' portrait, of the offbeat showman.'Behind the Candelabra' may not be everyone's cup of tea not because the material is salacious but rather because it's a bit ordinary. That includes Liberace's music, which to my mind represented a combination of the sublime and the ridiculous. In the end, there's enough here to keep one's interest, but given the subject matter, don't expect any real epiphanies.",6,2,5,8 July 2013
Beasts of No Nation," Grim, upsetting tale of African child soldier takes us out of our sheltered existence
","I was very impressed by director Cary Joji Fukunaga's Sin Nombre, a powerful film about illegal immigration and gang culture in Mexico and Central America. Conversely, I was stupefied by Fukunaga's lame attempt to adapt Jane Eyre to the silver screen.I am happy to report that Mr. Fukunaga is now back on solid ground with the adaptation of the novel Beasts of No Nation, a searing meditation on the fate of child soldiers in war torn Africa. Although most of the film was shot in Ghana, no specific country is referred to as the narrative unfolds. Some critics found fault with Fukunaga's generic portrait but as he himself pointed out, the story has a universal application with its focus on one particular child who is emotionally damaged after forced to become a soldier under the tutelage of his psychopathic commandant.There have already been a number of novels and films on this very subject (the recent film 'War Witch' comes to mind), so was it necessary for Mr. Fukunaga to cover similar ground once again? The answer of course is yes, provided this child- soldier genre is handled in a non-derivative, unique way.While the focus here is on black Africans, one should not come to conclusion that the 'beasts' of the title (child soldiers and their adult commanders) are a problem exclusive to the African continent. Recently there have been reports of children being employed by ISIS to fight in some of their bloody battles. It is also wrong to conclude that Africans are savage people based on what one sees here. In fact, the victims in this film are all black Africans. Our protagonist Abu's father and brother are murdered when soldiers from a newly installed junta accuse them of collaborating with a rebel group.The story breaks into the second Act when Abu is kidnapped by a group consisting of both adult and child soldiers who call themselves NDF, led by the 'Commandant' (menacingly played by the eminent actor Idris Elba). The Commandant intimidates Abu at first by referring to him as a 'thing.' But soon the Commandant allows Abu to join the group by undergoing an initiation consisting of running through a gauntlet of soldiers who thrash him mercilessly. One boy falls before making it through the gauntlet and since he has shown weakness, his throat is slit and then he is apparently buried alive as witch doctors perform a ceremony to 'cleanse' the children's' 'souls.'The horror only escalates as the Commandant forces Abu to prove that he's a 'real man' by hacking an educated man (an engineer) to death after he's one of the few survivors of a convoy the Commandant's group has ambushed.Abu cannot understand why the other youngest in the group, Strika, never speaks. It soon becomes apparent that the Commandant is a pederast who has been sexually molesting the boy for quite a while. Soon Abu will become another victim of the Commandant's perverse proclivities and he will fall silent too.Later Abu participates in a number of battles, eventually leading to a skirmish in the capital. Abu clings to a woman inside a building they've just taken, mistaking her for his mother. Completely unhinged, Abu shoots an innocent victim to death.Eventually the Commandant is summoned by NDF headquarters and learns he's being kicked upstairs by the Supreme Commander--his lieutenant will now take control of the group. In the evening, at a brothel, the lieutenant is shot and as he is dying, accuses the Commandant of being responsible for the shooting.When the Commandant orders his group back into the bush, against the orders of the Supreme Commander, they come under helicopter fire. After a few months, they run out of ammunition and the group (including Abu) rebels against the Commandant, and agrees to surrender to UN forces.The story ends on a bittersweet note as Abu, now haunted by memories of his experiences, reveals that he's still guided by the love of his parents and seeks to lead a normal life as best he can. He joins other children playing in the surf at a missionary school where they are staying.If there's any criticism to be offered here, one can point to some of the harried battle scenes which I often found to be unclear as to what exactly was transpiring. Mr. Fukunaga did well in casting newcomer Abraham Attah as the beleaguered boy, Abu. His transition from an innocent child to savage child soldier, is to say the least, upsetting. Beasts of No Nation is often hard to watch. But as with good films about the Holocaust, one comes out of the theater much more aware about what's going on in the world beyond the safe borders of our sheltered world.",8,4,6,25 January 2016
Gone Girl," Absurd characters and plot sink this poor man's 'Fatal Attraction'
","'Gone Girl' is one of those films in which I have no guilt feelings whatsoever in giving away the plot. If you must see it, wait until cable or when it comes to Netflix. The first third however, actually isn't that bad. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne whose wife, Amy, lived a sheltered and privileged existence after her parents created a series of children's novels entitled 'Amazing Amy', based on her life as a child in NYC.We learn in a series of flashbacks from Amy's journal, that when she first met Nick, it was similar to a perfect, whirlwind romance. Eventually, however, the couple is forced to move back to Missouri, to take care of Nick's mother, who has cancer. Amy is forced to give back a substantial sum of money to her parents who basically bankrolled her career, when they go into debt. Amy pours the remaining money into a bar, which is run by Nick and his sister.One fine day Amy disappears and the investigating detective, finds a series of clues purposely left there by Amy (including her journal). Soon, Nick fast becomes the prime suspect in Amy's disappearance. Nick tries to keep himself together, despite the media circus right outside his door. Eventually we learn in a twist, that Amy is a psychopath who seeks to humiliate Nick. This basically is where I lost interest in the film. Amy is too much of a bizarre character to be taken seriously. Her main motivation for wanting to do her husband in, is that he cheated on her. The way in which she tries to frame him, seems too complicated to pull off in real life; one also wonders if she was so enraged at him, why doesn't she simply try and kill him by making his death seem like an accident?The plot becomes even more bizarre when Amy allows herself to be ripped off by two rednecks who learn that she has a lot of cash on her, while they're all staying at a motel. For a clever psychopath like Amy, it seems a little too easy for her to be ripped off so easily by the two low life's she encounters. Now penniless, she contacts Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) who stalked her in high school. Now rich, the one-note Desi believes this is his chance to help Amy, while attempting to woo her again. Desi comes off as an equally unbelievable character as Amy, since there is no reason why he should have remained obsessed with her for all this time (not to mention the restraining order that Amy took out against him years ago). Amy ends up murdering Desi (in a very gruesome and unpleasant scene), slashing his throat with a box cutter. Before doing so, however she pretends she's been raped by Desi in front of a surveillance camera..The last third of the film features the last and equally noxious twist. Nick ends up 'lawyering up' by hiring the big media attorney, Tanner Bolt, who encourages him to be interviewed on a Nancy Grace-like show. By owning up to having an affair, Nick improves his media image after his girlfriend came forward to reveal their affair. Suddenly, Amy decides to nix the original plan to frame Nick and returns home, much to everyone's shock across the country, who have been following the case incessantly for the past few months on TV and social media.Somehow, Amy gets a hold of Nick's sperm in a sperm bank and impregnates herself. Much to his sister's chagrin, Nick decides to stay with psycho Amy, and raise the baby together.'Gone Girl' for me is a poor man's 'Fatal Attraction'. Somehow, Rosamund Pike's 'Amy' doesn't compare to the much more chilling, 'Alex', excellently played by Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Here Amy is practically a comic character, who gets away with both an attempted frame-up and murder, and ends up humiliating her poor schlub of a husband, who is forced to go back to her, under duress. 'Gone Girl' is not to be taken seriously and those who admire the absurd characters and plot, to my mind, have low standards indeed.",3,47,92,19 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino brilliantly turns Spaghetti Western on its head but then undermines it through cheap revenge fantasy
","With clever aplomb, Quentin Tarantino has turned the Spaghetti Western on its head and created a vision of the pre-Civil War South and Wild West, much more like it probably was: a landscape replete with the nightmare images of slavery, highlighting a society permeated by racism at every turn. When he decides to be 'serious', Tarantino 'gets it' and proffers up a series of disturbing images, scenes and characters that prove on a certain level, he's read his history.The opening scene, where a group of male slaves in chains are being transported by the Speck Brothers, introduces us to the brutal world of slavery. One notes the horrible condition these men are in and the sadistic way they're treated by the racist Ace and Dicky Speck. The brutal way in which the slaves take revenge on Dicky, after his horse falls on him after being shot, suggests their actions are an understandable reaction to years of terrible oppression.Tarantino is hardly finished. There are scenes of slaves on the way to the slave market in shackles, often forced to wear gruesome metal head locks that resemble the kind of restraints one associates with Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs'; a terrifying mob of hooded racist night riders, obvious precursors of the Ku Klux Klan, on their way to take revenge on Tarantino's protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django; Mandingo fighting where blacks are forced to basically kill one another in the wrestling ring while racist whites bet on the fight for sport; and the copious use of the 'n-word' throughout the film (Tarantino doesn't care about offending modern day sensibilities--he realizes that the overuse of that demeaning word, was commonplace during those times!).Tarantino is at his best when he comes up with a character like Calvin J. Candie, the racist plantation owner, so winningly played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is not just your average racist brute as are so many of the other characters in the film. Candie represents a racist with intelligence, as he toys with those he lords over, sadistically deriving pleasure through both physical and psychological means. In perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film, he coaxes one of his top Mandingo fighters down from a tree, after the poor, broken man confesses he's no longer able to fight and then sics a pack of savage dogs on him, tearing the man to pieces. Candie also is shown to have much in common with the Nazis in the 20th century, as he pontificates about what he believes to be the genetic inferiority of the black man.After all this clever scene setting as well as some brilliant writing in his portrait of Candie, why does Tarantino undermine his story by resorting to the same kind of puerile wish fulfillment fantasy, we saw in full relief in his previous effort, 'Inglorious Basterds'? The answer can be found in the examination of Tarantino's two protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django.While Christoph Waltz proves to be highly entertaining as Dr. King Schultz, the witty dentist turned bounty hunter, one must recognize that Schultz, personifies Tarantino himself. Not only does Tarantino want to be on the winning side, but he must prove, as a white Italian, that he is entirely sympathetic to black people and is 100% against racism. So here he grafts this 21st century sensibility on to his Schultz character, who is such a friend of black people, that he'll not only make Django his partner but go out of his way and risk his life, to help Django save his wife from the clutches of the very dangerous Calvin J. Candie.It hardly seems believable that Schulz would be able to save himself in that scene where he appeals to the Marshal's good will. I would imagine that after shooting the sheriff, the Marshal and his posse wouldn't have been in the mood to listen to Schultz's story that he was a bounty hunter, and would have shot them both on the spot. I was unable, however, to suspend my disbelief when it came to Schultz making Django his assistant, and parading around, ensuring all those racist townspeople got their comeuppance. It might have made Tarantino feel good that his white liberal Schultz and super-human racist killer, Django, were so successful, but the reality of the 1858 South, was quite different (Think about John Brown's fate after attempting to start a slave revolt when he raided Harper's Ferry).If Schultz is a stand-in for today's white liberal, Django represents the flip side: militant black people's wish fulfillment. Spike Lee is completely right that 'Django' trivializes the history of slavery (I wish only he saw the film so he can back up his beliefs with specific detail). When Django kills Candie's sister and Samuel L. Jackson's Uncle Tom, Stephen, and then blows up the plantation, it gives those unfamiliar with American history the wrong impression. Quite the opposite occurred: there was little opportunity for blacks to revolt against the slave master; and when such revolts did occur, they were brutally suppressed.By indulging himself with these revenge fantasies, Tarantino may be encouraging ignorant young people to resort to violence. Some of these young people may erroneously equate the racist behavior seen in 'Django' with people of today. In our own time, is it right to blame Germans born after World War II, for the crimes committed by their grandparents? Ultimately, Tarantino succeeds when he transforms the Spaghetti Western into the nightmare reality of a pre-Civil War racist world. But by also accepting the stock conventions of that genre, with all of its attendant juvenile trappings (e.g. one bloodbath after another), coupled with his need to be on the 'winning side' and indulging in revenge fantasies, Tarantino ends up appealing to the baser instincts of those who deny over 150 years of progress and hark back to an age that no longer exists.",5,6,12,15 March 2013
Get Out," Lame horror film tropes and racial stereotypes sink comedy writer's directorial debut
","Get Out is the directorial debut of comedy writer Jordan Peele who has taken a page out of the Quentin Tarantino wish fulfillment fantasy playbook. Unlike Tarantino, Peele operates in the much more lucrative horror genre, his film grossing $184 million worldwide against a mere $4.5 million budget.Peele's protagonist is black photographer, Chris Washington, who agrees to visit his white girlfriend Rose's family (the Armitages) in an upstate suburb. While driving up to the house, there is a bit of foreshadowing of even stranger things to come, when Chris and Rose unexpectedly hit a deer and then have an unpleasant encounter with a state trooper where Rose can't conceal her contempt for law enforcement in general.Before even meeting the parents, Chris is unnerved by the almost zombie-like behavior of the black groundskeeper and housekeeper, Walter and Georgina. Rose's parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon and Missy, a psychiatrist/hypnotist are depicted as white liberals, with Dean proudly telling Chris that he voted for Obama twice. Rose's brother Jeremy is unable to control an ingrained hostility and has little to do except attack Chris later on when it becomes clear the entire family suffers from a malevolence usually associated with typical horror film tropes.As for the plot, somehow Chris (due to losing his mother in a car accident when he was a kid) is susceptible to Missy's hypnotic commands, sending him to 'the sunken place' where he appears to not only lose consciousness but finds himself at the mercy of the creepy Missy. Soon a coterie of Armitage family friends show up at an annual get-together and it becomes clear that all these white folks are part of a conspiracy to subjugate black people through a series of actions that defy all logic.For example, when Chris takes a picture of Logan, a recently kidnapped black man from NYC, the camera flash causes him to become hysterical and yell at Chris to 'get out.' Quite conveniently, the flash isn't enough to break Logan completely out of his fugue state nor is Chris able to simply walk away and call the police, as the mere tapping of a spoon on a tea cup, causes Chris to fall back under Missy's spell.Peele's universe proves even more ridiculous when Rose is exposed as part of the family conspiracy to grab Chris and plant the brain of Jim Hudson, their older blind art dealer friend, into Chris' head. Somehow, this time, Chris breaks free of the hypnotic command and is able to contact his TSA agent friend, Rod, in NYC, who all along suspected that there was something very sinister afoot with these 'crazy' white people.The wish fulfillment is on display when the stereotyped white liberals get their comeuppance at the hands of the noble Chris. Peele does a great disservice to true victims of racism by reducing the tormentors to a group of straw men and women who are easily set aside. In real life, of course, racism is a far more complicated affair and sometimes the victims turn out to be as bad as their oppressors.Get Out marks a new low in race relations with Peele setting a poor example for impressionable youth. Instead of trying to mend fences, Peele is content to present African-Americans as perennial victims at the hands of stereotyped white tormentors. No race or ethnic group has a monopoly on benevolence despite Peele's lame and misguided outlook to the contrary.",2,267,517,20 April 2017
Drive," Dynamic and entertaining neo-noir plot trumps Gosling and Mulligan wooden parts and performances
","'Drive' is directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, a Danish director known for films with a violent bent. 'Drive' is no exception, as it emulates some of the darker film noirs of the 40s and 50s as well as the neo-noirs of later years. Refn shot 'Drive' in a contemporary Los Angeles but due to the use of an 80s, synth pop score, the story feels like it's more from the 80s rather than today (sounds like some of those synth tracks with the choppy bass parts were 'borrowed' from one of Hall and Oates' more popular hits).For women who might be drawn to the film due to the casting of Ryan ('The Hunk') Gosling in the lead role, be forewarned that 'Drive' is anything but a 'chick flick'. Gosling, in an unnamed part, moonlights as a getaway driver but has more respectable jobs as a part-time stunt driver and auto mechanic. Unfortunately, Gosling has little dialogue and speaks mostly in a monotone. Even worse is Carey Mulligan who plays Irene, the Driver's next door neighbor and mother of a five year old, who appears to drift about in a perpetual stupor (I seem to recall that when Driver crushes the hit man's head in the elevator, Irene backs off in shock but later never discusses or alludes to the incident at all).Things pick up in terms of action when Irene's husband, Standard, is released from prison but is being forced to commit another robbery by a brute named Cook, who claims Standard still owes a debt to former inmate associates who 'protected' him while incarcerated. A normal guy might feel some jealousy when another man encroaches on his territory, but 'Knight-in-Shining Armor' Gosling is ready to help Standard simply because he's taken a real liking to Irene and the kid. 'Drive' soon begins to shine through some neat twists and turns in the plot as well as the introduction of cool supporting players who overshadow both Mr. Gosling and Ms. Mulligan. Some critics have argued that the violence in 'Drive' is gratuitous, but I beg to differ. It might be a bit over the top, but is never cartoonish. In fact, the violence underscores the menacing, ruthless character of the antagonists Gosling's Driver must face.Cook beats Standard to a bloody pulp and the shocks are just beginning. There's the big double cross at the pawn shop, where Standard is shot in the back and later Cook's moll, Blanche, is gunned down at the motel room (there was a significant gasp that could be heard throughout the theater from a taken aback audience when the moll is dispatched). Gosling also gets the chance to be ruthless when he works Cook over. Later Bernie (a mobster played by Albert Brooks, who earlier backed the Driver and Shannon, the owner of the auto body shop where the Driver worked, in a joint stock car racing venture) kills Cook by stabbing him in the face. In addition to the aforementioned 'stomping in the elevator' scene, Bernie eliminates Shannon 'mercifully' by slicing his artery, causing the Driver's former pal, to slowly bleed to death.Who would have thought that comedian Albert Brooks, could actually be so good as an amoral crime boss? Bryan Cranston is also excellent as the Driver's seedy employer. Ron Perlman is always great playing the heavy but I would have liked to have seen more of him, as his character Nino's declaration of his Jewishness, remains wholly underdeveloped.The film's climax, where the Driver cuts off Nino's car on the highway, leading to his death by drowning at the hands of the Driver, was quite exciting. Less exciting and more awkward was the Driver's agreement to meet Bernie in public and return the money. For a person as crafty as the driver, didn't he anticipate that Bernie would try and hurt him at the scene of their meeting place? Or is it that he just didn't care? One other thing I wondered about at film's end. If the loot belonged to the east coast Mafia, even though Bernie and Nino were now dead, wouldn't the Mafioso still come looking for the Driver as well as Irene, who they would have discovered was affiliated with him? Thus, how could the Driver ride off into the sunset, knowing full well that Irene was still vulnerable?When I saw the title 'Drive', I expected the film to have many more chase scenes. Fortunately, director Refn took the story in a different direction, emphasizing the rivalry between the Driver and his criminal antagonists. 'Drive' is a film which doesn't have a lot to say. In other words, if you're looking for great 'meaning', you will not find it here. With the exception of the more complex Bernie, its characters are pretty much one-dimensional caricatures, especially the main protagonists, played by Gosling and Mulligan. Nonetheless, in the tradition of some of the great noirs and neo-noirs of the past, 'Drive' manages to be highly entertaining, due to a dynamic plot, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",6,0,2,4 February 2012
The Theory of Everything," ALS afflicted scientist's 'triumph' or 'Pyrrhic Victory?' You decide!
","I must confess to having mixed feelings about 'The Theory of Everything,' which covers the life of Stephen Hawking, from his days as a young graduate student afflicted with ALS (called 'motor neuron disease' in England) to the present time as a celebrated scientist who communicates via a computer and is confined to a wheelchair in an immobile state, for the rest of his days.The film's scenarist, Anthony McCarten, wisely does not attempt to explain Professor Hawking's scientific theories in great detail but is more interested in depicting Hawking's sad physical decline along with the relationship with his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking, who wrote the book the film is based on.The goal is to hold Hawking up as an inspiration to all of us—here was a man who was given two years to live and is still alive in his seventies. Not only is he alive but is an international figure, having made great contributions to the field of physics and wrote a worldwide, best-selling book, explaining his theories in more simplified form, so the ordinary man on the street could understand his extremely difficult concepts.The film has a beautiful score with performances that seem quite believable. Eddie Redmayne shines as Hawking in an extremely difficult, physically-demanding role. Still there's another voice in me that asks should Hawking really be viewed as an 'inspiration?' Of course he is but on the other hand, if you were a genie and could take away Hawking's disease along with his super-intelligence, I believe that Hawking wouldn't hesitate to cast off his 'brains' so he could walk again. What I am trying to say is that despite the inspiration, his life is still a tragedy. In the end, is there really enough here to create a full-length feature film? Or would a documentary serve as a better vehicle to illustrate the Hawking story? The 'sad decline' which I alluded to before is quite ably illustrated here for all to see. There's not much drama in that— nor the eventual dissolution of Hawking's marriage to Jane, which was an inevitable resolution given the overall tragic circumstances.'The Theory of Everything' is a beautiful tribute to a man who made something out of his life despite a harrowing disability. In that respect, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. We all can be inspired by such a tale but ultimately, Hawking's accomplishment is no 'triumph.' The dream sequence where Hawking gets out of his wheelchair and picks up a pen while attending a conference reminds us that such a simple act trumps any of the afflicted scientist's intellectual accomplishments which is decidedly akin to nothing more than a Pyrrhic Victory.",6,1,2,13 August 2015
Frozen," Han Christian Anderson rolls over in his grave as Disney scenarists substitute clueless neurotic for villainous Snow Queen antagonist
","Maybe because the critics were desperate for a Christmas time blockbuster that wasn't an action film (like Thor, The Hunger Games, or The Hobbit), that's why this average Disney animated musical, ended up receiving a multitude of accolades. In my view, however, it was overrated; not at all because of the music and special effects, which were quite good, but rather for the weak narrative.'Frozen' is very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, 'The Snow Queen' but bears little resemblance to the original classic tale. In the original, the two children were male and female; here there are two sisters of royal stock: eight year old Elsa who is afflicted with magical powers and her perky younger sister, five year old Anna, who live in the kingdom of Annendale (which in part bears a resemblance to a 19th century Norwegian fishing village). When Elsa can't control her powers (which involve turning everything into ice when she points her fingers), she accidentally injures her sister while they are playing. The result is the very awkward scenario of having Elsa locked up in her room until she's crowned queen as a teenager, following the demise of her parents, who are lost at sea during a storm.The demise of the parents is handled quite nicely before we arrive at the big coronation scene but children may find it disturbing that the film's scenarists opt to dispose of the parental figures and leave the two young girls as orphans. There is some stupendous 3D animation throughout the film, especially the interior shots of the palace (dig the Bruegel-like paintings on the wall, for example).The best part of 'Frozen' involves Anna's infatuation with the duplicitous Prince Hans. The whirlwind courtship between the inexperienced Anna and Hans, is undoubtedly meant as a cautionary tale for young women who are too easily taken in by good looks and facile words fashioned to manipulate, as opposed to proposals infused with sincerity. Elsa, on the other hand, sees through her sister's inexperience and refuses to give her blessing (as well as permission) for Anna to wed Hans, after a few hours of superficial courtship. Unfortunately, the rest of 'Frozen' is downhill. Anna strikes out on her own to try and find her sister the Queen, who's fled because again she is unable to control her own magical powers. Anna is aided by good guy 'Kristoff' the ice dealer and his trusty reindeer, Sven, and wouldn't you know it, Anna falls in love with him (after of course Prince Hans outs himself by revealing that his true intentions was to marry Anna and take over the Arrendale throne). That reversal is a nice twist but Hans is a minor villain in the pantheon of 'Frozen' antagonists, which all can be described as 'minor'.The problem with 'Frozen' is that it basically lacks an antagonist. Instead, the scenarists rely on Elsa's INTERNAL CONFUSION to move the story along. There is no evil 'Snow Queen' for the audience to root against. Instead, we merely are dragged along until Elsa inevitably gets herself together. But one wonders why she can't get herself together sooner. Instead of fighting an external villain, Elsa becomes an unlikeable loser who ends up creating a monstrous snowman, that almost hurls sister Anna and her soon-to-be boyfriend, off a cliff (also please include dopey Olaf, Anna's childhood snowman, who gets taken apart and put together again, ad infinitum).The all-powerful Elsa, is then somehow subdued by a few martinets and imprisoned in a jail cell with iron mitts. If she's such a powerful 'sorcerer', why does it take so long before she's able to 'freeze dry' the mitts and escape the jail cell? That's actually a minor contrivance compared to the climax when Elsa 'realizes' that Anna has sacrificed herself to save her. When Anna thaws out of her frozen state, that's when (duh!) Elsa realizes that only true love can set her own self free and also save the kingdom from eternal winter. Again, why does it take so long for (clueless) Elsa to realize the power of love? It's only hinted at (in the first few minutes of the film) but some kind of malevolent force has played with her self-esteem. But since that 'force' never manifests itself as a tangible entity, Elsa is reduced to being an ineffectual neurotic (hardly much of a crafty villain or heroine, we can root for!). As noted above, 'Frozen' has some great animation and the songs are bouncy and tuneful. Idina Menzel, of 'Wicked' fame, belts out the Elsa numbers and does quite well, especially the most catchy number, 'Let It Go'. Demi Lovato reprises 'Let It Go' on the end credits, but doesn't have as warm a voice as Menzel (and arrangement #2 doesn't help either). For years Disney attempted to adapt Han Christian Anderson's 'Snow Queen' as an animated feature without success. The difficulty in adapting such a sophisticated story is apparent in the current failure entitled 'Frozen'. Should a sequel be in the works, it would be best to create an actual Snow Queen antagonist, which could then propel this new adaptation, in a more efficacious direction.",4,9,23,16 December 2013
2012," Great special effects + one dimensional characters = passable but typical disaster movie
","In order to enjoy a disaster movie, it's important to suspend your disbelief to a large extent. Don't expect this type of movie to be at all logical, nor should you expect its characters to be very well developed. If the plot takes you from 'A' to 'B', with a reasonable amount of fast-paced action, then it probably has done its job.No, I did not think 2012 was masterpiece; but with its great special effects, it certainly ranks as passable. 2012 deals with a rather unpleasant subject: the end of the world. The ancient Mayan prediction that the world will come to an end in 2012, comes true in this movie. Director Roland Emmerich purposely avoids hammering his audience with true tragedy. We never see any close-ups of mangled bodies or blood being shed. Everything is shot at a distance so that we get the 'bigger picture' of what it would be like when the world is destroyed; that way, the true horror and terror is minimized.The best scenes in 2012 focus on the journey of part-time novelist and limousine driver, Jackson Curtis, very ably played by John Cusack. His journey begins when he picks up his kids from his ex-wife, who is now living with a new boyfriend, Gordon, a plastic surgeon, and takes them on a vacation excursion to Yellowstone National Park. Curtis runs into the best character in the film, Charlie Frost, in one of Woody Harrelson's best roles in a long time. What's so wonderful about the crazed Frost, is that he's one of these guys who's been trying to warn the world about his apocalyptic world view for years and now everything he's been saying has been vindicated. Frost actually welcomes death and stands impassively as the volcano consumes him. He revels in his last 'moment in the sun'. Curtis, on the other hand, initially believes him to be a crackpot, especially after Frost claims he has a map with the location of a secret ark project, which the world leaders have been working on, anticipating the end of the world.Finally Curtis sees the light when he sees the news report about the seismic activity that splits a supermarket in half which his ex-wife and her boyfriend were just in. He wisely rents a small plane and then drives to LA where he picks up his ex-wife, the boyfriend and his two children and then drives to the airport as the city collapses around them. Yes, all the near misses are ridiculous, but the special effects will keep you riveted to your seat. After making it to the airport, there's a new surprise: the pilot is dead and Gordon must fly the plane, despite only having a few lessons as a student pilot. They fly to Yellowstone in order to get a hold of Charlie's map and just escape as a volcano explodes. The map points to China and Curtis realizes that they'll never get there in a Cessna.When they arrive in Las Vegas, a huge crack has already appeared in the airport runway. Curtis runs into his Russian billionaire boss, Yuri, who has paid for tickets on the Ark, and also happens to have a giant Antonov 500 aircraft, which takes them to China. Yuri is another colorful character, who ruthlessly ditches his girlfriend, Tamara, as he only has three tickets for himself and two children on the Ark. But later, he redeems himself by saving his children by throwing them onto the Ark while the gates are closed and then falling to his death as a result.There's more exciting action when the Ark is unable to power up due to a jammed and malfunctioning boarding gate. At the last minute, as the effects of a tsunami pushes the Ark toward Mt. Everest (which has been displaced to a different location thousands of miles away due to a movement of the earth's crust) , Curtis goes underwater inside the hydraulics chamber (and with the assistance of his son) removes an impact driver which has been preventing the Ark from powering up.As to be expected, despite all the great action scenes, 2012 falls down in the area of character development. Emmerich serves up a cornucopia of politically correct characters including three blacks who are virtually faultless. They are: Dr. Adrian Helmsely, the American geologist, who proves how righteous he is when he insists that the stranded passengers who couldn't board a damaged Ark be allowed on the one he's boarded (Helmsley notes that his assigned room can fit a lot more people). Pitted against him is the supposedly heartless, white Chief of Staff, Carl Annheuser (Oliver Platt), who argues realistically that allowing the extra passengers might jeopardize the entire project. Even worse is the saintly president, Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover), who decides to remain in Washington, and 'go down with the ship'. In contrast, Emmerich obnoxiously has Queen Elizabeth board the Ark with a couple of her Corgis, implying that she's a coward! Naturally the president's daughter, Laura Wilson, must overcome her grief by striking up a romance with Helmseley, as they head for their new destination in Africa.There's plenty of other cheesy stuff that relegates 2012 to the realm of the mediocre. There's a particularly distasteful line about how the gene pool will be compromised when two Arab sheiks are seen, en route to board one of the Arks. And what about how expendable Gordon, the ex-wife's boyfriend is. After he's killed, it takes a scant minute or so before the ex-wife is back in the arms of John Cusack (Curtis). Also note that that Tibetan Buddhist monks are noble but Chinese soldiers are heartless. Other disappointing characters and moments are well chronicled here on the internet. But 2012 sometimes gets it right: the last moment of the Indian astrophysicist and his family may go down as one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.",5,0,4,11 August 2010
Room," Disturbing abduction plot and subsequent redemption tale doesn't rise above the level of an average Lifetime Movie
","Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts.For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination lock to enter.Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects found in the room—occasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present (such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between mother and son—Joy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for example.The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick drives away in his pickup to dispose of the 'body.' The entire escape is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is really dead—as the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of events in Act One.The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo. There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his catalog of resentments remain unexplored.A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at a hospital). Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic. When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's end.So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian script.In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings.",5,76,170,29 January 2016
I Am Legend," Three cheers for the mutants!
","First of all, I was wondering how the female survivor and her son were able to get out of NYC so easily at the end of the movie. If she drove her car maybe she would have taken the Henry Hudson Parkway to the Bronx and then upstate. But wait a second--if the Army blew up the Brooklyn Bridge in order to prevent people from leaving Manhattan, wouldn't they have blown up all the bridges? So how did the two get to the 'colony'? Maybe she was able to drive the car on to the Staten Island Ferry and figure out how to operate it (if you believe a ridiculous scenario like that, you probably rated this movie a '10').There were other things in 'I am Legend' that I found to be too incredible to be believable. For example, when we first meet the mutants, they don't seem intelligent enough to hatch a plan to do anything except bite people. But toward the end, they seem to be organized with a leader, capable of going after Will Smith. And how did they figure out where Will Smith was living? All of a sudden they have such great intelligence? If they had such capabilities, why didn't they track Will Smith (in his home) earlier? Even if one was engrossed by the first two Acts of this script (and I wasn't completely), Act 3 fell apart completely. Will Smith is so depressed because he has no one to talk to and when he finally meets the female survivor and her son, instead of being overwhelmingly happy that he's no longer alone and can talk to somebody, he ends up almost immediately arguing with her about the existence of the 'colony'. The chemistry between the two is almost non-existent and the writers attempt to 'humanize' Will Smith by giving him some lame lines about how he likes reggae music.And what about that scene where Will Smith is so depressed that he decides to play a game of kill-the-mutants with his car. I couldn't tell if this was one of Will Smith's dream sequences but if it wasn't, it didn't make a hell of a lot of sense. Here's a guy who's been spending all his time trying to save humanity by finding a vaccine that will transform the mutants and after he loses his dog, he goes to the trouble of setting up floodlights at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge and (for kicks) tries to kill as many mutants as he can. Was he trying to commit suicide or was it the director's decision to (awkwardly) place the hero in jeopardy and get him out of it? If it was still night out, how was Will Smith able to drive home in the dark without being attacked by a horde of mutants? Most unimpressive were the flashback scenes explaining how the virus wiped out humanity. There's no buildup, no tension whatsoever. Within a few hours, the virus has infected most people in Manhattan and they're all trying to escape. The movie would have been much more compelling if the infection was gradual and we saw how people coped with the transformation of their neighbors.Some reviewers have praised the film for its 'inspirational message'. In true 'faith-based' Christian fashion, it was God who told the female survivor that there was a colony in upstate New York (or was it Pennsylvania, I can't remember). But God takes a backseat when it comes to 'faith' in this movie. Rather it's 'science' that's elevated to the status of true religion. 'I am Legend' echoes the mantra which we've been hearing since the 50s that 'science' somehow holds the key to solving our most unsolvable problems and allaying our deepest fears. The whole idea that a virus can in a matter of a few weeks (or even days or hours) can infect and destroy humankind is laughable. Even more laughable is that some scientist can come up with a 'cure' in the form of a mysterious 'vaccine' to reverse the effects of such a contagion. In reality, when people get sick from some kind of 'disease', it doesn't happen overnight. It usually takes years before symptoms manifest themselves. 'Scientists' have been trying to find a 'cure' for cancer for years and always boast that they're one step away from discovering the elusive clue. The same goes for the pie-in-sky stem cell research which has been touted as a potential panacea for most diseases. I'll believe more in I am Legend's mutants before I believe in stem cell researchers enabling paralytics to walk again! 'I am Legend' has a few good special effects and that's why I give the film 3 stars. But even those cuddly mutants become tiresome after awhile. As for Will Smith--he was far superior in 'I, Robot' which at least had a fairly engrossing story.If you like Zombie movies coupled with pseudo-religious pontification, then I am Legend might be for you. Otherwise, exercise your brain by reading a book (non-fiction would be most preferable after coping with one shrieking zombie after another).",3,3,6,15 December 2007
Kick-Ass," Director Vaughn exploits children in modern-day 'Don Quixote' tale
","Kick-ass is the story of one Dave Lizewski, an 'ordinary', semi-nerdy high school student who can't understand why anyone in his age group never attempted to become a superhero in real life. You would think that such a premise has real comic possibilities but humorless director Matthew Vaughn decides to take things in a different direction. Right off the bat, Vaughn sets a nasty tone by serving up a mentally unbalanced young man, jumping off a building dressed in a superhero costume. The bad vibes are compounded when Lizewski's Mom drops dead of a aneurysm at the breakfast table. Fun stuff!!! The Act I set-up is full of the clichés and stereotypes typical of many 'youth' movies of today. For example, there's the obligatory scene where a couple of thugs steal a cellphone and comic books belonging to the good guy high school students. Then there's the stereotypical antagonist, Frank D'Amico, a vulgar comic-book Mafioso whose goons kill two hapless drug dealers in two repetitious scenes that occur within about ten minutes of one another (in one scene, the goons chop off the guy's finger and then shoot him and in a more repulsive scene, a man bursts like a balloon in a giant microwave).Vaughn attempts to conjure up a modern-day 'Don Quixote' figure with his geeky Lizewski. The nerd courts his 'Dulcinea', the attractive but morally bankrupt Katie who's been dating a drug dealer. His first quest to prove himself to Katie fails miserably after he takes on the two thugs who had robbed him earlier and ends up getting stabbed in the stomach, then hit by a car and almost dies. Fortunately when found, he convinces the paramedics not to let anyone know he was wearing his Kick-ass costume; but the rumor gets out anyway that he was found naked and is now presumed to be gay by most students at the school (including Katie who befriends but also patronizes him as she also assumes he's gay).Kick-ass could have gone in a more clever direction by having Lizewski train hard in martial arts and actually become a truly competent 'superhero' in the vein of Bruce Wayne (aka Batman). But instead it's pure luck that he survives the gang fight which he attempts to break up on the streets and in so doing becomes an internet sensation on Youtube. Lizewski continues with his 'Man of La Mancha' act by paying Katie's boyfriend a visit and again naively attempts to intervene on her behalf. As it turns out, 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' save the passive Kick-ass's ass! Now I have no problem with Damon Macready's story arc which involves the former cop attempting to take revenge on bad guy D'Amico after being framed. But what kind of message is being sent when he involves his ten year old daughter in his thirst for revenge? It's wholly inappropriate to depict a ten year old girl being trained by her father to become a professional assassin. Equally inappropriate is when teenager Chris D'Amico aka Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl—what completely makes no sense at all is that Red Mist is upset when his father's thugs carry off his buddy Kick-ass but he has no guilt whatsoever in shooting a ten year old girl? One other thing: after Frank is dispatched, doesn't Chris realize his father is dead? Does he try to find out what happened to his father or does it even occur to him? The bottom line is that the teenager shows no emotions at all which is not in keeping with the character's earlier scenes where he displayed affection for his father.The stupidity of Vaughn's comic book world is further on display when Frank D'Amico mistakenly shoots the wrong Kick-ass in broad daylight. You would think that the head of an organized crime family would be smart enough to realize that there are plenty of people walking around the city in the Kick-ass costume after the character goes viral over the internet. As for Lizewski's revelation to Katie that he's actually Kick-ass—suddenly bad girl Katie is transformed into a saint and falls for him hook, line and sinker. But Lizewski gets rewarded for finally realizing that he was a dumb ass all along! Some hero!The Kick-ass finale is perhaps the most repulsive aspect of the film. Big Daddy and Kick-ass are tortured on live television and then when the networks refuse to show the gory feed, all the voyeurs run to their computers to watch the sorry spectacle online. Finally, Vaughn resurrects his sadistic ten year old after she's shot, who then proceeds to dispatch one Mafia goon after another, in one unspeakably violent scene after another.Somehow after seeing a film like this, I kind of feel that something should be done about our current child labor laws. Rather than having accolades heaped upon Director Vaughn, perhaps the best place for him would be a secure lock-up--criminal or psychiatric, take your pick.",1,2,13,13 September 2010
Call Me by Your Name," Gay pride agitprop or idyllic gay escapist fantasy romance? You decide!
","Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name is the third in a trilogy which includes A Bigger Splash, a decent potboiler of sorts also set in Italy and starring English speaking actors. The film is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by AndrÃ© Aciman. James Ivory (of Merchant/Ivory fame) wrote the screenplay.The story is set in the early 80s and is superficially reminiscent of Bergman's 'Through a Glass Darkly'; both films deal with 17 year olds hunkered down with their families at summer retreats. That's basically where the comparison ends. Minus, Bergman's adolescent protagonist not only must resolve his relationship with a distant father, but also address the haunting and troubling split he feels between mind and body. On the other hand, Guadagnino's 17 year old, the Italian-American (and Jewish) Elio Perlman (TimothÃ©e Chalamet), a fledgling composer and music transcriptionist student, suffers from no Bergmanesque qualms of the psyche. Instead, it's all about issues revolving around his sexuality; specifically, his affection for Oliver (Armie Hammer), one of Elio's archaeologist father's (24 year old) research assistants, who shows up as an invited guest of Elio's parents for a six week stay at their very comfy villa in the North Italian countryside.A number of critics are so enamored with Oliver (i.e. Hammer) that they liken him to the Greco-Roman sculptures he's studying under the tutelage of Professor Perlman. There's a mildly interesting excursion that Oliver takes with the good Professor where an ancient statue is dredged up from the ocean and Oliver has some fun playing around with the statue's truncated arm. Much less interesting is seeing Elio enraptured as Oliver eats a soft-boiled egg with the yolk gushing out as this is supposed to be some kind of big sensual event. Ditto for Elio's attempt at self-gratification by slowly sucking on a peach. This is a film that is virtually devoid of conflictâ€”unless you consider Elio's inner confusion as to whether he really wants to get involved with the older guy as a mark of some kind of tension or (dare I use the word?â€”suspense). In the end the suspense amounts to the consummation of the couple's physical relationship and how unerotic that moment is (Guadagnino cuts away to a tree, seen from the bedroom window!). Jordan Raup writing in 'The Film Stage' somehow is impressed by the 'mutual yearning' of Elio and Oliver. He cites the scene of their visit to the local town, with Elio informing Oliver that this is the site of one of the most deadly battles of World War I. Instead of a complex interplay between conflicting personalities, Raup settles for an idyllic image of a gay romanceâ€”likening this inconsequential dalliance to the passion of soldiers involved in a life and death struggle: 'In an unbroken shot, they walk around opposite sides of the historic site, revealing as few words as possible about their heart's desires. In between this division there's the history of thousands of lives that have been lost, each with their own burning passions.' What crap!Worse yet is how the critics ignore the fact that this is an underage boy being taken advantage by an adult. The age of consent might be lower in Italy, but it still seems highly inappropriate that a research assistant is trying to have sex with a juvenile right under the eyes of the boss's father. But Peter Dubruge writing in Variety seems to be alright with all this. He acknowledges that 'this seductive outsider correctly anticipates that anything physical that might happen between him and Elio will have a lasting impact on the young man's sexual identity.' But Debruge seems to be impressed by how 'the pair brazenly peacock for one another, parading around shirtless and leaving the doors to their shared bathroom ajar â€” an improvised mating ritual echoed by a low insect buzz that fills the soundtrack.' Debruge describes the relationship as a 'deliciously tentative courtship dance'â€”instead of what it's legally referred to in the United States today: statutory rape.In a sense, Guadagnino doesn't really have to offer up a narrative replete with both multi-dimensional characters and conflict. Instead, the 'courtship dance,' the lugubrious exchange of intimate gestures, appears to be a reaction formation to gay bashing. The idyllic picture of intimacy between gay lovers is designed to reassure the public that gay people are not only capable of great intimacy, but are entitled to it. Despite Guadagnino's denial that Call Me By Your Name is not a 'gay' picture, it fulfills its function as a propaganda (or agitprop if you will) for the gay pride movement.This is borne out by the Elio's permissive father who goes way out on a limb with a long-winded speech to his son, approving of his sexual experimentation with the older partner. The morality is questionable given the ages of the parties involved, but the bigger offense is an aesthetic one: where is the conflict? The father approves, the 'boys' are 'hot' for one another, and despite the wistful, melancholy ending marked by the end of Oliver's vacation (and subsequent call to Elio with the news that he's getting married), nothing much happens between the principals at all. Unless of course a beautiful Hallmark Greeting card is your idea of compelling, realized cinema!",3,127,291,13 November 2017
Gran Torino," Deftly plotted narrative trumps improbable tale of Vigilante's change of heart
","When we first meet Walt Kowalski, the bigoted but lovable curmudgeon played by Clint Eastwood, he's coping with the loss of his wife of many years. During the funeral and reception at the house afterward, his sons are shown having a hard time coping with their father who doesn't have a good word to say about anybody. But soon it's clear that the film's scenarists are setting us up to view Walt as misanthropic but at the same a far better man than his offspring who are busy with their own lives and don't have their father's best interests at heart. Worse is the granddaughter, a narcissistic teenager who shows little sensitivity during a tragic time of grief (the portrait of the detached granddaughter, completely one-dimensional, is designed to contrast with the much more real and sensitive Sue, the young Hmong woman, that Walt is soon to befriend).Sue, played by the excellent Ahney Her, is probably the most engaging character in the film. She's the one who gets Walt to open up as she brings him over to meet her family and introduce him to the Hmong culture. Not only did I enjoy the banter between the two characters but had the distinct impression that Ms. Her was not actingthat she was simply playing herself! Every time Walt would make an ignorant, bigoted remark, she wouldn't get angry but simply contradict him and explain why he was wrong. He opens up to her precisely because of her patience and insight into both her own people and the outside American culture. She's an all-knowing guide and in a sense hearkens back to the 'wisdom' character in the Bible and other ancient writings.To the screenwriters' credit, gang culture is not sanitized. Not only are members of the Hmong gang shown to be what they are (vicious and aimless young people who want to make everybody else's lives miserable) but the black gang members are also shown to be equally vicious. And even better, most of the Gran Torino story is not about the gang members but the relationship between Walt and the two young Hmong people who help him to find some purpose in his life.As the Gran Torino story unfolds, certain things don't ring true. One thing that bothered me quite a bit was Walt's complete ignorance of who the Hmong people were. Here's a guy who presumably has been living in this neighborhood for many years, all his neighbors are Hmong people, and it's up to Sue to explain to him where the Hmong came from. Despite his prejudices, Walt is not a stupid person. He would have known the difference between the Hmong and say the Vietnamese people simply from his conversations with his friends in the neighborhood (such as his friend the barber, the construction foreman or any of his buddies at the various bars he frequents).Gran Torino is full of 'trash talk' mainly emanating from Walt's foul mouth. Walt and his barber friend trade occasionally amusing insults about each other's ethnic identity. Whether such conversations actually take place in real life is another issue (how a barber would actually like a customer who never tips him seems completely far-fetched).Most of the middle of Gran Torino concerns Walt's quest to turn Thao, Sue's brother, into a 'real man'. Thao doesn't have much of a personality like his sister and his gradual transformation from a shy, detached kid into someone who's hardworking and responsible seemed a bit too predictable. It's hard to believe that Thao is such a complete wuss that the macho pep talk from Walt's construction foreman friend will so easily turn him around.The film's climax is the least believable of all the scenes. We're asked first to believe that Walt would jeopardize Thao and Sue's safety by beating up one of the gang members. After all, he's the guy who later locks Thao in the basement after preventing him from impulsively taking revenge on the gang members. But earlier, Walt is the one who commits the impulsive act which leads to Sue being raped.Now he must undo his own mistake. In a nice twist, instead of turning Gran Torino into a typical revenge fantasy, Eastwood's Kowalski offers himself up as a sacrifice in order to prevent further violence. Perhaps 'Dirty Harry' is maturing in his old age. Furthermore, Clint seems to be softening slightly toward the Catholic church (here he's finally willing to go to confession in contrast to his diatribe against the church's stance against mercy killings which was prominent in Eastwood's earlier film, 'Million Dollar Baby').Nonetheless, the filmmaker's desire to give the audience a bittersweet but upbeat ending by suggesting that the gang members will end up being prosecuted rings false. Why would the neighbors suddenly be willing to testify against the gang members when it's established early on that everyone in the neighborhood is petrified of gang retaliation? No, in real life, odds are that the witnesses wouldn't have come forward to testify against the gang members despite Walt's heroic reputation in the neighborhood.Gran Torino is not always honest and goes out of its way to manipulate your emotions. Nonetheless, it's deftly plotted and will keep your attention throughout. That's no small feat. For all its flaws, it's definitely worth seeing.",7,1,7,24 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," Lethal Weapon meets the Iraqi Insurgency
","After reading many posts about 'HL', I've come to the conclusion that members of Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squads in the military are professionals who do a tough job well. There is nothing glamorous about being an EOD but 'Hurt Locker' is determined to give these soldiers the Hollywood treatment. Hence, one might come to the conclusion that there IS something exciting and glamorous about being a member of an EOD squad.SSgt. William James is more like a Mel Gibson loose cannon character from the Lethal Weapon series than a disciplined professional performing a difficult but routine job. Hollywood loves these loose cannon types but such a type does not really fit as a member of an EOD squad. Common sense will tell you that no EOD squad member would try and disarm an IED by going right up to it and cutting the wires with a plier. The bombs are always disposed of from a distance (as shown in the first scene with a robot—before it breaks down) so as not to endanger any soldiers or civilians in the vicinity.Quite a number of people who liked this movie felt there were too many 'quibblers'—that movies are not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's true but there should be a modicum stab at realism, especially when attempting to depict the gritty reality of the Iraq War. When an insurgent attempts to blow up a car loaded with bombs (without also trying to take out the soldiers at the scene) that seems a bit far-fetched. But to make matters worse, the car doesn't blow up even though it's totally on fire. But instead of letting the car burn (which might lead to an eventual explosion), SSgt. James puts the fire out and then disarms the bomb himself, wasting precious time and putting himself and his comrades in harms way.The EOD Squad seems to go everywhere outside their base without an escort. That would never happen in the real Army. What's more, most Army movies have interesting superior officers but not here. There's one good scene where a gung ho Colonel congratulates James for his loose cannon exploits but he's only on for a minute. There is also the Shrink who wants to see what's in like out in the field. Again, without an escort, he ends up the easy victim of an IED.The point is made that James becomes more and more unhinged as he is on the verge of completing his tour of duty. After he finds a boy dead after being tortured in a bomb factory, he mistakes him for another boy who sold DVD's to him in a marketplace. Wholly inappropriately, he kidnaps a merchant from the marketplace who he suspects of tipping off insurgents. Without regard to the consequences, he forces the merchant to drive into town and give him the name of someone who might have given the boy up. He even tells the merchant to wait for him while he goes into the house of an innocent Iraqi family but of course the merchant drives off. The whole pointless enterprise is resolved when the man's wife hits him and he runs out with a huge welt on his forehead. What's more, no one reports James when he returns, even though he's stopped and searched by sentries at the entrance to the base.Things get even more bizarre when James and his fellow EOD squad members are ordered to investigate a tanker explosion in the 'Green Zone' (how a tanker could get into the Green Zone, the most heavily protected area of Baghdad, I have no idea). Anyway, James gets the idea that this was not the work of a suicide bomber but a remote detonation near the scene of the explosion. Without a clue as to who might have been behind the crime, James orders the squad into an adjoining neighborhood where they (implausibly) split up and search for the faceless perpetrators. One of his guys is almost kidnapped but is saved only after James kills the bad guys but ends up shooting his EOD buddy in the leg. Again, James never gets into trouble for his antics and the whole incident never seems to be reported to his superiors.Despite the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest. The depiction of the different kinds of explosive devices the insurgents keep coming up with seems pretty convincing (they even go as far as booby trapping the body of a boy they recently tortured and killed). While pure Hollywood hokum, the denouement, where James attempts to save an Iraqi man who has changed his mind about being a suicide bomber, is pretty exciting (again, no EOD squad member would be allowed to try and save a man in that position since such actions could jeopardize everyone's lives at the scene).While it appears that the film's scenarist did a modicum of homework finding out what's it like to be an EOD member in Iraq, he had little success in developing his characters. The interplay between James and Sgt. Sanborn was clichéd at the beginning, with the conservative Sanborn attempting to keep the wild James in check. Later the conflict dissipates and the relationship devolves into a flaccid buddy flick where the characters are reduced to enjoying themselves by punching each other in the stomach. The shaky hand-held camera technique gives the picture a documentary feel and the dialogue at times seems amateurishly improvised.Although Hurt Locker has been classified as an 'indie' film, it's really a traditional Hollywood picture. While HL doesn't shrink from showing the horrors of war, the protagonist, James, is the typical gung ho American hero that John Wayne would have probably loved. I am willing to forgive Hurt Locker for its implausible moments but sadly there isn't enough conflict generated between the principals to qualify as true art house fare.",5,0,3,19 September 2009
Ex Machina," Boorish antagonist and lack of suspense sinks newbie writer/director's sci-fi indie 'thriller'
","'Ex Machina' is by newbie writer/director Alex Garland. I refuse to get involved in evaluating Mr. Garland's talents as a director but may I jump in and offer an opinion as to his talents as a writer? Unfortunately, you might already guess that my opinion as to Mr. Garland's talent as a screenwriter, is not very high.The problem with 'Ex Machina' plain and simple, is that it lacks suspense. The protagonist is one Caleb, a computer programmer who works for 'Bluebook,' the world's popular search engine which presumably has replaced Google in the future. Caleb is invited by Nathan, the firm's CEO, to his secluded, 'hi-tech' mountain retreat where he is asked to perform a 'Turing test,' on Nathan's sexy (CGI altered) android, Ava. The test involves determining whether the android's 'artificial intelligence' is so advanced, that Caleb is unable to distinguish human from non-human responses. You would think that Oscar Isaac who plays Nathan would be some kind of cool, Steve Jobs character with a touch of Machiavelli. But unfortunately Issac plays Nathan as a bully without a trace of subtlety. Is it Garland's lack of talent as a screenwriter or Issac's own boorish performance that brands Isaac as one of the worst actors of the year?You'll probably guess that the one-note Nathan plans to wipe Ava's memory clean and Caleb will try to help escape from the sealed-in compound. Caleb also discovers that Nathan's personal assistant, Kyoto, is also an android and he also has her 'confined to base.'At a certain point, Nathan learns of his collusion with Ava and warns Caleb that her plans to 'spring the joint' will not involve him. But somehow Caleb anticipates Nathan's uncovering of their plot and disables the compound's security system. Part of the climax is predictable: Nathan further shows off his bad guy credentials by killing Kyoto and ripping Ava's arm off, in an attempt to kill her. But of course the robot is too smart for the bully and stabs him to death. The only twist is that Nathan was right: Ava somehow escapes the retreat and leaves poor schnook Caleb, to die, locked inside Nathan's 'campus.' As Porky Pig would say, 'That's it, folks!' If your thing is one dimensional villains, then 'Ex Machina' is for you. Even the twist of a sexy but unfeeling android, who leaves an undeserved protagonist to 'twist in the wind,' is hardly much of a 'deus ex machina,' to get excited about!",2,104,204,17 May 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A beautiful Hallmark Greeting Card
","From a visual point of view, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is superb. Through the use of digital effects, the past (beginning with Armistice Day, 1918) is brought to life in an extremely realistic way. But unfortunately 'Button' is nothing more than a series of beautiful images. Its story is truly an empty vessel, shallow and ultimately lacking in drama.'Button' is the story of an infant who is born as an old man and ages backward. It's really a fable of sorts and it's not intended to be based completely on real history. Hence, from the very beginning, the viewer is forced to accept its absurd premise.The screenplay was written by the same writer responsible for 'Forrest Gump' and the stories are strikingly similar. They both focus on an odd protagonist who doesn't fit into mainstream society. They both go through a series of adventures that shape the protagonist's character. Benjamin Button is even more passive than Gump. Everything happens to him and he initiates very little.While 'Button' is a fable, history is still given short shrift. It's a film that pretends to encompass the entire sweeping arc of American history from World War I to Hurricane Katrina. History however is only alluded to through brief asides (like FDR's Pearl Harbor speech on the radio or the Beatles popping up on TV). Although Button is reared in New Orleans during the Jim Crow days, the issue of racial prejudice is never dealt with.If you were to take away the entire 'gimmick' of this film, the novel idea of a man aging backward, you're left with a story that isn't even half as good as some of those Douglas Silk melodramas of the 40s and 50s. All the characters in Benjamin Button are weak and completely underdeveloped as people. What do we find out about the British woman Benjamin Button is having an affair with while he's staying in Russia? Nothing except that her husband is a spy. Button has an affair with her. So what! And what of Kate Blanchett's Daisy? She's another bore who's a ballet dancer, is hit by a car ruining her career and eventually getting married to another man. Why should we care about any of these characters? I ended up spending much more time paying attention to how the filmmakers applied their special effects to Brad Pitt's face than concentrating on the story. If one ends up concentrating mainly on the special effects to the detriment of the story, I think it's safe to say that 'Benjamin Button' is a failure.I'm willing to give this film four stars due to its magnificent art design, music and overall look. Given its plodding plot and pessimistic view of life (Button ends up with Alzheimer's!), the Academy Award for Best Picture is not a lock. Let's hope it's soundly voted down!",4,8,16,25 December 2008
Hidden Figures," Little nuance as female African-American NASA pioneers receive long overdue recognition
","If you like your American History etched in a simplistic black and white, then perhaps Hidden Figures is for you. But if you require your historical 'cup of tea' to be much more nuanced, with decided 'shades of gray,' then this entertaining yarn about three African-American women and their under-appreciated contribution to NASA's space race, might not be the accurate and important film that a majority of the critics and attentive film-goers believe it to be.It's 1961 when Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) and Katherine G Johnson (Taraji P Henson), show up at NASA headquarters located at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. In Director Theodore Melfi's conception, Langley becomes a symbol of the racism of the times but in employing dramatic license, he makes it much worse than it actually was.Take for example the segregated bathroom facilities—they were already eliminated by NASA three years earlier in 1958—so the scene where Kevin Costner's 'Al Harrison' character utilizes a sledgehammer to take down the 'coloreds only' sign, never happened. Nor did Katherine Johnson ever go to the segregated toilets—she used the whites only bathroom for years and was only challenged once—and on that occasion she merely ignored the objection and continued using the bathroom unopposed. According to the non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly which the film was based on, Johnson was quoted as saying that she was aware of racism but while working at Langley never 'FELT' it. To her, she was just doing her job. And as far as being barred from joining the special Space Task Group, the truth of the matter was that she received the promotion in 1958 after working in the Flight Research Division for five years, beginning in 1953. She even co-authored a report while part of the Space Task Group in 1960.Unlike Johnson who didn't feel like she was a victim of discrimination, Mary Jackson did indeed have to use separate bathroom facilities before 1958 (although the half a mile hike to get to the bathroom was an exaggeration). She didn't however, have to obtain a court order to take engineering courses—so the dramatic scene before the Judge was again a fictional construct. Instead she merely asked for an exemption and it was granted. And the actual promotion to engineer took place three years earlier—note that this is seven years before the passage of the Civil Rights Act.Much is made in the film of how Dorothy Vaughn was passed over for a promotion to supervisor, opposed by her own supervisor, Mrs. Mitchell, a bigoted white woman who is depicted as patronizing. While Mitchell is a fictional character, it's even more shocking to learn that Dorothy became a supervisor in 1948! She also joined an integrated team in 1958, the year that NASA's name was changed from its previous acronym— NACA (The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics).Jim Parsons rounds out the film's collection of composite characters, playing the head engineer, Paul Stafford. He's there not as a symbol of racism but of male chauvinism—he's insistent on preventing Katherine from entering the room where the all-male Pentagon briefings are held.Hidden Figures fulfills its well- intentioned, feel-good mission as it chronicles Katherine Johnson's role in the early space missions, as she provides complex mathematical calculations for Alan Shepherd's first US manned flight and John Glenn's first orbit of the earth.The point of course is that the contributions of African-Americans to American history have often been ignored and the film's scenarists rightfully are determined to set the record straight and provide recognition where recognition has been long so overdue. In that respect, the film has accomplished a worthwhile goal.The highly attractive Taraji P Henson, donning eyeglasses, steals the show as the former child prodigy, who proves to her colleagues that race and gender are no impediment to performing a job well done—especially when that job entails understanding those complex set of mathematical calculations beyond the scope of the average person.The curmudgeon in me recognizes the bigger picture here involving the space race—what some discerning critics might classify as a 'sacred cow.' While I don't want to disparage the contributions of such brave individuals as John Glenn—it's necessary to recognize there's something much more sinister afoot here—and that is man's capacity for self-deception.After all the space program really is a relic—In the early 60s, everything was geared toward putting a man on the moon. We managed to accomplish that—planting the flag, collecting a few rocks—but after that, everything has been anti-climactic. Indeed, we are no closer to answering the age-old question, are we alone in the universe?I was shocked to see Katherine Johnson at the Academy Awards recently. Sitting in her wheelchair, it appeared time has certainly taken its toll on the once vibrant mathematician. The necessity and satisfaction in acknowledging minority contributions to our overall history pales in comparison to recognizing the fact of our inviolability of life here on earth—the rock group Kansas put it best when they sung, we'll all be soon like 'dust in the wind.'",5,5,11,28 February 2017
1917," Riveting World War I spectacle proves purist critics wrong!
","Generally the majority of the reviews of 1917 have been positive. But one of the chief arguments against the film among the negative reviews is that somehow director Sam Mendes has sanitized the war-it's described as an 'empty spectacle' or designed in effect as 'eye candy' for 'thrill seekers.'
I can only push back against these views as Mendes's 'spectacle' is meant primarily to be entertaining. How can any film truly depict the horrors of war? By the very nature of cinematic art, there is going to be some distancing and in the case of a film about World War I, what better way to convey (in some measure) the utter pointlessness of that particular conflict then by creating an exciting story of two 'everyman' soldiers, racing against time to prevent catastrophe?
This whole idea that many of the soldiers' recollections (including Mendes's own grandfather, on whom the film is loosely based) cannot be viewed simply in the context of their sense of adventure, is just plain wrong. As depicted in the film, a certain amount of suppression of feelings had to take place, just so the soldiers could carry on. Hence, 1917 is both a tale of adventure and cautionary tale about war.
1917 also has been edited to suggest one continuous take, as though everything is happening in real time. Whether this is merely a gimmick, or adds to the overall verisimilitude, remains open to debate.
The inciting incident occurs when a General orders Blake to hand deliver a message to Blake's brother's battalion (miles away), to call off a planned attack on the Germans, who have actually reinforced their position, thus setting a trap for them. Before he finds out the nature of the mission, Blake selects the more cynical Schofield who ends up accompanying him into no-man's land. All we know mainly about Schofield is that he traded a good bottle of wine for a medal he previously received-much to the chagrin of the more straight-laced Blake.
So yes, Blake and Schofield aren't very developed characters but they really don't need to be. Mendes introduces their 'ordinary world' as the trenches, where they exist most of the time, until being called to attack German positions. The two intrepid soldiers leave the ordinary world when they climb out of the trenches and make their way into no man's land.
There's enough here at least to suggest some of the horrors of World War I including all the dead horses strewn about the bombed out landscape along with masses of rats and dead bodies-their faces eaten away by maggots. You can say that our protagonists are initially tested in the first half of the second act 'call to adventure,' when they enter abandoned German trenches, which they must navigate through, in order to push forward toward their destination.
Blake's competence as a soldier is highlighted when he saves Schofield after a mouse hits a trip wire causing a tremendous explosion in the trenches which reach underground. It's something unexpected and keeps us glued to the screen.
The midpoint of the film comes early, in another extremely suspenseful scene-a German airplane is shot down and crashes a few feet from Blake and Schofield who have been making their way through an abandoned farmhouse.
Schofield reaches the 'point of no return' when the German pilot stabs Blake to death after they pull him out of a burning plane. It's another shocking reversal and the mark of good creative screenwriting.
The second half leading to the second act crisis is not as well thought out. Mendes has Schofield picked up by a passing British platoon and illustrates the difficulties of transportation during World War I (a truck gets stuck in the mud and must be extricated) along with an illustration on how soldiers must suppress their feelings in order to function (as the soldiers tell bawdy stories inside the truck, the camera focuses close-up on Schofield, who obviously is trying to contain his emotions, after experiencing the death of Blake, his friend and fellow soldier).
Schofield's dark moment, his second act crisis, involves direct combat with the Germans-first he must pick off a sniper and later, inside a bombed out French town, strangle a German soldier and escape another one, who fires at him incessantly with a rifle.
In between, Schofield provides provisions to a French woman who is caring for an infant-it's a scene designed to show Schofield's humanity and make him more sympathetic. But what about all those shots fired at Schofield during this sequence?-yes he's initially injured by a ricocheting bullet but later all the bullets fired at him, miss their mark!
The improbable escape (which still features a neat, eerily lit town from flares and unattended fires), leads to another improbable (third act) escape, as Schofield must survive a wild trip down the cascading rapids of a river (this scene also proves to be not particularly original).
1917 ends with an exciting climax as Schofield reaches the beleaguered battalion right before they advance on German positions. The way in which he must deliver the general's orders to the company commander, Mackenzie, is riveting and equally poignant when he ends up informing Blake's brother of the sad news of Blake's death.
Not everything in 1917 proves to be completely believable but this is a very solid film which manages to both entertain and (in small measure) convey the horrors of 'the war to end all wars.'",8,8,12,17 January 2020
Lincoln," Spielberg's narrow in scope hagiography can't hold a candle to 1988 Gore Vidal TV mini-series
","After reading approximately 200 books on the subject, Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter, playwright Tony Kushner, decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment, rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently, Spielberg concurred, concluding that a full-blown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three and a half hour spectacle, covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life, beginning with the first Inauguration, with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively (Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln' come to mind).First and foremost, what's missing here is little sense of Lincoln's brilliance as a master politician. Since most of the movie focuses on the machinations in the House of Representatives, focusing on the fight over the passage of the 13th Amendment, Lincoln's input is minimal. Tommy Lee Jones, as Radical Republican, Thaddeus Stevens, steals the show with his brilliant performance as the fiery abolitionist representative, who ends up giving up his quest for equal rights for blacks in order to have slavery abolished, with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Spielberg's opus is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, 'Team of Rivals'--but where is the 'team'? All the fascinating characters from Lincoln's cabinet are missing interacting with one another. In the Gore Vidal movie, both Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Chase's political ambitions are dissected and we actually get a sense of what their personalities are like. Here, David Strathairn as Seward, stands around with nothing much to do as Lincoln's adviser. Lincoln actually had to balance the conflicting positions and personalities of the members of his cabinet. This is effectively conveyed in both Gore Vidal's novel and TV adaptation but not at all in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'.Wonderful peripheral figures who are an integral part of the Lincoln story are lost due to Spielberg and Kushner's onerous decision to ignore the earlier history. The 1988 biopic includes them: Kate Chase, Salmon Chases' daughter, who married the 'boy governor' of Rhode Island; millionaire businessman turned General, William Sprague; Senator Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's debate rival; Billy Herndon, Lincoln's former law partner and McClellan, Lincoln's failed first general, who later opposed him in the Election of 1864.Spielberg is more interested in the arcane: focusing on the minor figures from the House of Representatives--now lost to history. Spielberg and Kushner spend so much time on the vote in the House of Representatives, as if this is the defining moment of Lincoln's presidency. Perhaps from a modern perspective, yes! But I found it hard to believe that the bells were chiming and there were was a giant parade in pro-rebel Washington, D.C., on the day the 13th Amendment was passed. The real cheering was on April 9, 1865, when the South surrendered. The end of the war was of course the main concern of the people of the time, not necessarily the abolition of slavery.Watching Spielberg's 'Lincoln', one can hardly realize that there was indeed a dark side to our 16th President. The suspension of Habeas Corpus and Lincoln's prosecution of political enemies without due process of law, is an aspect of the Lincoln presidency hardly addressed in Spielberg's flattering hagiography. Lincoln's view of African-Americans was decidedly less progressive than Spielberg lets on here. Even shortly before the end of the Civil War, Lincoln was still entertaining schemes of colonization for blacks in South America and Africa.And what of Mary Todd Lincoln? Sally Field looks a lot more like Mary Todd than Mary Tyler Moore did in the 1988 mini-series, but Moore truly turns the President's wife into a fully-realized character. With Kushner's sketchy script, Field only is able to touch upon a few of the major points of Mary Todd's life in the White House. In the Gore Vidal movie, we actually get to see and FEEL the devastating effect son Willie's death had upon her, as it occurs in real time. Here (like so many of the earlier events during the Lincoln Presidency), it is only alluded to. What's more, Mary Todd's meltdowns (probably today characterized as 'bipolar') are only tangentially dealt with, as opposed to the earlier TV movie, where they are an integral part of the story.Kushner creates a non-part for the character of Elizabeth Keckley, the African-American dressmaker turned servant to Mary Todd Lincoln. In the 1988 biopic, there's actually a relationship shown between the two women, with Keckley morphing into a confidante, in effect acting as a sounding board for Mary Todd Lincoln's actual views on slavery. In Spielberg's 'Lincoln', there's an unlikely scene where Keckley confronts Lincoln on the front porch of the White House, musing about the future fate of African Americans in the U.S.Daniel Day Lewis is as good as Sam Waterston but unfortunately he just doesn't have a good script to work with. Probably the best scene in the film is the confrontation between Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens in the White House pantry. But because none of the other 'team of rivals' is developed, Lincoln has hardly anyone to play off of here. Spielberg's attempt to examine Lincoln's personal life also falls flat. The melodramatic scene where he slaps son Robert, feels completely out of character! Before you praise Spielberg's 'Lincoln' to the hilt, go out and purchase Gore Vidal's Lincoln. It's only $4.89 at deepdiscountdvd.com and Sam Waterston is simply excellent as the politician and the man, warts and all! As usual, Spielberg's production values far outshine the low budget efforts on television. Ultimately, one should expect more from the famed director instead of his narrow focus on such an iconic figure.",5,123,224,12 November 2012
Big Hero 6," Only the animation team has integrity as obnoxious 'superheros' battle unpleasant professor villain in a mythical 'San Fransokyo'
","'Big Hero 6' is based on an obscure Marvel comic series that was adapted by Disney and reconfigured into a 3D computer-animated superhero comedy. The characters function in San Fransokyo, a mash-up obviously of San Francisco and Tokyo. At first I thought this might be a city in a future USA where somehow Japanese culture became overwhelmingly influential but it turns out the city is entirely mythical (wouldn't it have been more realistic to use China as a model for some kind of future transfiguration?).Nevertheless, the protagonist here is Hiro Himada, a 14 year old Japanese-American robotics prodigy. I could buy the idea that the kid has developed a small robot that he uses to win cash in illegal, back alley robot fights, but what comes next strained my credulity. After Hiro's brother Tadashi saves him from a bunch of rough characters who have been engaging in robot fights on the streets, he takes him to the university where he attends, which specializes in advanced robotics. Since Hiro has a rebellious streak, he never got around to checking out the university, which is right up his alley. Oddly, to be accepted, academic performance is not considered, but rather the fledging thespian must develop a robotics project which impresses the faculty.Hiro ends up developing a project involving 'microbots' which swarm together to form any structure imaginable. The whole idea of the university is to help the student create the next great technical innovation. Hiro, however, has already done it, so why does he have to attend a university to improve on his capabilities? Nonetheless, when he's offered the chance to sell out to tech guru Alistar Krei of the new rising tech company, Krei Tech, he goes with Professor Callaghan at the University. 'Big Hero Six' begins its march toward complete unpleasantness, when Hidashi dies in a fire at the university. Callaghan saves himself by encasing himself in a swarm of microbots during the fire. While at first Krei appears to be the villain, it soon becomes apparent that Callaghan becomes a much bigger antagonist. He blames Krei for the apparent death of his daughter during a failed teleportation experiment. Very conveniently, Callaghan uses Hiro's microbots to attempt to destroy Krei and his company.Hiro attempts to stop Callaghan by enlisting the aid of Tadashi's last creation, Baymax, a robot that resembles the Pillsbury Dough Boy. Baymax has a computer chip that turns him into a kindly physician, who can both diagnose and treat virtually any illness. Hiro is also aided by Tadashi's team of student colleagues who morph into superheros with Hiro, replete with special costumes (a la 'The Avengers').The last third of the picture involves tiresome battle sequences where the superhero team is pitted against Callaghan and the microbots. When the vengeful, obsessed professor is finally subdued, we're treated to the completely awkward discovery that his daughter was in stasis the whole time inside a worm hole, and is saved—only to see her idiotic father being hauled away by the police, and probably sent up the river for years due to his myopic thirst for revenge.Hiro learns his 'lesson' after first switching Baymax's microchip, transforming him into a violent robot with enhanced karate skills, only to suddenly realize that he was echoing Professor Callaghan's proclivities toward vengefulness and realizing he needed to turn the robot back into a kindly, attending physician.For aficionados of violent video games, a good deal of 'Big Hero Six' is for you. The painstaking animation goes all for naught when one discovers that the film is devoid of charm. Everyone and everything is obnoxious: from 'kick-ass' Hiro to Betamax, where the medical profession is put up on a pedestal. From brother Tadashi's death, to the most unpleasant Callaghan, who insanely attempts to 'get even' after an accident, this is a film that is hardly appropriate for children. If you must see it, do so for the excellent animation team—they, as opposed to the screenwriters, still have some integrity left.",4,64,174,30 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Major liberties taken with some of Turing's real life story doesn't bother, but take on his homosexuality does perhaps slightly
","Creating a screenplay based on the biography of Alan Turing, was by no means an easy feat. Had it only been about cracking Nazi Germany's 'Enigma' code, screenwriter Graham Moore, would probably be at a loss to make the whole thing work dramatically. But wisely Moore includes flashbacks to Turing's early days at an English boarding school as well as flash forwards over his tragic fall from grace regarding his then-banned homosexual lifestyle.Nonetheless, it's instructive to ask how accurate 'The Imitation Game' is as Slate Magazine asks in an article of the same name. Is it true, as Dana Stevens states in Slate, 'The Imitation Game doesn't do right by the complex and often unlovable man it purports to be about.' Stevens read Andrew Hodges' biography of Turing and noted how Turing's true story differed in major ways from the way in which he was depicted in the film.Stevens 'discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park.' Should we conclude that Turing's story was substantially compromised due to what Stevens terms, 'major liberties' taken? The question should be re-framed: if major liberties weren't taken, could the screenwriter have made it work at all?One of Stevens' big objections is that the Bombe, the big ticking machine Turing is supposed to have invented himself, actually was created by a Polish scientist. What's more, Turing collaborated with another scientist on the machine's design (which is not even mentioned in the film). This seems like a minor point as the film is about Turing and playing with the biographical facts in such a way, hardly seems like much of a sin. Of more concern is Stevens' charge that Cumberbatch's depiction of Turing as narcissistic and detached has 'more in common with the actor's title character in Sherlock than with the Turing of Hodges' biography.' Stevens indicates that the real Turing was 'very approachable' and the men at Bletchley Park, were very fond of him. Turing was eccentric to a certain degree and adding in a degree of narcissism, didn't detract from the drama, in my opinion, but may have added to it.Stevens concedes that were a good number of real incidents incorporated into the film (the young Turing being nailed under the floorboards by bullies, as well as a romantic interest in a boy at the boarding school). Stevens quibbles that there is no mention in Hodges' biography about Turing's obsession with separating the peas and the carrots.While Stevens takes issue with the depiction of Commander Deniston as a rigid naval officer who at one point attempts to fire Turing, he concedes that the made-up conflict between the two men is a 'stand in for a real-life power struggle between the military brass and the cryptologists.' Stevens notes that, 'Turing's colleagues there recalled that Turing 'was always impatient of pompousness or officialdom of any kind,' which made him ill-suited for work in a military context, and Hodges writes that he 'had little time for Denniston.' Turing's note to Churchill which got the project additional funding and put him in a charge, never happened. But Hugh Alexander, one of the principals there, along with a few colleagues, did write to Churchill successfully requesting more staff and resources in 1941.As far as Hugh Alexander, Turing's rival in the film, Stevens notes that Alexander didn't work with Turing until a year went by and there was none of that conflict between them as depicted in the film. Alexander was a diplomat, which contrasted with Turing's lack of ability in that department. Still, creating a rivalry between the two, seems within the purview of standard dramatic license. The same goes for Turing's relationship with Joan Clarke, the only female mathematician who is part of the team. Clarke did accept Turing's homosexuality but of course the violent argument between them never happened. Still I would argue, creating an argument for dramatic purpose, does not detract from the narrative's overall effect.One point in the film which never took place and seems a bit forced is when one of the team's members, Peter, begs Turing to save his brother, who is on a supply ship, about to be torpedoed by the Germans. This is after Turing and the team have cracked Enigma but refuse to save the brother, as alerting the ship, may tip off the Germans. In a film like this, the narrative depends on invented dramatic moments, and again, this is another necessary, albeit forced, example.'The Imitation Game' still has been the subject of some legitimate criticism. Amy Nicholson finds the treatment of Turing's homosexuality to be sanitized: 'Despite its brusque lead, The Imitation Game is too mannerly to ask Cumberbatch to act on Turing's feelings. There's no flirtation, kissing, nothing that even hints that Turing ever felt the jolt of sexual electricity that would prod him to, at 39, sleep with the 19-year-old hustler who burgled his house and got him arrested. (That, too, happens off screen.) Turing is kept tweedy and neutered, as closeted in celluloid as he was in real life... The plotting goes for surprise over struggle. Tyldum has robbed his own film of emotional depth — this Turing is as simple as Morse code. Rather than a complex human portrait, this is an assemblage of triumphs, tragedies and tics.'Gregory Ellwood also echos Nicholson's criticism: 'In effect, much of Turing's gay life is completely washed over. He says he had numerous affairs/lovers, but the film pushes the central relationship between his one-time fiancé Clarke as the most prominent.'Despite the historical liberties, screenwriter Moore has done a reasonably good job in telling Turing's heroic story. One only wishes Moore dealt with Turing's homosexuality in a more straightforward manner.",6,1,5,12 January 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Triumph of style over substance
","There is no doubt that Quentin Tarrantino is an extremely talented director in terms of editing, cinematography and the overall look of a film. Just take the extraordinary scene in Kill Bill, amazingly choreographed, where Uma Thurman dispatches over a hundred swordsman in a matter of minutes. It's simply incredible! What's more Tarrantino as one of the masters of film history, takes his knowledge of film genres and improves on each one of them. He mixes all kinds of styles including Kung Fu, Japanese Samurai and Anime, Italian Spaghetti Westerns and the Black Exploitation films of the 70s and comes up with his own inventive hybrid.Despite the sheer inventiveness of Kill Bill, Vol. 1, it's really an exercise in style over substance. Tarrantino is more interested in creating an homage to these various genres as opposed to a parody. And I think that's the problem. Notice there are virtually no laughs in Kill Bill (unless you consider all the exaggerated decapitations and limbs being chopped off to be funny). Tarrantino actually takes delight in these Grade C gorefests of yesteryear and attempts to elevate these pictures to high art. Instead of trying to emulate a great master like Ingmar Bergman, Tarrantino chooses to revel in the mindless violence of Samurai swordsman and Kung Fu fighters. Most of it is harmless stuff, the kind of mindless action scenes that most adolescents will take delight in. But occasionally Tarrantino crosses the line into the netherworld of bad taste. I'm thinking of that wholly inappropriate scene toward the beginning of the picture when Uma Thurman kills one of her rivals with a young child watching.It's quite clear from the outset that character motivation is virtually ignored in Kill Bill, Vol. 1. As Uma Thurman's 'Bride' dispatches members and underlings of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', we come to learn that she has taken revenge on the associates of 'Bill' after he betrays her at her own wedding. We never learn the circumstances as to why the Bride is betrayed. Occasionally Tarrantino serves up a few surprises such as when the orderly allows 'customers' to rape the comatose Uma or Matsumoto's pedophilia (the crime lord who Lucy Liu does in). But overall there are few surprises in 'Volume 1'; we move from one revenge killing to another--all the frenzied killing scenes tend to bleed (no pun intended) into one another.Vol. 2 supposedly provides the back story but what we're left with in Volume 1 are comic book characters who we simply cannot care about. Everyone is fearless as they try to do one another in. In Tarrantino's comic book world, the guardians of morality are powerless—that's why law enforcement only makes the briefest of appearances at the beginning of the film.When The Bride travels to Okinawa and meets her mentor, Hattori Hanzo, I found that all the pious pronouncements about the spirituality of the Samurai to be pretentious and out of place in a film that places the highest value on dismemberment for its own sake. What's more, all the serious pseudo-spirituality slows the pacing of the film down considerably.Tarrantino represents the embodiment of the American cinema today. He's exciting, technically savvy with a healthy respect for the history of film. But at the same time, his films only offer up a superficial and seductive examination of evil in the world today. If Tarrantino was a comedian, he best could be likened to the Three Stooges—his adroitly choreographed gorefests are akin to the Stooges' pie-in-the-face slapstick routines. Tarrantino is the perennial adolescent continually caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is nice to look at but is much easier on the eyes than on the mind.",5,4,7,15 June 2009
Cold War," Downbeat post-WW II tale of obsessed sad sack composer/musician, unable to let go of old flame
","Maybe there's a pattern here. This year's foreign language Oscar darlings, Roma and Cold War, appear to have so much in common. Helmed by noted directors (in the case of Cold War, Pawel Pawlikowski), both films feature brilliant, haunting cinematography and memorable soundtracks (in Roma it's all ambient sound; in Cold War a mixture of great Polish folk music, orchestral pieces and jazz). But both directors have taken on the task of writing the screenplay themselves. Result: protagonists who simply don't engage.
In Roma, director Alfonso Cuarón puts Cleo, his maid heroine, up on a pedestal. Pawlikowski, in contrast, turns Wiktor Warski (Tomasz Kot), his hero music ethnographer turned music conservatory head in 1949 Poland, into a lovesick sad sack. When he meets Zula (Joanna Kulig), a much younger aspiring vocalist trying out for the conservatory and its touring company, sparks begin to fly between the two principals.
Pawlikowski then reveals what happens to the couple over time-years continue to pass indicated by convenient title cards with the lovebirds indubitably showing up together in different locations including Warsaw, East Berlin, Paris and somewhere in Yugoslavia.
Pawlikowski manages to keep our interest for a while with a shady antagonist: the duplicitous apparatchik Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc), the administrator at the Conservatory. Under his watchful eyes (with his orders couched as mere suggestions), Wiktor is forced to include homages to Stalin in his musical program, which are presented at various cities in Europe and behind the Iron Curtain as his talented group shows off impressive musical and choreographed showpieces.
The break into the Second Act occurs when Wiktor, feeling artistically constricted by his Communist overseers, decides to defect to Paris. Similar to a scene in Casablanca, Zula fails to show up at the appointed hour as he expects her to leave Poland, and is completely crushed. Wiktor takes up playing jazz piano in Paris in smoky night clubs and later finds decent work scoring movie soundtracks.
But still the once passionate couple continue to meet over the years, making love and then leaving one another again and again. Despite his crush on Zula, there's also a wellspring of anger toward her, undoubtedly as a result of Zula's decision not to join him outside their native country.
The lovers eventually take up with other partners and in Zula's case, ends up having an affair with a friend of Wiktor in Paris. This appears to unhinge the former Conservatory head even more. At one point he's almost seen stalking his ex-lover by showing up in Yugoslavia where she's now a successful singer. The first time he's put on a train back to Paris by apparent Soviet agents but the next time he decides to go and see her, he's arrested in Poland and imprisoned. Zula, now married to Kaczmarek, uses her influence to get her old flame released.
Should we really care about Wiktor's creepy obsession? The answer is clearly no. His motives always seem to be of the one-note variety, expressing his 'passion' and then undermining his desires reflexively. Sad sacks never make for good drama but Pawlikowski hits the final nail into the coffin by also turning Zula into the spitting image of her once exalted Wiktor, joining him in downbeat heaven. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Should we be impressed by the joint suicide that takes place at film's end? Again the answer is a resounding 'no.'
There is no doubt Pawlikowski is a very talented director whose grasp of the visual medium is quite assured. In addition, he does well in presenting the oppressive atmosphere in post-war Poland. At best, Wiktor's obsession is a cautionary tale for the viewer. But Pawlikowski holds up all of this as some kind of epic tragedy. Since there is no complexity to his protagonist's motives, in the end, we film-goers (so impressed by the director's visual talents) ultimately feel let down as the air seeps out of the film's proverbial bag.",5,4,9,4 February 2019
Prisoners," An exciting serial killer thriller but I had trouble believing torture victim wouldn't crack
","Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is back with another densely plotted movie with 'Prisoners'. His 2011 'Incendies' was interesting but ultimately full of too many scenes which forced the viewer to suspend one's disbelief, one too many times. 'Prisoners' also has some questionable plot points but it's eminently more entertaining than Incendies.Villeneuve proffers up an interesting protagonist, Keller Dover (played by an intense Hugh Jackman), a survivalist type, who has no compunctions about teaching his son how to shoot a deer, on a hunting trip, depicted at the beginning of the film. While Jackman has a lot to work with depicting the hot-head Keller, Terrence Howard has little to do playing Franklin Birch, Keller's exact opposite: a passive (and thinly drawn) middle class black professional. The break into Act II occurs when Keller's and Birch's daughters are abducted after disappearing from the Birch family home. Since an RV was parked right near where the girls disappeared, the driver ends up as the number one suspect. The police soon track the driver down at a rest stop and he tries to escape by eluding a police blockade with his RV. The driver turns out to be Alex Jones, who on the surface appears to be mentally feeble. When Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) can find no evidence linking Alex to the girls' abduction and concludes he doesn't have the mental capacity to kidnap the girls, he's forced to release him, and allow him to return to the residence of Holly Jones, his aunt, a creepy senior, expertly played by Melissa Leo.A good deal of 'Prisoners' revolves around Keller's abduction and subsequent imprisonment of Alex, who he believes knows where the kidnapped girls are. Keller insists that Alex told him 'they didn't cry until I left them,' when Keller tries to choke him at the time he's released by the police, in front of a multitude of TV news reporters (no one else hears what Alex says to Keller). Before discussing the issue of Alex's refusal to talk, there are two red herrings in the plot, designed to throw you off track. Both involve Detective Loki's interaction with two suspects. The first is a priest who's on parole for a sex crime—out of the blue Loki finds a bound, deceased man in the priest's basement. The priest claims that he was forced to kill the man after he revealed (during confession) that he was a serial killer, who would kill again. Later, Loki chases after a suspicious man seen at a vigil for the missing girls, in front of the Birch's home. He turns out to be a wannabe serial killer, Taylor, who breaks into the family houses of real serial killer's victims and steals their clothes. Loki, who supposedly has solved all of his cases, blows this one, after Taylor grabs one of Loki's deputy's guns and shoots himself in the mouth.Even if you believe in both these incredible turn of events, one is hard pressed to believe in the film's main premise—that Alex would refuse to talk, despite being tortured for days by Keller. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. One of the arguments that Alex doesn't talk is because he is mentally handicapped. But that's debunked by the points Keller raises—he knew about the girls and told Keller; he tried to escape from the police in his RV and had a driver's license and was able to drive.Another reason (which seems to be suggested by the filmmakers) is that he's under the spell of Aunt Holly and is either a) afraid of her, b) evil like her, or c) both. He seemingly is given a free pass at film's end, despite Keller's statement that he confessed that he basically knew where the girls were (the free pass may be due to the fact that Keller's credibility was completely suspect, by breaking the law by abducting him). Still, while possible, I still think it's unlikely that Alex would never have turned against the old lady. Think of the child abduction case of Steven Stayner. He was imprisoned for seven years but when given the opportunity, he escaped and saved a newly abducted child. Alex was the first child abducted by Holly and her husband and the filmmakers would like us to believe he was psychologically beholden to his captor. But in real life, the Stayner case proves the opposite. I would like to think the desire for freedom would still burn in Alex's breast and his abduction by Keller would have been the perfect opportunity for him to spill the beans about his aunt. By confessing, he's smart enough to know that Aunt Holly would immediately be taken into custody and he would not have to be afraid of her anymore.Prisoners represents a critique of those who embrace the survivalist mentality and act as vigilantes. We expect Keller to save his daughter but actually Detective Loki does so after racing to the hospital and saving Keller's daughter from poisoning (Loki's big car race is not that exciting, since the outcome is pretty much expected). Instead, Keller underestimates Holly who turns out to be responsible for the girls' abduction as well as numerous other serial killings. Keller ends up in that hole and my interpretation of the abrupt (but clever) ending, is that he WILL rescue Keller, and let him face the music.'Prisoners' indeed will drag you into its electrically-charged story and keep you at the edge of your seat to the end. The supporting players, those who play the wives and children of Keller and Franklin, do quite well, but are saddled by underdeveloped parts. Ultimately, you will have to overlook the red herrings and the main premise that the feeble (or perhaps not so feeble) Alex, will not crack under torture. I prefer to believe that he would, as most people would in that situation.",7,1,3,30 March 2014
The Dark Knight," Convoluted plot and lack of humor sinks overlong exercise in self-indulgent nastiness
","Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop—they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop). After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the one's who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face'.The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum—that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.",2,11,25,15 April 2010
Friends with Benefits," Clueless commitmentphobes transformed in old fashioned morality tale masquerading as urban comedy
","Jamie is an executive recruiter who recruits Dylan, a young, up and coming art director for a small internet company in Los Angeles, to come to NYC and work for the much more high powered GQ Magazine. Before this happens, there's a prologue showing their back story: both are going through another unsuccessful relationship with a member of the opposite sex. When Jamie and Dylan meet each other for the first time, they're both jaded, as they've been burned one too many times, in their quest for 'true romance'.While getting to know each other, they watch a parody of a romcom (romantic comedy) on TV, both bemoaning the pitfalls of traditional courtships and wondering perhaps how they can circumvent all the complications associated with traditional romance. They forge an unlikely friendship where they can avoid any kind of commitment in the relationship and simply enjoy sex for its own sake. Hence, the 'benefits' is the satisfaction of having the sexual relationship without the commitment.Soon, the film's scenarists strategy of setting us up for an old fashioned morality tale, becomes clear. The 'friends with benefits' program--that is, sex without commitment, is only part and parcel of a larger overall problem with the personalities of our protagonists. Jamie and Dylan are unfortunately narcissistic, coarse and immature.The film's scenarists would like us to laugh at Jamie and Dylan, as they expose their foibles in the first thirty minutes or so. Jamie, the perennial go-getter, obnoxiously puts down Dylan, who extols the virtues of wide-open, west coast living as opposed to what he regards as the cramped living style of New Yorkers (the put-down becomes clear when Jamie sarcastically cracks, 'What are you, a Gazelle?).If Jamie's coarseness is off-putting, it pales in comparison to Dylan's complete cluelessness. Dylan is so narcissistic that he simply can't understand why he's so wrong about Captain Sully. People rightly perceive that he's stubborn and ignorant when he claims 'planes fly themselves'. In reality, Captain Sully's plane was almost completely disabled due to the bird strike and could not possibly fly itself. So he's wrong on that count and 'tunes out' all those who are justifiably angry with him.Dylan's myopic 'Sully stance' is indicative of what's wrong with the first third of the film. By trying to 'humanize' the characters, exposing them as deeply flawed human beings, the film's scenarists have gone too far and made them out to be decidedly unlikeable. Somehow the Sully joke needed to be lighter and not cast Dylan in such a negative light. That way, we would care more about him at the end, when he finally does redeem himself. The same goes for Jamie whose constant use of expletives coupled with her overreaching competitiveness, also casts her in a negative light, during the expository sequences.The failed comedy of exposing the two 'losers' who adopt the self-defeating 'friends with benefits' program becomes a much more traditional romance in Act II and III, not unlike the 'film within a film' parody of the romcom the two lovers watch and disparage early on. It doesn't take long for Jamie to have true feelings for Dylan, after he invites her to California to meet his family and they have an intimate tryst. But Dylan remains locked in his fear of commitment and after Jamie overhears him putting her down while talking with his sister, the third act crisis is precipitated.It takes a little while longer before Dylan redeems himself by realizing how selfish he's been, but with the aid of two key allies, he finally sees the light. The allies who counsel Dylan are of course, Tommy, his gay co-worker, delightfully played by Woody Harrelson and Dylan's Alzheimer's afflicted father, Mr. Harper (solidly and convincingly played by Richard Jenkins).Couldn't you guess, but despite Mr. Harper's fluctuating memory loss, he manages to impart to his son, a tale of long lost love which turns out to be the big lesson here: don't let your best shot at love slip away.It's all very predictable and sentimental but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do seem to exude some chemistry, working together. I only wish their characters were a little less alienating and a little more gregarious in the first thirty to forty minutes.In the end, 'Benefits' can only live up to its billing for its romance and not its comedy. Simply put, there's nothing funny about obnoxious, clueless people. But once these protagonists are transformed, they do become a bit more likable. Still, is this rather predictable 'love-fest', a film you'll remember for a long time? I doubt it quite a bit.As an old fashioned morality tale, where a misguided couple realizes the error of their ways and finds 'true love' in the process, 'Benefits' fits in well with the pantheon of mediocre romcoms, populating our movie theaters today.",3,4,8,31 August 2012
Avatar," 'Last of the Mohicans' meets 'Jurassic Park'
","Classifying 'Avatar' as science fiction is a misnomer. If you take away the whole idea of the Avatar technology, you end up with a standard Hollywood action movie. And the technology is truly dispensable. For the year 2154, I'd rather have a genetically modified humanoid standing on his own two feet rather than an 'avatar'. Both ideas are far-fetched, but the idea of an avatar who is controlled through some kind of vague telepathic commands emanating from a human being deep asleep while in a coma seems much more the stuff of comic books than semi-plausible science fiction.Without the Avatar 'gimmick', Cameron's story is nothing more than an allegory of the mistreatment of Native Americans by the 'white man'. Cameron harks back to the 17th century where the idea of the 'noble savage' was in vogue. So-called 'primitive' people were held up as 'natural' and 'spiritual', untarnished by the corrupting effects of western civilization. Also at play were deep-seated guilt feelings over the perceived deleterious effects of European colonialism.In Cameron's tale, the 'colonialists' have been updated to military contractors who have somehow bought the 'heart and soul' of the American military itself (we're told that the adventurers on 'Pandora' are ex-Marines, all there for the money). The contractors are headed by two stock villains: Parker Selfridge (the civilian corporate chief) and Colonel Quaritch (an amalgam of the worst right-wing military types you could ever think of). Cameron makes no effort in humanizing his two antagonists. On the other hand, the indigenous people, the 'Na'vi' can do no wrong. Not only have they mastered their skills in surviving in the wild but have tapped into the mystical forces of the forest which put our own holistic healers to shame.While the Na'vi are certainly stand-ins for Native Americans, they are not Native Americans of the American West in the 19th century but rather more akin to earlier forest dwelling Indians as depicted in James Fenimore Cooper's 'Last of the Mochicans' (is it a coincidence that one of the stars of the early 90s film version of that book is Wes Studi who plays 'Eytukan' here?) Cameron must bring in other cinematic influences to make sure that this is not simply a rehash of an early 18th century romantic novel. In the beginning, with images of space travelers coming out of suspended animation inside a spaceship, one is reminded of such iconic films as '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the sci-fi horror tale, 'Alien'. And what about all those futuristic helicopters that are constantly firing missiles at the hapless natives? I can only think of mediocre Vietnam-era war movies such as 'The Green Berets' starring John Wayne. Avatar is also derivative of Spielberg films such as 'Jurassic Park' with its emphasis on prehistoric creatures who seem to have a continuous anger management problem.As for Avatar's plot, it's all rather predictable stuff. The enlightened 'scientists' are pitted against the hard-boiled military, none of whom seem to have a conscience. The film's hero, Jake Sully, already is told that the bad guys are planning to wipe the Na'vi out but it takes him three months to warm up to them. I had a hard time believing that Sully would side so easily with the evil Colonel from the beginning—yes he was offered the 'carrot' of getting his legs back but as a paraplegic wouldn't that have made him wary of the Colonel's unrelenting disdain for the underdog? In other words, wasn't it obvious that the Colonel was a real bad guy from the very beginning? What's more, wouldn't Sully have tried to warn the Na'vi earlier instead of waiting to the last hour? He could have perhaps persuaded one or two Na'vi to form a reconnaissance team and to check out the base in order to convince them that the enemy had the capability to wipe them out. Also, at the end, why did the Na'vi let the defeated enemy leave the planet? Wouldn't they have slaughtered all of them? (Oh I forgot—they're Noble Savages!).Despite the derivative and mediocre story, Avatar keeps your interest due to its excellent special effects. Cameron is a master at computer animation and keeps you riveted on all the action despite insulting your intellect. Avatar is a sensory delight but seeing it more than once is not recommended.",5,4,10,27 December 2009
Selma," Grim Oyelowo is miscast as MLK in this preachy, by-the-numbers hagiography
","Director Ava DuVernay has mainly been criticized for her depiction of President Johnson as being a reluctant or obstructionist political actor. DuVernay was quoted as saying that she wasn't interested in making a 'white savior movie,' perhaps implying that Johnson has been given too much credit for his role in the civil rights movement. DuVernay admits that not everything in 'Selma' is historically accurate, but she's entitled to fictionalize events under the rubric of 'dramatic license.'Indeed, the most compelling scenes in the film appear to be those involving Johnson's political machinations. DuVernay would like to us to believe that King and Johnson's relationship was much more confrontational than it was. Joseph Califano Jr., a former LBJ top assistant for domestic affairs, points to a recorded phone conversation between King and LBJ on January 15, 1965 in which LBJ appeared to be much more constructive than confrontational.However, DuVernay attempted to justify her portrayal of LBJ as a reluctant actor, citing a 2013 article by Louis Menand in 'The New Yorker.' Menand maintained that Johnson was not proactive after progress toward getting the Voting Rights Act passed had slowed: 'Johnson had the most ambitious legislative agenda of any President since F.D.R. (his idol), and he explained to King that he was worried that Southern opposition to more civil-rights legislation would drain support from the War on Poverty and hold up bills on Medicare, immigration reform, and aid to education. He asked King to wait. King thought that if you waited for the right time for direct action (as nonviolent protests were called) you would never act.'In DuVernay's best scene, LBJ finally 'comes around' and tells off George Wallace face to face. What's so great about this scene is how LBJ attempts to appeal to Wallace on his level, even employing the 'N' word to show Wallace that he's just a 'good old boy' at heart. But when Wallace won't listen to reason, LBJ makes it clear that the days of the Old South are numbered.DuVernay undoubtedly would have liked Johnson to come around sooner and attempts to slightly steal his thunder in his famous 'We Shall Overcome' speech by having him speak before a sparsely populated House of Representatives (Bill Moyers insists that the chamber was completely packed and LBJ's speech was 'electric').The rest of 'Selma' is pretty much in part, a by the numbers hagiography. DuVernay chose David Oyelowo, a British actor who starred in her earlier feature, 'Middle of Nowhere,' to play Martin Luther King Jr. Oyelowo is sadly miscast playing King as a grim-faced, stoic preacher, failing to convey a shred of King's warmth or humanity. For those who wish to see the definitive portrait of King, they can find it by viewing the 1978 TV Miniseries: 'King', starring the sensational Paul Winfield. There is no comparison between the two performances and one can find the entire Winfield miniseries on Youtube under the films of Paul Winfield.DuVernay is more successful when she sticks to straightforward historical events. There's a compelling scene when Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper is rebuffed by a racist clerk when she attempts to register to vote at the county courthouse. Coretta Scott King has little to do in 'Selma' so I suppose her meeting with a seemingly muted Malcolm X proves to be her character's most exciting scene. The revelation that King was still miffed by Malcolm X's earlier claim that he was an 'Uncle Tom,' also proves to be quite fascinating. The two confrontations with the racist police in Selma are competently done, but I can't help once again recommending the Winfield miniseries, as the police-protester clashes there, seem more realistic.Except for a memorable confrontation where Andrew Young talks down a vengeful crowd of dispirited King demonstrators, the 'supporting players' simply don't stand out. This is particularly evident when King is greeted by his staff at the safe house in Selma (by the way, this is about the only time you see Oyelowo smile during the entire movie).Eschewing a 'warts and all' approach, DuVernay puts her MLK on a pedestal. There's little hint of the 'family man' or charismatic leader. DuVernay unfortunately was hampered (stymied if you will) by the King family, who always demand financial remuneration whenever any of his speeches are used in fictional portraits such as 'Selma.' DuVernay paraphrased King's speeches, but little of it sounds spoken by the great man!Adolph Reed Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania implies that DuVernay 'inscribes a monolithic and trans-historical racism as the fundamental obstacle confronting, and thus uniting, all black Americans.' One can't but help note that DuVernay believes that there's a continuity between the protests of the civil rights era and the recent protests in Ferguson. While the Civil Rights Era was a monumental and seminal part of American history, to equate Martin Luther King's non-violent movement with the events that occurred in Ferguson, seems absurd. To my mind, MLK probably would have rolled over in his grave had he seen the pathetic and self-destructive acts by those who were caught on camera rioting in Ferguson.Even though murders of blacks by police are statistically extremely low, media exposure has convinced many people that this happens all the time. While African-Americans were true victims of endemic racism until the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s, the cries of victimhood today, especially in regards to 'police brutality.' are not clear-cut. Some police may be outwardly racist as well as 'heavy-handed' or 'insensitive.'

The Artist," The Count of Monte Cristo meets The Little Rascals meets A Star is Born meets Sunset Boulevard meets Citizen Kane
","The Weinstein Brothers strike again by bringing French director Michael Hazanavicius' silent film tribute, 'The Artist', to the United States, now in the running for possible Oscar Gold. To my recollection, silent films wore out their welcome way back in 1927, and only something strikingly original, should be considered for the Academy's highest honor. While Hazanavicius does his best at technically putting together the kind of film they made in the silent era (and he certainly doesn't get 'everything' right), story wise, his narrative is completely derivative. There's nary a single original idea in the entire picture.Hazanavicius' protagonist is George Valentin, obviously named after silent screen legend himself, Rudolph Valentino. Valentin's character, a heartthrob before the advent of the talkies, is modeled historically more on silent screen star, John Gilbert, than Valentino. After the introduction of the talkies, Gilbert's career fell apart, not because the sound of his voice didn't sit well with audiences now accustomed to 'talking pictures', but because he was saddled with inferior scripts and the one or two good pictures he was in, did not find wide favor with the public. Like Valentin in 'The Artist', Gilbert also proceeded to self-destruct by embracing the bottle.The Artist's narrative is based both on films from the silent era as well some classic sound pictures. 'The Count of Monte Cristo', one of Gilbert's well-known silent era films as well as Douglas Fairbanks' 'The Three Musketeers' are alluded to when Valentin is seen in one of the 'pictures within a picture', playing an action hero swordsman. Silent era melodrama is also referenced when Valentin's dog, Jack, alerts a policeman on the beat, who runs into the fading screen star's home, and saves him from a raging fire. I can't help being reminded of the early sound serial, 'The Little Rascals', where dogs are used to a more comic effect. Early in 'The Artist', Jack is featured in an amusing bit, running to and fro, on stage.While there are many allusions to actual silent films and very early talkies in 'The Artist', the basic plot is derived from two later classic 'sound' films. In 'The Artist', Valentin, a once successful actor, now in sad decline after a successful career, finds himself supplanted by a love interest, who has gone on to a successful career of her own as a celebrity actor, but offers to rescue him out of both feelings of love and guilt. This in essence is the story of 'A Star Is Born', made in the 30s and later revived in the 50s, as a Judy Garland vehicle. One also cannot ignore the parallels to 'Sunset Boulevard', which features a story that in part revolves around the movie studio system. 'The Artist' even has its own chauffeur, Clifton, played by James Cromwell, that echos the chauffeur role in 'Sunset Boulevard', famously played by Erich Von Stroheim. Should I also mention how Mr. Hazanavicius can't help himself throw in a bit from 'Citizen Kane'? When Valentin uncovers all his auctioned effects which Peppy had purchased for him, it's a scene completely reminiscent from 'Citizen Kane', where all of Kane's property sits in storage, covered by similar white cloths. And what of Hazanavicius' lazy use of music composed by Bernard Hermann, associated with both Orson Welles and Hitchcock? It seems that Ludovic Bource simply ran out of ideas and perhaps was unable to complete the score. A more likely scenario is that Hazanavicius simply wanted to save money by licensing Hermann's Hitchcock soundtrack. There is little point in rehashing the details of Hazanvicius' derivative and pointless plot. Suffice it to say, it's Valentin who ironically discovers kindly Peppy Martin, after she accidentally crashes through a roped off area of Valentin groupies, and is photographed by paparazzi. After sad sack Valentin feels sorry for himself after falling from grace as a silent screen star and Peppy becomes famous in the talkies, he takes to the bottle and is about to kill himself. Leave it to Jack to save him along with Peppy, who recalls that Valentin is actually a talented dancer, and suggests to the Kinograph studio honcho, that they could make a great pair, as the next Rogers and Astaire-like dance team. If 'The Artist' has any value, is in its fairly faithful recreation of a bygone era. It's fun watching how director Hazanavicius utilizes the costumes, makeup and set design, as well as the many techniques of silent film era cinematography to create the final product, which best can be described as a 'loving tribute'. Nonetheless, Hazanavicius has chosen merely to emulate the traditional conventions of the silent film era than create an original, final product. One is reminded more of a 'B' melodrama from that era than one of the classics, such as the kind proffered up by a Chaplin or Keaton.It's a sad state of affairs when a less than mediocre story, created in a now defunct style of filmmaking (which was put to rest over seventy years ago), garners some of the top awards from the chief pundits in today's film industry. It only goes to show how hard up the film industry is, in its ability to discover and promote quality scripts, instead resorting to the dubious tactic of reaching back to yesteryear, for ill-advised inspiration.",4,12,24,5 February 2012
Invictus," 'Feel-good' race relations flick or extended rugby highlight reel? Take your pick!
","'Invictus' is designed to be a 'feel-good' movie about relationships between blacks and whites. The setting is South Africa beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and his subsequent ascent to the South African presidency a short time later. Morgan Freeman does a great job in 'channeling' the great man and you really feel as if you're watching Mandela himself. When the Oscars come up, Freeman has a very good shot at copping the Oscar for Best Actor.Clint Eastwood's strategy is to depict Nelson Mandela's program for racial reconciliation through the narrow prism of International Rugby. While there are a few interesting glimpses of Mandela interacting with his main assistant and some of his counselors, little of his personal life is shown (there is a brief scene where he's depicted as being alienated from his daughter who regards him as something of a sell-out). By the second half, Mandela is reduced to being basically a cheerleader for the South African Rugby team. Still, the sheer humanity of Mandela is always at the forefront, with his emphasis on forgiveness.I liked the first half of Invictus better than the second. There's a good scene where Mandela tries to persuade a group of his constituents (a Sports Federation) not to disenfranchise the rugby team. Mandela, in Christ-like fashion, urges the crowd to 'turn the other cheek' and support the team despite their identification of the white players with the apartheid era. Despite their initial rejection, blacks in South Africa gradually come to root for the team. One way they're won over is after Mandela asks the team to tour the shanty towns and introduce rugby to poor black children. It helps that there's one black player on the team who becomes a national figure. But when Mandela visits the team before a big game and congratulates each player individually, he's sending a signal that he's for whites as much as blacks. And the white players (who are initially depicted as being quite alienated and angry after Mandela becomes President) gradually soften up too: in one poignant scene, they go on a tour of the prison where Mandela was held for 27 years. Later they're not afraid to sing the new South African anthem with their black countrymen.Less successful are the scenes involving Mandela's bodyguards. The tension between the black and white bodyguards at the beginning is quite understandable. But virtually none of the characters are ever fleshed out. It takes a team victory in the Rugby World Cup to get them all hugging one another. But the camaraderie seems quite superficial. One wonders if everyone will be so touchy-feeley once all the excitement has worn off.Invictus completely loses steam in the second half. There's virtually no suspense since the film's outcome is a forgone conclusion. What's worse is that the idea of an antagonist is lost as the film plods along. The tension between blacks and whites is palpable at the beginning but as the focus shifts to the rugby team itself, where is the conflict? Good movies have a moment where the protagonist faces a moment of crisis leading to a 'dark moment of the soul'. The best Invictus offers us is when Mandela collapses after being overworked. It's not enough! The awkwardness of the entire screenplay is embodied in the relationship between the team captain, Francois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon, and Mandela. They have one scene together when Mandela invites Pienaar to tea. We find out next to nothing about Pinaar but maybe that's because there's not a lot to find out. Damon runs around a lot on the field but only briefly confronts his teammates who are initially reluctant to embrace Mandela's plan for reconciliation. Again, where is the conflict? As an American who is unfamiliar with the rules of rugby, I was bored watching scene after scene of grown men groping one another without protective equipment. Since Eastwood really had no exciting climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'. For rugby aficionados, this might prove to be orgasmic. As for ignorant Americans such as myself, I never thought I'd be desperate to tune into next Sunday's football game so quickly.Some have claimed that Invictus is just another film about race relations from the white man's perspective. Maybe so but I prefer to view it as primarily a mediocre sports film. On the plus side, if one wishes to feel good without thinking too hard, then one can indulge oneself in this rather superficial glimpse of racial harmony. While Invictus fails in the drama department, Morgan Freeman's performance as the great and inspiring Mandela will make you look at race relations from the glass being half full and not half empty.",5,7,13,24 December 2009
La La Land," Entertaining but derivative homage to classic film musicals
","Move over Orson Welles! Hollywood has found its new wunderkind—and his name is Damien Chazelle. Coming off his indie hit, Whiplash--a vastly overrated melodrama featuring a jazz drummer instructor who acts more like a drill sergeant—Chazelle has muted his inner bad boy and set his sights on the top prize: Oscar Gold for Best Picture!Chazelle sets his La La Land in a virtually unrecognizable present with characters, music and settings that are designed to remind us of the 1950s. Virtually every scene is interchangeable so when the La La cast steps out of their cars on the LA Expressway to sing the peppy opening number, Another Day of Sun, Eisenhower could have easily been sitting in the White House and not the present day occupant.The opening scene is where Chazelle introduces his protagonists, Mia (Emma Stone), a barista on a movie studio lot and aspiring A-list actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a talented jazz pianist who dreams of opening his own club. Stone's Mia is pretty much your generic aspiring actress playing a character initially done in by a lack of self-confidence; the handsome Gosling is miscast as the rebellious jazz pianist—he's a beatnik thrust into the anachronistic modern day setting. Chazelle's unimaginative protagonists remind me of a more sophisticated set of characters from the recent TV series, Smash, also a musical that alludes to the past but is set in the present.Mia and Sebastian meet up a few times before their chemistry clicks in and they realize they're meant to be a couple. This happens when they go and watch Rebel Without a Cause in a movie theater and then decide to go up to the Griffith Observatory, the site where James Dean and Natalie Wood acted out a number of dramatic scenes as star-crossed lovers. Channeling his inner Mary Poppins, Chazelle has Mia and Sebastian fancifully float up to the planetarium ceiling to the strains of a rather tuneful original number by Justin Hurwitz entitled (couldn't you guess?), 'Planetarium.'The bulk of the La La Act 2 machinations involves Sebastian joining a modern jazz-fusion band headed by a former high school classmate, Keith, played by John Legend. Because Sebastian is an outright snob, a jazz purist who only likes stuff from the good old days, he ends up in the awkward position of disparaging the kind of music Keith is composing and playing. So Legend's number, Start a Fire, a rather nice jazz-pop tune, is supposed to be viewed by Sebastian as something that actually isn't good at all (but actually is!).Mia's story is a bit more straightforward. After being rejected by casting agents who she comes to completely disparage, Sebastian encourages her to take a stab at presenting her one-woman show. In a rather contrived scene, Sebastian simply 'forgets' about a photo shoot for his band and misses Mia's show. When her show is a bust with few attending, Mia simply moves back home to Boulder City, Nevada.Chazelle is on more solid ground wrapping things up in Act 3. Mia gets another chance when unbeknownst to her, a big casting agent came to see her one-woman show and raved about it. But it's Sebastian who gets the phone call from the agent's secretary looking for Mia and dutifully drags Mia to the tryout. Five years later, Mia is a big star, married with child. Instead of reuniting the once aspiring artists, Chazelle imagines Mia randomly instructing her husband to get off the freeway because of the traffic, and they end up at a jazz club called 'Seb's,' owned of course by Sebastian. As Mia watches Sebastian play, she fantasizes what things could have been had they ended up together. But Chazelle brings us right back to reality to remind us that Mia and Sebastian were never meant to be. That's a nice touch since he could have ended it with a much more saccharine climax. The choreography here tries much too hard to emulate the glory days of the American film musical. Perhaps An American in Paris is the film La La Land attempts to copy the most. It's all very derivative and reminds us of early incarnations without creating something distinctively new. The music on the other hand is quite nice. In addition to the aforementioned instrumental, the lovely 'Planetarium,' Emma Stone's 'Audition (The Fools Who Dream)' might end up as a bonafide hit especially if nominated for the Academy Award.What La La Land basically lacks are sophisticated lead characters. No there is no My Fair Lady here by a long stretch. Chazelle's narrative is entertaining enough, featuring charming performances by Stone and Gosling, but perhaps lacks the really original plot twists and turns that one might find in the classic film musicals from yesteryear such as Singin' In the Rain or the Wizard of Oz. Chazelle's nostalgia trip lacks the benchmarks of artistic greatness but some catchy tunes--and Hollywood's general desire for film musicals--might propel this decent but derivative project into the Hollywood canon of the Academy Best Picture.",5,7,11,22 January 2017
Super 8," Spielberg clone wins no points for bashing US military and scientific communities
","It sure doesn't hurt to have your film produced by Steven Spielberg and apparently J.J. Abrams, creator of the highly commercially successful 'Super 8', understood that the way to Mr. Spielberg's heart (as well as his purse strings) was to create an homage to the 'master', a Spielberg clone if you will, that both legendary director and scores of uncritical teenagers could appreciate.'Super 8' certainly begins with a clever concept. A group of teenagers are shooting their own amateur detective zombie movie which they hope to enter in a statewide competition. You can see how this would appeal to Mr. Spielberg—he got his start making amateur movies as a teenager. At the end of 'Super 8' during the closing credits, we actually get to see the amateur film ('The Case'), the intrepid teenagers end up creating. It's one of the most clever and enjoyable moments in 'Super 8', and it's too bad the rest of the film is unable to reflect the true joy and unheralded abandon of young teenagers trying to find their way in the adult world.The protagonist here is Joe Lamb (very nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) who is your basic Spielberg stand-in. Note that the young Lamb is the make up and special effects guy who best friend Charles depends on to spruce up the amateur Super 8 film they're shooting at a nearby train station. The tension really builds when a real train derails and crashes in spectacular fashion and the kids barely escape with their lives. After that, there just seem to be too many contrivances to ignore as Abrams introduces us to another tired alien 'E.T.' narrative, about a misunderstood Anthropod, pursued by a sadistic US military who won't let him return home. It's a little difficult to believe that Dr. Woodward, the kids' biology teacher, is able to survive the horrible train derailment; in addition, one can only wince that the film's primary victim is another saintly black man who must sacrifice his life for the good of all humanity (please see 'Terminator II' and '2012' for further examples).Much more egregious is the idea that there is a psychopathic Air Force Colonel (Nelec) who has an entire group of soldiers who follow orders (like any good Nazi), ensuring that a kindly alien is tortured needlessly for years and his main protector, is murdered after surviving a horrendous train wreck. After the kids discover Woodward's treasure trove of journals and film, we realize that it's not only the military (represented by Nelec) who is indicted here, but the scientific community who went along with the cover-up. Thus it seems rather obvious that Abrams is content to take cheap shots at both the military and scientific community since in these days of heady conspiracy theories, it just seems like the easy thing to do.While I had to suspend my disbelief that the military was unable to uncover Woodward's treasure trove before Joe and his gang get to it, I was more bothered by the fact that neither the local or national media picked up on this story considering that there were a lot of unusual goings-on in this little Ohio town. First off there probably would have been a lot more questions from the media regarding the massive train wreck which probably would have drawn even more reporters to the sleepy town. Then after the power went on and off, and the sheriff disappeared, there was a town meeting (which certainly would have been covered by at least some local media), leading to some additional uncomfortable questions, which in real life, probably would have led to further scrutiny (perhaps leading to coverage by the national news.) In other words, this is something that could not have been covered up so easily as Abrams would like us to believe.Abrams has more difficulty turning his alien into something lovable and cuddly. After all, he's locked himself into a corner when Nelec is depicted as having tortured the hapless creature relentlessly for years. Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically—once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively. This is shown in the past with Dr. Woodward but also in the present with Joe, who tells the creature 'it's okay' to go home! The problem remains is that the creature has kidnapped a whole bunch of townspeople including Joe's love interest, Alice, who remains suspended upside down, in the creature's subterranean lair. One wonders how long the all those people have been hanging upside down. What happens if they have to go to the bathroom? And why does the creature grab the sheriff a second time? Has he killed him or simply hung him up on the 'rack' for another bout of suspended animation? It's obvious that Abrams doesn't want to kill the townspeople off since that will put his cuddly alien in a bad light!For those who haven't noticed, 'Super 8' does have a 'B' story. No it's not the prepubescent romance between Alice and Joe but rather the conflict between their warring fathers, Jackson and Louis. It seems that alcoholic Louis missed a day at work and as a result, Joe's Mom was killed in an industrial accident. Unfortunately, Abrams misses an opportunity to develop Louis's character and he comes across as too petulant for most of the film. Jackson is good trying to wear many hats in attempting to help harried townspeople during the 'creature crisis' but later, the big 'rescue' of the kids flops, after Joe and his chums escape from the besieged bus, by themselves.For those who enjoy Spielberg, 'Super 8' may be the ticket to relive the memories of some of Spielberg's sci-fi classics. But for those who want something that's not so derivative, you'll probably come away being a bit disappointed.",4,4,10,12 June 2011
Up," Pixar rests on its laurels
","It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, 'Up', I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist—on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, 'Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.When we finally meet up with the long lost 'Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now onand that is up!",4,35,86,2 June 2009
Woman in Gold," Critics with mixed and negative reviews have underrated this fascinating tale of art restitution and the Holocaust
","'Woman in Gold' chronicles the efforts of a Viennese-born Jewish woman, Maria Altmann, to recover her family's artwork stolen by the Nazis. What sets this apart from many of these art restitution cases, is that the main painting in question, a portrait of Altmann's aunt by the famed painter Gustav Klimt, came to be considered a national treasure in Austria.The film received mixed reviews for various reasons but in my estimation, a good number of those negative and mixed reviews clearly underrated the film. Part of the problem is that the bulk of the action concerns itself with a series of legal dramas, which is not always conducive toward the stuff of great cinema (perhaps better suited to theater, with all the attendant legal dialogue and maneuvers). Nonetheless, the story is so fascinating, that one can ignore the occasional lack of arresting visuals.The drama begins with Maria Altmann conscripting a young lawyer, Randol Schoenberg (who happens to be the grandson of the famous composer, Arnold Schoenberg) and also the son of a good friend of hers, to represent her case in Austria. Initially it appears that the painting was ceded to an Austrian gallery by Altmann's aunt. With the help of an Austrian journalist, Hubertus Czernin, he manages to obtain documents from the national archives (in an unlikely scene involving a mole) and it's soon discovered that the painting was not owned by the aunt but by her husband, whose plans to give it to the Austrian gallery after his death, was cut short after it was stolen by the Nazis.Part One of the legal saga ends when the Austrian Art Restitution Board rules against Schoenberg and Altmann. Part two involves Schoenberg's appeal to the US Supreme Court who rules that Altmann is permitted to sue Austria for the return of the painting. With this ruling, Austria agrees to arbitration before a new panel at the Art Restitution Board. Before the climactic decision involving the painting, Altmann and Schoenberg have a falling out over Altmann's decision not to return to Austria a second time. Schoenberg decides to argue the case in Austria by himself. But in a dramatic moment, Altmann changes her mind and shows up at the final hearing.A number of critics found the Austrian characters to be stereotypical bad guys but the truth of the matter is that Altmann offered to let the Austrians keep the painting if they simply acknowledged that her claim was legitimate. They refused to do so. When she won the painting back, her decision to sell it to Ronald Lauder for $135 million resulted in cries that Altmann all along was simply in it for the money. My feeling is that Altmann owned the painting and she could do whatever she wanted with it—especially in light of Austria's obstinacy in acknowledging that she was the legitimate owner.'Woman in Gold' also features flashbacks to Altmann's life as a young woman, just as the Nazis occupied Austria. Tatiana Maslany plays the young Maria with aplomb and rivals Helen Mirren (who plays the elderly Altmann), in acting chops. The flashbacks notably feature a hard to believe chase of Altmann and her new husband by the Nazis, obviously created to pump up the film's action quotient. Some additional scenes of mistreatment of Jews on the streets of Vienna are a powerful reminder of what actually occurred but by the same token, these are scenes we've seen before in other Holocaust-themed films, such as 'Schindler's List.'While a good deal of what transpires in 'Woman in Gold,' actually happened, I did wonder how Schoenberg supported himself and his family while taking on the Austrian government. The film's scenarist failed to include information that Schoenberg was hired by another law firm and was allowed to pursue his case against the Austrian government, while in their employ!By no means is 'Woman in Gold,' a complete masterpiece, but it's a solid, fascinating story that needs telling. The film not only sheds light on a particular aspect of the Holocaust but it also chronicles the presence of reactionary elements in Austria in recent times.",7,0,1,2 June 2015
Love & Mercy," Paul Dano shines in innovative and enjoyable biopic of Brian Wilson, Beach Boy wizard
","Bill Pohlad, the producer of such notable films as Brokeback Mountain and 12 Years a Slave, only directed one film in his life and that was back in 1990. So it's quite remarkable that his second effort, a biopic about Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame, is so enjoyable and innovative. The film focuses on two different times in Wilson's life—jumping back and forth between his heyday when he created the landmark album 'Pet Sounds,' and later in the late 80s and early 90s, after he was experiencing significant mental health issues and came under the spell of a Svengali-like therapist. The early Wilson is played brilliantly by Paul Dano who looks and sounds like the legendary singer-composer. Less successful is John Cusack in the role of the troubled older Wilson.We first meet the younger Wilson after he experiences a panic attack on an airplane and soon is asking the rest of the Beach Boys if he could stay home and work on new songs while the boys go off touring in Japan. In a fascinating part of the film, Dano shows off his acting chops channeling an eccentric Wilson putting together Pet Sounds, an album (as we're reminded in the film) that Paul McCartney called 'the greatest rock album of all time.' Troubled by voices in his head, Wilson manages to sublimate the cacophony and turn it into music on the new album. Christopher Gray writing in Slant Magazine cogently explains how Wilson accomplished this, aided by the film's composer: 'With a series of brilliantly composed sound collages containing snatches of harmony, studio banter, and kernels of hooks, composer Atticus Ross gives a tangible impression of the clutter in Wilson's mind blossoming into Pet Sounds, an album that's simultaneously elemental and maximalist, deconstructionist and rigorously composed.'Pohlad provides a fascinating glimpse into how Wilson went about creating Pet Sounds, working with the 'Wrecking Crew,' the famed straight-laced group of studio musicians who initially are befuddled by the eccentric Wilson but eventually warm up to him (one of the musicians tells Wilson that he enjoyed working with him on Pet Sounds above anyone else in his career). The use of real-life musicians -- and the scenes being shot in a documentary style utilizing hand-held 16-millimeter cameras -- adds to the film's verisimilitude.The conflict in the scenes involving Wilson's creative period focuses on his father, Murry, winningly played by Bill Camp. We come to understand that a good deal of Wilson's problems are related to his overcritical father. In a startling scene, Wilson plays a solo piano version of one of his most acclaimed songs, 'God Only Knows.' At the end of the scene, the camera pans back revealing a critical Murry telling Wilson that the song is 'wishy-washy.' While it's clear Murry was a martinet, I still wanted to see the character fleshed out a bit more (the best the film's scenarists can do is show Murry awkwardly blurt out 'I love you' to Wilson in an angry tone of voice). After his father's death from a heart attack in 1973, Brian praised his father for pushing the group to achieve.Mike Love, Wilson's cousin and fellow Beach Boys member, acts as an additional foil in the Wilson heyday sequences. As he's depicted here, Love wanted Wilson to write simpler songs in the vein of the hits the group churned out in their 'surfer' days. Like the father, Love was a character I wanted to know a little bit more about, although I can understand the screenwriters had limited time to tell their story.The events involving Wilson in the 80s prove just as fascinating as his earlier incarnation. Wilson is propelled into a new depressive phase when he falls under the influence of Dr. Eugene Landy, the sociopathic therapist who controls virtually his every move. Paul Giamatti is mesmerizing as the over-the-top Svengali who controls the vulnerable Brian with a massive amount of medication. Pohlad claims that John Cusack does look like Brian at that time in his life, but even if this is true, Cusack's overall performance is clearly not as good as Dano's. It's hard to say what's wrong with Cusack here—perhaps he plays Wilson as a little too creepy—whatever the case, Cusack just isn't quite right for the part (not terribly bad, but just not quite right!). Also quite enjoyable is Elizabeth Banks playing Cadillac saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter, who eventually becomes Wilson's wife. It's a strong female part for various reasons—I liked how they come to meet each other for the first time (inside a showroom Cadillac) and her surprise when she finds out that this strange guy is actually THE Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. The best part is when she confronts Landy and eventually wrests control of Wilson from him. I'm informed that the actual mechanics of how Landy's grip over Wilson ended was part fiction (the maid did not have a hand in getting a hold of Wilson's altered will). Nonetheless a little dramatic license is forgivable. Love & Mercy manages to be a cut above some biopics that have recently appeared on the silver screen. The combination of depicting Wilson's creative process in his heyday with the Beach Boys and his later struggles attempting to extricate himself from the influence of a vicious psychiatrist, proves fascinating. Brian Wilson of course had some critical collaborators in his musical career, and they've been given short shrift here. This is of course a biopic and placing the protagonist on a pedestal is expected. It's done a little less here, and for that we should be grateful.",7,1,2,27 January 2016
How to Train Your Dragon," Worth looking at more for its impressive animation than politically correct narrative
","Who knew? Fire-breathing dragons deep down inside are really touchy-feely creatures as long as you know how to train them right. That essentially is the premise of the much-acclaimed Dreamworks animated film, 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Of course there's a deeper message here (quoting the late Rodney King): 'Why can't we all get along?'.This is perhaps the first film I can remember where the great pillaging clan of Vikings are not pitted against human opponents and hence their reputation as a group of sadistic, murderous thugs is tempered by the aggression of their dragon antagonists. Leave it to the film's protagonist, Hiccup, the young nerdy son of the Viking leader, Stoick the Vast (curiously voiced by Gerard Butler, with a Scottish accent!), to teach his community an important lesson: it's better to use your brains instead of brawn.It takes a while for 'Dragon' to get going as the break into the second act doesn't occur until Hiccup begins nursing 'Toothless', the cute but hyperactive dragon (that he's responsible for injuring), back to health. Toothless looks like a leopard with wings but appears to have the temperament of a lovable canine. It turns out that the dragons have an excuse for all their bad behavior: they're beholden to a giant 'killer' dragon who the Vikings fear but who have never seen. Hiccup uncovers the mystery of this frightening behemoth when he flies into its lair after figuring out how to pilot Toothless, without falling off of him, in the air.Meanwhile back at the Viking village, Hiccup, much to his chagrin, is forced to participate in dragon training school with a coterie of fellow young misfits. Voiced by such comic luminaries as Jonah Hill and Kirsten Wiig, Hiccup's 'associates' all follow the 'macho' Viking line: kill the unpleasant dragons at any cost. Much of the antics of the youngsters are rather one-note, as they parrot the macho posturing of the community at large. Finally, Hiccup, through his sensitive handling of the out of control creatures, turns his colleagues around and trains them how to calm the dragons down, without killing them.The stakes are raised when Hiccup refuses to kill a dragon at the end of the training and his father disowns him. Stoick, raises an armada of his heavily armed Vikings, and with Toothless in tow (now chained on board the lead vessel), head out to the island where the big, bad monster awaits them. Leave it to Hiccup and his buddies to save the day by flying out to the island on board the formerly imprisoned dragons (back at the training school) and eliminate the monster in a rousing fight to the finish.With the bad dragon eliminated, the dragon population 'understands' that the Vikings are really on their side and are now quite amenable to being house trained. And of course, even macho Stoick, sees the light and ends up apologizing to his son. I suppose all this is an acceptable children's story but adults will feel a little less satisfied. If underneath, this is a tale about how humans treat animals, it's a rather fanciful conceit that leopards or tigers (which the dragons seemingly represent), can so easily be domesticated. If on the other hand, if the dragons represent a misunderstood group of humans (demonized by the Vikings who lack the insight into their nature), the fact that they ALL suddenly become peaceful (because they're now treated with 'sensitivity' by humans), hardly seems to reflect the reality of true human-to-human interactions. Throughout history, attempts to mollify belligerent peoples through appeasement, have resulted in disastrous consequences.In short, 'How to Train Your Dragon', is a feel-good tale, politically correct tale, best suited for children. Adults, however, will still be much impressed by the excellent, sumptuous animation, painstakingly created over a number of years by a group of highly talented animators. Whether the animation is enough for the viewer to overlook the rather lackluster story, is a matter of personal taste. For me, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is worth a look, decidedly for its impressive technical achievements, as opposed to its rather predictable narrative.",6,1,6,7 October 2012
Limitless," Exciting and entertaining sci-fi-like thriller, undone by disappointing Hollywood-like ending
","'Limitless' is one of those entertaining thrillers that (despite its ill-conceived ending), will appeal to the majority of ordinary males who have fantasies of becoming the kind of male women seem to automatically gravitate to: the alpha male. Indeed, the film's protagonist, Eddie Morra, the down and out novelist played by Bradley Cooper, represents an exaggerated version of the kind of situation, the average guy finds himself in, on a daily basis.While most guys aren't down to their last buck like Morra, they can certainly can identify with his great dissatisfaction in the inability to achieve success in a career. It's not like Morra is some bum off the street: he's got an agent but has writer's block; the average guy can relate to Morra's inability to reach his potential. The same applies to women: Morra does have a very good-looking girlfriend, Lindy—but because he doesn't reach his potential and ends up projecting a negative image, she has no guilt feelings about dumping him.'Limitless' allows the average male to indulge in the fantasy of becoming an instant alpha male without developing the skills. When Eddie runs into his ex-brother-in-law who gives him the illegal medication, 'NZT', we're ready to break into Act 2 and watch how Eddie is transformed. Perhaps the best scene in the movie is when Eddie must turn his brow-beating landlady around after she constantly screams at him for not paying his rent. Instead of adopting the motivational social skills of the ordinary schlub, the NZT allows Eddie to tap his full cognitive potential. Not only does he help the landlady with her paper for law school but also ends up bedding her without even trying.A montage with voice-over allows us to see what else Eddie accomplishes 'under the influence', including learning how to play difficult classical music pieces on the piano as well as mastering multiple languages in a matter of a few days. Instead of turning into a mensch, Eddie decides to model himself after Gordon Gekko. He starts as a day trader and begins amassing some money and this is where perhaps the first plot hole appears in the film. If he's such a genius, why does he have to borrow $100,000 from a Russian loan shark? During a voice-over, Eddie claims he needs the money fast but given his talents, couldn't the newly transformed Eddie have made that kind of money in a week or two? His financial success leads Lindy to change her mind about him and she's back in his arms in no time. Eddie also insinuates himself into the business world of business tycoon Carl Van Loon (another average performance by Robert De Niro) and is on the verge of earning millions, advising Van Loon as he's about to complete a merger with Atwood, a business rival. Eddie's transformation now appears complete.Screenwriter Leslie Dixon manages to keep things moving even after Eddie's transformation is finished. Since there is a limited supply of NZT, all the really bad guys are after Eddie including the loan shark and a stalker. What's more there are very bad side effects to this medication. Eddie is shocked to see his ex-wife, who is going downhill from NZT's side effects as well as discovering previous users have either died or are physically debilitated. Eddie also can't recall where he is for 18 hours and later he's implicated in a murder of a woman in a hotel.There's also an exciting scene where the stalker goes after Lindy. She's seemingly cornered in Central Park (of all places) by the Stalker, but Eddie advises her to take one pill of NZT, which allows her to figure out how to stop her pursuer. Her escape is exciting but contains one ugly misstep: she grabs a little girl who's skating on an ice rink, and uses her as a human machete—slashing her pursuer with the blade of the little girl's skate (I wonder why no one chased her and why she wasn't initially charged with child endangerment).The second act crisis is rather perfunctory, with Eddie going toe to toe with the Russian loan shark and his henchmen. There a few twists and turns in this confrontation, especially when Eddie runs out of his NZT, stabs the loan shark and is forced to drink his blood in order to get NZT back into his system.While a good part of this is somewhat unbelievable, it all adds up to some breezy entertainment. Unfortunately, Leslie Dixon, the film's screenwriter opts for a typical Hollywood ending, which dilutes the film's overall impact. We're asked to accept that Eddie somehow overcomes the addiction to NZT and retains his mental abilities--even though everybody else becomes addicted and goes downhill after being unable resist, after taking one pill. I also wondered why Lindy did not succumb to the effects of NZT and become an addict (I guess since she's one of the 'good ones', she has the willpower to resist).Finally, why should we really root for Eddie? Has he done anything good to help humanity? In the end he's a politician who rejects Van Loon, who wants to control him, even after he becomes president. But Eddie still is sleazy—after all he is a politician (not a brain surgeon!). A better ending would have Eddie sacrificing himself to save Lindy—penitence for his decision to use drugs and suck up to bad guy Van Loon.I enjoyed 'Limitless' up to a point. It's a fast-paced thriller, undone mainly by a cheap ending, that makes little sense.",6,0,0,3 June 2013
Sicario," Thoughtful meditation on over her head FBI agent coping with CIA extra-judicial actions against evil drug cartels
","What does one make of Taylor Sheridan's screenplay in which the principal character, FBI agent Kate Macer (played by Emily Blunt), is a passive observer for a good part of the drama? Macer is given the assignment to accompany CIA operatives to investigate the botched FBI Swat team raid of a Mexican drug cartel hideout in Arizona, where dozens of corpses are found and two agents lose their life when an improvised explosive device goes off. Macer's assignment is mandatory since the CIA must be accompanied by an FBI agent during any domestic investigation.Macer is partnered with a CIA undercover operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who makes it clear they're going after Sonora Cartel lieutenant Manuel Díaz. But instead of going to El Paso, Texas, they end up in Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, accompanied by the sinister former Mexican drug prosecutor Alejandro Gillick (Bernicio Del Toro). It will soon become apparent that Macer is way in over her head as Gillick refuses to play by any rules in dealing with ruthless cartel members. In fact, Macer will soon realize that Gillick is almost as bad as the cartel members he's attempting to hunt down.On the way back to the US with Diaz's brother Guillermo in tow, Macer almost gets herself killed as cartel members attempt to rescue the hapless sibling on the Bridge of the Americas at the Mexico-US border. While Macer is undoubtedly happy to see Delta Force Special Ops come to the rescue on the bridge, their method of shoot first and ask questions later (which foreshadows some even more advanced extra-legal shenanigans at film's end), impels the intrepid FBI agent to question the entire moral imperative of the CIA team's mission.It's only at this point that Macer becomes a more active participant in the drama that things get more interesting. First she and her FBI partner Reggie Wayne question Graver and Gillick as to their true intentions and they learn that the real target is Sonora Cartel boss Fausto Alarcón—Graver and Gillick are attempting to disrupt the cartel's drug operations which may draw Diaz out and lead them to the bigger cheese, Alarcón. But naïve Macer almost mucks things up entirely by attempting to gather records at a bank that services Diaz's money launderers (Macer is overruled in her efforts to arrest the bank officials as it could tip off Diaz and his cronies as to what's going on). Meanwhile Gillick has extracted information from Mexican illegals about a tunnel between US and Mexico at a border station.Macer falls in deeper over her head when she attempts to have a one night stand with a corrupt Arizona cop. Gillick saves her from being strangled and later extracts information from the cop regarding other corrupt cops, utilizing methods that border on torture.The CIA achieves its objective when they're able to track Diaz who is now going to meet with his boss Alarcón. Gillick has no time for by-the-book Macer who regards his mission as completely unauthorized and illegal. One of the film's most exciting moments is when Gillick shoots Macer (she's wearing a bulletproof vest) and he orders her back through the tunnel to the US side.Graver explains that Alarcón's overreaching has upset the balance of power in the drug cartel world and he must be eliminated—re -establishing the Medellin cartel as the sole arbiter of power. Gillick also has a personal score to settle with Alarcón—his wife and daughter were murdered by Alarcón's thugs.The focus shifts from Macer again with Gillick providing all the histrionics at the denouement. Proving how ruthless the drug cartel world is, Gillick murders Alarcón wife and children as the drug lord helplessly watches at the dinner table at his estate in Mexico. Then Gillick finishes Alarcón off not before mentioning the fate of his own wife and daughter to the kingpin.The whole point of the film is that in the war against Mexican cartels, there are no rules and those assigned with the task of taking them out, will employ any tactics at their disposal to achieve their objectives. Macer, who believes in the rule of law, proves to be wholly impotent and irrelevant in the fight against evil. Her impotence is highlighted when Gillick forces her to sign a waiver at gunpoint, claiming that all his actions were legitimate.At the beginning, we expect the heroic Macer to be successful in her quest to bring murderers to justice 'by the book.' But in a complete reversal, it's those who refuse to play by the book who are triumphant. Macer is simply a cog in the wheel who is completely over her head.Despite its theme imbued with verisimilitude, not everything that happens in Sicario is completely believable (did you really believe that Gillick would have been successful in sneaking into the drug cartel boss' compound and is so easily able in disposing of Alarcón and his entire family?).Still, Sicario raises some important questions about the nature of extra-judicial actions in the fight against evil.",7,0,0,18 April 2016
In Time," Clever premise can't save predictable dystopia as Phillip K. Dick meets Twilight Zone Season 1, Episode 24
","'In Time' was written, directed and produced by Andrew Niccol. Set in 2169, a genetically engineered populace can only live to age 25; beyond that they're given one year which will expire, unless time (which appears as a fluorescent counter on their forearms), is replenished. This gimmick of time for money, is perhaps the only real clever conceit of the film. I enjoyed watching how much a cup of coffee went for (a few minutes) as opposed to the price of a new car (such a purchase would put the purchaser back a good number of months).Todd McCarthy writes in the Hollywood Reporter that the film suffers at the outset from a lack of a back story: 'As cleverly conceived as it is, the time-for-money substitution leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Other than for Leon and a few flunkies, there are no authority figures visible or alluded to. Who runs the country, the city? Is the rest of the world like this? How did the aging process get halted? Given so remarkable an achievement, why are there no other comparable technological advances? Why are all the cars customized early 1960s Lincoln Continentals, Jags and Cadillacs?'Justin Timberlake plays the protagonist, Will Salas, who lives in the economically depressed time zone, Dayton, where the population scrounges day to day, attempting to add precious minutes to their time clock, just to stay alive. The film's break into act two occurs when Salas meets up with a man, Hamilton, who's willing to give him a century of time for nothing in exchange. It's a scene which reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode, 'Long live Walter Jameson', where a man sips a magic motion two thousand years ago and discovers that he never ages. Unlike Twilight Zone, where the man is afraid to die, in this case, Hamilton is tired of living. This leads to the melodramatic scene where Salas' mother (played by Olivia Wilder who is younger than Timberlake in real life) doesn't have enough time to get on a bus as the normal fare has been raised due to inflation. She's reduced to attempting to run home before the clock runs out but doesn't make it, falling into Will's arms, just as her counter lands on zero. It feels odd that she didn't prepare for this contingency but the whole idea is to emphasize the great divide between the haves and the haves-not. Salas blames the affluent who hoard time in the richest time zone, 'New Greenwich,' for his mother's death. The zone is run by a time hoarding mogul, Phillipe Weis, who is basically your stereotypical 'robber baron', a stock villain. Salas' plan is to somehow institute his own brand of class warfare by getting his hands on Weis' 'eons' and redistribute it to the people. When he arrives in New Greenwich, Weis introduces him to his extended family. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine notes the problem in having everyone the same age in the film: ' A bit more background on the origins of this genetics-predicated social structure would have better fleshed out his narrative, especially with regard to the confounding reality that—since everyone is physically stuck at 25 years old, as epitomized by a hilariously creepy lineup of Philippe's mother-in-law, wife, and daughter—people's romantic and sexual attractions to others must be hopelessly confused by the disconnect between their appearances and age.'In the second half, 'In Time' devolves into your basic crime caper flick replete with foot chases and car crashes. With Will now hooked up with Phillipe's daughter, Sylvia, the two play a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde attempting to elude both the police in the guise of Timekeeper Leon as well as the nasty 'Minuteman' gang member, Fortis. There's a very awkward and unconvincing scene toward the end where Will and Sylvia take Sylvia's father hostage and in the end, make good on their goal of grabbing his 1,000,000 years and redistributing all that time to the common people. The worst part of 'In Time is the clumsy climax. Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine, sums it up best: 'And though there's a vaguely socialist theme of wealth redistribution running through the film, it's never clear what the final goal is for the two time bandits in love: Are they looking to abolish the time-is-money system altogether, or just eke out a few more years for the downtrodden?'Perhaps the most critical and perhaps enjoyable critique is from Kyle Smith in The NY Post. Part of his criticism involves the narrative's lack of verisimilitude: 'Chunks of time (which look like Atari video- game cartridges from 1978 that have been dipped in aluminum) sit barely guarded in vaults that can be breached simply by driving a truck into them,' as well as a lack of an explanation as to how Leon the Timekeeper is able to confiscate all of Will's time, when he has no evidence that he was guilty of stealing from the 105 year old man. Smith's main criticism comes back to the theme of class warfare: 'The allegory nullifies itself in inviting comparison to reality. Life is more egalitarian than it is in this movie, because while rich people may have more toys, their wealth doesn't buy them the most precious resource. Warren Buffett won't outlive his secretary by centuries.'In the end this is a film that has a clever premise which will keep you watching pretty much to the end. Nonetheless, the plot is awkwardly constructed, leading to a climax which is hardly what I would call thrilling. The lack of thrills perhaps can be attributed to a lack of high stakes as Salas is merely redistributing the wealth and not saving the population from imminent annihilation.",5,0,1,25 May 2014
Three Colors: Blue," Sumptous visual palate saves exploration of mourning process from total mediocrity
","This is the first film in Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski's Trois couleurs trilogy based on the French Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The high point is Sławomir Idziak's sumptuous cinematography and when all is said and done, 'Blue' is a fine film to look at. But in terms of story, it's also a slow-moving affair and if you don't have a lot of patience, you might find the narrative an exercise in unfortunate ennui.Juliette Binoche plays 'Julie' whose famous composer husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident at the beginning of the film. Totally shattered, Julie first attempts suicide but can't go through with it. Instead, she decides to withdraw from life by putting up her home for sale, place her Alzheimer's afflicted mother in a nursing home and renting an apartment in Paris without telling any of her friends and family. She also destroys her husband's unfinished musical score (commissioned to promote European unity), which she may have actually composed herself.The main question we're left with (as robot-like Julie makes her way through her self-imposed life in exile) is, when will she come out of it? Along the way, however, she's determined to prove that she can go through life with all her emotions deadened, as a sort of impotent protest against the cruel fate bestowed upon her. Hence, when Olivier, a former composer colleague who's in love with her, finally finds out where she's moved to, Julie has sex with him and then cruelly tells him never to see her again. And then there's all those scenes swimming in the pool—we hear the booming sound of the unfinished symphony impinging on Julie's consciousness. This obviously signifies her inability to repress her emotions completely.Kieślowski argues that in the mourning process there comes a point where demands for kindness in ordinary life must intrude on the mourner's determination to maintain their inflexible stance of anger and denial. Case in point: Julie answering exotic dancer's Lucille's call for help when her father shows up at the strip club. Or Julie deciding not to hold a grudge against Sandrine, her husband's mistress, by allowing her and the new baby, to live in her family's home. While Julie probably is still not overjoyed by Sandrine's actions, this is her way of 'moving on', and also acknowledging that she must help the baby, which belongs not only to Sandrine, but to her late husband as well.Julie finally breaks out of her shell by getting involved with Olivier. At the denouement, Olivier gives Julie the ultimatum about the unfinished score (a copy turns up preserved)—he'll complete it with all its 'roughness' or Julie will take over completely, but admit to current and past authorship. But Julie's decision is ambiguous in terms of who takes credit—what's important is that she's involved in collaborating and is no longer alarmingly self-absorbed. As the presumed completed symphony plays, we see shots of the various individuals who Julie touched, in spite of her self-defeating but thankful short-term exile. And the housekeeper who earlier cries for Julie because she's unable to mourn, can now rest assured that Julie is finally beginning to cry herself.Part of the 'Blue' problem is that there is no external conflict going on. The conflict exists solely in Julie's mind. The characters that impinge upon her are not developed in great detail—they exist as a catalyst for Julie's recovery. There's also the natural tendency to feel sympathy for a character that has experienced an unfathomable tragedy. Nonetheless, Julie's recovery is rather predictable and I'm not convinced that explorations of the mourning process in itself, should really be the subject of a full-length feature film. On the other hand, if you're a patient film goer, the film's visual palate, is worth the price of admission.",5,5,10,16 September 2014
The Shape of Water," Liberal do-gooders save amphibian humanoid from stereotyped right-wing martinets in this vastly overrated tale set in Cold War era
","The Shape of Water is noted director Guillermo del Toro's vastly overrated attempt to link mythic fantasy to the Cold War era. The problem with the film is its absurd premise: there's a secret government facility in Baltimore which houses an amphibian humanoid captured earlier in the Amazon by bad guy Colonel Richard Strickland (a cartoon, right wing martinet adventurer) played by an over the top Michael Shannon.Even if one accepts the premise (which I of course do not), you would think that security would be tight at the facility to ensure no unauthorized persons have access to the creature. Quite conveniently, however, the film's protagonist, the mute cleaning lady, Elisa (who communicates via sign language), is permitted to perform her cleaning duties inside the room where the newly minted 'creature from the black lagoon' is imprisoned and easily ends up bonding with him (or it-which ever appellation you prefer!). Elisa soon hatches a plan to save the creature from the dastardly clutches of Strickland, and Strickland's sponsor, another vile right wing martinet, General Frank Hoyt. Of course the more than noble Elisa is joined by friends and confederates, all again quite conveniently joined at the hip by distinct, commonly held LIBERAL convictions. These associates include Elisa's best friend Zelda, played by Octavia Spencer in the familiar role as African-American 'help' (will she ever be cast as the 'bad guy' in any future films?), Giles, Elisa's neighbor, an artist and closeted gay, and a sympathetic scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, who is actually a Soviet spy (note that Hoffstetler's superiors, are very much Strickland's counterparts, as they also evince a most unpleasant demeanor).Elisa somehow ends up ferreting the creature out of the facility after she learns of Strickland's deadline to vivisect it, allegedly for scientific purposes. Back at her apartment, she keeps the creature alive in a tub filled with salt water. Once the river is at full tide, the plan is to remove the creature from the apartment and bring it to safety, in the watery refuge.Meanwhile, the creature's dark side becomes slightly manifest when it attempts to take a bite out of a house cat (animal lovers do not despair: the creature is unsuccessful in significantly injuring the little kitty!). Giles is more than happy after it becomes apparent the creature has healing powers, touching Giles on his bald pate, and inducing some hair growth. And Elisa experiences pure bliss after discovering that the creature's genitalia is actually hidden and with a little coaxing, can actually engage in sexual intercourse (the act actually takes place in Elisa's bathroom, now completely flooded to the ceiling).Strickland, about to be fired by General Hoyt following the creature's disappearance, remains frustrated by not being able to find the lost amphibian (you would have thought that maybe he could have figured it out earlier that Elisa was the number one suspect). Strickland finally finds out from Zelda's terrified husband after unmercifully browbeating him, that Elisa is indeed the culprit who has sprung the creature from Strickland's deadly lair.No need to describe the rest of the plot in detail. Suffice it to say, there is a confrontation with Strickland who shoots both our heroes, only to meet his own demise at the hands of the creature, who miraculously recovers from Strickland's bullet to the gut. Elisa also revives (despite her wounds) and joins the creature in a blissful embrace underwater. How is this accomplished? Well, it seems Del Toro has kept his clues about Elisa's true nature from us all along. She's also some kind of long lost creature, and the wounds on the side of her neck, are actually gills-so she experiences some kind of re-awakening, again most conveniently while embracing her new found 'king.'I actually have a friend who sees the denouement as some kind of Gnostic allegory. Of course anyone can read into this narrative, anything they want. But the fantasy element certainly seems way out of place with this Cold War tale which also has problems of its own, with its rather cheap triumph of liberal do-goodism over stereotypical right-wing demagoguery.",3,181,387,1 January 2018
Zombieland," Once is good, but a 'Double Tap' is not recommended
","I was pleasantly surprised with the first third of 'Zombieland' when I discovered it's more like a comic buddy road movie than some dumb horror slasher-fest. The introductory 'documentary' sets the comic tone: right off the bat Zombieland announces that it's not politically correct (a 'fatty' is unable to outrun a Zombie on an athletic field). Jesse Eisenberg's narration, with all his neat rules on how to survive in Zombieland, adds to the overall humor of the story (the 'rules' are illustrated twice—first during the introduction and then later as we follow Jesse's character 'Columbus' as he must personally survive the wrath of the Zombies). Perhaps the rules that garnered the most cinematic mileage were 'Double Tap' (it takes two blows to kill a Zombie) and 'Fasten Your Seat Belt' (you never know when you have to stop short and have a Zombie fly through your windshield!).Zombieland is set in a post-apocalyptic America where a strain of Mad Cow Disease has turned most people into Zombies. Instead of merely concentrating on the Zombies for most of the picture, the films' scenarists wisely focus on the relationship between Columbus and his redneck buddy, Tallahassee (well-played by Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee's love for Twinkies and his skill in taking out the Zombies with various weapons of choice makes the character interesting. He's nicely contrasted with Columbus, the obsessive-compulsive nerdy college kid, who needs to overcome a clown phobia before he can finally break loose in his interpersonal relationships.Since I like my fantasy pictures to be as plausible as my true-life dramas, I found the flashback scene where Columbus must fend off the young girl he takes in to his apartment as particularly weak. It's not that I minded her sudden transformation into a Zombie, but what happened to all the other college students in Columbus' dorm? Did they all turn into Zombies at the same time the young girl did? And why didn't we see any news reports that people were turning into Zombies? It's as if the transformation from America into Zombieland happened in one night.Once Columbus and Tallahassee meet up with the two young women, 'Wichita' and 'Little Rock', I felt the story began to lose steam. I didn't really care that the two women were con men and were able to steal our hapless hero's' SUV. And the second scene, where they all agree to a truce and sort of become friends seemed interminably long.Before they get to Hollywood, there's a rather unpleasant scene where Tallahassee (with the others joining him) destroy souvenirs in a Native-American tourist shop. While the knick-knacks were probably made in China, they still looked pretty good to me and even though this was supposed to be a post-apocalyptic landscape where private property was now irrelevant, the destruction of what appeared to be a part of Native-American culture still rubbed me the wrong way.Somehow, the Billy Murray cameo was supposed to be funny and it makes sense that Murray would have survived the Zombie plague in real life. But the ending of the cameo wasn't funny as Columbus mistakenly shoots and kills Murray after he mistakes him for a Zombie.Tallahassee's internal arc seems to be resolved when Columbus does finally realize his buddy has a sensitive side; he discovers that Tallahassee has been been pining away for his young son rather than his dog.The film's denouement seemed quite abrupt. Columbus and Tallahassee must rush to the Pacific Playland Amusement Park to save the two young women who are trapped there. Card carrying members of the NRA should enjoy all the firepower as the two heroes save the women after blasting hordes of Zombies who have come after them. Columbus's internal arc is resolved when he falls in love with Wichita (now revealed to be 'Krista').And that's basically it. The foursome ride off into the sunset with no particular destination in mind. Presumably more encounters with Zombie are in store for them. Will there be a Zombieland II? Frankly, I hope not. There are just so many Zombies one can take!",5,6,10,17 September 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," My 'hero's journey' analysis of a classic American cinematic masterpiece
","George Bailey must learn his LIFE LESSON that 'No man is a failure who has friends.'
George's BIG FLAW is that there is a voice inside that tells him he doesn't need any friends-that he's better than them; that's why he wants to leave Bedford Falls.
His DARK VOICE WITHIN is represented by POTTER, the meanest man in town who believes money and social status is more important than friendship. Deep down, POTTER is jealous of George's father who has the respect of the COMMUNITY.
THE GUIDE that helps George to self-awareness is Clarence, an Angel Second Class. Clarence's REWARD is that he will receive his wings if he's able to help his charge.
George's REWARD is self-awareness of his goodness and the end to the dark voice within that drives him to want to take his own life.
Clarence must come up with a plan to help George gain self-awareness; but since he knows nothing about him, Clarence (as well as the audience) must sit back and see how George arrived at his DARK MOMENT OF DESPAIR.
THE EXPOSITION establishes George's goodness. He's heroic in saving his kid brother Harry from drowning after he falls through the ice (but in doing so develops a physical FLAW-losing the hearing in one of his ears).
Through his intelligence and resourcefulness, he also saves MR. GOWER a potential DARK FORCE druggist from ruin after he accidentally puts poison in a prescription order for a customer.
As a teenager George meets MARY, his eventual LOVE INTEREST who complements his basic goodness.
But George still believes he will leave the town until THE INCITING INCIDENT: George's father has a stroke and dies.
But before the journey, George REFUSES to take the reins at the building and loan.
POTTER appears and attempts to take over the Building and Loan but George agrees to be elected president which begins THE JOURNEY INTO THE CHANGED WORLD.
George spurns POTTER'S offer to work for him.
George makes another SACRIFICE for Harry who is now engaged and offered a job out of town by staying as head of the Building and Loan.
George realizes that getting married and raising a family with Mary is a better option for him.
But he SUFFERS A REVERSAL as he can't even go on a honeymoon at the MIDPOINT where a run on the bank causes him to spend all of his honeymoon money on saving the business.
Instead George's friend Bert and Ernie, a cabdriver and cop, serenade at an old house which will now be refurbished by the newlyweds as George attempts to adjust to his new reality.
During World War II George remains in Bedford Falls due to his hearing loss. Harry's elevation to hero winning the Congressional Medal of Honor only reminds George of the (illusory) opportunities he may have missed.
A DARK MANEUVER occurs when Uncle Billy absentmindedly puts all of the bank's proceeds in Potter's hands who keeps the money and effectively makes George a felon.
George's anger comes out when he lashes out at Uncle Billy. A series of ESCALATING REVERSALS including George's sullen reaction at home where he yells at one of his children's teachers over the phone which leads George to be slugged by the teacher's husband after arriving at Martini's bar.

The Witch," Convincing tale of Puritan family's paranoia leading to murder ruined by reliance on typical horror film tropes
","The Witch marks the directorial debut of Roger Eggers, who meticulously researched this tale of a 17th century Puritan family banished from their community due to a disagreement over the interpretation of the New Testament. The characters and dialogue are based on actual court transcripts from the time period as well as folk tales that reflect the supernatural beliefs of the people of that era.The attention to period detail is perhaps the film's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness. Eggers' protagonists--consisting of parents William and wife Katherine, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, as well as their daughter, Thomasin (who emerges as the story's antagonist)--feel as though they were delivered directly to the screen via a time machine. The verisimilitude of the characters is that convincing. At the same time, because they speak in the arcane style of old English, dependent on the Bible, you might find it quite difficult understanding the words that are being uttered—unless English subtitles are available on your DVD.The story begins with the family living in a remote, rural area. Thomasin is babysitting Katherine's newborn son, Samuel, who is kidnapped—and we soon learn that a witch snatched Samuel and killed him for his blood (to make a flying ointment). When William takes Caleb hunting, he confesses that he sold Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. Later, when Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of the cup, she implies that not only did she steal the cup but also had something to do with Samuel's disappearance. Meanwhile, the other children claim that the family goat, Black Phillip, has been talking to them.When Caleb decides to go hunting in the forest by himself, Thomasin insists on joining him. Eventually William finds Thomasin but Caleb ends up in the clutches of a witch and when he finally returns to the home, he's dying of a fatal illness. After the young boy's death, the twins and Thomasin accuse one another of being in league with witches and William is forced to lock them all up in the goat's stable.What could have been a nice little story of a 17th century family's paranoia leading to murder, is replaced by a silly folktale about witches being responsible for the carnage that unfolds before us. The sequence of events is as follows: the twins disappear, William finds Thomasin unconscious in the stable with blood on her hands, Black Phillip kills William, Katherine blames Thomasin for William's death and attempts to strangle her, and Thomasin kills her mother in self-defense. Eggers appears to buy the superstitious mumble-jumble of those times when he has Thomasin end up in the forest talking to Black Phillip the goat, who of course is actually Satan. When she signs Satan's 'big book,' it's the old trope of signing away one's soul to the devil.Alan Scherstuhl, writing in the Village Voice, couldn't have said it better: 'The Witch purports, at times, to confront ignorance and hysteria, but in the end, for horror thrills, Eggers's film sides with the preachers and executioners.' In other words, despite all the impressive research, The Witch is just another dumb horror movie. Despite the earnest performances (especially an intense Anya Taylor-Joy playing the accused Thomasin), once we're force fed all this nonsense about witches and a goat morphing into Satan, all bets are unfortunately off.",4,3,6,22 February 2017
Jersey Boys," Eastwood's adaptation of Bway jukebox musical suffers from over long exposition but still entertains
","If you're forced to choose between Jersey Boys the Broadway Musical or Clint Eastwood's movie, I would recommend seeing the Broadway show. While the movie shows more in terms of historical material, the musical proves to be much more of an emotional experience. Eastwood starts the story of the Four Seasons with perhaps too much exposition. Christopher Walken shows up in the thankless role of 'Gyp', a local Mafioso who the founding member of the band, local hothead Tommy DeVito is beholden to. DeVito introduces Gyp to teenager Frankie Castelluccio (who later changes his name to Frankie Valli). We then learn how DeVito gets the young Frankie involved in criminal activity, DeVito ends up taking a 6 month rap for the burglary they were both involved in, Frankie meets Mary Delgado who convinces him to change his name to Valli (and they eventually get married), Nick Massi becomes part of the group and is sent to prison for trespassing at a local church (again Frankie is let off) and Frankie ends up a victim of a scam by two local hoodlums, one who pretends to murder the other. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed in order to get us to Act 2 sooner. Act 2 of course begins when Bob Gaudio joins the group and this is where the story gets interesting. Gaudio is the complete opposite of DeVito. He's an intellectual who quotes T.S. Elliot and his quite knowledgeable about the music business. DeVito is a gambler who demands to be the center of attention. Valli, on the other hand, though streetwise like Devito, is much more conservative and ends up making a business deal with Gaudio to split songwriting royalties and any outside business not involving the group.The group's rise to fame is quite entertaining as we learn how they hook up with their flamboyant, gay producer, Bob Crewe, who guides them in releasing their first hit, 'Sherry'. We get to hear a good number of the Four Seasons' big hits, which are staged by Eastwood as performance pieces (as opposed to big choreographed numbers). One of the best scenes is when Gaudio, Valli and Massi learn of DeVito's $100K debt to a loan shark as well as approximately $600K to the IRS. The honorable Valli agrees to play in Vegas until he pays off DeVito's debt. Before quitting the group, Massi sounds off about life on the road with DeVito and how difficult it was putting up with the tough guy narcissist. Gaudio and Valli had it easier, since they didn't have to room with the surly DeVito.Once the group breaks up, the focus is on Valli who must deal with the tragedy of the death of his daughter, due to a drug overdose. I seem to recall that the daughter's death was much more effective on stage than the way it's handled here by director Eastwood. Like all the female characters in the movie, Valli's daughter is underdeveloped and the way in which her demise is dealt with, seems a bit rushed.The ending of the film focuses on The Four Seasons induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. We learn what the band members were doing after years had passed and one notes that there is a reconciliation between DeVito and Valli. Clint Eastwood attempts to stage a big production number at film's end, but it falls completely flat (at one point the big cast freezes a number of times, and the entire production number ends up looking quite pathetically awkward).The acting is quite decent with John Lloyd Young (who starred in the original Broadway production) reproducing Frankie Valli's unusual falsetto voice. As in the Broadway show, each character speaks to the audience, inducing a Rashomon-like effect—telling the story from their different perspectives.Once Jersey Boys gets to the formation of The Four Seasons, the story takes on a life of its own. You can't argue with hearing all those great hits, souped up in modern day arrangements. I would recommend seeing this film but would also recommend seeing the Broadway show if you're ever in NYC. The film is not without its flaws (it could have been pared down), but in the end, it certainly entertains.",6,0,15,25 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Critics and liberal public seduced by overrated journalism exercise masquerading as compelling drama
","Emboldened by her big Oscar win for 'Hurt Locker,'' Director Kathryn Bigelow was determined to fry some bigger fish, by taking on the herculean task of chronicling the 10 year manhunt for America's most wanted man: Osama bin Laden. Initially, Bigelow partnered with screenwriter Mark Boal, to write about the failed attempt to catch Bin Laden at Tora Bora. Everything changed when bin Laden was caught and disposed of, so Boal scrapped the Tora Bora script and hashed out a new one rather quickly, featuring the now famous mission that resulted in bin Laden's demise.Bigelow's strategy was to create a composite character based on the exploits of numerous CIA agents who were involved in tracking down and eventually uncovering bin Laden's infamous lair. She ended up creating 'Maya' (Jessica Chastain), after hearing about one particular female CIA agent involved in bin Laden's capture. As Rex Reed correctly notes in ''The Observer,' there was no evidence that the hunt for bin Laden was the exclusive province of one woman. In Reed's opinion, Bigelow's desire to create a 'Wonder Woman' character backfires, as it ends up that 'Ms. Chastain's stoic, textbook approach to the role does nothing to illuminate or enlighten.'The bigger problem with 'Zero Dark Thirty' is that it's inherently undramatic. Maya is never pitted against a concrete antagonist, whom she must butt heads with. In its place are a coterie of both individual terrorists whom we get to know for only a short time (Ammar Al-Baluchi, who's water boarded due to his 9/11 connections, or faceless terrorists, such as the ones whom attempt to assassinate Maya, when she attempts to drive out of the US Embassy in Pakistan). Bigelow ends up connecting her fictional Maya through sleight of hand: suddenly she just happens to be eating dinner at the Islamabad Hotel, when it's blown up in 2008 or her good CIA friend Jessica, is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. It's all good journalism, but Maya's individual drama, feels forced. When Maya does butt heads, it's merely with one of her CIA bosses, who's slow to act on her intelligence, due to orders from above (the new Obama administration certainly is proceeding too slowly for the veteran analyst's tastes).After a series of drawn out CIA torture scenes, as well as the aforementioned historical scenes straight from the CNN breaking news play book, Bigelow's and Boal's journalistic 'research,' pays some dividends when we're made privy to the way in which the CIA (Maya) tracks down bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed, who eventually leads them to bin Laden himself. Perhaps the most interesting scene in the film, is the way in which Ahmed is tracked down while driving his SUV (he's located through his cell phone signals).While I would argue Bigelow is way overrated in the script department, she does know how to use a camera. The final scene, where the crack team of Navy Seals invades bin Laden's compound, and finishes him off, is expertly choreographed and actually somewhat nail biting (even though everyone knows the outcome).Still, I'll argue Ms. Bigelow is a vastly overrated director, another Hollywood 'flavor of the month' (usually 'flavors of the month,' can last a good number of years, before they lose their taste). It's understandable, given the fact that there have been few female directors singled out as significant by the Hollywood powers that be, that suddenly Bigelow finds herself in the spotlight. In Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow and Boal mistakenly assumed that by merely clipping a few newspaper articles and conducting a few interviews with people connected to the CIA and then inserting a composite character into the action, that's enough to create a compelling story. Their 'mistake' still paid dividends: the overwhelming body of critics as well as a liberal general public, overjoyed by the liberal Obama administration's 'win,' rubber stamped an ordinary film, as a masterpiece!",5,2,5,22 September 2013
Steve Jobs," Director Boyle and Screenwriter Sorkin are guilty of celebrity worship in their fanciful portrait of 'tech guru' Jobs
","Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin want it both ways in their portrait of Steve Jobs: they're content to show him as an unlikable 'control freak' but inexplicably conclude that Jobs was some kind of visionary. Maybe Boyle and Sorkin's approach wouldn't be so reprehensible if they simply weren't content to stick to the basic facts about Jobs' life, but even Sorkin admits that his narrative is only very loosely based on true events and falls under the rubric of 'dramatic license.'All the drama is bunched up during the three key 'product launches' overseen by Jobs: the 1984 introduction of the MacIntosh, his NeXT 'Black Cube' in 1988 and the slightly more successful iMac in 1998. Much of what when on during these launches is fabricated to emphasize Jobs' intransigence or a prescient flip side. For example, the entire brouhaha about Jobs' purported threat to humiliate his programmer, Danny Herztfeld, if he couldn't get the computer to say 'hello' within 40 minutes before the launch, never happened. Similarly, Joanna Hoffman's shock that special tools were needed to open the computer since it was a closed system, also was a bogus invention (do you really think anyone on the Apple team wouldn't have known about their own computer's internal parameters?) Even Jobs' daughter Lisa's 'abstract painting' which supposedly induced him to pay more child support for ex-girlfriend Chrisann, was purely fictional. Boyle and Sorkin would like us to believe that Jobs was a master seer, prophesying that he would be hired back by Apple after sabotaging his NeXT computer by introducing it without an operating system. According to 'steve-jobs-the-movie-11-things-that-arent-true-about-the-apple-co- founder' by Rick Tetzeli at thefastcompany.com, the purported plan was that Apple then would turn around and offer Jobs control of the company after he finally developed an operating system. But Tetzeli informs that in 1988, Jobs 'had no reason to believe that this could—much less would— happen.' Eight years later Apple did buy the NeXT operating system but Jobs never predicted it.The idea that Jobs became a big success at the time the iMac was introduced is another fiction designed to promulgate Jobs as some kind of visionary. The truth of the matter is that Apple didn't get into the black until the introduction of the iPod, not back in 1998 when Jobs introduced the iMac.Boyle attempts to humanize Jobs by showing his dark side. In addition to the contemptuous way in which he treats his employees, Jobs also did a long number on his daughter, Lisa, by continually denying paternity in his puerile obsession to get even with his ex-girlfriend, Chrisann, whom he regarded as a bad mother. Due to the three scene 'product launch' narrative utilized here, Chrisann is never seen in her native habitat and hardly is fleshed out as a multi-faceted character. What we do learn about her is from Jobs' biased diatribes. More unforgivable is the simplicity in which Boyle handles the resolution of the father-daughter relationship. In the final scene, Jobs presents an 'I wasn't perfect' mea culpa to his daughter. Did the Grinch mellow after all this time? Maybe so, but there's also the fact that Lisa spent time with Jobs' OTHER family, his wife and children that were never mentioned during the entire film. Boyle's format prevents us from understanding Lisa's complex attitudes toward her father and how they evolved over time.If Sorkin has found any success, it's in his dramatizations of Jobs' confrontations with programmer Steve Wozniak, his assistant Joanna Hoffman and Apple Chairman John Sculley. The confrontation with Wozniak over Jobs refusing to honor the Apple 2 programmers before they're going to be fired at the iMac product launch, never happened according to Wozniak—but it's fine theater. Similarly, Hoffman's demand that Jobs apologize to Lisa for the years of abuse, tends to finally humanize the character played by Kate Winslet. Finally, perhaps the best scene, which alternates between past and present, is the clash between Sculley and Jobs, which fills us in why Sculley was forced to fire Jobs. The internal machinations at Apple prove to be fascinating, despite the stage play-like presentation. What I believe has been lost here is Boyle and Sorkin's failure to truly humanize their subject. Jobs had a dark side but also charisma—without it I see no reason why he would have become so successful in the corporate world. What's missing is the sense of humor and perhaps the mellowing with age that some who knew Jobs have alluded to. What's so odd about Boyle and Sorkins' treatment of Jobs is that they gingerly chronicle his bad points in his personal life and interpersonal relationships, but end up concluding that he wasn't such a bad guy after all. They also twist his history at Apple and give him much more credit due for the company's corporate success.In the grand scheme of things, Boyle and Sorkin end up putting Jobs on a pedestal. In their eyes, he was some kind of visionary despite the bad boy outbursts--note their shot of the frenzied audience and thundering applause at the product launch, for the 'guru' (Jobs thought of himself more as a music conductor like Seiji Ozawa).In reality, Apple is just a company putting out products which may or may not serve humanity's march forward (if there is such a thing). Much has been written about whether computers help or hinder us. But there was nothing special about Jobs—yeah, he made a lot of money and had a bit of an odd personality. But he was no visionary. A computer is just a computer. More important is the fact that Jobs always needed to be in control, often treated people poorly and was consumed by his goal of success. A final shot of a cancer-ridden Jobs would have been more appropriate than the beaming 'guru' at a podium, cheered by adoring sycophants.",5,5,11,24 October 2015
Crazy Heart," Bridges' Oscar worthy performance highlights engaging portrait of aging country singer's battle with the bottle
","In an Oscar worthy performance, Jeff Bridges is 'Bad Blake', a down on his luck, washed up country singer who is addicted to the demon alcohol. What I like about the screenwriter's characterization of Bad Blake, is that he's someone who still likes himself despite all the reversals he's had in his life. It's precisely this portrait of an aging former country star who 'sticks to his guns' that makes the character believable and prevents the story from descending into bathos.When we first meet Bad Blake, he's just arrived in his beat up '78 Suburban for a gig at a bowling alley somewhere in a small town in the mid west. When he plays and sings before the appreciative audience, it appears that he's just going through the motions—toward the end of his set, he walks off the stage and lets the hired band play, while he hits the bottle backstage. And when he returns, he only plays for one minute and calls it a night. After returning to his motel, he continues his downward spiral by drinking himself into a stupor.His next gig is in another small town at a bar. There he meets a talented piano player who asks him if he would allow an interview with his niece, Jean, a local reporter, smartly played by Maggie Guyllenhaal. Blake is guarded during his interview with Jean and won't talk about his former country music partner, Tommy Sweet, who soon appears prominently in the story. Before you know it, Blake finds himself in bed with Jean and a relationship develops. Some critics and internet posters cannot believe that a younger, good-looking woman would fall for an washed-up alcohol like Bad Blake. In the novel the movie is based on, the woman is closer to Blake in age. Yes, it might be a stretch to believe that a younger woman would fall for a character such as Bad Blake, but it's still possible—especially if the woman in question is emotionally needy and has had a pattern for falling for self-destructive types (she even admits this later when she breaks up with Blake).Soon Blake hears from his tough but caring manager (very convincingly played by James Keane) that he's arranged a gig for Blake to play on the under card of Tommy Sweet's big concert which will have over 10,000 people in attendance. Sweet, a younger former protégé, has eclipsed Blake and now boasts a huge following on the country music circuit. Blake decides to swallow his pride and accepts the gig since he needs the money. When we first meet Sweet, he's greeting Blake in the parking lot before the concert. Colin Farrell does a fine job in portraying the thoughtful Sweet who wants to help Blake by offering to record some of Blake's new songs if he only gets around to composing them. At this point, Blake turns Sweet down since he indicates that his muse had dried up. Nonetheless, both Blake and Sweet put on a rousing show before enthralled fans (Bridges and Farrell, under the tutelage of a vocal coach, do a fine job in doing their own singing on the soundtrack).At the midpoint one wonders where the story is going and two major events occur that keep things moving nicely forward. In both cases, Blake's alcoholism puts him in jeopardy. In the first event, Blake is almost killed when he nods off at the wheel and his Suburban rolls over into a ditch off the highway. In the second event (where the stakes are significantly raised), Blake loses Jean's four year old as he takes a few drinks at a bar at a local mall. Security guards at the mall eventually locate the boy but Jean is infuriated and breaks up with Blake on the spot.It's this horrendous event that convinces Blake that he needs to get himself in rehab. Helped by his friend, a local bar owner (ably played by the always dependable Robert Duvall), Blake weans himself off the bottle. He thinks this is enough for Jean to forgive him, but she makes it clear she doesn't want to see him again.Jean's rejection finally brings Blake completely down to reality. Now he really cleans himself up (physically and spiritually) and begins writing music again. He even takes time to try and contact his son who he hasn't seen in years (sadly, the son wants nothing to do with him).Before you know it, Tommy Sweet has recorded one of Blake's hits and it's become a #1 smash. Sweet hands Blake a big royalty check and it appears he's now back in the money and rehabilitated himself. Blake faces one last hurdle when he runs into Jean at Sweet's concert. She's now married and forgives Blake for what happened with her son. We fade out as Blake grants Jean a new interview.Jeff Bridges does an excellent job of playing the talented but troubled alcoholic. He's probably a shoo-in for this year's Oscar. In fact, all the performances in Crazy Heart are uniformly excellent and they prevent the story from becoming predictable and clichéd. Crazy Heart does suffer from slow pacing at times (some of the 'bonding' scenes between Blake and Jean's four year old go on for a little too long) but all in all, there are enough twists and turns in the plot to hold your interest to the end. Crazy Heart is one of the stronger entries in this year's crowded field of indie entries for best picture.",8,2,3,7 February 2010
12 Years a Slave," Modern day progenitors may be blamed for the 'sins of the fathers' in this faithful adaptation of an 1853 slave memoir
","Having read some excerpts from the book the film is based on, it appears that this is a very thorough adaptation of Solomon Northrup's original account which was written at the time of course as an expose-to sway northern conservatives who might have been on the fence concerning the horrors of slavery.
The danger here is that a '19th century' story can have a whole different meaning when presented in a modern day context. Director Steve McQueen already established himself as having a talented visual eye but also an unhealthy obsession with violence (his disappointing fictional effort, 'Shame,' focused on a protagonist's sexual fixation). Thus McQueen (in the grand style of Tarantino), may have been drawn to Northup's tale more for the salacious moments than explaining what slavery and its legacy was all about.
Similarly, screenwriter John Ridley, may have been attracted to the story in order to draw a parallel between what he perceives as modern day racism and the horrors of the past. Of course equating slavery with the 'racism' of today is absurd as the physical subjugation of African-Americans was eliminated following President Lincoln's 'Emancipation Proclamation' and codified into law with the 14th Amendment. Nonetheless, a story such as Northrup's, can still be used by writers like Ridley to intimidate rather than edify.
Northrup's story only focuses on the very worst aspects of slavery and for its time makes sense. But there is little sense here of the black man's triumph IN SPITE of the degradations they had to endure. The positive message (which reverberates today, for example, in many black churches) but is ignored in this film, leaves one wondering if Ridley's screenplay is designed more as agitprop than art.
The flip side of the coin is the deleterious effect the legacy of slavery had on the psyche of African-Americans throughout the years. Is it more important to make a movie simply about the horrors of slavery without discussing the effects of its legacy?
Despite these concerns as to the questionable motivations of the director and his screenwriter, in a limited sense, Northrup's story still features powerful moments which begin with the family man/musician's abduction by slave traders in 1841 Saratoga, NY. The break into the Second Act, which constitutes the beginning of Northrup's nightmare, is when he's sold into slavery down in New Orleans. The scene is doubly horrifying as Northrup witnesses the separation of two children from their mother, who are all sold into slavery.
The first half of Act II features heightening tension as Northrup is sold to a relatively kind but ineffectual plantation owner, William Ford, who treats him decently and even gives him a violin as a present. Ford recognizes that Northrup is educated (without questioning where he got his education) and allows him to assist in engineering a waterway for transporting logs downstream.
Nonetheless, Ford is unable to prevent the plantation overseer, the brutal racist Tibeats, from severely beating Northrup, who is almost lynched but prevented by the head overseer, who is afraid that Ford will lose his original $400 investment. Although Ford is the owner, Tibeats is really in control and settles on selling Northrup to another plantation owner, the even more brutal Edwin Epps.
Epps is a religious fundamentalist who reads Bible passages to his slaves but also beats them whenever he's in the mood. He's also a hypocrite, as he's sexually infatuated with a young slave, Patsey, whom he rapes and will not stop, despite his wife's constant entreaties. The jealous wife takes out all her hatred on poor Patsey too; in one powerful scene, she offers treats to all the slaves, except Patsey, who she strikes in the head in front of her husband, and a horrified Northrup and his fellow slaves.
Northrup's deliverance occurs in Act III when he meets a white man, Bass, a carpenter, who's doing a job for Epps and has abolitionist sentiments. Northrup is reluctant to tell Bass his story since earlier he was betrayed by a white worker on the plantation, after he attempts to convince the man to mail a letter for him, to alert his family and friends in New York. Northrup finally decides to trust Bass and things are set in motion, which leads to his freedom. Brad Pitt might not have been the best casting choice here but his character Bass's intervention proves to be one of the few positive moments in this very dour tale.
Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent in the role of Northrup as he echoes the original author's restrained dignity. In one sense, McQueen and Ridley should be praised for resurrecting this 'historical artifact.' On the other hand, the narrative is limited and ignores both the positive and negative effect the legacy of slavery had on the descendants of its victims.
Instead, this antediluvian tale brings little or nothing positive to the modern-day debate about race relations wherein the 'sins of the fathers' may be deemed morally equivalent by some misguided individuals, to what's going on today.",6,2,6,15 November 2013
There Will Be Blood," One-dimensional portrait of American businessman
","I haven't read Upton Sinclair's 'Oil' which 'There will be blood' is based on but I understand that the main character in the movie is depicted as being far more demonic than the character shown in the book. So apparently it's the screenwriter who we can heap scorn upon here and not the novelist responsible for the original source material.Paul Thomas Anderson, the screenwriter, has borrowed a page from the second half of 'Citizen Kane' where a multi-dimensional character suddenly morphs into a one-dimensional bad guy. But in 'There will be Blood', our anti-hero, Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is one-dimensional throughout! There seems to be a mantra uttered these days that Day-Lewis's performance is a masterpiece and he deserves the Oscar. Except for a few dramatic angry outbursts, Day-Lewis's performance appears to me as entirely one-note! That's really the fault of the screenwriter, who believes in the 'I'm not OKyou're not OK' school of screen writing. Make your character someone who openly admits that he has contempt for everybody and also (unconsciously) dislikes himself. Anderson's Plainview is a metaphor for big business past and present. It's a puerile view of American business and American businessmen since no one is like that in real life. Evil characters need to have likable and hence charismatic characteristicsthey attain their objectives by seducing their constituents (e.g. Tony Soprano). One wonders how such a surly and nasty character as Plainview actually succeeds. Notice how the peripheral characters in this film have virtually nothing to saythey are completely underdeveloped. The screenwriter is content to explore only his relationships with three main characters, his son, Eli, the minister and his pseudo half-brother (who he ends up killing after he realizes that the man is really a con artist). One wonders why Plainview has to be so demonic and unlikable. Would a person whose main goal is to be successful jeopardize his entire career by murdering the man who pretended to be his brother? Would a person who purportedly did everything for his handicapped son throughout the boy's childhood suddenly turn around and disown him simply because he wants to move away with his wife and start his own company in Mexico? And finally, does it make ANY SENSE AT ALL that he would risk imprisonment by murdering the minister who comes begging to him after he's lost all his money in the stock market crash? I understand that Plainview was getting back at Eli for humiliating him after he was forced to undergo Baptism in order to lease the land from one of the parishioners, but to suddenly murder the fellow with a bowling pin at the end made no sense at all!'There will be blood' is melodrama which descends into cheap propaganda. While Daniel Day-Lewis will probably win for best actor (and I don't think he should), my prediction is that this picture will not win the Oscar. The truth of the matter is that it's too much of a downerand downers don't win Oscars!",3,13,24,10 February 2008
Joker," Director Phillips' moral equivalence between criminality fueled by mental illness and a one-dimensional corrupt, fascistic society, proves specious
","Director Todd Phillips' origin story stars Joaquin Phoenix in a dark, gritty fairy tale as to how the Joker of DC Comics fame, became the number one criminal of Gotham City. Phillips likens Gotham to a New York City of the very early 80s, replete with rampant crime, a garbage strike, rats, Joe Franklin-like TV shows, graffiti laden subway cars and VCRs.
The Joker's decompensation is shown in increments as he devolves into criminality and madness. The main strike against him is that he never moved out of his mother's apartment and takes care of his demented elderly mother, who has a long history of mental health issues. Eventually, in a scene where he's able to illegally extract an old report from the state mental hospital, he learns that his mother used to work for (now) mayoral candidate, Gotham's power broker Thomas Wayne (father of Bruce, who eventually became Batman). It appears that the mother developed the delusion that Wayne impregnated her and that the Joker is actually Wayne's illegitimate son.
The Joker ends up paying a visit to the Wayne mansion where he encounters little Bruce and chokes Alfred the Butler, after not being allowed in to see Thomas Wayne. Soon afterward, he's able to sneak into a concert hall where he punches the elder Wayne who's just finished relieving himself in the bathroom.
Phillips also fills in the backstory of the Joker's daily life in which he constantly finds himself laughing inappropriately in public (it's later brought out he sustained a brain injury after his mother's boyfriend smashed his head in against a radiator when he was a child). The Joker even has a card made up which he gives to strangers whenever he's subject to these laughing outbursts, explaining the origin of this peculiar neurological condition.
There's quite a bit more dark stuff we end up privy to--including how the Joker loses his Rent-a-Clown job after he drops a gun at a hospital where he's entertaining children (a co-worker had given him the gun after a bunch of punks assault him while he's working as a street performer) as well as how he murders three Wall Street types on a subway train after they taunt and beat him up.
The Joker also develops a thing for Sophie, the next door neighbor who has a young daughter. Phillips does well in showing how The Joker deludes himself into believing that he has developed some kind of romantic relationship with her. He even imagines Sophie visiting him and mother at the hospital, after she has a stroke.
For all the imagined scenarios, reality intrudes. There's a scene where Sophie confronts him and asks whether the Joker has been following her. And later he breaks into her apartment and when she comes home, the Joker asks her, 'You're Sophie, right?' as if in reality, he hardly knew her. When he leaves the apartment, we're left wondering if he ended up murdering his neighbor but Phillips wisely keeps it a mystery.
All in all, Phillips is intent on portraying a man who is gradually losing his grip on reality and becoming more and more violent. The Joker even ends up suffocating his mother with a pillow, causing her death. But Phillips unfortunately wants it both ways: as much as how he adroitly depicts how the Joker became the master criminal he came to be, he also attempts to evoke sympathy for him by depicting society (both the community and government) besieged by a simplistic, fascistic mentality and morality.
Phillips draws a moral equivalence between the Joker's criminality (perhaps excused by so-called mental illness) and a society motivated by promoting the haves over the have-nots. The Joker is a perennial victim beginning with Thomas Wayne who not only has no toleration for lawlessness and will use any means necessary in cracking down on the disenfranchised but has no sympathy for the Joker (who's convinced that Thomas is his father).
There are no moderates in Phillips' comic book world. The Joker's therapy sessions must be discontinued due to government cuts (they obviously no longer have resources or patience for the disenfranchised). The Joker's co-worker (whom he eventually stabs to death) believes only in vigilante justice and gives him the gun with the proviso that he pay him back out of his salary.
The three upstanding Wall Street guys who end up beating the Joker up on the train, do so without mercy, and he responds by executing them. The Joker's life-long dream of becoming a standup comedian is fulfilled after he's invited on to the Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) Show but this is only after the show's producers utilize earlier clips of the Joker performing at a comedy club, in order to mock him.
The Joker becomes a movement when he executes Murray Franklin on live TV and then is hailed as a hero by criminals who now regard him as some sort of savior. As much as Phillips may abhor the violence of those who advocate class warfare on the basis of income inequality, he also revels in the violence by harping on it and depicting the Joker as some kind of victim.
The denouement is also unsatisfying as Phillips suggests that after The Joker is locked up at the state mental hospital, this whole story might have been a figment of his imagination. That way I suppose Phillips can escape accusations of promoting a moral equivalency between criminality fueled by mental illness and an indifferent, one dimensional fascistic society.",4,5,11,14 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Despite hokey premise, 'Alien' meets Groundhog Day as Cruise delivers in entertaining sci-fi action-adventure
","There are a number of reasons why 'Edge of Tomorrow', a Tom Cruise sci- fi action-adventure vehicle, did quite well at the box office in 2014. Primarily it's the overall concept: a 'Groundhog Day' mixed with the alien invasion genre.Cruise adopts a variation of the 'Bill Murray' role, playing a former advertising executive turned public relations officer for the US Army, and assigned to a United Nations-like 'United Defense Army', who have been entrusted with the difficult task of battling a bunch of nasty aliens who have taken over almost the entire European continent.Cruise plays 'Major' William Cage and he's similar to the narcissistic Phil Connors in 'Groundhog Day'. Both must go through the trial of time repeating itself before they develop the insight to change their personalities. Connors' character flaw that he must overcome, is misanthropy; Cage, on the other hand, must overcome not only his lack of competence as a soldier, but his 'cowardice'. It's General Brigham who sees through Cage's phoniness and lack of bravery right away and has him arrested after an escape attempt; as punishment, Cage is stripped down to the rank of private, and finds himself assigned to a forward operating unit at Heathrow Unit in London, about to be shipped off the battlefield on the French beaches.Cage ends up under the charge of Master Sergeant Farrell who bullies him continually after learning that he's labeled as a 'deserter'; Cage meets the various soldiers, who he ends up fighting with against the aliens on the beaches of France. Cage is petrified as he's parachuted down on to the field of battle. Before being almost immediately killed by one of the aliens (called Alphas, larger aliens who command the foot soldiers, the Mimics), he meets Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who tells him to seek her out, when he 'wakes up'.The film becomes much more engrossing and entertaining when Cage suddenly wakes up and finds himself back at Heathrow and being escorted once again by Sergeant Farrell to meet the same fellow soldiers he met before. He realizes he's in some kind of time loop but doesn't know why. In order to meet up with Sgt. Vrataski, he must find a way to escape from his platoon and there's some comedy thrown in when he tries to sneak underneath a truck and gets crushed, only to have Sgt. Farrell quip, 'What the hell were you thinking?' But after getting killed, we see Cage make a second attempt going under the truck, and this time he makes it.Cage hooks up with Vrataski who puts him through a grueling training course to learn how to successfully navigate his way through the battlefield against the mimics. Each time he fails, she finishes him off with a bullet from her gun and he goes through the same training, eventually perfecting his craft as a warrior.Vrataski also introduces Cage to Dr. Carter who explains how he came to acquire the power to continually to go through the time loops. The explanation proves that the film's premise is not grounded in science but rather fantasy—so for those Ingmar Bergman aficionados out there, do not be disappointed if this explanation doesn't turn out to be 'rocket science'. Cage ended up getting sprayed by the blood of an Alpha after he killed it in battle and somehow, since the Alphas are hooked into the hive mind, the Omega (who controls the time looping ability), that somehow allows him to take over the Omega's fantastic power. This power can only become undone if one ends up getting a blood transfusion (which is exactly what happened to Vrataski before, when she was wounded on the battlefield and brought to a field hospital!).Obviously getting too caught up in analyzing the pseudo-science behind the whole time-looping premise, will only detract from the enjoyable machinations to come. Cage, now fully a 'battle machine', has been clued in about the Omega's visions, which may lead him to where the 'queen bee' is hiding. After several scenarios on the beach where Vrataski keeps getting killed, he decides to proceed inland himself, but discovers that the Omega hiding out at a German dam, is only a ruse.The plot now thickens when Cage, Vrataski and Carter decide to lift a 'prototype' which has been developed at the Ministry of Defense, to locate the Omega. That seems rather convenient but there's enough 'action' along the way, to keep your interest. And this is when Cage is injured and ends up getting a blood transfusion, losing his power to reset each day.The climax is slightly anti-climactic. Cage of course finds out where the Omega is hiding (under the Louvre of all places!) and must destroy the big blob in order to disconnect the rest of the interconnected Alphas and Mimics. This whole idea of an interconnected hive, tied to a controlling 'brain' (and forcing the good guys to destroy it) has been done ad infinitum. Cases in point: the Borg series in Star Trek: Next Generation (with the 'brain' taking over the body of Picard and now calling himself 'Locutus') and 'Vikki', the chief operating system in 'I Robot'.Since Cage gets splattered with the Omega's blood after it explodes, he gets one more reset. This time he wakes up where it's announced that a 'power surge' in Paris causes a cessation in all alien activity—the threat is neutralized. Cage is now back being a major and meets Vrataski, who of course, doesn't recognize him. In addition to the enjoyable plot and pulsating electronica score, 'Edge of Tomorrow' features some neat battle suit designs (based on real-world exoskeleton initiatives), as if appropriated from an 'apocalyptic' Mad Max set. Kudos to Mr. Cruise for the excellent stunts. 'Edge' maintains its edge despite the hokey premise and a few clichés along the way. Definitely worth a look!",7,1,3,3 November 2014
Whiplash," Only neat music and cinematography make this tawdry, melodramatic tale of sadomasochistic relationship between jazz conservatory student and teacher, worth watching
","In the 70s, a new genre of films aimed at black audiences emerged entitled, 'Blaxploitation'. The genre primarily glorified stereotypical 'criminal' behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction. Both white liberal film critics and martial arts enthusiasts alike, will enjoy this exercise in sado-masochistic shenanigans as evidenced by the plethora of rave reviews now gracing a multitude of web pages over the internet.Don't ask any of our critics who rave about the film to require Mr. Chazelle to provide even a modicum of verisimilitude. I'm talking, of course, about how Mr. Chazelle's antagonist, the martinet music instructor, Terence Fletcher, would even last five minutes at a prestigious music conservatory, given his vast repertoire of sociopathic behavior. Oh but wait—'Whiplash' really is supposed to be more like a fable, so Mr. Chazelle is given a pass—he no longer has to be beholden to 'conventional' narratives.But even fables should operate within a somewhat realistic world. And is it realistic to have Fletcher's co-worker shrink from him (are they all so afraid that they dare not assert themselves one bit?) Is it realistic not to see Fletcher's interactions with his supervisors (are they also completely browbeaten by him?) Would the administration allow such a person to continually humiliate his students, hurl ethnic and gay slurs, and actually throw things at the students, which could result in personal injury (possibly subjecting the school to a lawsuit?). Fletcher is clearly a caricature, who belongs in an army setting and not a music conservatory. Nonetheless, Chazelle needs the character to not only titillate us along the way but to illustrate his simplistic morality play, which entails a warning about the dangers of obsessive careerism.Now of course various naysayers will argue that there ARE people like Fletcher who seek to bring out the best in their students by utilizing 'tough love' but such pedagogues in real life must work within the 'system' and the 'pushing' is much more subtle than what is depicted here.The same goes for Chazelle's protagonist, Andrew Neyman, who plays the obsessed drummer student who seeks to get in the good graces of the ruthless Fletcher. Neyman is played by Miles Teller whom I liked very much in 'The Spectacular Now'. Since he plays drums in real life, Teller is pretty convincing playing the drums in the film. But Chazelle applies the same 'sledge hammer' approach toward the character 'Neyman' as he does with 'Fletcher'. Neyman wants to 'make it' at 'any cost'. He plays the drums so hard until his hands start bleeding (various drummers posting on the internet deny they've seen cases of this); and then on his way to a competition, Neyman gets in a bad car accident, but STILL drags himself to the performance and attempts to play (Chazelle seeks to prove the inane point that Neyman is so obsessed, that he'll do anything to win—even if it means playing seriously injured and jeopardizing his own life). No really, can you see anyone doing this? But again, since this is more like a melodramatic fable, Chazelle can have his characters do the most ridiculous things, and seemingly get away with it!Two thirds of the Whiplash plot concerns Fletcher's quest to supposedly bring out the best in his students (none of whom do we really get to know except Neyman). John Bleasdale writing in CineVue finds Fletcher's diatribes appealing: 'His razor wit, sheer outrageousness, inventive taunting and vulgar insults are at once appalling and blackly funny.' I agree that Fletcher's insults are appalling but 'blackly funny'? Keep in mind that all the other characters who come in contact with Fletcher, have no ego, to the point that no one will oppose him. Therefore, Fletcher can get away with saying anything he feels like (some may call this 'wit', but in reality they're simply one note monologues--a set of variations on a theme).The second act crisis manifests itself when Neyman is kicked out of school after physically attacking Fletcher. The way back toward some kind of 'equilibrium' is when Neyman agrees to give a deposition in a lawsuit that eventually leads to Fletcher's dismissal from the conservatory.The Whiplash climax occurs after Neyman and Fletcher meet at a jazz club where Fletcher is now playing and Neyman agrees to play at a showcase. This turns out to be an ambush, since Fletcher arranges for Neyman to get up there without sheet music and he can only end up improvising (Fletcher is so demented that he's seemingly willing to sabotage the entire performance to get back at Neyman who he knows testified against him). Neyman runs off backstage into the arms of his good guy father but suddenly summons the courage to come back and play, where he dazzles, performing an extraordinary drum solo. Has Neyman triumphed after enduring the humiliating set-up? Not at all! He merely plays into Fletcher's stratagem to push him beyond his limits emotionally—even if it means that he must sacrifice his dignity and self-worth by allowing the mad sociopath to manipulate him over and over again.In order to accept Chazelle's tawdry tale, one must accept the conventions of melodrama. Clearly it's written as heightened reality to make a point about the sadomasochistic relationship between student and teacher. While Chazelle may ultimately view his characters at a distance with the correct moral upper hand, he mirrors Tarantino, by reveling in the violence that he is also attempting to disdain. The 'Whiplash' machinations end up more tawdry and sensationalistic than compellingly tragic.I would recommend 'Whiplash' for the excellent cinematography and of course all the neat jazz music. I'll pass on the story—due to its clear, unrealistic and melodramatic aftertaste.",4,139,249,6 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Occasionally interesting chronicle of Wall Street scam artist's life ends up as a poor man's 'Good Fellas'
","I like to think of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' as a poor man's 'Good Fellas'. They're both based on a true story about a character who is a moral failure and they both rely quite a bit on a narrator as well as improvised dialogue. 'Good Fellas' was primarily successful due to the strong, believable performances of Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci; both those actors were of Italian descent and they were playing characters that also were supposed to be Italian. But here Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to play Jordan Belfort, a Jewish guy from Queens. I watched clips of the real Belfort and I just felt DiCaprio doesn't come close to capturing the essence of the 'Wolf of Wall Street' (maybe I associate DiCaprio with too many other characters in films that he's been in before or maybe he simply is unable to move beyond his own persona). One other problem is that the stakes in 'Good Fellas' were much higher: there was that enormous Lufthansa heist and people being whacked all over the place; but here it's just a matter of investors being conned (who you never get to see on screen) and an anti-hero who's prone to a life of extraordinary excess.Still, Belfort's antics are mildly interesting, especially in the first half hour, where in a series of flashbacks, we see how he lost his stock broker job on his very first day on Wall Street due to the stock market crash of 1987. Matthew McConaughey is highly entertaining as Belfort's sleazy supervisor who imparts his 'greed is good' philosophy to the fledging shyster, while they dine together in a high-end restaurant. Probably the highlight of the first half hour is when Belfort employs a new phone script at the low class 'boiler room' where he's recently been hired—Belfort proves to be much polished than his fellow employees, who rely more on intimidation than finesse. Way less successful is Jonah Hill's character, Donnie Azoff (Danny Porush in real life). There's really nothing distinctive about Azoff (unlike a Joe Pesci in 'Good Fellas) except for the fact that he's married to his first cousin; Hill basically has no memorable scenes (unless you consider the ridiculous fight between Donnie and one of Belfort's drug couriers later in the film).Once Belfort is locked and loaded as CEO of the newly minted (and seemingly respectable) 'Oakmont Stratton', Scorsese's strategy is to highlight most of Belfort's reported true-life escapades. We're asked to laugh at the morally corrupt Belfort as Scorsese blasts us with Belfort's outrages piled on one after another. Not all of it essential to the plot. Take for example the scene where his wife's gay butler throws a party for his friends and some of Belfort's cash in the apartment ends up missing. The whole point of the scene is to show how ruthless and greedy Belfort is, with the butler ending up being held by his legs over a balcony. It's an interesting scene but again, not essential; cutting it could have contributed to the necessary shortening of the entire film, to a much more manageable two hour fest, as opposed to three.Another problem is Scorsese's penchant for stretching things out beyond any modicum of good direction (as well as plain good aesthetics). I'm thinking of the scene where Belfort is wasted after downing the Lemmon- 714 Quaaludes; after taking too many, Belfort finds himself at a country club where he's no longer able to work, so he has to crawl to his car. Yes it's supposed to be funny but the long 'crawl' just goes on for too long and dilutes whatever humor Scorsese is attempting to extract from the situation. Another drawn out scene which loses its comic effect is the yacht being tossed in the storm. After about a minute we get the idea but Scorsese doubles down on the slapstick, with Belfort and crew being tossed around ad infinitum.The dialogue here is very inconsistent. One very good scene is the cat and mouse conversation Belfort has with the FBI agent on his yacht. But often, Scorsese insists that his actors improvise, sacrificing verisimilitude (one example that sounded improvised to me, was the early Belfort-Donnie exchange where they discuss Donnie's incestuous relationship with his wife). While many people will find it hard to believe, most of the scenes in the movie actually happened (if we are to believe Belfort's book--same name as the film). One scene that didn't happen were the dwarfs being tossed around at the office party (at the beginning of the film). A critical scene that did not happen in real life is when Belfort slips the note to Donnie that he's wearing a wire. I understand that Belfort did this with another one of his employees but not Donnie. I think it was a mistake for Scorsese to take liberties here since the implication is Belfort is not such a bad guy after all, since he's not willing to betray his best friend (but in reality, he did).Ultimately, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' would have been a much better if it was shorter. Not all of Belforts' machinations are that interesting; after a while the greed simply becomes grating. Scorsese wants us to laugh at some of the outrageous things Belfort does and occasionally we end up amused. But 'Wolf' is also a cautionary tale about not following a good path in life. Scorcese and DiCaprio are critical of the 'old' Belfort but seem to have forgiven the 'new' (note that the real-life Belfort gets a cameo at film's end). Is Belfort really a new man? Prosecutors have recently alleged that Belfort only paid a fraction of the restitution he owes, detailed in the original plea agreement. Perhaps it's time for a new accounting. That's one important point I would have liked to have seen highlighted at end of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.",5,1,4,21 April 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Excellent Production Design can't save Coen Brother's weak satire on early 50s Hollywood studio system
","For those who have read my reviews, you can see I am not a big fan of the Coen Brothers. Yes, their production design is usually impeccable and for the most part they manage to cull fairly respectable performances from their actors. But they inevitably fall down in the area of screen writing and 'Hail, Caesar!,' their most recent take on the early 50s Hollywood heyday and Biblical epics, is no exception.Hail, Caesar! is pretty much a one-joke idea. The main plot revolves around the protagonist, Eddie Mannix, based on a real character of the same name, solidly played by Josh Brolin. Mannix is a 'fixer' for the fictional Capitol Pictures, charged with ensuring everything runs smoothly on the studio lot. When Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), star of the studio's main production, Hail, Caesar! (a poor man's 'Ben Hur'), is kidnapped, Mannix meets a ransom demand of $100,000 by requesting 'petty cash' from the accounting department. We soon find out that Whitlock has been kidnapped by a group of blacklisted Hollywood screenwriters who are depicted as a Communist cell.Unlike Trumbo, a recent biographical film about the noted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo which depicted blacklisted screenwriters as victims of a Congressional witch hunt, here the Coens throw political correctness to the wind and present the screenwriters not only as a traitorous bunch but also as a coterie of bumbling fools. Ironically, according to Ronald Radosh, in his article 'Will the New Trumbo Movie Rehash Old Myths?', Trumbo stated late in his career that his 'fellow Red screenwriters failed to get work not because they were Reds, but because they were 'mediocrities.' The Coens appear to echo Trumbo's sentiments. There's some mildly amusing stuff here when Whitlock is depicted as being charmed by the screenwriters, who have fallen under the spell of a crotchety old professor who spouts the party line. And later on, after Whitlock is rescued, Mannix slaps some 'sense' into him for allowing himself to be seduced by the 'dreaded' Communist writers. The climactic 'crisis' scene at the end of the second act also highlights the group's ineptitude, when one of the studio's actors, intending to defect, boards a Russian submarine, but accidentally drops the bag containing the ransom into the ocean, after his dog jumps into his arms. But the scene with the writers goes on for much too long and the jokes (elucidated above) tend to get lost in all the excessive verbiage.Another example of a joke that goes on for too long involves the sub-plot featuring the studio's Cowboy star, Hobie Doyle. Alden Ehrenreich is actually quite good in the role of a country crooner who's ordered by the studio to act in a period drama directed by the classically trained Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Laurentz attempts to have Doyle speak in a highly refined accent but after many takes, Doyle cannot escape from his ingrained Country-Western twang. The problem here are the many 'takes' that the Coens believe are hilarious but in reality become tiresome.The rest of the narrative in part features the Coens' satirizing some of the big Hollywood musical production numbers. Scarlett Johansson briefly shows up as DeeAnna Moran, an Esther Williams-like synchronized swimmer beset with an out of wedlock situation which Mannix must come in and 'fix.' This allows Jonah Hill to step forward in a brief cameo as an accountant who protects Moran's reputation by ultimately marrying her.Tatum Channing also does nicely as Burt Gurney, a Gene Kelly-like sailor, dancing up a storm in the Coens' homage to big movie musicals like 'On the Town.' Gurney is later revealed as the actor who defects to the Russians.Also of note is Tilda Swinton, playing identical twin gossip columnists based on the rivalry between Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. Frances McDormand also gets in the act as a chain-smoking film editor, who is almost strangled by an errant roll of celluloid that gets accidentally wrapped around her neck while frantically doing her job.In the end, the Coens' main plot simply is not clever or developed enough to sustain an entire feature. Instead, the sub-plots end up being more interesting to look at due to some more dynamic visual elements. Count on the Coens to deliver when it comes to production design—but only count on a few intermittent chuckles here and there, when it comes to the dialogue and story line.",5,2,3,7 August 2016
American Gangster," 'Gangster' is no 'Scarface'
","After watching the real Frank Lucas being interviewed on BET, I couldn't believe that Denzel Washington was cast as him. Denzel unfortunately is no Laurence Olivier and is unable to play anyone other than Denzel Washington. As others have pointed out, it's particularly difficult for him to play bad guy parts. There's no range or nuance in his performance to the point that he could have been playing any other gangster. The real Frank Lucas is a very unique character and Denzel virtually made no attempt to show any of this guy's idiosyncrasies. The writers do a poor job in fleshing out the Frank Lucas character as Denzel has little to do in his interactions with the other characters (Lucas's wife is the worst written part--her biggest scene is ducking a bullet meant for Frank toward the end of the movie).The story takes a very long time to get going and probably a half hour could have been cut from the beginning. The transition from Lucas going from small time protégé of Bumpy Johnson to big-time drug dealer is not very convincing. Other scenes seem completely over the top (for example, when Frank shoots a rival on the street to impress his family members and then calmly comes back and joins them to finish his meal. Have you ever heard of a murderer who doesn't want to get caught remain near the scene of the crime?)While the director attempts to show in part that Lucas's actions had very negative consequences for his community, the victims are shown at a distance in a docudrama style. In fact, the film would have been better made as a docudrama for the History Channel than a feature film. Russell Crowe does a serviceable job as the beleaguered detective (and later prosecuting attorney) who tracks down Lucas. But he's basically reprising his hard-edged detective part form L.A. Confidential. I read an article that the detective/prosecutor played by Crowe had a much lesser role in taking down Lucas in real life. One gets the feeling about American Gangster that the screenwriter only was able to collect the basic facts surrounding the life of Frank Lucas and virtually had little knowledge of Lucas's family members, criminal associates and opponents. Hence, the most fleshed out characters are the detective, his family and fellow cops as opposed to the people we would like to know more about (such as Nicky Barnes, etc.). The screenwriter ends up padding the script with some long drawn out chase scenes to make the film more dramatic. But at its core, there are few interesting revelations here aside from the surface facts of Lucas's story found on TV and in magazines. I would rather watch Al Pacino in the sensationalist 'Scarface' which was far more entertaining than the plodding 'Gangster' which never rises to the grandeur it aspires to.",4,12,19,23 December 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," 2006 fantasy dramedy lacks internal logic
","With fantasy films, there needs to be an internal logic that makes the premise plausible. Usually an external event or character disrupts the protagonist's world, creating an alternative universe in which the protagonist must navigate and gain insight: Back to the Future (time traveling car), Wizard of Oz (malevolent tornado); It's a Wonderful Life (Guardian Angel). Stranger than Fiction lacks the internal logic of these other films; no alternative universe is created. Rather the fantasy character Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), the fastidious numbers crunching IRS agent, suddenly discovers he's part of novelist Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest novel and becomes a real person in her world! So the idea of the fictional character becoming part of the real world lacks credibility and reduces Crick to a character you cannot take seriously. Had it been the other way around, with Eiffel finding herself in the fictional novel she's been writing, that might have worked a lot better!
Crick is depicted as a faceless bureaucrat, whose life is ordered by numbers. When he starts hearing Eiffel's voice in his head, he consults a couple of therapists to find out what's wrong with him but is eventually referred to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a 'literature expert' who finally buys the idea that Crick has come to life out of the exertions of a novelist. It's a silly idea with a professor accepting such a nonsensical idea but this is the logic neophyte screenwriter Zach Helm has handed to us!
The bulk of the film involves Crick's involvement with Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a young bakeshop owner whom he must audit. It turns out that Ana has refused to pay part of her taxes in the last few years as a sort of protest against a cold-hearted government, which has failed to live up to her left-leaning, Socialist beliefs. Of course Ana ends up transforming Crick into a mensch, who dispenses with his number-crunching ways, and develops a 'personality.'
Meanwhile, the big question is whether Eiffel will kill off Crick as she has done with her previous characters in all her prior novels. The publishing company assigns an assistant, Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), to help her finish the novel (if you can believe that). Crick finally finds Eiffel and begs her not to kill him off but after consulting with Hilbert, he accepts the idea that Eiffel's outline (in which she kills Crick off), is 'just right.'
Fortunately Eiffel changes her mind, and we're left with a happy ending, in which Crick survives and I guess becomes a real person (please ask screenwriter Helm how?). The diverse cast does its best with the flimsy material. That includes Ferrell in a more 'straight-acting' role.",4,0,1,25 June 2020
The Reader," More atonement than drama
","'The Reader' begins in West Germany in 1958. Michael Berg hails from a grim-faced German family and is ready to sow his adolescent oats. Hanna Schmitz, former SS concentration guard now turned streetcar conductor, brings Michael back to her apartment after he's not feeling well. Hanna gives Michael a bath and before you know it she's playing sex therapist to the impressionable teenager. The affair lasts a scant month or so but on screen it feels like an interminable couple of years.While Hanna is tender showing Michael new sexual positions, she is unable to control those flashes of temper (foreshadowing the revelation of a very nasty past!). Michael ends up reading various classic novels he's been reading at school to Hanna and she hides a deep dark secret that she is actually illiterate! One day Michael comes over to Hanna's apartment and she's disappeared.Flash forward to 1966. Michael is now a law student in Heidelberg. As part of a class trip, he attends a war crimes trial and finds Hanna in the docket, accused of unimaginable horrors as a Nazi concentration camp guard. Initially, Hanna denies she's the ringleader of a group of female guards responsible for an atrocity where they prevent a group of Jewish prisoners, locked inside a burning church, from escaping. Prosecutors insist that a document ordering the atrocity is in Hanna's handwriting. Hanna won't give up her dark secret of being illiterate and falsely confesses, taking the rap for her fellow Nazis. It costs her big time: a sentence of life in prison.The first half of 'The Reader' is slow-moving, the erotic scenes are repetitious and there's no central antagonist unless you count what's going on in Michael's confused mind. In a slightly more interesting second half, we meet an all grown up Michael (played by a grim-faced Ralph Fiennes). He's alienated and cut off from his emotions evidenced by his inability to bond with his daughter. Obviously he is still troubled by his relationship with Hanna even after all these years.So Michael decides to record the famous novels he used to read to Hanna in the old days on cassette tapes. Soon, Hanna is devouring the tapes and over the years finally learns to read comparing the tape narrations to books she's taken out in the prison library. Hanna writes to Michael but he won't write back (even though he still has feelings for her the idea of writing to a convicted former SS guard is something a good German should not do).Finally Hanna is about to be released but she has no family to help on the outside. Will Michael come and help her get set up with her own apartment? After initially balking, Michael changes his mind and meets Hanna in the prison cafeteria where he informs her that he's taken care of the apartment. But Michael asks her in effect does she feel any remorse for her actions as a Nazi? All she can that she is happy she's learned to read. As for the atrocitiesthere's nothing she can do about it now. Michael isn't happy with the answer but he'll still help her. But Hanna must pay the price in terms of the audience. No remorse = the need for some kind of punishment (Nazis must be punished!) So what does she do? On the day of her release, Hanna hangs herself. But she leaves a makeshift will, donating the rest of her cash to one of the Holocaust survivors, a woman who testified against her at the trial.In the best scene in the movie (and most truthful) Michael visits the Holocaust survivor in the United States where he informs her of Hanna's wishes. She doesn't want Hanna's money and tells Michael if he wants drama he should go to the theater and not dwell on concentration camps where no positive life lessons can be learned. Still Michael suggests donating the money to an illiteracy campaign and the Holocaust survivor won't stand in his way.Flash forward to 1995. Michael has overcome his demons and he's ready to tell the whole story of Hanna to his daughter as they pass Hanna's headstone in a church cemetery.Although the Reader is not a very dramatic or even good movie, it still is fascinating because its main focus is on the whole issue of German guilt. The movie is based on a novel written by a German writer, Bernhard Schlink, who is grappling with years of guilt feelings over the Holocaust. He's saying in effect, 'Hey, we Germans aren't that bad. Can you forgive us?' Schlink (and the Reader's screenwriter, David Hare) present two characters that don't mince words (the aforementioned daughter of the Holocaust survivor at the end of the movie and a young law student who points out that Hanna and her co-defendants are scapegoats since there were thousands who went unpunished).But while Schlink can face German responsibility for the Holocaust, he can do so only up to a point. His guilt leads to such confusion that Hanna is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape (however more typically, Nazis on trial would say they were 'only following orders').'The Reader' gives the wrong impression that Hanna was somehow not responsible for her actionsthat somehow by being ignorant, deep down she wasn't a bad person. In this way Schlink and Hare sugarcoat their antagonist. The vast majority of Nazis were not illiterate, ignorant peoplethey knew exactly what they were doing and they, along with the German people, followed Hitler with gusto.The generation of post-war Germans don't have to apologize for 'the sins of their fathers' nor feel guilt.

The Wrestler," Sympathetic but critical fable of the world of low-rent pro wrestling
","The Wrestler introduces us to a behind-the-scenes look at the world of low-rent professional wrestling through the eyes of one Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, an aging pro wrestler who's desperate to stay in the business despite being way past his prime. Director Darren Aronofsky treats the wrestling world sympathetically and partly shoots his film in the style of a documentary. He suggests that pro wrestlers are a benign bunch who work hard at their 'craft'. From the outset one sees that there is a great camaraderie between the wrestlers who are determined not to upstage one another and always put on a 'good show'. After watching 'The Wrestler', one comes away with a modicum of respect for these 'entertainers', as it appears quite a bit of rehearsal and detailed preparation goes into creating their mini-spectacles for the public.To reinforce the idea that the wrestling world is populated by 'good guys', the film's protagonist (very well-played by Mickey Rourke) is made out to be a tough guy with a heart of gold. The film's screenwriter, Robert Siegal, establishes that early on when he has Randy tumble around with the kids in the trailer park who all seem to love him. What's more Randy seems to really enjoy signing autographs and treats the younger wrestlers with the utmost respect.One of 'The Wrestler's' great strengths is that despite having respect for the journeymen who are devoted to their craft, it doesn't sugar coat the nature of the business itself. Pro wrestling is still a brutal sport that exacts a tremendous physical toll on its 'actors'. In one memorable scene, Randy hides a razor underneath his bandaged hand and uses it to cut himself on the forehead in order to draw blood in order to make his act more realistic. Right before the film's midpoint, another wrestler uses a staple gun on both himself and Randy as they tumble around in the ring. The peddling of steroids, hormones and illegal prescription medication is seen as routine when Randy casually buys a supply of HGH (Human Growth hormone) from a dealer inside the locker room.Randy is a tragic figure since he's not a bad guy but one who is unable to accept the fact that he is growing older. After he has a heart attack after a match and undergoes bypass surgery, he accepts his physician's admonitions that he'll probably die if he gets in the ring again. After working in a humiliating job behind a deli counter at a supermarket, the Ram can't accept being away from the only world he's ever known and decides to go ahead with the 20th anniversary of his famed fight with the 'Ayatollah', now a used car salesman who decides to come out of retirement for the money (It seemed a little too 'easy' for Randy to end up in that humiliating job behind the deli counter and I wonder why he didn't try harder to get a job that he could tolerate a bit better, such as driving a cab. Of course, without working at the humiliating job, there would be no direct motivation for his decision to return to the ring).Aronofsky's subplots include Randy's relationship with Marissa Tomei's lap dancer with a heart of gold, Cassidy, and estranged daughter Stephanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood). Cassidy parallels Randy's journey in that they both work in self-destructive professions. She too has a 'good heart', trying to raise a young son, while working in a seedy strip club. When Randy reveals he's had a heart attack, she no longer sees him as another 'customer' and eventually tries to prevent him from going ahead with his fight with the Ayatollah. When she arrives at the arena, she realizes that Randy is lost and is unable to stop his self-destructive spiral. Randy looks for her during the fight but sees she's already left.Randy's attempted reconciliation with his estranged daughter is a less developed subplot in the film. We find out little about the daughter, only that Randy ignored her when she was young and now wants to make amends. There's a good scene where Randy forgets about his dinner date with his daughter and instead ends up sniffing cocaine and having sex with a woman. The daughter's decision to cut all ties with her father after he shows up late for their date serves to illustrate another one of the wrestler's character flaws.Mickey Rourke seemed perfect for the part of Randy with his weather-beaten face and muscular but banged-up body. Rourke, whose career took a nosedive after being perceived in Hollywood as an unsavory character, shows that he has a sensitive side and is not such a bad guy after all. Like Randy, age has mellowed him! The Wrestler doesn't pretend to be a profound character study. In a sense, there are no real bad characters in this world. Rather, the world they are in is defective. The Wrestler is more a simple fable, a cautionary tale to all of us, that we should not resist the idea of aging gracefully.",6,0,2,5 September 2009
Inception," Sort of like a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s
","Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis. At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else's dream. It's a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito's fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we're trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself. Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their 'audition'; the extractors' 'architect', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they're all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different 'levels' in the dreamworld. Cobb's 'audition' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film's inciting incident: Saito's proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival's entire business empire. 'Inception' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to do—extracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito's proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can't resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of 'Inception', the 'exposition', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected 'Mission Impossible' superstar team who will penetrate Fischer's mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father's business empire. Nolan's explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don't tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there's a lot more 'tell' than 'show'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the 'journey' aspect of 'Inception'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the 'dream team' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they're able to return to reality—the so-called 'kicks', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our 'heroes' must navigate through—in fact, these so-called dreams don't look like dreams at all. Take Level 1—just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the 'good guys'. As for level 2—I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard 'Level 3', compared to 'Ice Station Zebra', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception's Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer's mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn't have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he's quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We're also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer's empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He's a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father's deathbed? He's just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn't he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now 'his own man'?The bulk of 'Inception' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded 'B' story, Cobb's tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot.",4,35,65,7 March 2011
Defiance," Standard but worthy Holocaust drama
","By necessity, one must focus on the survivors if one wishes to create a workable film about the Holocaust. For its only through the eyes and ears of the survivors (and their tales of suffering) that we can appreciate the enormity, the scope of what occurred to the victims of the Holocaust. Paradoxically, the tales of the survivors are nothing more than anomalies—which may give the wrong impression to the uninformed that the Holocaust was an ennobling event—that these tales of survival were somehow the rule rather than the exception.Defiance is one such anomalous tale. Some critics have likened it to a critique of Jewish passivity—that the overwhelming majority of Jews went to their deaths without putting up a fight. And certainly that reputation is reinforced in 'Defiance' as the protagonists, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, stand out as Jewish outsiders who aren't afraid to fight the Nazis as opposed to the majority of the Jewish 'intellectuals', mostly freshly minted refugees from the ghetto, who end up as part of the Bielski 'community' within the Byelorussian forest.But there is an excellent scene in Defiance, where Tuvia sneaks into the ghetto and confronts the head of the Jewish committee there, that demonstrates that the average Jew was not passive—simply bewildered and overwhelmed. Can you really blame the head of the Jewish committee when he doesn't believe Tuvia's tales of genocide? He says, 'yes, we've heard these stories, but who can really believe them?' Reports of atrocities reached the United States during the War but they were not really appreciated until the actual newsreel photos of truckloads of emaciated bodies were seen being bulldozed into ditches at Bergen-Belsen after the war was over.The opening scenes of 'Defiance' are testament to the brutally swift nature of the Nazi genocide. In most cases, there was simply no time to think about resisting (or escaping). The Nazis came in, along with the help of the local authorities in the occupied territories and murdered the Jews in the blink of an eye. We see this very effectively illustrated in 'Defiance' after the Bielskis find their parents murdered on the family farm.One of the picture's strengths is that it also illustrates the role of the local collaborators who assisted the Nazis. In a dazzlingly effective scene, Tuvia takes revenge by shooting the local police chief and his sons after they've murdered his parents. The collaborators aren't seen as monsters—quite the contrary, in a humanized portrait, the police chief begs for his life and insists he was forced to act at the bidding of his superiors in the Nazi occupation force (in an earlier scene, the police chief comes to a farm looking for one of the Bielski brothers who hides in a barn after attacking a group of Nazis--here the police chief is much more crass and arrogant--but still all too human!).Nonetheless, Zwick, the film's director, should have had another scene involving the collaborators to balance out the 'sympathetic' portrait. The truth of the matter was that there were other of these local collaborators who were outright sadists, capable of incomprehensible, monstrous acts of brutality. Similarly, Zwick shows us a group of Jews in the forest who end up savagely beating a captured German soldier to death (despite his cries that he has a wife and children). While such acts of revenge did occur, it's hard to appreciate the context for their actions (it would have been better if Zwick had actually shown the Bielski parents, for example, being murdered and not merely the aftermath).A good deal of 'Defiance' explores the conflict between the two brothers. Tuvia is the pragmatic one who comes to accept his role as a new 'Moses', leading his beleaguered group of 'intellectuals' to safety through the forest. At first he has only contempt for his fellow Jews who he regards as cowardly and passive. But as time passes, they earn his respect as they all become more proactive. Zus, on the other hand, wants to take direct action against the Nazis and joins the Soviet partisans as one of their fighters. I thought that the characterization of the Russians was one of the strongest parts of the movies. They are depicted sympathetically—shown both for their courage and brutality (Zus eventually leaves the partisans after he can no longer tolerate their anti-semitic stance).A good part of 'Defiance' is taken up showing life in the forest camp. The characterizations are a mixed bag. Some of the characters are standard 'types' (the debate between the 'intellectual' vs. the 'spiritual' Jew is one such example). There are some good scenes depicting the malnourishment that the community had to endure along with a few obligatory romances. One scene I had a hard time believing was when Tuvia kills one of the food hunters who insists that his group gets extra portions of rations. Did that really happen? I'm not sure but it made for good drama.I like Daniel Craig in this role a lot more than as James Bond; he gives a solid performance as an unlikely savior for his people. And Lev Schreiber is excellent as the tough as nails partisan who eventually reunites with his brother after a fractured relationship.Defiance's final scene focuses on the community battling and defeating a large group of Nazi soldiers backed up by a tank. I'm told that this is what actually happened but the way the whole thing is staged seemed a little hard to believe. Nonetheless, Defiance is a film that will keep you absorbed from the opening credits. As a little known history lesson, it does its job. And certainly it was a worthy project to commemorate the deeds of the heroic Bielski brothers.",7,4,9,26 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Basil Rathbone rolls over in his grave with new interpretation of Sherlock Holmes as wacky Bohemian
","Here is the newfangled Sherlock Holmes, courtesy action director Guy Ritchie. Ritchie initially wanted to cast a younger actor for the part of Sherlock Holmes but settled on Robert Downey Jr., after envisioning the new Holmes as a Bohemian artist type. This fit right in with Downey's belief that Holmes is supposed to be 'quirky and kind of nuts', an interpretation which was suggested to him by his real life wife, Susan Downey. What appealed to Downey about this interpretation of Holmes is 'quirky and kind of nuts' is the way he views himself! Now I have no problem with Holmes being depicted as eccentric (which is precisely the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle conceived him) but there was also a certain meticulousness and dignity which Downey runs away from in his interpretation. Start with Downey's unshaved look throughout the picture—would the meticulous Holmes allow himself to look so scruffy while everyone else in proper Victorian society is so well manicured? Despite his amazing powers of deductive reasoning and ability to solve cases, Victorian society would never accept a Holmes that refuses to conform to its basic norms. I'm also thinking of the ludicrous opening scene at the Baker Street apartment where Holmes is shooting bullets into the wall in an attempt to develop some kind of early 'silencer'. Can you imagine Basil Rathbone, from the original Sherlock Holmes movies, shooting at the walls and terrorizing his landlady and the other lodgers in the building? And isn't it beneath Holmes to be so petty in his relationship to his perennial sidekick, Watson? The scene at the restaurant where he brings Watson's fiancé to tears and causes her to walk out, just seems so out of character for Holmes. Yes, he's supposed to be cold and insensitive at times, but that happens when he becomes absorbed in attempting to solve his cases. It should not apply to a social gathering where he boorishly undermines the relationship between a close colleague and his fiancé.The childish interplay between Holmes and Watson goes on for a good two thirds of the movie. I fail to see the humor in such scenes as inside the carriage when Holmes teases Watson by keeping the money he won gambling the night before (Watson of course is an inveterate gambler) and Watson then (tit for tat) throws Holmes' vest outside the carriage window. Both Robert Downey and Jude Law both seem to offer up the same over the top interpretations for Holmes and Watson and I found I couldn't distinguish very well between the two characters. I much prefer the buffoonish Nigel Bruce as Watson opposite Basil Rathbone in those old movies since at least the contrast between the two was evident.Ritchie's plot runs into a great deal of trouble for the first two thirds of the movie due to slow pacing. There's an attempt to pick things up with a couple of action scenes which grow tiresome. I had no trouble with the early scene of Downey as action hero in the boxing ring which Ritchie claims is derived from the original Sherlock Holmes stories; but then there's a long drawn out sequence where Holmes and Watson battle an evil giant and then end up destroying a ship while in dry dock. Then there's the scene with Irene Adler interacting with a hidden Professor Moriarty; we end up seeing the scene twice since Holmes ends up explaining what he deduces from his confrontation with the evil Professor to Watson.Nor is the rest of the story very exciting leading to the climax. Reordan, the man Adler has been looking for, turns up dead in Lord Blackwell's coffin, despite Blackwell being hanged earlier for the murder of five women. Then Blackwell murders his father who heads the Temple of the Four Orders.Finally things begin to pick up when Holmes confronts Home Secretary Lord Coward. In one of the best scenes in the movie, Holmes tricks Coward into revealing that Blackwood and company intend to wipe out all members of the House of Lords. Holmes is initially brought to Coward in handcuffs but it's later revealed that Inspector Lestrade has given Holmes the keys to escape. Lestrade, by the way, reminds me of the excellent late actor, Donald Pleasance, and ably acquits himself in the thankless role of second fiddle to Sherlock Holmes.For those sticklers who find all of the evil Blackwell's machinations to be completely implausible (such as how he manages evade detection in staging his own death by hanging), I cannot disagree; however, the film is not supposed to be taken too literally or seriously. Ritchie finally gets things moving at the climax and I liked how Holmes dispatches Blackwell on the under construction Tower Bridge. I'm not so sure however, how Irene Adler survives that fall after Blackwell pushes her off the bridge.For purists such as myself, the scenes where Holmes uses his deductive reasoning (such as his ability to follow a carriage's path while blindfolded) are quite welcome. Nonetheless, with Robert Downey choosing to play Holmes for a good part of the time as a lout who resembles a drunkard and a completely nondescript Watson who serves up no significant contrasts to his wily colleague, the new Sherlock Holmes lacks the main ingredient that has been found to be offered up by some of its predecessors: charm!",4,3,6,12 June 2010
WALL·E," A feast for the eyes
","Wall-e has a great concept: Due to the toxic effects of unchecked consumerism, earth becomes a dead planet and humans find themselves in a giant pleasure ship run by robots. This is perhaps the first film I've seen in a long time that takes the politically incorrect position that obesity is not a good thing. In the future, people have all become obese. They sit in pleasure chairs and mindlessly move around the ship on a conveyor belt of sorts, eating junk food and slurping drinks you would find at any fast food outlet today. Giant electronic billboards broadcast news about the latest products and the people of tomorrow all are in a great stupor.Meanwhile back on earth, Wall-e is the last functional robot, a waste compactor assigned to clean up the trash left behind. Earth is a dead planet and the people of earth have fled since nothing can grow there anymore. The mother ship sends out probes searching for signs of life. One such probe is 'Eve' who Wall-e befriends and then falls in love with. Wall-e ends up finding a small plant which he gives to Eve as a gift. This is the 'evidence' that the humans have been looking for. Now earth is capable of supporting life again and the humans may return. Eve returns to the mother ship with the plant but Wall-e, love stricken, must follow her too. Eventually, the ship's computer confirms that earth can now support life again but not before the robot in charge of guiding the ship revolts at returning and struggles with the human captain for control. The Human Captain finally realizes how great it is to be on earth, gains control of the ship from the rebel robots and brings the mother ship back to earth. Wall-e, damaged from the fight with the rebel robots, is restored to his former self by Eve, who finds some replacement parts, and they live happily ever after. One cannot describe the inventiveness of the animation here. It is truly phenomenal. The effects are dazzling. But one feels that after awhile, some of the scenes are a bit repetitious. For example, there is this small robot who is assigned to cleaning up all the 'foreign contaminants' it finds within the mother ship. The cleanup scenes by this robot are overdone. Similarly, Eve's penchant for blasting anything that gets in her way becomes a little tiresome. Instead of one of two blasting sessions, we get about ten. Act I goes on a little too long. We should have Wall-e get on his adventure sooner (i.e., when he attaches himself to the ship and finds himself in outer space). Another weakness of the script is that the antagonist is not identified clearly enough into much later in the film. Halfway through, the robot controlling the ship suddenly becomes malevolent. That should have been established earlier. In addition, it was a little too easy for the Human Captain to suddenly 'see the light' and regain his humanity. Wall-e is in the end, an enjoyable but somewhat sentimental love story between two robots. Its human characters are drawn more as comic relief. Had the screenwriters drawn the humans as a bit more multi-dimensional, this could have been a more compelling film. As a romance, Wall-e is cute and sweet. But the overall story will be favored more by comic book aficionados. Walle's dazzling special effects create on a visual level, a feast for the eyes which must be seen.",7,2,11,28 June 2008
Finding Dory," Despite an overly talky Act I, Pixar's animated fish tale will charm you incessantly in Acts II and III
","Thirteen years ago Pixar released the mega-successful Finding Nemo starring two clownfish, Marlin and Nemo, with their buddy, a regal blue tang fish named Dory. Albert Brooks is back as Marlin and Ellen Degeneres again plays Dory, saddled throughout with short-term memory loss. Finding Dory amounts to a spin off of Finding Nemo, with Dory now playing the lead and Marlin and Nemo doing the honors as gracious sidekicks.Perhaps the most problematic aspect of the Finding Dory narrative is the Act One machinations. The inciting incident involves Dory's separation from her parents who are part of an open ocean exhibit at a rehabilitative Marine Institute in California; after she's caught in an undertow Dory finds herself on the other side of the Pacific and is reunited with Marlin and Nemo.Dory, with her short term memory loss, represents an opportunity not only to exploit comic possibilities but also to make an important point that parents who have children with developmental disabilities should never give up on them and continue to encourage whatever latent abilities to improve themselves, they might possess.Dory's parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy) are the prototypical nurturers who make periodic appearances in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. Despite all the approbation, Dory still suffers from lack of self-esteem, and it's only through her journey of self-discovery that she overcomes her self-deprecating self-absorption.The scenarists perhaps at this juncture have made the mistake of explicating Dory's predicament ad infinitum, resulting in a lugubrious Act One, featuring much too much talk and little action. There's a nice little scene of a stingray migration, Dory, Marlin and Nemo hitching a ride on the back of a sea turtle taking them to California and perhaps the only scary moment for young children— an encounter with a menacing squid who puts a nice little scare into our determined protagonists.Surprisingly, it's the voice of Sigourney Weaver playing herself that signals the break into an exciting and much more gripping Act Two—here Weaver is the voice of the Marine Institute, where our fish heroes interact with a coterie of human characters devoted to creating obstacles which prevent Dory from both finding her parents and ultimately saving her best buddies, Marlin and Nemo.When Dory is inadvertently twisted up in a six-pack ring, she's scooped up by staff members from the Marine Institute and tagged and sent to the quarantine section. There she's aided by the seven-legged octopus, Hank, who oddly derides ocean life and would prefer to live out the rest of his days in quarantine (in Cleveland of all places)—all Hank wants is Dory's tag and he agrees first to help her find her parents.Dory ultimately learns that her fellow regal blue tangs are all in quarantine and probably hold the secret as to the fate of her parents. Along the way at one of the exhibits, Dory meets her childhood friend Destiny, a benign, near-sighted whale shark, and her companion, Bailey, a beluga whale who's been attempting to recover his powers of Echolocation after a purported head injury. Note that the two whales are as goofy as Dory and are another example of the intentionally designed non- threatening marine life, guaranteed not to scare away younger viewers.Both Dory as well as Marlin and Nemo take circuitous routes to arrive back in quarantine. Hank, operating a runaway stroller with his tentacles through the Institute, is guided by Dory, who gives directions while ensconced in a fishbowl. They end up in the enormously clever children's 'Touch Pool,' where they both are almost scooped up by 'possessed' children, desperate for contact with the sedentary marine life in the pool beneath. Only Hank's sudden release of black ink flooding the pool, saves our protagonists from not accomplishing their ultimate objectives.Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo have their set of allies who aid them in their quest to find Dory. The hilarious sea lions Fluke and Rudder end up summoning the disfigured loon, Becky, and are aided by the nerdy Gerald, who provides the pail for Becky to transport Marlin and Nemo into the innermost cave of the Institute. Once inside, Marlin and Nemo propel themselves out of a tank by hopping over columns of jet sprays. Once Dory, Marlin and Nemo are reunited, Dory faces the 'dark moment' at the end of ACT 2—where she incorrectly comes to believe that her parents have died—after her encounter with her fellow regal blue tangs. Fortunately, the dire belief is short- lived, once Dory finds the shells her parents have left for her—now she has a joyous reunion with her parents who reveal they've waited for her this whole time. Note here Dory loses her self-pity and becomes self- actualized—now she must save Marlin and Nemo who are still stuck in the truck headed for Cleveland that has just left the Institute.Despite their absurdity (and perhaps that's what makes it so enjoyable), the Act 3 machinations are very satisfying. How does Dory get the truck to stop so he and Hank can take command of it? Just have a bunch of very cute otters crawl up the side of the bridge, crawl out onto the highway, and stop traffic. How does the truck, pointed in the wrong direction, get back to the Institute? Just have Hank grab control of the steering wheel with Dory again providing directions, ensconced inside a fish bowl this time on the truck's dashboard! And finally dig the slow motion scene where the truck crashes through the railings, the back door flings open and all the fish fall back into the ocean.Despite its slow start, Finding Dory morphs into an adorable animated action film for both adults and children. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks manage to finely provide the obligatory comic relief as well as important encouragement for parents and children who are dealing with the spectre of childhood developmental disabilities.",8,0,7,4 January 2017
Arrival," Linguist saves nations of the world from each other, but no 'Kumbaya moment' for her
","You never know what you're going to get with director Denis Villeneuve. I was not impressed with his political bias in 'Incendies' but was pleasantly surprised with 'Prisoners' which proved to be pretty entertaining. Now he's tackling sci-fi for the high-brow crowd with Arrival starring Amy Adams.Arrival is similar to science fiction films from the 50s featuring an alien invasion and the obligatory American response. Villeneuve posits an armada of 12 obelisk-looking spaceships randomly touching down in different countries around the world. The one winding up in the US appears in an isolated area of Montana.A rather grim Forest Whitaker plays US Army Colonel Weber who calls in linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to try and make contact with the aliens and find out what they want. The bulk of Act 2 involves Louise, along with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), attempting to decipher the aliens' strange language, circular images that appear before them like puffs of smoke. The aliens by the way are called 'Heptapods' and can best be likened to giant jellyfish.Be forewarned that those sci-fi aficionados who are used to a lot of action and derring-do on the part of a superhero or two, will be sorely disappointed here. Indeed, Louise's efforts at translating the mystery language is a long slog and only those who are appreciative of all the linguistic references will perhaps leave the theater satisfied. Meanwhile the political aspect of the plot follows a familiar sci-fi trope—there is usually a progressive group (represented as Americans wouldn't you know it!) and a more reactionary one (featuring the militant Chinese General Shang who is inclined to attack the alien ship and ask questions later). When the Chinese linguists translate an alien word as 'weapon,' their conclusion is that the aliens are belligerent and have not come in peace (Louise's belief, on the other hand, is that the word is more benign—translating as 'tool'). The apparent mistranslation provokes an international crisis, with the Chinese now on the verge of attacking the alien ship and others countries following suit. Villeneuve is not content to leave us with the impression that the Chinese and other bellicose nations are not the only ones guilty of a committed jingoism. There is also a rogue group of American soldiers who desire to do in the aliens and at one point smuggle a bomb on board the alien vessel--only to have the explosion deflected (with Louise and Ian saved) by Abbott, one of two aliens aptly named after the iconic comedy team, Abbott and Costello.Leave it to Louise to save the day when she finally figures out that the aliens speak in a 'non-linear' language and are able to perceive time as an organic entity. What this means is that we're all in store for a 'Twilight Zone-like' ending where Louise runs into General Shang at a cocktail party in the future and he instructs her to go back to the present, call him on this secret cell phone number and tell him his wife's dying words that no one else could have known. This convinces the present-day General Shang to believe that Louise is the 'real deal,' has correctly understood that the aliens mean us no harm, and he orders his army then to stand down, preventing a guaranteed Armageddon.It's all a wonderful 'Kumbaya' moment for the nations of the world, but unfortunately not for Louise. She now realizes that all those earlier visions of her teenage daughter dying of cancer occurred in the future, and bravely decides to have the child with Ian anyway, even with the knowledge that things won't end up as gloriously as they did for mankind in general.As for the acting, Whitaker and Renner have little to do in underdeveloped parts. Adams as the determined linguist certainly is acceptable but is saddled by the heavy-handed script, notable for its total lack of humor.Villeneuve attempts to temper his happy ending of world peace with a bittersweet denouement for his heroine. But still the aforementioned 'kumbaya moment' for the nations of the world is a disappointment (couldn't he have thought of something a little more clever?) Still, if your thing is linguistic puzzles mixed in with a touch of Twilight Zone, Arrival might just be for you. Others might not be so forgiving as this is for the most part, one decidedly lugubrious tale of sci-fi fancy.",5,3,9,10 December 2016
The Blind Side," Average Hollywood treatment of true life tale of Christian charity
","The Blind Side is one of those movies that manages to evoke a huge difference in opinion as to whether the film works or not. I'm somewhere in the middle. Certainly the saga of the White Republican Tuohy family who takes in Michael Oher, a black kid from the 'other side of the tracks' and then helps him to become what he has become today, a very successful NFL star football player, is an inspirational tale of true Christian charity. On the other hand, the story is riddled with so many clichés that ultimately the film devolves into a predictable Hollywood tale of an underprivileged youth making it in the sports world.Some posters argue that the white characters in the film, particularly the Tuohy family themselves, come off as saintly and the black characters are all presented as negative stereotypes. I don't see that at all. For starters, the first black character we meet, 'Big Tony' Hamilton, is a self-sufficient and kindly man who ends up being responsible for getting Big Mike into the Wingate Christian school where he eventually thrives. Leigh Anne Tuohy is hardly a saint as she is depicted as sensitive but also a thoroughly pushy and sometimes obnoxious woman who is capable at times, of putting her foot in her mouth. While Michael Oher is a slow learner, the film makes it quite clear that he has street smarts and inherently is a lot smarter than what the teachers at the Wingate school pegged him to be. Unfortunately, the film's scenarists know a lot more about Leigh Anne Tuohy's personality than Michael Oher's. This is perhaps the major shortcoming of the film as the warm, winning ways of Oher are not shown here; rather, he's depicted as thoroughly introverted and socially inept and rookie actor Quinton Aaron is unable to make much of a part that is quite thin to begin with.The first third of the movie is perhaps the most moving as it shows Leigh Anne's Tuohy's growing realization that she has led an isolated life. In a most poignant scene, Tuohy is startled when Michael reveals that he's never slept in a bed before. Leigh Anne's willingness to take Michael in is tested in the scene involving the car accident. After Sean Tuohy Sr. buys Michael a new car, he gets into a car accident while the the young SJ is in the passenger seat. Somehow all is forgiven when it's revealed that Michael prevents the full force of the air bag from hitting SJ. Never discussed are the events preceding the crash—Michael and SJ are engaged in singing a rap song without Michael paying attention to the traffic ahead of them. I also wondered if Leigh Anne would have forgiven Michael so easily had SJ actually been seriously injured in the accident or even killed. Christian charity I suppose has its limits! Once Oher is acclimated to his new family, 'The Blind Side' picks up the Hollywood mantle and offers up another tired and long-winded high school football scene, replete with the young SJ obnoxiously 'coaching' Oher before the big game along with Leigh Anne later fending off the token white racist in the stands. Oher not only gains confidence as a defensive tackle but the big teddy bear flips an opposing player over a fence after the bully has been mocking him before every play (how cute!).Again, the second half of 'The Bind Side' ends up with mixed results. There's more 'cute' stuff when Leigh Anne hires a tutor (Kathy Bates) who tutors Michael to get his grade point average high enough to qualify for college. Liberal Hollywood needs to let us know that the tutor is a Democrat so that both conservative Republicans (the Tuohy family) and a Democrat both have a hand in helping Michael reach his goal. There's a stab at comedy when all the college recruiters start courting Michael and again the obnoxious child actor who plays SJ attempts to get the 'best deal' for himself in the event that Michael is recruited (stuff like walking out on the field at the beginning of the college football season).When an NCAA Investigator questions the Tuohy family's motives in 'adopting' Michael after he accepts an invitation to attend Ole Miss, Michael impulsively returns to his old ghetto haunts. There he's taunted by Alton, the head gang member, brilliantly played by IronE Singleton (this actor has the potential to be a major star!) Michael gets into a fight with Alton and gets the better of him and then disappears. Leigh Anne looks high and low for Michael and confronts Alton. Some posters say the scene is implausible since the gang member would have retaliated when Leigh Anne challenged him. I'm not so sure—when she claims that she's friends with the DA, that in itself might have given Alton pause to take revenge. After all, he's a drug dealer who doesn't want any outsiders calling attention to his business. Finally Leigh Anne finds Michael after he calls her. There's a reconciliation and Michael of course goes on to graduate from high school and is drafted by the NFL.Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of conveying the brash personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. Tim McGraw as Sean Sr. and Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy have little to do during the film. As previously mentioned, the youngster SJ (played by Jae Head) is simply obnoxious and Quinton Aaron does not know how to make Michael Oher into an engaging character. As 'The Blind Side' is based on a true story, it certainly is worth watching. Just don't expect much complexity when it comes to the majority of its characters.",5,2,5,29 May 2010
Parasite," Noted Korean director's enjoyable grifter family farce devolves into unfunny bloodbath
","Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His 'heroes' at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.
The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.
The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.
Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself 'Jessica' in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces 'Uncle Kim' to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the 'uncle' is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.
The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When 'Uncle Kim' convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.
Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).
When Moon-kwang discovers the new 'hired help' are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.
As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is 'permitting the outrage without the consequences.' The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.
A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.
Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.
But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.
Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.
Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet.",6,18,37,17 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 'Art' vs. Commercial Success is the one-joke idea this overrated claptrap attempts to mine, ad infinitum
","'Birdman' is the latest overpraised and over-hyped 'art' film by the acclaimed director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Michael Keaton, who was known for playing Batman in the late 80s and early 90s, is cast here as Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor, once famous for playing a superhero Birdman character in the movies, now making a comeback on Broadway, acting in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story.The entire film is shot as if it's one long take in a cinema verité style. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the behind-the-scenes peek at the technical aspects of a Broadway theater production. Initially, the narrative takes the form of a black comedy in which we're asked to laugh at the denizens of the theatrical world, all of whom are depicted as deeply flawed.Riggan's big fault is that he's deeply ashamed of 'selling out' years earlier when he took on his superhero role. But now, by attempting to mount a 'serious' Broadway play, he has a chance to redeem himself. But his Birdman persona keeps appearing in the form of a disembodied voice (and later hallucinations), telling him that he will fail. The idea that there are those performers who believe that 'art' is anathema to commercial success, is mocked incessantly throughout the film, but we get the joke early on, and eventually it becomes tiresome.When the lead actor in the play is mysteriously knocked out by a falling stage light, Riggan is desperate to find a replacement, since previews are about to begin. At first the well known 'method' actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), appears to be a godsend that will save the show; but soon it becomes apparent that Mike is exceptionally unstable. We're supposed to laugh at a character who gets drunk during his first rehearsal and later attempts to rape one of the female actors while they're on stage, lying on a bed, under the covers, before an audience who misinterprets the scene as comic.Later, in a bar, Mike puts Riggan down further by pointing out that the napkin that was given to Riggan and signed by Raymond Carver, was given to him in a bar while he, Carver, was drunk. Mike tells Riggan that he's too untalented for Broadway and introduces him to Tabitha, the vicious Times critic, who later tells Riggan that she'll never give him a good review because anyone who sells out to Hollywood can never do anything good in the 'legitimate' theater. The negative Times critic is just another example of the exaggerated caricatures sprinkled throughout the film, which simply aren't funny (a more realistic portrait of theater people should highlight both their positive and negative attributes!).Also in the mix is Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), who has just been released from rehab for drug abuse. Riggan receives a double dose of humiliation: first when he is locked out of the theater in his underwear and is forced to perform before the audience almost au naturel and later when he discovers the slimy Mike, has had sex with his daughter.By the time we experience the 'twist' of a 'happy ending' at the denouement, there's nothing left for the audience to laugh at, since Mr. Iñárritu has smugly shot down all of his straw men caricatures. Riggan 'triumphs' first when he blows off his nose with a gun loaded with live ammunition and Tabitha then gives him a favorable review, dubbing the performance an exercise in 'ultra-realism.' His new prosthetic nose appears to resemble Birdman's, and Iñárritu has Riggan fly away, now self-actualized, having had a Broadway hit.The whole idea that commercial success and 'art' is mutually exclusive is not borne out by reality. Even Riggan acknowledges that actors like Robert Downey Jr. can be successful in both worlds. So basically 'Birdman' becomes a silly, 'one-joke' idea, not based on reality nor worth hammering down our throats, ad infinitum.",3,556,1115,23 October 2014
The Big Short," Highly educational distillation of 2007-2008 financial crisis despite non-heroic nature of film's protagonists
","Adam McKay, former head writer for Saturday Night Live, co-wrote and directed this black comedy based on the 2010 book of the same name by Michael Lewis, all about how a few quirky finance guys foresaw the looming financial crisis of 2007-2008, and ended up profiting from it.The main character played by Christian Bale is Michael Burry, a former physician turned hedge fund manager who discovers that the US housing market is unstable due to risky sub-prime loans. He becomes convinced that the financial crisis is unavoidable and creates a 'credit default swap market,' convincing various banks to accept his 'bets' that the housing market will collapse. The banks, convinced that the market is stable, gladly accept his investments on behalf of the investors in his hedge fund.We find out a little about Burry's background—that he lost an eye as a child. suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, and was always a maverick who didn't fit the typical profile of a hedge fund manager. McKay establishes a conflict between Burry and his jittery investors, who stand to lose millions, if his prediction does not come to fruition. How Burry copes with the pressure is where the comedy comes in— although it's certainly not laugh out loud funny. And it's also quite interesting how Burry ultimately prevents all his investors from panicking and cashing in all their chips—he does this by creating a moratorium on all withdrawals, right before the big economic collapse!When trader Jared Vennett of Deustche Bank (Ryan Gosling) hears about Burry's credit default swap market, he decides to get in on the action too. Vennett's wrong number phone call alerts our other protagonist, Mark Baum, another quirky, curmudgeonly hedge fund manager adroitly played by Steve Carrell. Baum and Vennett join forces and Baum begins to investigate the depth of the problem with the US Housing market. Baum is a sensitive guy who was deeply affected by his brother who committed suicide. He discovers that collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are loan packages bundled together and given AAA ratings by unscrupulous rating agencies. McKay wisely takes us out of the finance board rooms and has his principals attend a big housing forum in Las Vegas where Baum in particular meets a fat cat businessman who has profited greatly by creating synthetic CDOs. Baum ultimately convinces his business associates to adopt Burry's stratagem.Also in the mix are small-time, young investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) who learn of the swap market and then must conscript a retired banker, Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), to get them in the game. Rickert, now a new age type (and one who has a conscience like Baum), castigates Geller and Shipley for celebrating over impending profits, at the expense of the millions of people who will lose their jobs and income due to the financial collapse. Geller and Shipley try to atone for their selfish attitude by attempting to alert the press about the impending collapse, but to no avail.McKay may see the protagonists here as heroes merely for their foresight into what is to come, and for bearing witness to the fraud they uncovered. Nonetheless, despite their guilty conscience, they ended up profiting from other peoples' misery. Despite their foresight, they're really nothing more than vultures feeding on the carcasses of the millions wiped out in the financial downturn. But it's really the entire financial industry as well as the US government whom McKay is indicting here—a corrupt system that allowed swindlers to convince low-income people to live beyond their means and obtain mortgages that they couldn't possibly pay off.In the end it's the film's educational value that makes it worthwhile. The 2007-2008 financial collapse is a topic that is difficult to understand. McKay has his characters explain the financial jargon and even brings in celebrities such as Selena Gomez to explain arcane terms that pop up in the narrative. While some of the characters' machinations become somewhat repetitious, I still was able to learn quite a bit about a topic that isn't ordinarily so easy to grasp.",7,6,9,14 January 2016
Prometheus," Inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!
","No matter how much he and his fellow scenarists deny it, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is very much a souped-up update of Scott's 'classic' 1979 sci-fi horror show, 'Alien'. The film begins with a cryptic scene set during pre-historic times when a space traveler (who looks like a muscle-bound 'Mr. Clean' with pasty skin) drinks a dark liquid concoction that causes him to disintegrate. We find out later, that quite incredibly, the traveler's disintegration causes a biogenetic chain reaction, which is responsible for the origin of life on earth,Cut to 2089. Archaeologist couple, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, make a new discovery of an ancient cave drawing that's similar to other cave drawings already discovered, pointing to a distant moon where Mr. Clean might have come from (these humanoids are dubbed 'Engineers'). Cut to the Prometheus, a giant spaceship financed by multi-billionaire Peter Weyland, CEO of the Weyland Corporation. Weyland is played by Guy Pearce, made up to look like a senior on his last legs (despite a ton of prosthetics, the make-up department ends up managing to turn Weyland into a clone of Biff Tanner from 'Back to the Future, Part 2').Weyland gives the Prometheus crew a pep talk after they wake up from suspended animation, except he's a hologram. We're told by Vickers (Charlize Theron) that Weyland had a few weeks to live before the Prometheus took off but it turns out that he's been in stasis in private quarters, off limits to the rest of the crew. Weyland can't accept the idea that he's soon going to kick the bucket and hopes that the Engineers will restore his youth. Boy is he in for a big surprise!Before the ship arrives at its destination, David the Android house sits while crew members sleep in their pea pods. David, designed by Weyland, has a mind of his own and a nice British accent to boot. He keeps himself busy before the crew wakes up by studying thousands of obscure languages and watching old movies. For some reason, David doesn't seem to be programmed to obey orders and ends up digging around for clues by himself once the crew lands on the moon.Despite all the neat special effects, 'Prometheus' is saddled with one clichéd character after another. Holloway, the archaeologist leader, is the skeptical scientist who's contrasted with his lover Shaw, the 'believer', who is still bent on finding out the 'meaning of life' at film's end. Holloway is virtual cannon fodder after David infects him with the dark liquid seen earlier. Holloway proves to be thoroughly expendable when he becomes a virtual Zombie and Vickers must torch him to death with a flamethrower, to prevent him from getting back on the ship. Theron's Vickers, who turns out to be Weyland's daughter, has no interest in alien first contact and is a most unlikeable, one dimensional villain. Like Holloway, she's easily disposed of when she's crushed by the Engineer's disabled ship, during the denouement.The bulk of the action takes inside a giant cave which turns out to be the Engineer's spaceship. Crew members Milburn and Fifield, decide to run back to the Prometheus after they're spooked by all the bad vibes inside the cave. As there is no discipline amongst the crew members, they're allowed to abandon their colleagues and promptly end up getting lost. Of course they're the first ones to be dispatched by the alien monsters, squid like creatures completely reminiscent of Scott's '79 'frightfest'.Scott must have reasoned that audiences today still want a taste of that old 'Alien' magic, so Milburn and Fifields' demise must go the usual route of having the creature's tentacles reach inside the victims' bodies (through the mouth) and then having them subsequently disemboweled from the 'inside out'. But wait! Scott must up the 'ante' and then does so by having Shaw impregnated by an infected Holloway. Since she's now got an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day! Not to worry! Set your self-service 2093 surgery machine on automatic pilot and let the device remove the nasty creature for you. Just make sure you give yourself enough shots of morphine, or whatever pain-killer does the trick! It turns out that David has discovered that one of the Engineers is still alive, inside one of those pea pods inside the cave. When they wake him up, the crew members who went back into cave (including Weyland), have to deal with the humanoid's 'anger management' problem, which they didn't count on. Everyone is killed and David gets his head ripped off (don't worry, he's somehow still able to think, talk and communicate!).It's not enough for the director to channel 'Alien' but why not a dose of 'Alien vs. Predator' while you're at it? That's essentially happens when the surviving bad-guy Engineer takes on the giant squid-like Alien, in a fight to the death struggle. Guess who wins?Leave it to Shaw (the aforementioned true believer), to want to go off to distant places, in an attempt to extract an explanation from the Engineers, who seemingly gave humans life but then changed their minds. As Shaw jets off with the help of David, one wonders why Shaw seems to ignore all the unpleasantness associated with her first encounter with the surviving Engineer. Is there any reason why she wouldn't get her head ripped off, during a second encounter with these baddies? If you're going to see 'Prometheus', it's for the special effects and not the characters. There's actually some neat visuals in this film, including a wondrous sandstorm and a star map highlighting Earth. But in the end, most of this stuff we've seen before. One thing I did learn from 'Prometheus' is that inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!",4,10,17,16 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Mythology and World War I setting are pluses, but Wonder Woman's exploits add up to puerile wish fulfillment
","When Wonder Woman came out, it was touted as a 'higher class' action hero film. Indeed, right away we're introduced to a narrative infused with mythology, where Amazon warriors created by Zeus are entrusted to protect all mankind. Diana (never referred to 'Wonder Woman' during the film), is the daughter of Hippolyta, and she and her fellow Amazonians live on a secluded island, training to eventually confront the God of War, Ares, who is held responsible for all the wars propagated by an evil mankind, fallen from grace after their initial emergence in paradise.What Wonder Woman also has going for it is the World War I setting-Diana's leading man is American pilot Captain Steve Trevor who ends up on the Amazons' island, after his plane is shot down by the Germans. The setting of 'the war to end all wars' is appropriate as many of the battles ended up in stalemates, highlighted by pointless trench warfare, leading to massive casualties. Later it's Ares who tells Diana that he was only a passive onlooker to all the carnage. It's men themselves who are responsible for all the perfidy. And what better illustration is the conflict, initially entitled 'The Great War,' which perhaps represents mankind's greatest folly.While Ares remains Diana's primary antagonist in the narrative, the Germans, represented by real-life World War I general, Erich Luddendorf and a nasty chemist, Isabel Maru, are the primary villains on the earthly plane. It's Maru who's developed some new kind of poison gas that threatens to turn the war in favor of the Germans and Diana, Trevor and a motley crew assembled by Trevor, must stop them.Act 2 of Wonder Woman is unfortunately rather puerile as the idea of a woman with supernatural powers proves to be wish fulfillment for deluded feminists and their male enablers. Maybe kids might be impressed by all the histrionics, but when Diana manages to wipe out an entire German regiment and successfully liberates a besieged French town singlehandedly, one can only laugh at the stupidity of such a concept.At a certain point, Luddendorf is able to release Maru's gas, killing many in another French town, and Diana takes revenge, killing the brutal general (in real-life, Luddendorf did not die in World War I, and lived until 1937!). Meanwhile Trevor and his team blow up Maru's laboratory. Soon Trevor successfully highjacks the bomber loaded with poison gas which Luddendorf had ordered dropped on London. The plot has two twists: Trevor must sacrifice himself to get rid of the gas and Ares is revealed to be Sir Patrick Morgan, the British politician who was trying to arrange an armistice between the warring parties. I suppose the writers get some credit for these twists but Diana's final confrontation with Ares proves to be anti-climactic, as we've already suffered through enough unrelenting gore.Gal Gadot as Diana is eye candy for presumably a majority male audience and must be applauded for the very good shape she's in. Nonetheless Gadot does not have the requisite warmth to end up as an iconic, endearing character. More successful is the handsome Chris Pine, best known for his work as James T. Kirk on the Star Trek reboot. Special mention must be given to David Thewlis as Ares. He reminds me of the late Alan Rickman, who was a natural playing complicated antagonists. Watch Wonder Woman for the production design and a few good performances. But in the end, it's really just another comic book action flick detached from the historical verisimilitude it attempts to impart.",4,6,12,8 May 2018
Marriage Story," Baumbach's chronicle of escalating stakes in divorce war hits the mark!
","With Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach has cemented his reputation as one of the more sophisticated screenwriters in Hollywood today. His film however should be more appropriately titled, 'Divorce Story,' as his narrative is basically a distillation of the unraveling of a marriage. The couple in question is Nicole and Charlie, played with subtlety by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Their battle is over where their 8 year-old son Henry should be growing up-east or west coast, as it turns out.
The film begins on a deliciously ironic note. We're treated to sets of voice overs from each of the principals, extolling the virtues of each others' personalities. On the surface it appears the marriage has not unraveled at all-yet.
But as the camera pulls back, Nicole and Charlie are in a marriage counselor's office, reading off their assignments from the counselor-to praise each other, in an attempt to find common ground. But it's also immediately made clear that each party feels the marriage is irretrievably lost, despite the positive pronouncements in these essays they've been reading, in the opening sequence.
We soon learn that Nicole, a talented actress, has supported Charlie, an up and coming director who runs his own theater company.in New York City. When Nicole has the opportunity to work on a pilot for a new TV show in Los Angeles, Charlie is under the impression that she and Henry will be returning to New York, after the TV opportunity wraps up-soon he discovers his assumption was incorrect (to put it mildly).
Baumbach's focus is not primarily on the warring couple and their disagreement-that no doubt would not work for an entire movie. He draws the battle lines clearly, however: Nicole wants Charlie to recognize her quest for independence-and she ultimately intends to remain in LA with their child, where she has the opportunity to flower. Charlie can't countenance her demand, as his burgeoning career is wrapped up in everything New York City.
It's how Baumbach chronicles the growing animus between them and the escalating conflict which proves so successful--coupled with how the deteriorating conflict proceeds in gripping increments, At first, the couple has agreed that they'll work the divorce out amicably-without attorneys present.
All bets are off however when Nicole is introduced to Nora (a deliriously fine Laura Dern), as the ball-busting divorce attorney, who's an expert at representing female clients. Charlie, still hesitant about enlisting an attorney, briefly flirts with hiring Jay (a thoroughly believable Ray Liotta), the attack-dog attorney who charges over $900 per hour. Soon after learning from Nora he's in jeopardy of losing custody of Henry and most of his earnings, Charlie finally conscripts Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), who urges him to cut his losses and allow Nicole to keep Henry in LA.
The stakes are exacerbated when Charlie drops Spitz and takes on Jay, who, in one of the best scenes in the film, duels with Nora in court, over Henry's fate. The judge ends up appointing an evaluator who will observe both parties in their interactions with Henry.
The family court evaluation ends up in disaster for Charlie, who ends up cutting himself (and bleeding profusely) with his small pocketknife which he carries around habitually on a key chain (it doesn't help that the female evaluator is completely unemotional). This probably leads to Charlie throwing in the towel at film's end and agreeing to Nicole's demand to keep their child on the west coast.
We can only conclude that Baumbach has done a bravura job in researching the vagaries of the divorce system-his superb characterizations of the attorneys involved are what ultimately give the film its compelling impetus.
Marriage Story is also a character study-not only the chronicle of Nicole's quest for independence but Charlie finally realizing that his demand to have Nicole and Henry return to NYC was tied to narcissistic careerism (Charlie eventually ends up in LA anyway, working as a university lecturer).
Baumbach also insightfully presents Nicole and Charlie's conflict as not entirely hateful. Even in Charlie's worst moment, when he has a meltdown in which he expresses his unbridled hatred for Nicole-there are still tender moments between them (as Charlie falls to his knees sobbing, Nicole cradles his head in her arms).
Baumbach's direction is so good due to his all-star cast. Some of the scenes could have moved a little quicker and one wonders why he inserted such a self-indulgent scene where he has Driver sing that entire Sondheim song from Company at the nightclub.. But these are minor peccadillos, as Marriage Story turns out to be one of the top films of 2019, certainly worthy of a best picture Oscar nomination, at the very least.",8,7,19,21 November 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Cogent chronicle of rise and fall of early Gangsta Rap group despite overtones of hagiography
","Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise and fall of the seminal hip-hop group, N.W.A., who broke on the scene in the mid-80s. N.W.A. was one of the first hip-hop groups to employ 'gangsta rap,' a heavily street-infused parlance marked by blunt verbal jabs, often incorporating phrases considered 'obscene' in more 'polite,' white society.The purveyors of hip-hop (i.e. of the gangster variety) have been criticized for encouraging violence, as often the lyrics involve one threat or another to an intended rival (whether that be a specific individual or a more generic group). Defenders of the genre maintain that 'gangsta rap' merely reflects the realities of the street and should be considered 'artistic expression' protected by the First Amendment. The reality is that this type of music is nothing more than braggadocio and is very much akin to a violent video game—it is of course up to the 'player' or 'listener' to recognize that the fictional content of a gangsta rap song or violent video game is exactly that— fiction—and is not necessarily intended to encourage violence in real life.The story of N.W.A., particularly in its first half, pulls you in just like any good police procedural. There are the three principals, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, who come from completely different walks of life, and you want to know just how this diverse crew end up becoming successful in the music business. The first scene is startling as Easy escapes a police raid on a crack house. Dre is determined to follow his dreams despite the fact that his mother feels that he's not being practical by pursuing a career in music. And Ice Cube, a high school student with a notebook of clever lyrics, almost becomes the victim of gang-banger violence, when a thug boards his school bus, pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot some of the students on board.When a more 'professional' group of rappers decline to become involved in the new start-up, Dre convinces Eazy to perform a potential hit song himself. The song, Boyz-n-the-Hood, becomes a big hit, which attracts the attention of Jerry Heller (played adroitly by the ubiquitous Paul Giamatti), who gets the group a contract with Priority Records.Police harassment is a constant theme in Straight Outta Compton, and when group members are harassed by members of the LAPD outside their recording studio, this inspires Cube to write and record another big hit, 'F—k the Police.' While members of the band and Heller despise the negative and overly aggressive stance the police take toward the black community, there is never a suggestion that there are any good apples at all in the police department. What's more, given the fact that police officers face ultimate annihilation by real criminals in places like Compton every day, it's understandable that many of them are on edge. The lack of professionalism and over aggressiveness can be justly criticized by rappers like Ice Cube, but there are always two sides to a story—and the juvenile exhortation to 'F—k the Police,' is certainly not always a helpful one.Indeed, the reality of a bigger problem than police violence in the black community (i.e. black on black violence) becomes apparent in the tragic scene involving Dre's younger brother, murdered by other youths from his community back home. Indeed, for all the Rodney King-like incidents (overly highlighted in the film), they pale in comparison statistically to the murders that occur every day between members of the same race in the so-called 'ghettos' of US cities.As we reach the mid-point, there's more fascinating stuff especially with Cube's decision to quit the band after claiming Heller is intentionally withholding his contract. Ice Cube subsequently becomes successful as a solo act and a 'rap war' ensues between Cube and Eazy, with Eazy claiming Ice Cube is a 'Benedict Arnold,' and Cube responding with his infamous 'No Vaseline' track.Heller turns out to be the film's main antagonist, with Dre and Eazy also eventually turning against him. The accusations against Heller are perhaps the least convincing aspect of the film; there is a rather lame scene where Eazy's girlfriend is going over the 'books,' and claims, without any in-depth explanation that Heller gypped all of the NWA artists. In the face of a recent lawsuit instituted by Heller against the film's producers, we'll see who's telling the truth when the lawsuit is over.The second antagonist here is Suge Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, along with Dr. Dre. Knight is ably highlighted as a thug, when he beats up Eazy who refuses to release Dre from his contract. There's also another good scene where Knight mercilessly beats up a man over an innocent dispute over a parking spot. I suspect however, there is much more to the Suge Knight story that the producers don't let on here.Straight Outta Compton generally follows the basic history of NWA's rise and fall. But some things are left out to give the impression that the principals were not really such bad guys when they were indeed guilty of some rather noxious bad behavior. Dre's drunk driving is downplayed, a subsequent jailhouse stint is ignored along with a violent assault on a woman, resulting in a lawsuit and subsequent payment. To his credit, Dre has admitted that he did some things in his younger days he wasn't proud of, but it would have been nice to have seen some of those things in this film.Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., steals the show playing his father in his younger days. The acting generally is quite good and the film covers most of the bases of the NWA history. Even if rap isn't your thing, this is a film worth seeing despite the limitations of hagiography.",7,3,26,4 June 2016
Win Win," Characters with hearts of gold make 'Win Win', a losing proposition!
","Following in the footsteps of his earlier indie 'The Visitor', Writer/Director Thomas McCarthy now proffers up a new unlikely tale, set in the wilds of suburban New Jersey. Paul Giamatti plays another lovable loser by the name of Mike Flaherty, a down on his luck attorney who suffers anxiety attacks due a downtown in his business. He shares an office with an accountant, Vigman, and has a friend, Terry, who's bitter after his wife leaves him for a contractor who's been repairing his home. Despite the fact that he's breaking his back trying to get new clients, Mike still has time to work as a part-time wrestling coach at the local high school, along with Vigman, and later Terry, who still has an interest in the sport as he used to be a below average wrestler as a teenager.The basic plot seems a bit confusing. I didn't understand why Mike agrees to assume the guardianship of part-dementia stricken Leo and then promptly puts him in a nursing home against his wishes. He could have kept his $1500 fee and simply allowed Leo to stay in his home with round-the-clock help (it's established that Leo is well off and can afford home care—in fact he already has help at the time Mike takes his case). Most of Mike's work as a guardian would have involved overseeing Leo's finances—not having to run over to the home all the time which is Mike's justification for putting him in the home in the first place. Leo did seem like an interesting character but Burt Young has little to do, playing a part that is clearly underwritten.Apparently, Mike's secretary's investigatory skills aren't very polished, as she's unable to find out any information about Leo's family. Lo and behold, Leo's missing grandson, Kyle, suddenly shows up on his grandfather's doorstep one fine day and he's a champion high school wrestling student to boot! Part of the problem here is that McCarthy can't decide whether this is a comedy or drama. The result really is an uneven hybrid. A good part of the Act 2 shenanigans are just that: shenanigans! The big joke is that the student wrestlers are completely inept and we're supposed to laugh at them, even after Kyle comes on board and restores a modicum of dignity to the team. Aside from Kyle, the next best player is Stemler (Kyle's buddy), who wins a match, not by pinning his opponent, but escaping his clutches, so that the clock runs out! The three coaches also happen to be thoroughly obnoxious in their fanatic love of the game; exhorting the hapless students through the use of choice expletives (and in the case of Mike) slapping Kyle in the face (at the boy's behest), in order to motivate him to greater heights on the gym floor.'Win, Win' becomes slightly more interesting at the midpoint, when Kyle's mother finally appears, lawyers up and demands to take Leo and Kyle back home with her as well as demanding Mike's $1500 guardianship commission. The way all this plays out is fairly predictable. Mike and his wife Jackie basically end up bonding with Kyle, despite the kid's chequered past which includes a juvenile rap for stealing a car. When Kyle finds out that Mike is 'just as bad as his mother', after it's revealed that he put Leo in a nursing home against both the grandfather's and the court's wishes, Kyle disappears, resulting in a frantic search, initiated by Mike and Jackie. All's well that ends well when Kyle is found at Leo's place, a series of apologies are made by Mike and Jackie reassures the boy that he's loved by them. An even more sentimental (and hence happy ending) is effected when Kyle's drug addict mom changes her mind about allowing 'good kid' Kyle to remain with the Flahertys. The win-win proposition comes into play when Kyle's mom gets to keep the $1500 and Mike doesn't have to reveal to the court that he's guilty of fraud. Mike's only 'punishment' is that he's forced to work part-time as a bartender in order to make up for the money he's agreed to send to the drug addict mom.Giamatti does well in the role of Mike despite the fact that he's not a very sympathetic character. Even less sympathetic is Terry who has a chip on his shoulder after his wife has an affair with that contractor. I'm not sure what Vigman is doing in the script and newcomer Alex Shaffer (a former successful high school wrestler) feels like he needed quite a bit of coaching (for the acting part—not the wrestling) to play the part of Kyle. Only Amy Ryan really succeeds amongst the supporting players as she does well in depicting the skepticism (and later the acceptance) of the young interloper in her household.Like in his previous indie, 'The Visitor', McCarthy's characters tend to veer toward the melodramatic. There is a need for a slightly flawed hero but the antagonist is decidedly evil. In the end, Win Win, is pretty much a losing proposition, as it sacrifices verisimilitude for the easy happy ending, with characters who can't rise above their hearts of gold.",4,4,10,6 November 2011
Black Panther," Like Trump, Coogler must play to his base in spite of entry into exclusive film fraternity
","Somehow I have a feeling that director Ryan Coogler anticipated the success of his Black Panther as well as the dilemma he now finds himself in. As a newly minted member of (the almost all-white) film establishment, and (probably now) a multi-millionaire to boot, Coogler undoubtedly had to figure out a way to fend off accusations from his base, of being a 'sell-out.' He did this by crafting his Black Panther script along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole to appeal to the masses of ordinary African-Americans who don't belong to an exclusive club of rich people that Coogler has recently joined. 
Coogler accomplishes his appeal to the base first by embracing the idealistic, utopian vision of Africa in the form of the nation of Wakanda, a Marvel comics invention, that harks back to films from the 30s such as Lost Horizon, where a 'mysterious, harmonious valley', dubbed 'Shangri-la,' thrives, somehow protected merely by mountains and a large number of overarching clouds. 
The whole idea is to present a positive image of African culture (mainly for) African-American youth in light of a history of put-downs which began of course during slavery times, when horrible stereotyped images of black people were first introduced and subsequently proliferated. Unfortunately, the tendency now is to go to the other extreme, so the blacks of Coogler's Wakanda are all powerful due to possession of the magical Vibranium, the super metal that gives them the technology to not only compete with the former (white) colonial powers of the world, but to surpass them! 
The ascendancy of black power as depicted here is nothing more than wish fulfillment, and clashes with the true political history of Africa since each country achieved independence and threw off the yoke of their colonial masters after World War II. Coogler knows that the phony Wakanda is much more appealing with its lack of corruption and suggestion of complete female empowerment (he also throws in some completely out of place Star Wars-like spaceships just to prove he's as good as any established sci-fi director).  
By playing to the base, Coogler refuses to present a 'warts and all' portrait of the African homeland and reinforces what amounts to chauvinism (excessive or prejudiced loyalty or support for one's own cause, group, or gender). Although Coogler holds up the tribal infighting in Wakanda as some kind of cause célèbre, it's really an unconscious admission that African history is not so wonderful. As Patrick Gathara writes in the Washington Post, Africa is represented here 'as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite, centered upon 'royalty and warriors', whose fortune comes not from its citizens' skill or ingenuity, but from a 'lucky meteor strike.' 
Coogler's other strategy to win over the masses is to introduce a vengeful antagonist, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, the former protagonist star of Coogler's prior effort, Creed. Here, Jordan is much more effective playing the bad guy, since Coogler's protagonists apparently all tend to be rather bland (that includes the star of this film, Chadwick Boseman, who plays King T'Challah and the Black Panther (all rolled into one). 
We first meet Killmonger in a flashback when he's just a kid in 1992 Oakland, California. This is where his father is killed by T'Challah's dad after he's discovered working with the racist South African Ulysses Klaue, who is attempting to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. Killmonger holds a grudge into adulthood and is determined to seek revenge against his uncle and cousin (as well as all whites). 
Some may say that by Coogler using the name 'Killmonger' (an obvious pejorative appellation), this suggests that he disapproves of the character's militant position. But think again. T'Challah doesn't finish Killmonger off at film's end-quite the contrary, he offers to save his life, if he only submits to eventual imprisonment. Killmonger instead takes his own life-Coogler views Killmonger's death as clearly tragic and obviously has sympathy for him.
By evoking some measure of sympathy for the villain, Coogler sets another bad example for impressionable youth, suggesting that Killmonger's position has merit. And what exactly is Killmonger's position? He seeks revenge (as well as hegemony over) all whites associated with the excesses of colonialism in an African past. This of course ignores the fact that the almost all of the nations of Africa have been independent for at least 50 years and are responsible for their own shortcomings which of course include (first and foremost), rampant corruption (not to mention subjugation of women and other human rights violations).
The strategy is of course to find a familiar scapegoat and deflect any calls for self-responsibility. Some may argue that Coogler is actually conflicted about this issue of revenge, especially because he depicts T'Challah as being conciliatory toward whites and seemingly rejects violence at film's end. But in actuality, Coogler's embrace of a Martin Luther King Jr. hero is merely done as a matter of expediency-he must suck up to the powers that be so they allow him into the exclusive film fraternity which he craves to be part of. In a sense, T'Challah's actions are almost a footnote-down deep, Coogler's real sympathies remain with the masses of deluded militants-with their puerile (and self-destructive) call for vengeance.
When one looks closely at Coogler, one sees a very technically capable director who will remain a mediocrity as long as he continues to suck up to the mass of deluded chauvinists who embrace vengeance as a means of solving the sorry legacy of slavery and racism in the United States today.",4,7,12,22 March 2018
Iron Man," Robocop flies to Afghanistan!
","This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intriguing: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man' who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.",1,27,67,10 May 2008
Toy Story 3," Entertaining, but not as good as Toy Story 1 & 2
","I was looking forward to seeing Toy Story 3 since I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2 so much. The question remains whether Toy Story 3 measures up to its predecessors. All the main characters are back including Woody and Buzz Lightyear and the Pixar animation, with its attention to extreme detail, is even better. It was a good idea not to bring back all the toys from the previous features and dispensing with the toy soldiers (for example), by having them 'bail out', which was quite clever.The plot begins in the present, with the toy's owner, Andy, now about to go away to college. He packs up his toys (excluding Woody who he intends to take with him to college) and puts them in a bag, about to bring them upstairs to the attic for storage. Somehow he gets distracted and his mother mistakenly throws the bag with the toys out in the trash. The toys manage to escape from the bag but jump into a box marked for the Sunnyside Day Care Center. Woody manages to follow the toys to the day care center and insists they should all return to Andy before he goes away to college. The toys, however, don't relish the idea of being no use up in the attic and stage a mutiny. Woody leaves his colleagues, only to end up in the home of Bonnie, a young child, who has some neat, new toys including a Shakespearean hedgehog, Mr. Pricklepants, and a scatterbrained triceratops, Trixie.Unlike Toy Story 1 & 2, which featured human antagonists (the vicious child 'Sid' in '1' and Al McWhiggin, the conniving toy store owner in '2'), Toy Story 3's antagonist is Lotso, a bear with a chip on his shoulder. It seems that Lotso was lost by his previous owner, a child named Daisy, who replaced him with a similar looking model. Somehow the idea that the innocent toy world can be corrupted by an evil seed within its own ranks isn't as effective as having human antagonists. That's because I think it's better to depict the toys as essentially representing the innocent and positive world of childhood with the negative force derived from the worst aspects of adulthood. In Toy Story 1, Sid is a child, obviously conditioned to be a 'monster' by his parents; and in Toy Story 2, Al the toy store owner, embodies the sin of avarice, which must be opposed through the 'goodness' of Andy's toys. In a sense, 'toydom' is diminished by pitting toy against toy and the point that adults are responsible for causing the problems of childhood, is lost.The other problem I found with the plot is that Andys' toys' reaction to Lotso's directives was unfounded. You'll recall that Andys' toys claim that being placed with the 'younger children' is inappropriate; but as toys, they should expect to be thrown around by younger children (isn't that what younger children do with toys?). And was Lotso being so unfair when he demands that the new toys be placed with the younger one's first, since they're 'first in line'? Notice at the end of the film, when 'fairness' is supposedly restored, Ken and Barbie are now running the day care center, now allowing all the toys to take turns, interacting with the younger and more disruptive children. Note that the toys will still be subjected to being thrown around by the younger children—simply less often.Still, Toy Story 3 is filled with thrilling scenes, reminiscent of its predecessors. After Andy's toys attempt to escape from the day care center, we're taken on a wild ride inside a trash compactor. The toys face their 'dark moment of the soul' as they're about to be burnt alive in an incinerator; after Lotso fails to save them by pushing the compactor's stop button, they're miraculously saved by squeeze toy aliens who somehow manage to stop all power by operating the controls in the control room.There are other neat scenes in Toy Story 3 including Buzz turning into a Lothario after accidentally being set on 'Spanish mode', Barbie and Ken falling in, then out of love and back in love again, Ken's hilarious wardrobe display and the fantastic introductory sequence featuring a wild chase involving both a train and a spaceship.For those who haven't seen Toy Story 1 & 2, Toy Story 3 might seem like a masterpiece. But for those who have seen the two earlier incarnations, one can only conclude that '3' just isn't quite as good. '3' does get marks for trying however. The theme that one cannot hold on to the past is ably embodied in Woody's resistance to leaving Andy and finally accepting, along with the rest of Andy's toys, the idea that it's time to move on. On the other hand, it's sad to see Lotso, pinned to the front of a garbage truck, with the implication that he may be the victim of his new owner, who might be some kind of sadist or pervert. The image of an innocent child's toy, made to represent some demonic force, is all wrong and sadly makes Story 3 inappropriate for younger viewers.",6,3,8,9 August 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen's Grand Comeback
","In his early days, after he gave up writing comedies such as 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper', Woody Allen desperately wanted to join the ranks of the world's great directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. He churned out pretentious drivel such as 'Interiors' in an attempt to emulate his beloved Bergman but deep down he always knew that he could never approach the great director's depth. So he turned to a mixture of romantic comedy and his own brand of 'art house fare' in the films that made him famous: 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her Sisters'. Unfortunately, until the impressive 'Crimes and Misdemeanors', he was never able to muster enough sympathy for his characters to make them credible enough or engaging. There was always that flash of arrogance underneath the surface that Allen was unable to hide; he was always one step above his characters, looking down on them rather then striking the necessary balance between sympathy and contempt.At a certain point, Allen threw up his hands and decided for awhile that maybe he should go back to his strong suit as an 'entertainer'. He churned out fluff pieces such as 'Bullets over Broadway' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' but made one last attempt at joining the great directors' pantheon with 'Deconstructing Harry', another failed attempt to emulate Bergman. Allen floundered until 2005 when he came out with 'Match Point' which marked a welcome move to the mainstream. No longer starring in his own films and filming in England, Allen decided that he no longer had to prove to the world that he was the next Fellini or Bergman. Up until the unconvincing climax, 'Match Point' was a taut drama chronicling the machinations of a lower-class retired tennis pro as he manipulates family members in an upper class milieu.Vicky Christina Barcelona is content to examine all strictly middle class characters from both sides of the Atlantic. Before Allen shows us the 'dark' side to his characters, he wisely builds sympathy for them. Both Vicky and Christina are adventurers. Vicky, the more conservative of the two, is extremely skeptical of Juan Antonio's proposal to fly in his private plane for a weekend of wild abandon in a picaresque Spanish town. Her skepticism and conservative nature are her strong points. Christina, in contrast, believes in taking chances without thinking about the consequences so she convinces Vicky to accept Juan Antonio's proposal. While Christina often acts recklessly, her desire for freedom often leads her to new, interesting experiences which the average person would never dream of entertaining.Juan Antonio, the suave Lothario, who sees nothing wrong in seducing as many women as he can, also has many likable attributes. Not only is he a 'smooth operator' but he has that 'senstive side' that women are drawn to. Vicky finds Juan Antonio's proposition to visit his father his 'first genuinely interesting proposition'. Juan Antonio's startling account of why his father won't share his poetry with the world draws Vicky to him. Juan Antonio's ex-girlfriend, the volatile Maria Elena, can hold her own with her ex in regards to creative pursuits. Not only does Juan Antonio claim that his strength as an artist can be attributed to Maria Elena but she is genuinely helpful to Christina when she teaches her how to become an accomplished photographer.The plot of VCB never bores. The break into Act II occurs when Juan Antonio takes Vicky and Christina on a wild weekend. Up until the midpoint there are many twists: Christina becomes sick right before making love; Juan Antonio's seduction of Vicky; Doug's proposal to get married first in Spain and his arrival and Christina's decision to move in with Juan Antonio.The midpoint marks escalating tension. This is when Maria Elena attempts suicide and moves in with Christina and Juan Antonio. More twists and turns occur in the second half of Act II: Maria Elena's terrible jealousy toward Christina; The revelation of Juan Antonio's infidelity which led to Maria Elena attacking him; Vicky's confession to Ben that she doesn't know why she's attracted to Juan Antonio; Judy's affair with Doug's business partner and her misguided encouragement of Vicky in continuing the affair with Juan Antonio; Christina's decision to leave the ménage a trios and Maria Elena and Juan Antonio's dispiriting breakup.Woody Allen does a much better job with his climax than in Match Point since Maria Elena's 'crime of passion' is more believable than Chris, the ex-tennis pro's foray into full-blown murder.Just as he views his characters with sympathy, Woody Allen doesn't hesitate to criticize them. Vicky admits that her husband Doug is a wonderful guy, someone who she's always wanted but cannot throw off her irrational attraction to Juan Antonio. Even at the end, she's about to be seduced by Juan Antonio AGAIN but is brought back to reality when Maria Elena's gun goes off and she sustains a flesh wound to her hand. Christina seems naturally drawn to vacuous affairs. Even at the beginning, she's telling Juan Antonio she'll go up to his room but 'you'll have to seduce ME'. She's also a bit arrogant when she tells him, 'You're home free, unless you blow it'. Christina never knows 'what she wants' but does know 'what she DOESN'T want'.Juan Antonio seems to go from one woman to another but is unable to make a commitment. His narcissism seems to always lead to bad feelings of jealousy amongst the various women he seduces. And of course Maria Elena is the ultimate narcissist in that she can't accept others unless they give her 100% loyalty.The overuse of the narrator in VCB is perhaps the film's major flaw. One wonders why Woody Allen doesn't trust his audience to draw its own conclusions. Nonetheless, VCB marks a comeback of sorts for Woody Allen. It's a perceptive and critical look at European and American sensibilities regarding relationships and how they can go awry.",8,0,2,3 November 2009
Saving Mr. Banks," It will successfully tug at your heart strings only if you ignore the one dimensional portraits of its principal protagonists
","Walt Disney had been trying to obtain the rights to make 'Mary Poppins' into a film for years, but P.L. Travers, its highly critical author, wouldn't budge. Finally in 1961, faced with diminishing financial assets, Travers agreed to Disney's proposal with the proviso that she have the last say in regards to creative control of the script. In 'Saving Mr. Banks', Travers is depicted as the film's 'heavy' and Disney as the understanding 'good guy'. In reality, Travers was a much more complicated person than the stereotyped martinet who puts the Disney creative team through a living hell. The film's scenarists posit a simplistic scenario in which Travers' difficult childhood is the reason she grows up to be such a sourpuss. A good part of the film features flashbacks to Travers' early childhood in Queensland, Australia, where her highly imaginative father (well-played by Colin Farrell) encourages the young Travers' creativity but cannot control his own, very sad addiction to alcohol.The childhood flashbacks prove to be a ponderous affair and could have been easily done in one or two short but compact, all-encompassing scenes. Perhaps it would have been better to show Travers' life as she progressed into adulthood. Hardly someone who was narrow-minded (as some might get the impression here), Travers had a career as an actress and poet in her younger days, had a number of bisexual lovers, adopted a child when she was 40, spent two summers on different Native American reservations and was an astute student of the mystic, George Gurdjieff. Disney, on the other hand, is depicted as an eccentric uncle type that everyone loved. Tom Hanks ably conveys the 'good' side of Disney but visually fails to convey his true craggy look—a visage worn down by years of smoking cigarettes (Disney would never allow himself to be shown smoking in public and this fact is actually alluded to in 'Saving Mr. Banks'). Perhaps we needed a few flashbacks also for Mr. Disney, whose dark side included flirtations during the 40s with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an anti- semitic, anti-communist organization (he distanced himself from the organization in the 50s) as well as testifying before the House of Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC), also in the 40s, against a number of liberal Hollywood writers, some of whom ended up being blacklisted (something that Mr. Hanks probably would have been appalled by me, had he been living as an adult, back then).Nonetheless, it is true that while working on the film version of Mary Poppins, Travers was devoted to playing the part of a curmudgeon. Travers stipulated that the creative sessions between her and the writing team be recorded on tape; thus a good deal of the hilarious interchanges, are utilized by the films' scenarists to illustrate just how far Ms. Travers would go in preserving the integrity of her intellectual property. Sometimes her demands were off the wall like not allowing the color 'red' to be used anywhere in the film. But not everything she objected to was unreasonable. Take for example, her violent distaste for the use of animation in the film. That, actually, constitutes the 'dark moment' at the end of Act II, when Travers bolts Disney headquarters (with unsigned contract in tow) and returns to England, vowing never to see Mary Poppins completed as a movie, precisely because of Walt Disney's desire to insert a small sequence involving dancing Penguins (Having seen clips of those dancing penguins, I can completely understand why Ms. Travers was upset!).The rest of the plot involves how Disney and company (along with the help of Travers' chauffeur, played by the always interesting Paul Giamatti) managed to soften Travers up and convince her to give up her rights, so that 'Mary Poppins' could finally get made.. Here, 'good' Disney shines; I don't know whether this actually happened, but Disney expresses empathy for Travers, when he recalls how he was very protective of his own invention, Mickey Mouse, when others were out to change his concept. I do know Disney did not fly all the way to England to convince Travers to change her mind, but Hanks gives his most impassioned speech of the movie when he links the history of his own creative career to that of Travers, during their face off in the UK.The Disney creative team also becomes more 'sensitive' to Travers' desire to ensure that her father's legacy is not tarnished. Hence, they 'save' Mr. Banks by not making him a 'pathetic' character (a drunkard in real life) but one who loves children and always wants to help them (he fixes the kite and the Sherman Brothers, end up penning the enormously catchy, 'Let's Go Fly a Kite.')The scenarists revert to comedy when Travers invites herself to the Mary Poppins Hollywood premiere after Disney declines to issue an invitation (Disney's fear is that she'll muck things up at the premiere, acting as a loose cannon). While Travers is watching the animated penguin sequence, you can see tears streaming down her cheeks. Disney leans over, and says something to her, to the effect that the animation didn't turn out to be so bad after all; but Travers explains she's crying because she still finds the animation repulsive.'Saving Mr. Banks' is an affectionate look at a small piece of entertainment history. It pulls at the heart strings but one still must look at it with a jaded eye. It's a film that was vetted beforehand by the Disney Corporation, who were bent on protecting their founder's reputation at any cost. The result is a slight loss of prestige to P.L. Travers. Nonetheless, she was the one who got the last laugh, by barring any future film sequels and insisting on only British writers working on a Mary Poppins musical.",6,5,12,24 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," Happy ending for Hitler Youth, as Nazis get their comeuppance, doesn't sit right
","Writer/Director Taika Waititi is not the first filmmaker to use farce to satirize the Third Reich. In 1940, Charlie Chaplin attempted to mock the Nazis in his first full sound film, The Great Dictator. After the war, Chaplin was quoted as saying that had he known about Hitler's program of genocide, he would never have made The Great Dictator.
Chaplin implicitly recognized later on, that turning Hitler into a buffoon was not the proper strategy to expose the Nazis for what they were. It was a cheap strategy in which viewers reveled in the Nazis' comeuppance ex post facto (the buffoon being the perfect straw man-easily punctured like a papier-mâché piñata). The sad reality is, of course, that aside from their ultimate defeat, the Nazis were successful in bringing misery to a vast number of their victims.
Here Waititi employs the same strategy in having Hitler (played by Waititi himself) become the imaginary playmate of his protagonist, ten year old Johannes 'Jojo' Beltzer (Roman Griffin Davis), an aspiring member of the Hitler Youth. There's nothing wrong with the concept of having a ten year old German boy in the waning days of World War II, having Hitler as an imaginary friend. But wouldn't it have been a much darker (and perhaps a much more accurate portrait) to have Hitler be more manipulative and seductive?
So when Jojo refuses to kill the rabbit while ensconced at the Hitler Youth camp, Hitler pretends to sympathize with Jojo as he does in the film. But later (as an alternate scenario), through his persuasive powers, he convinces the boy to change his mind, and make it seem like, 'yes, it's okay to go ahead and kill the rabbit.' That would be much more in line with the way many of these kids turned out under the spell of a Svengali like Hitler.
But as is the case with many European post-war filmmakers (and especially German ones), there always has to be at least one 'good German,' to balance out the horror of the Nazi characters (if you're German, the plaintive cry that 'not all of us were and are bad' must be ubiquitous). It's a noble sentiment but sometimes leads to the wrong impression that Nazi perfidy wasn't as widespread or perhaps there was ALWAYS a significant counterbalance of good Germans, who were ever present to 'do the right thing' (i.e. opposing the genocidal madness of fanatical adherents of the Nazi regime).
So not only does Waititi promote Jojo as one of his good Germans who turned out to be good (and not one of those fanatical Hitler Youth who fought in the streets of Berlin to the very end), but there's also the one-eyed Wehrmacht Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), another buffoon of a character, who ends up sticking up for the Jews, thwarting the Gestapo and saving Jojo from certain execution by the Russians, after they emerge triumphant against the Nazis.
And Waititi insists on introducing some more 'good Germans' (this time much closer to home) in the form of Jojo's mom, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson ), who has been hiding a Jewish teenager, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in a secret room throughout the war. It's all part of Waititi's strategy to promote a pyrrhic victory-the good guys facilitate their comeuppance against the bumbling Nazis.
Elsa, in particular, turns out to be a virtual super girl-convincing Jojo of the error of his belief in the 'Master Race' and outwitting the Gestapo in the crucial 'dark moment' at the end of the second act. There are no truly fleshed out characters in Jojo Rabbit-only those designed to protect the audience from grasping the true nature of Nazism and reducing them to ordinary, clownish villains in Waititi's generic 'anti-hate' campaign.
On the other hand, when Waititi eschews turning his Nazis into perennial clowns, he's more successful (and makes one feel he's getting at 'something'). There are 'glimpses' throughout Jojo Rabbit of the darker side. I'm thinking of scenes such as when Jojo's fellow Hitler Youth kill the rabbit, or when we see Jojo's drawings of the repulsive caricatures of Jews in his notebook or the aftermath of the murder of Rosie, hung in the streets after being outed as a collaborator with the resistance.
Waititi's most revolutionary gesture is the politically incorrect way in which he depicts the anti-Semitism of ordinary Germans. Even the goodly Jojo is infected by the scourge of 'Jew hatred.' While we never see any fanatic Nazis talking about extermination, the banality of such ordinary 'shop talk' is indicative of the kind of racism inculcated in the minds of those who indulged in what Hannah Arendt termed 'the banality of evil.'
In the end, however, Waititi serves up a predictable happy ending, again promoting the comeuppance of a group who in reality were the victors in the game of genocidal madness (in reality did Hitler get his just desserts?-not really...he killed himself in the bunker but was responsible for murdering millions).
For those kids who went to their death as committed Nazis, the rest of the remnants of the Hitler Youth (like Jojo) who underwent de-Nazification, did not emerge 'dancing in the streets' upon liberation (in contrast to the happy Jojo and Elsa). Indeed, it took these kids years to overcome the horrific conditioning imposed upon them by legions of brutal taskmasters-hardly a group of certified buffoons.",4,3,6,7 February 2020
Son of Saul," First-time Hungarian director's effort ably captures atmosphere of Nazi genocide, but lacks dramatic conflict
","First-time Hungarian director László Nemes has been quoted as saying that he didn't want to make a film like Spielberg's Schindler's List, which he dubbed too 'conventional.' Nemes insisted on creating a different kind of Holocaust drama, where the emphasis was not on the survivors but on those who perished—pointing out that surviving the Holocaust was an anomalous affair.Nemes' protagonist is Saul Ausländer, a native Hungarian, who worked as an Auschwitz Sonderkommando (a group of prisoners given special privileges by the Nazis in exchange for assisting them in the extermination procedures and clean-up duties at the camp). Despite being housed away from the crematoriums and given a few extra meager rations, the Sonderkommandos were marked for death when it was deemed they had completed all the work required of them by the Nazis. After the war, some Sonderkommandos were treated as war criminals and shunned by the survivors.Ausländer discovers that one Hungarian boy has survived inside a gas chamber. His life is brief after a Nazi doctor suffocates him and orders an autopsy (to determine why this particular boy had survived). Ausländer insists this boy is his son and arranges to gain possession of the body so he can find a Rabbi to perform a proper burial. Was the boy really his son? At one point, Ausländer states that this was his son from a woman he never married. That kind of statement makes one believe that Ausländer could have been telling the truth. But he could have said that to justify his actions with his fellow inmates—they of course regarded his belief as a delusion and that he was 'more interested in the dead than the living.' An alternative way of looking at this is that this is how Ausländer could find some measure of redemption inside such a horrific environment—by arranging for the boy to be properly buried, he would be thwarting the Nazis' aim to desecrate the body as well as giving his life some purpose amidst the horror.Nemes' technique is to shoot the entire movie close-up from Ausländer's point of view. The camera never pulls back so we can see the 'bigger picture.' Since everything is shot close-up, we can only catch glimpses of what's happening all around the beleaguered Sonderkommando. We never see the Jewish victims being gassed inside the crematorium. But we can hear their screams and terrifying pounding on the steel door as Ausländer stands right in front of it. Glimpses of the bodies (called 'pieces' by the Sonderkommandos) are briefly seen being pulled out of the gas chamber and Ausländer and his associates must clean the blood on the floor so none of the new victims get any wind of what is about to happen to them.Nemes' decision to shoot 'close-up' has the effect of distancing the audience from the horrors that are not seen directly. In one respect, this distancing effectively makes the horror more palpable—if the audience takes in too many horrifying images, they may become numb to it all. On the other hand it defeats Nemes' purpose which is to emphasize the emotional connection with the audience—we're supposed to be shocked by the inhumanity (not sheltered due to not seeing the 'whole picture'). The 1985 Russian film, Come and See, had a similar 'distancing' problem— the subject matter concerned the massacre of civilians in Belarus by the Nazis and their collaborators. Unlike Son of Saul, Come and See was shot from a distance, not close-up. But the result was the same: the horror was not horrifying enough.The value of films such as Come and See and Son of Saul is that they convey the 'atmosphere' of genocide. From a distance, one might perceive the Nazis' actions as a macabre carnival where the perpetrators continually enjoy themselves as they commit repulsive, sadistic acts. Nemes also fulfills his promise not to give the wrong impression that the Holocaust was a story of survival. The final, gripping scenes in Son of Saul make it clear that there were virtually no survivors. Ausländer may have found some peace that he was able to save his 'son' from desecration, but those whom we were rooting for throughout the narrative, are mowed down by Nazi bullets, the sound of which occur effectively off screen.Son of Saul is less effective as a drama due to lack of a singular antagonist. We rarely get to see what the personalities of the perpetrators are like. There is one really telling scene where a Nazi officer mocks Ausländer, dancing around him and speaking in pidgin Yiddish. But for the most part, the Nazis here are faceless entities. It might have been more interesting if their genocidal actions were seen from their point of view.Finally, Ausländer's journey is too one-note and repetitious to be effective. We get the idea of what he is trying to do early on—it may be noble but his plan is aimless and ineffectual. Paul Ranier writing in the Christian Science Monitor echoes my sentiments: 'Nemes's Saul- centric stylistics grow wearisome after a while, because Saul, blank- faced throughout, never really comes to life as much more than a symbolic martyr.'Son of Saul is certainly up there with other Holocaust films that depict the horrors from a sensory and auditory perspective. This may be the only way to effectively convey what occurred in the extermination camps. Nonetheless, somehow the human element is missing here—which of course would involve fleshed-out multi-dimensional protagonists and antagonists, and the conflicts cogently enumerated between them.",6,18,28,31 January 2016
Lucy," 'Lucy' passes the entertainment test but Besson is mired in the unsatisfying adolescent world of sadistic one-note mobsters and the vigilante's thirst for revenge
","'Lucy' is famed action sci-fi director Luc Besson's latest import from France. The film is mainly in English and stars Scarlett Johansson who plays a student in Taipei, Taiwan, forced by an ex- boyfriend to deliver a mysterious suitcase to a Korean mob boss, Mr. Jang. It turns out that the suitcase contains packets of a new experimental drug called CPH4 which can enhance physical and mental capabilities. Jang has his henchmen sew packets of the drug into her stomach and while in captivity, one of the captors kicks her in the stomach breaking the packet and releasing all of the drug into her system. Lucy suddenly gains superhuman abilities including extraordinary depth of perception.Early on it's clear that Besson has trouble deciding whether 'Lucy' is a good 'Terminator' or a bad 'Terminator.' After escaping by killing her captors, there's a rather ugly scene whether Lucy rushes to the hospital to have the remaining bag of CPH4 removed from her stomach. She kills a man on the operating table and rationalizes her actions to the doctors by indicating that the man would have died anyway (she scans the x-rays and concludes he is a terminal case.) Soon, however, Besson gets back on track by having Lucy strictly kill bad boys and clearly go down the 'good Terminator' route.Realizing that she will disintegrate without getting her hands on some more CPH4, using her super brain, she locates the three other drug mules and phones in their locations to handsome Parisian cop, Pierre Del Rio. Meanwhile, she contacts kindly super-brilliant Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who has been lecturing on increased mental capacity for years. Lucy's ever increasing knowledge will go to waste if she doesn't get it to Professor Norman before she expires.The rest of 'Lucy' is a combination of a dopey Asian mobster flick with some rather nice sci-fi visuals mainly involving time travel and psychedelic-like perceptions. As Lucy keeps developing her 'full potential,' she also must fend off the mobsters who are trying to kill her. With her extraordinary powers, the mobsters are of course no match for her and she dispenses with them in a series of clichéd scenes including a car chase, assisted by the handsome Parisian cop. In perhaps the neatest scene, she goes back in time to earth's creation by flipping her hand as if she going through pages on an iPad. My favorite time travel moment is when she finds herself on a street in the late 19th century. The ending is rather anti-climactic. Before Lucy becomes one with the universe, she hands over her knowledge to Professor Norman on a flash drive (of all things!). Del Rio asks where Lucy is and a message on his cell phone shows up, 'I am everywhere!' So presumably now Professor Norman will be able to cure all diseases with all the knowledge he finds on the flash drive.Besson's creation of a superhero relies on the accidental consumption of an untested black market drug. Why would someone try to sell such an extraordinary compound on the black market when they could (perhaps with some tinkering) use it themselves and gain super-intelligence like Lucy? I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief, but it still feels a little too 'easy' for this CPH4 drug to induce such effects in a human being.'Lucy' manages to be entertaining as well as tawdry as the same time. It passes the entertainment test but one gets the feeling that Besson is mired in the unsatisfying adolescent world of sadistic one-note mobsters and the vigilante's thirst for revenge.",6,0,2,4 September 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Anderson's overly cute quirk fest also features compelling elements of redemption
","Some may say 'Moonrise Kingdom' is charming and whimsical. Others might say it's simply trivial. Perhaps the best assessment is somewhere in between. One thing for sure is that the cinematography is a visual feast. Set in 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Pezance, it was actually shot around Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.'Moonrise' is formulaic up to a point. Quirky comedies usually feature protagonists who are outsiders, non-conformist, slightly emotionally unstable and victims of persecution by an established order. In this case, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop fit the bill. A year before the break into the 'Second Act' where Sam and Suzy run off to their 'Moonrise Kingdom', they become pen pals after meeting at a church performance of Noye's Fluddle. A year later, Sam, who has a history of acting out behavior, finds himself ostracized by his Scout troop and then is dropped by his foster family after he disappears at his 'Khaki Scout' summer camp. Suzy comes from a more 'stable' family of dysfunctional attorney parents but also has behavior problems, and ends up running off with her 'soul mate', the equally troubled Sam.Quirky comedies also feature a group (or groups) who persecute our quirky heroes. In this case, Sam is the subject of vituperation by his scout troop. Similarly, Suzy is rejected by her parents, who have no tolerance for her rebellious ways. Perhaps the most unpleasant scene in 'Moonrise Kingdom' is when the Scout Troop attempts to chase down Sam out in the forest. Fortunately, director Wes Anderson later redeems his antagonists. The scout troop realizes that they've been bullying Sam and finally decide to help him. Suzy's parents also realize the error of their ways and employing their legal acumen, aid Captain Sharp as he adopts Sam and prevents the Social Services matron from hauling Sam off to the Juvenile Refuge.With both actors playing wondrously against type, Bruce Willis and Edward Norton as Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), also play characters worthy of redemption. Sharp, who's been having an affair with Suzy's mother, Laura Bishop, ends the affair and later nobly adopts Sam. And Randy, who initially loses his scout troop after they split camp aiding Sam, saves his superior, Commander Pierce, after Pierce demotes him for incompetence. Only the Social Services matron, who represents bureaucracy, finds no redemption in Anderson's redemptive pageant.'Moonrise Kingdom' feels a bit too long especially when Sam and Suzy run away TWICE. And we also see one too many chases throughout the film. Nonetheless, Wes Anderson employs a number of great creative touches that distract us from the drawn out narrative. I'm referring of course to the fictional books he creates for Suzy as well employing the marvelous Benjamin Britten music.One must realize that Anderson's characters are farcical types--not meant to be at all realistic. Rather, he's gently poking fun at those neurotic type of adults who lack insight into their own behavior. Fortunately, Anderson ends things on a positive note, as most of the adults such as the Bishops and Captain Sharp, redeem themselves in the end. As for Sam and Suzy, it's sort of like the kid's version of 'Silver Linings Playbook'--amusing up to a point but slightly over baked. When all is said and done, 'Moonrise' is sometimes a little too cute for its own good. But look a little closer and you'll also see it's a tale of the power of redemption--which is no small thing.",5,3,6,16 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Competent but derivative reboot of American exceptionalism undermined by crucial miscast of storm trooper character
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the 7th installment in the great money-making pantheon. After Disney bought out George Lucas, the progenitor of the series, the decision was made to conscript the heavily Spielberg influenced director, J.J. Abrams, who agreed to direct a veritable clone of Episodes 1 through 3 (eschewing the 'dark' prequels of Lucas' Episodes 4 through 6). The three original episodes represented a grand updating of the old movie serials of the 30s and 40s, particularly those produced by Republic Pictures, known for outstanding special effects.Even more influential is the memory of America's last 'noble' conflict: World War II. Indeed, The Force Awakens (TFA) features villains primarily modeled on Nazi Germany and to a lesser extent, fascist Imperial Japan. In TFA, the Nazis take the form of 'The First Order,' sounding very similar to the Nazis' 'new order' (the political order which Nazi Germany wanted to impose on the conquered areas under its dominion). The Star Wars' 'good guys' are part of the 'Resistance,' a moniker usually reserved for the French, who battled the Germans on their own turf in World War II. First Order Stormtroopers appear to be a stand-in for the Waffen SS (militarized formations of Hitler's elite bodyguards and special police force), who commit Nazi-like atrocities, eliminating innocent inhabitants on the planet Jakku. The mysterious Supreme leader Snoke harks back to the image of Emperor Hirohito, an inscrutable figure in the eyes of many Americans during the second World War. TFA features the derring-do of fighter pilots who look and sound like Americans. 'Alien' pilots are also part of the Resistance and they represent foreign nationals who assisted the Americans and the British in the air campaign against Nazi Germany and Japan. American Harrison Ford as the smuggler Han Solo and one of the new protagonists, Brit Daisy Ridley, as the scavenger Rey, exemplify any civilian (on either side of the Atlantic), who assisted in the war effort (Rey's capture and subsequent interrogation by the First Order peg her as a descendant of MI5 or OSS spies entrusted with secret information—in this case, Rey must not give away the crucial information of the map that will lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker).Additional World War II allies find their counterparts in TFA. Maz Kanata (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) is the Yoda-like, ET looking alien who brings wise advice from what must be a timeless, magical Orient. And Max Von Sydow, a retired adventurer on the planet Jakku, undoubtedly typifies any ally from the Scandinavian countries that aided English-speaking combatants. The TFA is seriously undermined by the politically correct casting choice of renegade Stormtrooper Finn played by John Boyega. Finn not only doesn't have a very good reason for going 'rogue,' but if the First Order believes in racial superiority like their Nazi counterparts, Finn would hardly be a candidate for inclusion in the elite Stormtrooper unit. Even if you buy the idea of Finn's change of allegiance, Boyega's decision to turn the character into a buffoon of sorts (replete with his cowardly decision to go AWOL), casts an amateurish pall on the TFA proceedings. Instead, a young Arnold Schwarznegger type would have been far more appropriate in the role. One very sagacious IMDb poster suggested that Oscar Issac who plays the crack fighter pilot, Poe, should have been cast as Finn and Boyega should have taken the role of Poe.It's pretty pointless rehashing the TFA plot but suffice it to say much of what goes on is a rehash of what we've seen before in Episodes 1 through 3. BB8, the new 'droid,' is quite delightful as the roly-poly 'pet' who belongs to Rey and hides part of the puzzle that will lead to Luke. Star Wars aficionados will probably dig the reappearance of the rundown Millennium Falcon ship but when Han Solo unleashes the cargo against criminals out to get him, the ensuing mayhem (featuring rapacious snake-like creatures) translates into what appear to be some rather bad outtakes from one of the Men in Black pictures. When the Falcon crew travels to the planet Takodana, there's more nostalgia as the camera pans through a cantina consisting of most of the cooler aliens in the Star Wars universe.The hurried TFA climax is nothing to write home about. Particularly puerile is Rey's ability to use the Force to direct a Stormtrooper to unlock her restraints so she can escape. Then there's the rather predictable Oedipal confrontation between Kylo Ren and his dad, Han Solo. Guess who meets his demise? Finally, there's the rather pointless and dull light-saber battle first between Kylo and Finn and then Rey, who manages to get the better of the deranged psychopath.Just like in the originals, the American (oops, I mean the Resistance) fighter pilots do their thing and destroy The First Order's base. I neglected to mention Princess Leia (now General Leia), played by the late Carrie Fisher. She unfortunately didn't have much to do except hug Han Solo and later get misty eyed over his death.Mark Hamill has such a small part here that we can only hope the Star Wars scenarists come up with something a little more substantial for the iconic super hero, the next time around. Hamill unfortunately didn't have much of a career after starring in the original Star Wars—so he probably (and unfortunately) has the most to prove.TFA might have been better if there was more of a focus on what made the bad guys tick. Instead, it's just another reboot of a reboot: the Star War Universe episodes 1 through 3, as a stand-in for American exceptionalism in World War II. Again, if you a Star Wars aficionado, you probably can't go wrong here. Others should be slightly wary.",5,12,15,20 January 2016
Flight," Tale of a Captain Sully with a drinking problem nosedives after sensational crash scene opening
","'Flight', Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film in twelve years, starts off with one of the most spine-tingling, harrowing plane crash disaster scenes in cinematic history. Denzel Washington as the plane's alcoholic pilot, Captain William 'Whip' Whittaker, crash lands his jet into a field after a broken jack screw causes a catastrophic loss of control. Loosely based on a fatal Air Alaska crash in 2000, Whip successfully saves 96 out of 102 lives, by inverting the aircraft, right before it goes down.Whip winds up in the hospital and soon recovers from minor injuries. Despite being hailed as a hero (a la the real-life Captain 'Sully' Sullenberger), Whip was drunk during the flight and the National Transportation Safety Board now has a toxicology test taken when he first arrives at the hospital, that proves it. Fortunately for him, his tough as nails attorney, Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle), is able to quash the report due to irregularities in the blood test.While the aforementioned plane crash is riveting, the bulk of 'Flight' is unfortunately just another tale of a sad sack alcoholic wrestling with his demons. Some may be impressed by the ambiguity of a man who can be both a hero and an angry, aggressive, self-destructive alcoholic at the same time--but most of 'Flight' is a story we've seen before.While in the hospital, Whip meets Nicole who is recovering from a heroin overdose. Earlier, we see Nicole before she meets Whip and it's quite clear that her addiction is extensive. It seems rather odd that Whip would take Nicole under his wings at this juncture especially with the possibility of extensive media scrutiny, but he decides anyway to bring her back to his (now) deceased father's farm (why it takes the media a few days before they actually go out and confront Whip at the farm, doesn't ring true at all).Nicole is there to contrast her quick transcendence over her addiction as opposed to Whip's continuing denial (it seems awfully convenient that such a severe addict as Nicole, is able to see the light, so quickly!). Still, Denzel Washington does a fine job in conveying just how hard it is to deal with someone who is an alcoholic (some of the best later scenes are Whip's confrontations with Nicole).The rest of 'Flight' chronicles Whips' continuing downward spiral. There is Whip's visit to his ex-wife and son which ends quite badly and Charlie Anderson (the union rep) along with his attorney's attempt to sober him up before the big NTSB hearing. That whole scene is perhaps the least convincing in the film. You'll recall that Whip is placed in a hotel room where he has no access to alcohol. Even though they hire a bodyguard to watch the room, they don't bother to check to see if the adjoining room is stocked with alcohol. Furthermore, why would the door to the adjoining room be unlocked?--unless you've paid for the other room, a hotel would not leave such a door open.In the end, Zemeckis must opt for the 'Hollywood' ending. At the crucial moment, Whip suddenly has a change of heart, and admits 'everything' at the NTSB hearing. In this case, he won't let the flight attendant he was sleeping with before the ill-fated flight, be blamed for 'drinking while on duty' (Whip won't impugn her reputation since she was responsible for saving a child during the crash). Is this enough for a man so in denial as Whip is, to suddenly 'come clean'? Unlikely. It would have been a lot more troubling if Zemeckis showed Whip staying in denial and is cleared at the hearing--but Zemeckis needs a feel good ending. Whip does go to prison afterward but is on his way to reconciliation with his son (who visits him in prison) and presumably with the ex-wife. There's also a rather obvious moral tale here--Whip articulates it when he states at the film's conclusion that he finally feels 'free' in prison, as he is no longer hitting the bottle.Despite a pretty positive critical reception, there were a number of critics who refused to jump on the bandwagon--recognizing that the story surrounding Denzel's performance, in the words of LA Times critic Kenneth Turan, 'is not as subtle or involving as his performance.' Turan feels that 'Flight' 'plays at times like a feature-length infomercial for the powers of AA.' David Fear agrees: 'Take out the opening jaw-dropper, and you've essentially got The Lost Weekend Redux. Despite Washington going the full nine yards ugly-drunk-wise, there's little to distinguish this from every other entry in the cinema du addiction genre: You'll get the requisite denial, hitting rock bottom and then rockier bottom, relapse and, finally, a moment of clarity.'Stan Hall in the Portland Oregonian feels that Zemeckis' 'best-known work has a tendency to go for grand gestures, old-fashioned moralizing and outcomes that can often be spotted from miles away.' And he finds that, 'there's not much real value to this oddly slick stab at popcorn entertainment about a person's debilitating alcoholism.' Andrew O'Hehir in Salon concurs that Zemeckis is a 'technical wizard' but 'drama just isn't his instrument': 'Slowly but surely, 'Flight' degenerates from a tale of moral paradox and wounded romance into a mid-1990s after-school special about addiction and recovery. You get the feeling the filmmakers are aiming for a star-driven combo of the Sully saga and 'Crime and Punishment.'I quote these critics to point out that I'm not the only one who has reservations about this film. I think most of us will agree that the plane crash scene and Denzel's excellent performance are the highlights of the film. I'm not sure how many will agree with me and these other discerning critics, that Flight's narrative is nothing special, with its pedestrian emphasis on one man's quest to purge his alcoholic demons and the obvious exhortation to embrace sobriety.",5,0,3,25 November 2012
Unbroken," Jolie shows more talent for visuals than her generic portrait of Olympian and WW II Prisoner-of-War Hero
","Angelina Jolie's biopic of Olympian and World War II Prisoner of War, Louis Zamperini, almost falls into the category of hagiography. I agree with Kyle Smith writing in the New York Post that 'on a scene-by-scene basis, the film works perfectly well.' But I also agree with him somewhat that the movie is 'trite' and 'thin of character.' I have never been a big fan of Angelina Jolie, but I can't help but feel she's endured some significant Jolie-bashing just because she is who she is. While the 'Unbroken' scenarists have trouble making Zamperini into something more than a generic hero, the basic facts of what he went through are gripping enough. Particularly in the two early sequences where Zemperini is a bombardier for the US Army Air Force on a B-24 bomber, Jolie shows her mettle in constructing some thrilling action scenes. The flashbacks to Zamperini's childhood don't work as well as they're fraught with clichés. Joe Walsh in Cine Vue points out that Zamperini's brother 'encourages the young Louis to compete long distance running and provides trite motivational speeches. The emotional drive of these moments is there to kindle a sense of the rise to glory; hard work is demonstrated through a series of running montages that imitate Chariots Of Fire (1981), all of which adds up to be surprisingly dull.' Jolie's attention to detail in recreating the 1936 Olympics is quite welcome and I found it interesting that Zamperini came in eighth in the 5,000 meter race he competed in but broke the record for the fastest fractions in the final lap (the fact that Zamperini was actually congratulated by Hitler is left out of the narrative; it might have been interesting if Jolie left that sequence in).Perhaps the best sequence in the film is Zamperini's 47 day survival at sea. It's not only how he survived (of the two other men he was with, one of them died), but we also get a sense of what some of the other characters he interacted with, were all about.Zamperini's sojourn as a Japanese prisoner of war pretty much sticks to the facts as detailed in the Hillenbrand biography. I found out that Zamperini was indeed punched by most of his fellow soldiers upon orders of the sadistic Sgt. Watanabe (aka 'The Bird'). Zamperini was also forced by Watanabe to hold a beam up, which he did for an extraordinary 37 minutes (although it seems like hours as Jolie frames it). Shooting the whole sequence as if Zamperini was some Christ-on-the-cross figure, was a bit too much! Including Zamperini's trip to Tokyo where he spoke on the radio and later declined to be part of Japanese propaganda broadcasts, was a fascinating digression in contrast to the scenes in the camp, ably highlighting his heroic demeanor.Of the critics who weren't thrilled with aspects of 'Unbroken,' some felt there was wasn't enough character development. Tim Robey writing in 'The Telegraph' bemoaned the exclusive focus on Zamperini: 'But when Louie's self-belief is the only subject on screen, which is gormlessly often, Jolie presses her young lead into a lot of face-pulling, anguished grimaces and screams of violent elation. We are not dragged deeply into either a man's soul or his character.' Joe Walsh said that Jolie, 'focuses too much of what he endured and how he survived such suffering, crafting a lackluster and dull film about an incredibly remarkable man.'Unlike the classic 'Stalag 17,' 'Unbroken' fails to develop any of the characters of Zamperini's fellow prisoners of war. Justin Chang notices this shortcoming, writing in Variety: 'Jolie sensitively conveys the solemn intimacy and tender camaraderie that arise among men at war, but she never captures these soldiers in all their bawdy, rough-and-tumble vigor and rebellious energy; nor does she evoke the fire in Zamperini's belly that made him not just a survivor but a natural-born leader, his instincts and intellect as nimble as his feet.Rodrigo Perez in 'The Playlist' suggests that 'Unbroken' is too long: 'Suffering from pacing and monochromatic tonal issues —various types of drab torture for two hours— 'Unbroken' is also overlong and eventually settles into a slog with little narrative drive.' And Roger Moore in 'Movie Nation,' finds the film derivative: 'But if we've seen the beatings, the maddening stretches of solitary confinement, the war of wills between the stoic serviceman and the sado-homosexual Japanese camp commander in one film, we've seen it in five–pretty much every film from 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' to 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence' to last year's 'The Railway Man.'Lawrence Toppman, writing in the 'Charlotte Observer,' felt there was quite a bit more to Zamperini's story, mainly dealing with his post-war experiences: 'We don't see his alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder after coming home, the decay of his marriage, the vengeful hatred that led him to strangle his captors in his nightmares. Nor do we see his conversion to Christianity after a 1949 Billy Graham crusade in Los Angeles, an event he credited with saving his sanity, marriage and perhaps his life. He was able to forgive his tormentors, even going back to Japan to try to do so in person. Perhaps the filmmakers were afraid his devout faith would consign their movie to the low-attendance ghetto where Christian movies often land.' In the end, 'Unbroken' held my interest. Jolie has more flair for the visual than the narrative, which, unfortunately, focused a bit too much on Zamperini's 'self-belief,' and not other aspects of his character. The supporting players also got short shrift in terms of character development. All in all, 'Unbroken' is worth watching, despite its shortcomings.",6,1,3,19 January 2015
Pitch Perfect," The a capella music is great but the story only serviceable and a trifle too long
","Pitch Perfect is set at the fictional Barden University, featuring the rivalry between an all-male a capella group, 'The Treblemakers' and an all-female group, 'The Barden Bellas'. The protagonist is Beca Mitchell, played by the talented Amy Kendrick. Beca wants to be a DJ and move out to LA, much to the chagrin of her father, who is a professor at Barden. He strikes a deal with Beca, that she must participate in one college activity and if after one year, she doesn't find it fulfilling, he'll finance her trip to the west coast.'Pitch Perfect' is most successful, when the music groups are performing their a capella numbers. The film begins with the introduction of The Treblemakers and The Barden Bellas at the national a capella finals at Lincoln Center in NYC, during the previous semester. Aubrey, the strident co-leader of the Bellas, ruins their chances when she throws up on stage (the workaholic and seemingly in control Aubrey, obviously can't stand the pressure). Act 2 begins nicely when the a capella auditions begin at Barden, each candidate singing parts from Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'. Desperate for members, the Bellas end up selecting a group of odd balls, including Beca, who comes in late for the audition, only to wow the audience by singing a folk-rock tune, with a cup as a percussive accompaniment. There's also 'Fat Amy' (Rebel Wilson from 'Bridesmaids'), Stacie, a self-admitted nymphomaniac, Cynthia-Rose, a lesbian with a gambling problem and Lilly, who sings so softly, no one can hear her (she later is revealed to have talent as a beat boxer).There are a number of scenes in 'Pitch Perfect', where the film's scenarist, Kay Cannon, veers away from the music and bores us with dialogue heavy narrative. A good ten minutes could have been cut from those scenes which involve the initiation of the new members of each a capella group as well as the following scene, some kind of 'mixer', where the boys and the girls get a chance to interact.It's at this point where the love interest begins in earnest, with Beca rejecting the advances of Jesse, who has just been selected to be one of the new members of the Trebelmakers. Jesse initially bores Beca with some dull zombie conversation but eventually woos her by appealing to her romantic, visual nature (first, he hides his face with a set of old record albums; later he convinces her to watch old movies (which is not her thing), especially the 80s film, 'The Breakfast Club'. In the finale, Beca utilizes the 80s hit, 'Don't You (Forget about me), the key song in 'The Breakfast Club', which helps the Bellas win the final competition. The Bellas manage to get by in the regional competition, after one of their competitors, lamely feature Muppets, as part of their performance. The scuffle between the Treblemakers and another group afterward, goes on a little too long, and Beca ends up getting arrested after sticking up for her schoolmates. Jesse also infuriates Beca after he calls her father. The conflict between Beca and Aubrey escalates, as the latter wants her mates to wear the same uniforms and perform the same songs, they've used before.The dark moment of Act 2, occurs when the Bellas lose in the semi-finals. Beca infuriates Aubrey because she did a little improvisation during their final number and quits the group. Beca must do some soul-searching and she finds it watching 'The Breakfast Club'. She's now receptive to her father (no longer rebelling) and agrees to rejoin the Bellas. It should be noted that Cannon's screenplay contains two moments of outright political incorrectness. First there's Beca's dour Korean roommate, who for some reason seems to dislike non-Asians. Then there's the black lead singer of the Footnotes, who's disqualified from the finals because he's not a high school student. This is the reason why the Bellas get a second chance to sing at Lincoln Center in the finals.Meanwhile, there's an additional sub-plot which I failed to mention before. Bumper, the Treblemaker's egotistical lead singer, quits after being offered a gig as a backup singer to John Mayer. That allows, Jesse's quirky roommate, Ben, a magician, to realize his dream of singing for the Treblemakers.The finale isn't very hard to figure out. Beca is appointed the leader of the Bellas and they adopt her new costumes and arrangements. In a rousing face-off, both groups perform magically, but the Bellas have the edge, with Beca leading the way.'Pitch Perfect' is an enjoyable, musical treat, featuring some fantastic a capella arrangements of both contemporary hits as well as classics from an earlier time in the rock/pop era. As for the story, it goes on for about twenty minutes too long and some additional, judicious editing, could have markedly improved the storyline. I would recommend seeing 'Pitch Perfect' and purchasing the soundtrack.",6,0,1,8 August 2013
Looper," Terminator meets Twilight Zone, Season 3, Episode 8
","The near universal critical acclaim for 'Looper' is something I'm having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven't seen a great sci-fi thriller in such a long time, that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, practically calling it a masterpiece! My first problem with 'Looper' is the overall concept. A crime syndicate in the future (2074)wants to dispose of its victims by sending them 30 years back into the past and have them disposed of by hit men, who they pay with bars of silver. Once these hit men (the loopers) live their lives for thirty years, the syndicate decides to dispose of them by sending them back to 2044, where they'll be disposed of, sometimes even by their younger selves.It's explained that in the future bodies are 'tagged' so by sending them back in time, they cannot be traced. But why can't the syndicate send their victims in the present immediately back to 65 million B.C. where they would probably be immediately eaten by a dinosaur or other prehistoric animal, thus preventing the time-line from being tampered with? And by cutting out the middlemen (i.e. the loopers) in this way, the syndicate can keep all the profits for themselves.Once we're introduced to the novelty of the how the looper scheme operates, the novelty soon wears off. We see Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) traveling to the cornfield and then performing executions one too many times. Finally, there's a plot twist: fellow looper Seth appears at Joe's apartment, explaining that his 30 year old self from the future appears in the cornfield and he's unable to finish the job. Abe, the enforcer from the future, forces Joe to betray Seth, who's tortured and his alter ego from the future is hunted down. You might ask what this has to do with time travel or science-fiction. Actually nothing--it's simply all action-thriller at this point in time in the script.Soon, Joe finds himself in the same position as Seth. His 30 year old future self (Bruce Willis) appears but manages to prevent younger Joe from doing him in. In a rather derivative idea borrowed from the 'Terminator' series, Willis must dispose of a child who will one day grow up to be the 'Rainmaker', the sinister figure in the future who is now bent on eliminating all the loopers.It might have been interesting had we seen what this Rainmaker character looked and acted like in the future, but that never occurs. We're asked to be content with meeting little Cid, our future Rainmaker, who has telekinetic powers coupled with a severe anger management problem. One is immediately reminded of Billy Mumy in the Season 3 Twilight Zone episode, 'It's a Good Life', who plays a mutant who terrifies adults by 'wishing them away to the cornfield'. So the second half of 'Looper' feels much more like fantasy-horror than Sci-fi action thriller.The meeting between the younger and older Joes in the diner is perhaps the most interesting scene in the film as it underscores the contrast between the more impulsive younger self with the more seasoned, experienced older one. Unfortunately, there is hardly any additional interaction between the two altar egos, with older Joe stalking off to blow away Abe and his crew of malevolent meanies. In true Bruce Willis fashion, the aging 'Die Hard' legend, is up to his old tricks, by machine-gunning most of the bad guys, sans Kid Blue, who appears out of nowhere on his flying motorcycle and immediately gets himself killed, instead of Joe, who is his intended target.If the Looper second half feels a bit slower than the first, that's because director Rian Johnson spends a little too much time out on the farm, with Joe courting Sara (Emily Blunt). Although there's a feeling that we've seen this before, the ending proves to be passable as we finally have something to feel good about. Younger Joe sacrifices himself, preventing older Joe from killing Sara. He does this after he's able to foresee that Cid, growing up as the Rainmaker, will hold a perpetual grudge due to the murder of his mother and will take it out on all of humanity (including all the loopers) in the future.Unfortunately, Joe's sacrifice, is not enough to make either young Joe or older Joe, likable. Younger Joe, before he takes his own life, is a criminal and a drug addict and older Joe, is responsible for murdering the second child on his list of three potential Rainmakers. In terms of a sympathetic protagonists, there's little to like here at all.'Looper' is also unable to score points with its look at the dystopian future. One feels that one is simply viewing a second hand set from 'Robocop'--in that film, 'Old Detroit' looks remarkably similar to Looper's Kansas City of 2044 including the grimy 'futuristic' cars and emphasis on vagrancy as a national blight.The performances in Looper are all acceptable, with an honorable mention going to little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, who manages to handle a number of complicated lines and take direction in a fashion way above his chronological age.In the end, Looper proves only mildly interesting. While some of the action sequences are entertaining, the sci-fi premise is not developed into something clever enough to deserve all the the accolades that have been heaped upon it to date.",3,266,446,29 September 2012
50_50," No laughs in 'feel good' cancer movie, made worse by thoroughly obnoxious Seth Rogen performance
","50/50 is by Will Reiser, who by his own admission had writer's block until he was stricken with a rare form of spinal cancer. He thought it would be an original idea if he wrote a 'comedy' about a topic he was familiar with. As it turned out, 50/50 (which refers to the protagonist's chances of survival), plays more like a 'dramedy', than a narrative written strictly for laughs.At the outset, a story such as this is going to have difficulties, due to the apparent lack of a strong antagonist. Obviously, Reiser's stand-in for himself, Adam Lerner (played endearingly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) does have that internal arc, where we're curious as to see how he copes with his illness. The external story arc, whether Adam survives the cancer or not, seems to be a foregone conclusion, since not only are many people aware that Reiser survived the cancer (after all he was well enough to write the screenplay) but the whole idea of killing the protagonist off, might have been a little too much for most film goers to take.Unfortunately, the writing takes a decisive wrong turn when Reiser opts to make Adam's girlfriend, Rachael, the 'bad guy'. It's not like Rachael's been married to Adam for years and then decides to abandon him, by having an affair. No, it's quite understandable that a young woman would feel resentful about being placed in the role of a 'caregiver' instead of a 'girlfriend', at such a tender age. What is her great crime? She decides to have that affair and fails to tell Adam about it. And the reason why she fails to tell Adam she's cheating on him is because just as much as she wants out, she also feels extremely guilty about what she's doing and would really like to still help Adam, but can do nothing, as he begins wasting away from the side effects of chemotherapy.Along comes the obnoxious Seth Rogen, who plays Adam's vile buddy, Kyle. Rogen as Kyle, in his holier than thou attitude, throws Rachael under the bus, painting her as a despicable villain, merely because she's acting like most people would in her situation (note that squeaky clean therapist, Katherine, played by Anne Kendrick, only has to see Adam in her office and isn't privy to the extent of Adam's deterioration, as Rachael is). Note that Adam was very kind with Rachael at first, when he tells her that he would understand if she left him. But due to Kyle's unwholesome, negative influence, Kyle cajoles Adam into destroying Rachael's oil painting. What an ugly scene!I understand that it's sometimes important to try and use humor to try and soften an overwhelmingly depressing situation (as in the case of a diagnosis of cancer). But what is so humorous about a 'buddy' such as Kyle, always encouraging his stricken friend, to continue to attempt that one next sexual conquest followed by another. Is this his way of making Adam feel more 'normal'? I hardly believe that Adam needs that kind of encouragement. It will only lead to bad feelings amongst all parties involved! I was reading one cancer survivor's review of 50/50 and he felt the film minimized what it was like to cope with cancer. The poster writes in substance: 'Chemo is an incredibly powerful drug...the longer you're on it, the more cells it continues to destroy, and it basically slowly kills you. I saw the character sick after his first infusion, and then doing quite well throughout the rest of his illness...The opposite is true; you get worse, not more functional, and weaker. Your sex drive plummets...appetite, your sense of taste and smell. None of that was portrayed.' The poster did concede there was a scene where Adam was unsuccessful at sex, after experiencing exhaustion, but on the whole, I do believe he's right. While the film does imply Adam is 'cured' after his surgery, many times the illness comes back in a more virulent form a few years down the road. That's after all the intrusive and debilitating surgery as well as the side effects from chemotherapy.Perhaps the most realistic and true moment in 50/50 is when Adam breaks down inside the car and proclaims, 'I'm tired of it all'. The story devolves into an unlikely and quite sentimental romance between Adam and his therapist, who unethically gets involved with him at film's end. Angelica Huston tries for laughs at the beginning, playing an apparent, overbearing Jewish mother. Later, there are a few better heartfelt exchanges between mother and son.Perhaps the greatest disservice of a film such as 50/50 is how it fails to question the cancer establishment's unbridled faith in treatments such as chemotherapy. The gullibility of a character like Adam is the norm in our society. Instead of exploring alternative options, he fails to ask any questions of his oncologist, and blindly accepts his pronouncements. As it turns out, the practitioner is typical of many physicians today, who doesn't expect you to challenge him, and acts as if he has all the answers. As is usually the case, the chemo treatments turn out to be worse than the disease itself, killing the bad cells as well as the good, and destroying the quality of the patient's life.I found most of 50/50 to be a very unpleasant experience, because it implies there is only one way to treat cancer (chemo, radiation and surgery). While Gordon-Levitt does his best in a difficult part, Seth Rogen has proved to have worn out his welcome as a serious actor and should be relegated to roles on bad TV sitcoms—where hopefully he will disappear from the entertainment scene, sooner than later!",3,17,40,25 January 2012
Easy A," Easy 'A' is really an Easy 'D'
","'Easy A' was written by a first-time screenwriter, Bert V. Royal, and it shows! It's not his fault that most of the actors who play the high school students at 'Ojai North High School' (including the 22 year old star, Emma Stone) are too old for their parts. Director Will Gluck and his casting director must take the blame entirely for that. Royal, on the other hand, has proffered up a script featuring a fairly unsympathetic protagonist, pitted against an assortment of noxious antagonists, most of whom are pure stereotypes.Mr. Royal has really found the formula for making a quick buck in the film industry. Simply come up with a story about shallow teenagers who attend a high school. Royal reportedly concocted this smug tale in five days and it shows. His protagonist, Olive Penderghast, is an insecure teen who initially doesn't want to let her best friend Rhiannon know that she's a virgin, so she concocts a tall tale of a weekend liaison with a guy at a local community college. Marianne, daughter of a Christian minister and campus gossip, overhears Olive's fictitious claim and then spreads the word that Olive is a slut and soon enough most of the kids at school turn against her.At first, Olive appears sympathetic, as she is willing to help Brandon, an insecure gay kid who hopes to gain acceptance from his peers by pretending that he's straight. Olive helps him accomplish this by agreeing to simulate a sexual encounter with him, behind closed doors at a party thrown by the 'most popular' teen at the school. But then Olive decides to embrace her notoriety by accepting gift cards from nerds who ask her to vouch that she's had some kind of sexual contact with them.Since the student body is basically depicted as a bunch of nasty, back-stabbing gossips, Olive is unable to withdraw from the collective condemnation and perhaps seek support from a more sensitive, intellectual type of student. Even the cool English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) fails to help her. In a completely awkward scene, a student calls Olive an 'abominable tramp', likening her to Hester Prynne from Hawthorne's 'Scarlet Letter'. For some reason, however, Olive ends up in Principal Gibbon's (Malcolm McDowell) office after calling her an abominable 'twat'. I found it a bit unbelievable that a student would have to go to detention for merely calling another student a 'twat', especially after her rival started the whole thing; in addition, other students who have been actually physically assaulting one another, seem to receive an equal punishment . Actually it's never explained who actually sends Olive to the principal's office (why didn't sensitive Mr. Griffith try and defuse the situation?) and Malcolm McDowell, is also unbelievable as a surly martinet who cuts the kids no slack whatsoever.What's worse is that we're asked to root for Olive after she begins accepting the gift cards. By doing so, ultimately she bears the responsibility for compounding her negative reputation on campus and no one seems to point that out to her. Why does she act so surprised that one date almost takes things too far? Why also root for her when all the misguided males (sans good guy Todd) have no redeeming qualities? Also ask yourself whether you find it funny that these insecure males (en masse) would offer gifts to a woman who has such a dubious reputation. Is it really worth it to them, to have her vouch for them? In reality, having sexual contact with such an outcast as Olive, would probably lead to scorn from their peers--not approbation! So the whole idea that these nerds would shower gifts on Olive makes little sense!Olive is allowed to indulge in her negative, acting-out behavior since she's depicted as a total victim of a gossip-ridden society. Even if you believe that most people are like that, at least give your opponents their due: even the unprincipled have something of a likability factor! Not here! In addition to the insecure males, Christians also get short shrift here too. I have no objection to criticizing or making fun of those of the Christian faith but at least create some real life characters to shoot down. Here the Christians are narrow-minded bigots, buffoons, easily disposed of since they are completely one-dimensional. Even educators can't catch a break. Lisa Kudrow's Mrs. Griffith is perhaps the most unpleasant character in 'Easy A', having sex with one of the students and another one of those unlikeable individuals who have no guilt feelings about throwing Olive under the bus. Only Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, who play Olive's over the top 'New Age' parents, manage to eke out a few laughs by taking permissive parenting to one big extreme.'Easy A' ends awkwardly as it begins. Somehow, Olive's bombastic musical production in the high school gym and a one last 'heart-felt' web cast manages to convince the surly high school population that she's not so bad after all, turning everything around. And she finds 'true love' to boot with that one 'sensitive' guy who respects her decision not to give away her virginity right away. Despite the poor script, the acting and direction in 'Easy A' is spot on and the film has some nifty cinematography. If you can stand all the implausibilities and lack of 'ideas', you might find all this somewhat entertaining. For more discerning eyes, the most predictable thing here is that the critics were once again taken in by all the tripe. Hopefully, a few of us will pray for their misguided souls!",3,3,5,20 August 2011
Green Book," Guilty white liberal critics can't stomach this true feel-good race relations story set in the early 60s Civil Rights era
","A fair number of film critics have argued that Peter Farrelly's Green Book, his new dramedy set in the early civil rights era of the 60s, is designed to make its chiefly white audience, 'feel better about racism.' Such a specious argument has it that the film promulgates the false notion that the racial tensions of today can be ignored (or even denied) primarily by white liberals by watching this optimistic tale of bonding between a gay black musician and Italian salt of the earth bouncer.
Some of these critics go further when they insist that the deck is stacked in favor of the protagonist Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), the gruff driver whom Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) hires to ensure that his concert tour of the deep South goes smoothly. Tony does so much more for Dr. Shirley, that some critics maintain that primary screenwriter Nick Vallelonga (Tony's real-life son) has turned his father into a 'white savior.'
Nothing actually can be further from the truth. Tony benefits from Dr. Shirley's influence just as much as Dr. Shirley from his. Their relationship is symbiotic. Both represent a fish out of water-Tony is exposed to Dr. Shirley's rarefied, world of culture while the sophisticated musician is forced by Tony to become more spontaneous, dealing with all the attendant street characters that challenge his ordered vision of the world.
What rankles many of these critics is that Dr. Shirley doesn't conform to their stereotyped image of what a black man should be. He's the opposite of 'street culture,' having grown up in a white world and trained as a classical musician. What's more he's gay and looks down on other blacks whom he regards as uncultured and uncouth. Indeed his decision to travel through the deep south as a goodwill ambassador marks this unusual man as courageous as he's forced to endure constant humiliation by a coterie of racists at every turn.
It's Dr. Shirley who forces Tony to re-evaluate his deep-set beliefs about race. When we first meet Tony, he looks down on black people so much that he places two drinking glasses in the garbage after he spies the two African-American plumbers at his house, drinking out of them. Tony eventually comes to realize that his employer doesn't fit his stereotyped view of blacks; how can it be that Dr. Shirley never eats fried chicken?
The comic scene where Tony persuades Dr. Shirley to eat the chicken is the beginning of Tony's reevaluation of his racism. Meanwhile, Dr. Shirley must effect an attitude re-adjustment of his own, eating the chicken with his fingers, manners which he initially regards as beneath him.
Other critics also feel that the screenwriters are much harder on Dr. Shirley than Tony. Where Dr. Shirley plays Cyrano, teaching Tony better manners on how to write proper love letters to his wife, Dr. Shirley is depicted with much more self-destructive traits-he has one too many drinks and finds himself surrounded by racists at a bar, finally rescued by Tony in the nick of time.
Both Tony and Dr. Shirley are social outcasts however; both have trouble controlling their temper and in this respect they're very similar. Tony ends up punching a police officer in the face over an ethnic insult and Dr. Shirley has to be stopped by Tony from attacking the maÃ®tre d who won't allow him to eat dinner with whites.
Perhaps the greatest scene in the film is when Tony and Dr. Shirley stop their car on the way to North Carolina and spy a group of black sharecroppers toiling away in the fields. This is where they both realize they have much more in common than the sharecroppers, who live a life of virtual indentured servitude.
At that moment Tony and Dr. Shirley can appreciate their freedom. It's a moment of epiphany for all characters concerned-the expression of wonderment on the faces of the sharecroppers whom have never seen an independent, 'free' black man before; Dr. Shirley's realization of the true nature of the oppression of his people and Tony's appreciation of Dr. Shirley's sensitivity toward other blacks, whom perhaps in the past he would never have payed attention to.
The liberation of both Tony and Dr. Shirley is illustrated in the denouement. Dr. Shirley is able to 'let loose,' playing blues music at an African-American bar and Tony admonishes his relatives for speaking poorly of black people at the dinner table.
Ali shows his versatility as Dr. Shirley, playing the upper crust musician (in contrast to his street tough role in Moonlight) and Viggo Mortensen (gaining about 40 lbs. for the role), shows off his acting chops as the gruff Italian. Kudos also to director Peter Farrelly, usually known for low light comedies, but in this case venturing forward into much more rewarding territory.
Green Book is nothing more than a feel-good story about race relations based on a true story. For those who can't stomach such a note of optimism in the face of a disappointing historical legacy, shame on them!",8,9,18,19 December 2018
Pineapple Express," I'd rather watch Beavis & Butthead!
","Seth Rogen is the type of actor who simply plays himself. In 'Knocked Up', there was a positive arc to the story where he plays a loser who must take on adult responsibilities and eventually grow up. In 'Pineapple Express', he remains a loser and we can never believe in his journey since he's pitted against a bunch of unlikeable, unsavory comic book characters. Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server, who witnesses a murder by a drug dealer and then must elude the drug dealer's hired killers who are out to get him. His buddy marijuana dealer, Saul Silver, joins him as they elude the hit men. Right away you see how dumb the movie is when Denton is able to witness a murder which occurs inside a house in full view of anyone walking on the street. Another ridiculous moment occurs when Saul's marijuana supplier is shot point blank in the stomach but manages to survive and then is strong enough to drive Denton to the drug dealer's lair. Of course those who wrote the movie undoubtedly will argue that the situations are supposed to be over the top and that's the humor of it. But there comes a point where there are so many scenes that are so ridiculous that one simply doesn't care about the characters anymore. Rogen and Franco do their Beavis and Butthead impersonations but their humor has no subtlety and relies mainly on slapstick to get by. There's a romantic subplot involving Denton's relationship with a girl who's a high school student but that fizzles completely especially at the end when the screenwriters forgot to tell us what happened between the two. While this is supposed to be a somewhat good-natured farce about two guys who share a mutual love for marijuana, there's a lot of unnecessary violence with drug dealers killing one another during the finale. The ending undercuts the more good-natured scenes between the film's two protagonists. If you check out the IMDb graph as to the age groups who liked this film, you will see that the older you are, you are less likely to like it. I feel certain that within five years, Seth Rogen will be a forgotten name within the movie industry unless he stops writing and acting in films such as this.",1,103,192,28 August 2008
Inside Llewyn Davis," Some great atmosphere, but story of clueless, narcissistic folk singer, really isn't worth telling
","The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark side of Americana; applaud us.' The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic, like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life. But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be immortalized in film? I hardly think so. The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's internal demon— which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead, we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in the folk music world of the early 60s. Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide; he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately, sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in Greenwich Village.Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional' critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful reviews in the review section of IMDb. There, at least, is a sense that Llewyn Davis is not a believable character and if by chance, such misanthropes truly exist in real life, their journeys are certainly not worth being looked at, given the lack of change or growth. If you like a straw man, Llewyn Davis is for you. The Coen brothers are experts at shooting straw men down--but such a maneuver should never bring praise and accolades; that's reserved only for the gullible!",4,26,42,17 January 2014
Spectre," Some good action sequences but in the age of ISIS, the 007 franchise has become irrelevant
","It's standard fare time again for 007. As usual, poker-faced muscle man Daniel Craig acquits himself nicely as James Bond in the stunts department but oh do we miss the wit of Sean Connery. 'Spectre' is the 24th installment in the franchise and like its predecessors, there is no deviation from the formula (which of course includes the Bond girls, Q's gadgets, multiple chase scenes and a dastardly villain). The trick of course is for the scenarists to improve upon the formula just a tad—a curve ball of sorts, if you will. Sadly once again, there is a dearth of really original, creative ideas, to make this entry stand out in the Bond pantheon.Occasionally, the film does deliver the goods and that's why we'll still pay a few bucks to see it. Most impressive is the opening sequence shot in Mexico City at the most colorful 'Day of the Dead' festival. Bond ends up assassinating a coterie of bad guys but must fend off being swallowed up by a crumbling building after a spectacular implosion. The subsequent chase and fight inside a tottering helicopter is just what the doctor ordered and I was ready for more derring-do Bond exploits.We then learn that Bond is threatened from a completely different source. Back at headquarters, MI5 and MI6 have been merged forming a privately backed joint intelligence service. The new head 'C' wants to eliminate the 007 program entirely with 'M', Bond's boss, powerless to prevent the shortsighted plan from coming to fruition.Meanwhile, Bond travels to Rome despite being grounded by 'M' for his unauthorized actions in Mexico City. He looks up Lucia (played by 50- year-old Monica Bellucci, the oldest Bond 'girl' ever), the widow of one of the men Bond killed earlier, who tells him about Spectre, the international criminal organization at the center of the 007 plot. I had a hard time believing that Bond would just walk into a meeting where he could be so easily discovered. Worse yet was the nature of the Spectre organization with its assemblage of bad guys who reminded me more of an odd collection of diplomats from the General Assembly at the United Nations than modern day terrorists. Clearly the villains here were more reminiscent of the kind one would find in a Bond movie from 1965—despite the group's modern-day grab for world dominance via worldwide linked internet surveillance.At the meeting we're also introduced to Mr. Hinx, the assassin who plucks out the eyeballs of a rival assassin in front of a disbelieving group of Spectre villains. Hinx is 2015's equivalent of Oddjob, far more charming in the antediluvian 'Goldfinger.' Unfortunately there is nothing to distinguish Hinx from the odd lot of prior Bond enforcer/assassins. He's involved with Bond in a rather perfunctory car chase and later a more impressive fistfight on a train (was director Sam Mendez's decision not to actually show Hinx being asphyxiated a budgetary consideration?). Despite the big fight on the train (where Hinx pops up out of nowhere) and Bond surviving a neat crash in a prop plane, the journey to Spectre headquarters, is a long and tortured one. First there is Bond's encounter with Mr. White and then the long-winded meeting with his daughter, Dr. Madeline (played by the much younger Léa Seydoux), who brings Bond to the L'Americain hotel in Morocco where they finally find out the location of the arch-villain Oberhauser (aka Blofeld).The rather idiotic scene where Oberhauser goes to great lengths to drill two needles into Bond's brain to turn him into a vegetable and Bond's subsequent, incredible escape is just another reason we can never take any of these Bond pictures seriously. Although I did like just how spectacularly the production team staged the blowup of the Spectre complex.The Spectre denouement was again really nothing new. Particularly disappointing was Q's role—stopping the 'ticking clock' of Spectre's surveillance system by simply hacking into a computer and overcoming its encryption codes. There were also no surprises when 'C' gets his comeuppance and Bond saves the girl before another building implodes. I had no objection to the final helicopter crash and the detention of Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz has settled well into providing us with a one-size-fits-all stock villain, for most of the films in which he appears).If this is Daniel Craig's swan song, one must congratulate him for his physical prowess—I still wish he could have exuded a little more humor in the role. As for 'M', Ralph Fiennes is serviceable enough but can't hold a candle to Judi Dench. Finally, may I argue that Naomie Harris is more than fine in the role of Moneypenny and should be retained, even if Daniel Craig is replaced.In the age of ISIS, organizations like Spectre hardly seem scary or believable at all. For the next James Bond, I call on the screenwriters to make things a little more believable—that way the franchise may be able to cast off the moniker of irrelevancy.",6,1,7,11 November 2015
Joy," Russell's quirky family members are hit or miss, but rags to riches tale of QVC entrepreneur, is riveting
","If you liked David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook,' then you'll like 'Joy' even more. Both have their share of quirky working-class misfits but unlike 'Silver,' Joy is based on a true story. Russell is on much firmer ground here in his half-fact, half-fictional chronicle of Joy Mangano, inventor of the 'Miracle Mop,' who parlayed a simple but clever household item into a multi-million dollar fortune.Since little is known about Joy's personal life, Russell conjured up his own take on what Joy's family might have been like. Joy did have an ex-husband Tony, who lived in the basement of the family home even after they were divorced. Russell imagines Tony as a failed nightclub singer and his fictional take works well, as the character adds to the necessary comic relief. Slightly less successful is Russell's portrait of Joy's mother who is addicted to soap operas. Russell reproduces the soaps in a series of flashbacks, beginning with a black and white show from the 1950s. The joke wears thin after a while and the mother never rises above the level of caricature (the mother's attraction to a Haitian plumber doesn't really go anywhere either).Joy receives emotional support from her father Rudy, who owns a failing auto body repair shop in the neighborhood. Robert De Niro plays the father as an over the top, irascible curmudgeon who ends up moving into Joy's house after breaking up with a girlfriend. De Niro shows off his usual shtick coping with a significant anger management problem and here often battles things out with ex-husband Tony. Diane Ladd is entrusted with narrator duties as the supportive grandmother who believes that Joy is one day destined to consummate her rags to riches daydreams.Peggy, the half-sister, seeks to upstage Joy whenever she gets the chance. Peggy is the only character whom Russell invented completely out of whole cloth and doesn't work well at all, as there's really nothing redeeming about her.Things really begin to pick up after the introduction of the quirky family members. Rudy begins dating Trudy (artfully played by Isabella Rossellini), an Italian widow who bankrolls Joy's dream with an inheritance courtesy her late husband, a successful businessman. In fact, it's on Trudy's small yacht, that Joy comes up with the idea for the Miracle Mop, after she must swab the deck following an accident involving red wine.Joy (the movie and the character) becomes more and more interesting as Tony is able to have her meet with someone who works for QVC, the fledgling cable TV channel that turns Joy into a star. Joy gets to meet the go-getter QVC executive Neil Walker (played pretty straight this time by Bradley Cooper), who proceeds to sabotage Joy's quest for success by having one of his TV sales agent's blow the presentation for the Miracle Mop on live TV. Having convinced Joy to manufacture 50,000 mops anticipating a successful broadcast, Walker finally gives Joy another chance and she becomes a big success after doing the presentation herself on TV. You would think that this would be the end of the story, but happily it isn't! Russell knows he needs a dark moment at the end of Act II and for his protagonist to accomplish what she set out to do at the beginning of the narrative. Joy must do battle with the manufacturer in California who has been unfairly raising his prices and throwing her for a loss. In the best scene in the film, Joy discovers that the company has been using her design illegally but ends up being arrested for trespassing. Back home, Trudy's lawyer advises her that she must file for bankruptcy after Peggy signs an agreement with the manufacturer without Joy's knowledge. Joy moves past her darkest moment and travels to Texas where she confronts the owner responsible for cheating her and gets him to sign an agreement, paying her back all her royalties plus interest.What makes Joy so interesting is that she must overcome three major obstacles before claiming victory: pitching the Miracle Mop on her own; uncovering the misappropriation of her design by the manufacturer; and successfully negotiating a contract with the manufacturer's owner after discovering he has committed fraud. Just when it appears she's successful, a whole new set of obstacles appear which she must overcome, before declaring her 'final victory.'The first third of Joy is hit or miss—but once Joy's own story begins in earnest, the viewer is hooked. Joy's rag to riches story is 'feel good' just about all the way. The success story of this talented woman should only be tempered by the fact that part of her success was due to the intervention of someone who inherited quite a bit of money. There are plenty of other 'Joys' out there with talent that only need a 'connection' to bankroll them. In this case, luck (in part) was on Joy's side.",7,1,9,5 January 2016
Her," 'Rohmer' meets 'Asimov' as 'man meets his operating system', in a semi-plausible, not-too-distant future
","Spike Jonze's 'Her' has a touch of Asimov-inspired sci-fi but it's much more 'rom-com' overall. Set in the not so distant future, what I like about Jonze's vision is that it's quite plausible. There are no flying cars or aliens walking around but rather people even more addicted to their computers. The protagonist is Theodore Twombly (nicely played by a low key Joaquin Phoenix) who works as a copywriter of intimate correspondence for people unable to compose original tomes themselves. Twombly purchases the latest computer operating system (OS) infused with artificial intelligence. He assigns a female voice to his 'companion' who initially is designed to organize his day. But soon the artificial companion names herself 'Samantha' and proves to be quite engaging, becoming Twombly's confidante and 'lover' of sorts. Twombly in turns falls completely for his virtual girlfriend, and finds himself reacting less with human companions.'Her' really is a robot without any corporeality. Normally, this would be a distraction since having only one person interacting with a voice-over does not work very well visually in a film. However, the dialogue that Jonze has written for Samantha is excellent and it's delivered impeccably by Scarlet Johannson (interestingly enough, the film was originally shot using actress Samantha Morton's voice but Jonze decided Johansson was far more effective in the role).Although Jonze's idea of an operating system suffused with artificial intelligence is a clever one, it becomes apparent that the premise itself cannot carry an entire movie. Instead, the artificial relationship between Twombly and Samantha evolves into a satirical peek at how a relationship between two humans rises and falls. At first Samantha is completely supportive as Twombly confides in her about his impending divorce to his wife, Catherine, as well as going out on a failed date with an attractive woman he meets online. Later, they have a verbal sexual encounter and soon Samantha suggests utilizing an actual human surrogate to enhance their relationship. Twombly is unable to pretend with a stranger (Isbabella) who attempts to make love to him as Samantha whispers in his ear. Twombly begins to have his doubts about continuing with Samantha but his good friend Amy, encourages him to try and make a go of it, as she also has broken up with her husband and is now also interacting with another OS with artificial intelligence.The relationship between Twombly and Samantha has a real ring of truth to it and reminds me of some of French director Eric Rohmer's films that dissect the complex relationships between men and women. Like Rohmer's artful narratives, some may find Jonze's dissection to be a tad bit lugubrious but for those who are patient, epiphanies can be uncovered, if one cares to look for them. There is also some tension in Jonze's plot, as we're also still waiting to find out how Jonze resolves his tale between man and machine. The ending is a comic one when Samantha reveals that she's met another operating system based on the mind of a famous physicist, who she falls for. Before you know it, Samantha admits to Twombly that she's been talking with 8,316 others, of whom she has fallen in love with 641.Samantha has no choice but to 'move on', leaving Twombly and Amy to commiserate with one another. The ending should be considered a relatively happy one in that Twombly has been apparently cured of his artificial intelligence infatuation and will probably be spending more time with humans in the foreseeable future. This could have been a much more dark, 'hit you over the head' type of film, with Jonze pointing out the dangers of modern day man being seduced by ever improving technology. Fortunately, he refuses to take such a route and opts for verisimilitude. Even an OS (echoing her human counterpart), is not adverse to embracing 'change'.Ultimately, Jonze's initial premise of an artificial being evolving into something a lot more human, is really a one note idea. It's the relationship that develops between the two principals that hooks us to the end. Phoenix is really playing the 'straight man' here and it's Johannson, with her changing moods, that gives the film its broad flavor. As mentioned before, the compelling dialogue compensates for the lack of visual impact, when Phoenix and Johannson interact.Something still must be said for the cinematography which creates a vision of the future which is not that much different than today. Jonze's 'Her' indeed is a cautionary tale but with the sagacious Samantha, there appears to be hope for humanity. Ironically, humans here don't take the lead; it's the machines—I feel sure that Samantha will ultimately end up with her 'equal', leaving humans to fend for themselves.",7,0,2,27 June 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Cheesy Bollywood-like Production Still Entertains!
","Slumdog Millionaire chronicles the odyssey of Jamal Malik from the slums of Bombay to now modern Mumbai. The film's framing device is Malik's attempt to win the Hindi version of 'Who wants to be a Millionaire'. He ends up answering each question correctly and a day before he attempts to answer the final question for the grand prize, he's whisked away by the police on suspicion of fraud. The police want to know how a kid from the slums could possibly answer all those questions correctly. As they question him (sometimes using torture at first), the viewer is treated to a series of flashbacks which explains how he's able to successfully answer each question.The first half of the movie (the much better part) involves Malik first as a young child (of about five) and later at about the age of 10 (played by two different child actors). Malik's older brother, Salim, is the more aggressive of the two, in contrast to the sensitive younger brother. We see how they are orphaned at an early age when their mother is killed during a riot where Hindus attack Muslims. The children must fend for themselves in the slums of Bombay and there are many memorable and shocking scenes that chronicle their tactics of survival. One indelible scene involves Malik securing an autograph from a famous Indian singer who is on a publicity tour in the area. Malik extricates himself from inside a locked latrine and appears at the autograph signing covered head to toe in human excrement. Eventually Malik and Salim are lured by a gang of criminals who end up training them to become professional beggars. The gang goes so far as to increasing their profits by blinding certain children who have sweet singing voices. The blind children are used by the criminals to manipulate unsuspecting tourists who feel sorry for the now handicapped children. Salim alerts Malik to the gang's nefarious plan and they escape along with another child, Latika who Malik falls in love with.At the midpoint of the film, with Salim now a young teenager, he takes revenge on head of the gang who almost blinded Malik by shooting him to death. But Salim incurs Malik's enmity by raping Latika. Flash forward to the present as we find Malik working at a menial job as a gopher at a large international customer service company. Malik eventually locates Salim who is now working for the boss of Mumbai's biggest crime syndicate. And he finds out that Latika is basically an indentured servant in the boss's mansion. In the film's climax, the police release Malik who goes on to answer the final question correctly and hooks back up with Latika who escapes the crime boss's lair (with the help of Salim, who, in a final act of contrition, sacrifices himself by murdering the crime boss and in turn is killed by the boss's bodyguards). Slumdog Millionaire has a lot going for it. It's highly entertaining and features some great performances (especially by the child actors in the first half). Dev Patel as Malik is also excellent as the low-key hero who eventually gets the girl. The passionate conflict between the two brothers adds to the verisimilitude of the story.Slumdog is really designed to be a gritty fairy tale. But even fairy tales must have some kind of internal logic. The weakest part of the story for me was the whole idea that the producer of the 'Millionaire' show was some kind of crook who wanted to fix things so Malik would lose. And was it at all believable, that Malik, who had become a national hero, would suddenly be brought in by the police and tortured merely because they could not believe a kid from the slums could answer such the tough questions on the show? In reality, the police would never have chanced abducting Malik while the show was going on and risk losing their jobs due to possible adverse press coverage. And why would the producer of the show want Malik to lose? If he wins, the producer's ratings go much higher and he makes more money.Slumdog also stumbles by becoming a Bollywood production in the second half. The villain in the first half, the child exploiter is much more believable and menacing than the crime syndicate boss in the second half. And Latika is wholly an underdeveloped character—she has nothing much to do except being the love object of Malik.I'm not sure if Slumdog Millionaire deserves to be nominated for an Academy best picture. But as a solid piece of entertainment, it will keep you riveted in your seat.",6,3,6,27 November 2008
The Nice Guys," Uneasy mix of comic non-sequiturs and violent noir proves tiresome
","Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys stars a rather bloated and unkempt looking Russell Crowe as Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer who plays opposite Ryan Gosling as Holland March, an alcoholic private detective. March is hired by an old lady, Mrs. Glenn, who insists she saw her porn actress niece Misty, through the window of an apartment, despite the fact that Misty was killed in a car accident two days before. March gets on the trail of a mysterious young female, Amelia, who might be involved in Misty's disappearance. Healey is hired by Amelia to prevent March from finding her so he goes over to his house and beats him up. After Healey and March's initial dust-up, Healey is attacked by two thugs who are looking for Amelia. After fending them off, Healey joins forces with March to look for the missing instigator. While The Nice Guys is designed as a gritty film noir, it also unhappily features the comic machinations of the two principals whose dialogue is loaded with a series of non-sequiturs. If this is your cup of tea, then you'lli probably like The Nice Guys but I found Crowe and Gosling's comic interplay to be repetitious and grating.The rest of The Nice Guys plot is a bit convoluted to say the least. March, while in an alcoholic stupor, takes a pratfall over the railing in the back of a mansion where a party is going on, and ends up finding the corpse of Sid Shattuck, a porn producer who was involved with Amelia. Meanwhile, March's 12 year old daughter, Holly, is kidnapped by 'Blue Face,' one of the two thugs who attempted to kill Healey earlier. Holly prevents Blue Face from killing Amelia while inside the car and manages to escape and flee with Amelia. Surprisingly Blue Face is seriously injured by a hit and run driver. Before strangling him to death, Blue Face tells Healey that a notorious hit man, John Boy, has been hired to take out Amelia.Also in the mix is Amelia's mother Judith (Kim Bassinger), a high- ranking Justice Department official who describes her daughter as unstable to both Healey and March. When the intrepid investigators bring Amelia back to March's house, they can't decide whether her tale of Detroit automaker collusion attempting to circumvent auto exhaust emission standards and her mother's involvement with them is true or whether Amelia is simply a spoiled brat with grand conspiracy theories. The ranting Amelia proves to be one of the more interesting characters in the film with a personality that appears to represent a satire on the over the top, leftist anti-government young people of today.In addition to Crowe and Gosling's failed comedy routine, The Nice Guys takes an even further turn for the worse by confirming Amelia's story that her mother Judith indeed colluded with the Detroit automakers. Judith sends her assistant, Tally, to divert Healey and March by giving them a briefcase to deliver that is supposedly filled with $100,000 cash, but actually contains shredded magazines. Meanwhile, in the most unpleasant scene in the movie, John Boy ends up killing Amelia.Healey and March finally figure out that the near-sighted Mrs. Glenn actually saw her niece in a movie that was being projected inside that apartment. It turns out that Amelia spliced in evidence of the Detroit automakers collusion into a film scheduled to be projected at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It's there that Healey and March engage in a wild shootout with the bad guys, one of whom dies and the other two apprehended.The Nice Guys disappoints grandly with the stereotyped depiction of Judith, the scheming Justice Department official, who is willing to sacrifice her daughter for the good of the American economy. I don't buy it in the least and you shouldn't either. With its uneasy mix of comedy and noir realism, The Nice Guys ends up trying to have it both ways. The killing of Amelia undercuts the comedy by introducing a tragic element too overbearing for a seemingly light-heartedly designed vehicle.",4,1,4,25 August 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Spectacularly choreographed action scenes and production design can't save script which features one big chase after another
","Australian writer/director George Miller, who gave us a trilogy of Mad Max dystopian thrillers from 1979 through 1985, is back with his new incarnation: 'Fury Road.' For those who love sci-fi and action blended together, 'Max' should be your thing. Miller's post-apocalyptic world takes place out in the desert where a group of mutants are lorded over by one Immortan Joe, a king worshiped as a god by his subjects, who sports a mask that resembles a human skull. His warriors look like modern-day skinheads and there's also a grand coterie of Joe's subjects, akin to medieval peasants, Joe controls the water supply at his fortress called 'The Citadel' and also owns a small harem of sex-slaves he maintains for breeding purposes (these women appear to be the only healthy ones in the realm).The protagonist is Max Rockatansky, now played by Tom Hardy of Inception fame. Rocktansky is captured by the skinheads and makes a futile attempt to escape from the Citadel early on. The character with the bigger part for a while is Imperator Furiosa played by an enervated Charlize Theron. Furiosa moves things into Act 2 when she kidnaps Joe's concubines and drives in a souped up tanker truck headed for the mythic 'Green Place,' which supposedly is some kind of aqua-infused paradise. Joe's minions give chase in a crazy assortment of different vehicles, all patched up from parts remaining after the Apocalypse.We don't hear much from Max since his face is hidden by a steel mask and he's strapped to one of those weird vehicles which is chasing Furiosa. After a series of spectacular chases and crashes, Max finally gets free of his captors (but still must have Furiosa assist him in cutting a chain that binds him to one of the skinheads (Nux) who ironically joins Furiosa and her group after deciding there's great glory working for the rebels than bad guy Joe. The long continuous chase to capture Furiosa temporarily slows down when the good guys must navigate their way through a canyon controlled by hostile forces. After successfully breaking through the canyon blockade, Furiosa finds an old woman who belongs to the Vuvalini, the clan which Furiosa was kidnapped from as a child. Wouldn't you know it but the old woman makes it clear that the 'Green Place' is indeed a myth so what are the good guys to do?The plan is to finish off Joe's forces on the way back to the Citadel (which they successfully accomplish) and then kill the king and gain control of the water supply, much to the peasantry's delight. This of course allows Mr. Miller to stage another big chase scene, just as spectacular as the one in the first half.That's basically it. 'Fury Road' is nothing more than one big chase scene after another. After a while, the whole thing just gets a little tiresome. One can admire the production design and how the chase scenes are choreographed—but the script is so paper thin, that the best rating I can muster here is 5 out of 10. Sorry!",5,0,1,9 January 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Overly pious Gibson still delivers war as gripping spectacle with calculated verisimilitude
","After ten long years, Mel Gibson is back in the director's seat. Certainly he needed some kind of self-reclamation project given the debacle a decade ago involving some drunk driving and words overheard by an arresting officer that were deemed anti-Semitic. Gibson might be a little like German director Leni Riefenstahl, who for years asked when the statute of limitations would run out on her collaboration as a documentary filmmaker with the Nazis.Gibson somehow needed a project that would ameliorate the notion of his past narratives infused with hyper-violent tendencies. He perhaps found it in his choice of Desmond Doss, the Army medic awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery during World War II, despite also refusing to pick up a rifle during combat. Ben Croll writing in IndieWire grasps the paradox—he finds that Hacksaw Ridge is 'a movie venerating pacifism, made by a man pathologically beguiled by violence.'Gibson however provides a rather chaste back story for his pacifist protagonist, chronicling a childhood replete with an abusive father and an incident which leads to his embrace of non-violence when he almost kills his brother during a fistfight (encouraged by the father). After saving a man hit by a truck, Doss (Andrew Garfield) meets nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) at the hospital in his home town of Lynchburg, Virginia (Gibson filmed most of this on location in Australia). There's a series of rather perfunctory courtship scenes finally leading to Doss' decision to join the Army.The action picks up as Doss must endure basic training where he is harassed by his fellow soldiers who don't respect his Seventh Day Adventist pacifist beliefs. He also is singled out by the company drill sergeant who makes an example of him in front of the troops. When he is finally court-martialed for insubordination (failing to obey orders to pick up a rifle), there's a rather unconvincing scene where his father obtains a letter from a brigadier general with whom he fought in World War I, and presents it to the commanding officer at the court martial which leads to all charges being dropped.Gibson's talents, however, are on display in the combat scenes at the battle for Okinawa. The soldiers are forced to climb up the Maeda Escarpment (also known as Hacksaw Ridge), where they come up against scores of Japanese troops, mostly hidden in caves. Gibson proves to be a master at choreographing the battle, which depicts massive losses of life on both sides.Doss' heroic achievement is highlighted as he climbs back up to the main battlefield and drags wounded soldiers to the edge of the cliff and lowers them down using cleverly knotted ropes. All the while, the Japanese are a short distance away about to pounce. Doss eventually is wounded himself and just makes it back down to join his already decimated unit.Despite being highly entertaining, the film exhibits what Christopher Gray writing in Slant Magazine, perceives as an overly pious stance here: 'The eponymous 350-foot high ridge itself is a resonant image of Desmond's ascension, and Gibson finds more opportunities to place him in baptismal and Christ-like poses. It's all deeply silly and occasionally risible, but it's also undeniably canny, a throwback entertainment that somehow successfully integrates a lofty sense of piety with an unyielding taste for bloodlust.'Jessica Kiang writing in The Playlist is even more critical of Gibson whom she perceives as a tad bit self-righteous: 'But this tale of real-life heroism seems less a celebration of humanist convictions than a glorification of religious intransigence and a declaration of the moral superiority of the faithful over the faithless.'Has Gibson redeemed himself for his own past personal sins? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. The piousness is still there as well as the aforementioned 'taste for bloodlust.' Nonetheless this is a director who is still quite talented and can draw the viewer in by depicting war as spectacle with a calculated verisimilitude.",7,1,4,16 April 2017
The Social Network," Sorkin serves up respectable biography of computer generation's 'Citizen Kane'
","Aaron's Sorkin's screenplay, based on the 2009 non-fiction book 'The Accidental Billionaires', attempts to turn Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, into the 'Citizen Kane' of the computer generation. Like 'Kane', it's the chronicle of the rise of a boy genius to the heights of power, who is a dogged by a character flaw. The question in both films is whether each of the protagonists truly has an 'Achilles heel' that tarnishes their legacy or is it some sort of unconscious jealousy on the part of the films' scenarists who seek to drag these boy wonders down from their high perch in order to take them down a peg or two in the public eye? As an only occasional user of Facebook, I hold no implicit disdain for the social networking site that Mark Zuckerberg created. I've noticed that some internet posters hate Facebook so much that they refuse to be objective about the film. If they were honest, they would recognize that the material the film is based on, is difficult to make into a compelling film. 'The Social Network' IS dry material and veteran director David Fincher has managed to turn this story into something that moves along at a fairly brisk pace. I also wonder why some posters find the subject matter, not to be worthy enough to be made into a feature length film. Certainly the way in which Zuckerberg rises to the top as the world's youngest billionaire, to my mind, is a compelling enough subject to merit the attention of the average film goer.Sorkin's technique is to tell Zuckerberg's story as a double flashback: the two alternating depositions in which a bored looking Zuckerberg must give testimony at. First is the Winklevoss brothers' lawsuit, fellow students at Harvard who claimed Zuckerberg ripped off their original idea for a Facebook-like platform. The other lawsuit is instituted at the behest of Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former friend, who provided some small start-up capital in the early days of their business venture together.While I was overjoyed that Jesse Eisenberg finally got to play a role where he wasn't a geeky good guy, as 'The Social Network' moves along, his performance as Mark Zuckerberg becomes a bit one-note. It's really not Eisenberg's fault since the script calls for him to play Zuckerberg as both the manic overachiever and sullen bad boy who basically remains the same throughout the narrative (the real Zuckerberg doesn't see himself worthy as a dramatic character—he's quoted as saying, in substance, that he spent most of his time writing computer code during those heady days). A bit more interesting is Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) who gets to emote a lot more, especially after he discovers that his best friend and partner has ripped him off royally! (Garfield's Eduardo also collects a few laughs when he attempts to deal with a girlfriend who will not change her mind about dumping him).What 'The Social Network' really comes down to is our verdict on Zuckerberg's moral character. And in my opinion, that verdict must be a mixed one. Certainly, the Winklevoss part of the lawsuit seemed to me to be without merit. In the end, we find out they prevailed to the tune of $65 million but did Zuckerberg really copy any of their ideas? They may have had the same concept but web pages are all in the details—and it was Zuckerberg who came up with all the unique ideas. As for Saverin, Zuckerberg probably would not have become successful if he took the cautious advice of his business partner. By seeking out the wild and unpredictable Napster founder Sean Parker (who Saverin couldn't stomach at all), Zuckerberg found a partner who truly had the connections to make things happen. Nonetheless, the way in which Zuckerberg and his new business associates 'tricked' Saverin, was reprehensible. Saverin counted Zuckerberg as a friend and Zuckerberg took advantage of this fact because he knew Saverin would never read the fine print of the contract he was signing. Zuckerberg was right about one thing: Saverin, as a successful Harvard business student, should have read the fine print and hired an attorney to go over the contract he was about to sign.In Citizen Kane, Orson Welles offers up the image of 'Rosebud', a childhood keepsake which symbolized the loss of love for the film's protagonist. Here, in 'The Social Network', Sorkin serves up Zuckerberg's 'Rosebud' as something much more mundane: a college sweetheart who rejected him. The audience gets to have their 'Rosebud' moment when Zuckerberg tries to send a Facebook friend request to his lost love. In an earlier scene in a restaurant, Zuckerberg can't bring himself to apologize for his crude blogging when he was a student at Harvard, and ends up begging his ex to join him in a private tete-a-tete where presumably he'll try to rationalize his behavior once again. It's a long stretch to suggest that Zuckerberg's occasional sour disposition is all due to his rejection by an ex-girlfriend. The implication is that this is the one thing Zuckerberg can't have—and it consumes him (just as Kane/Hearst pines for the lack of love in his childhood).'The Social Network' is no masterpiece as some have maintained here on the internet. It's really a workmanlike story chronicling the machinations of a driven overachiever who becomes insanely successful in our new computer age. Mark Zuckerberg's story is certainly worth watching at least once. If I do see this film again, I'll be sure to concentrate on the technical aspects since I'm quite satisfied that I've already absorbed most of the major plot points and internal/external arcs of the principal characters.",7,0,0,1 March 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," Good non-stop action trumps Bourne's moral turpitude
","When you strip 'The Bourne Supremacy' down to its bare essentials, basically what you have is a high-powered, well-done chase movie. For the most part, it's non-stop actionand the producers were smart to enlist Paul Greenglass as the director. Greenglass films 'Supremacy' in a documentary style, making use of hand-held camera shots in many scenes. One of my favorite scenes where you really feel the events actually could have happened is when Bourne kills a fellow CIA agent in Munich and then blows up the house where the killing took place. Not only are the sequence of events leading up to the explosion choreographed masterfully(the fight scene, the lighting of the fuse, etc.) but the aftermath is equally effectiveas Bourne drives away, the police are heading in the opposite direction toward the burning house which we glimpse in the distance.The plot to 'Supremacy' is more convoluted than complicated. In a nutshell, a rogue CIA agent conspires with Russian criminal elements to frame Bourne for two recent murders (also involving CIA agents). After a failed assassination attempt in India, Bourne escapes and is pursued by both the CIA and the Russians. Since he has amnesia, he's trying to figure out who's hunting him and why. Bourne eventually discovers he was part of a secret project called 'Treadstone' and was involved in the murder of a well-known Russian politician and his wife. The politician was set to expose the collusion between the rogue CIA agent (Abbott, convincingly played by Brian Cox) and the Russians.Matt Damon who plays Bourne, has very little dialogue in this movie. Damon usually gives capable performances but with little nuance. Nonetheless, the part calls for a great deal of physical action and Damon is up to the job. This is what he's good atplaying parts that require someone who's in great physical shape. What doesn't ring true is that Bourne is too much of a supermana killing machine that basically no one can stop.The supporting players here are equally as good. There's a lot of nice conflict between Brian Cox's Abbott who seeks to stymie Joan Allen's Pamela Landy, the CIA deputy administrator from discovering that's he's the rogue agent responsible for all the trouble. The Russian assassin and his boss are equally realistic as menacing villains.'The Bourne Supremacy' was filmed on location in many different countries including India, Italy, Germany and Russia. This gives the film a great deal of its verisimilitude.'Supremacy' wears out its welcome in the final scenes. There's a car-chase sequence that's been done many times before and goes on for too long. And there's an additional scene tacked on at the end where Bourne visits the teenage daughter of the Russian politician where he reveals that he was actually responsible for murdering her parents. Whether Bourne was brainwashed at the time or whether he knew exactly what he was doing, the writers succeed in undermining Bourne's heroic status and we're left with a sour taste in our mouths after realizing Bourne really isn't such a good guy after all.Forget about Supremacy's thin plot and the Bourne character's moral turpitude. If you like non-stop action, The Bourne Supremacy is worth seeing.",7,1,2,18 January 2009
The Great Gatsby," Gaudy production values can't save Luhrmann's latest due to Fitzgerald's weak source material
","Most of the critical reviews of Baz Luhrmann's new take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, 'The Great Gatsby', focus on its over the top production values. Here are a few samples of the type of criticism I am referring to: 'a near-constant bombardment of visual over stimulation,' 'mostly a cacophony of style, excess and noise that makes you want to turn it all down a notch,' 'anachronistic convergence of hip-hop and swing,' 'all look and no feel,' 'hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment,' 'baroque, overblown, megalomaniacal spectacles,' (with Luhrmann) 'less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste.' Aside from the hip-hop and unnecessary use of 3-D, Luhrmann's penchant for overindulgence didn't really bother me. In fact, one of the titles Fitzgerald came up with before settling on 'Gatsby', was 'Trimalchio in West Egg'—referencing the obnoxious, ancient Roman 'noveau riche' businessman in Petronius' 'Satyricon', known for his wild orgy-like feasts. I'm not sure at all whether Fitzgerald would have actually objected to all those over-the-top, gaudy spectacles, Luhrmann proffers up here in his take on the 1920s 'jazz age'.Getting back to the critical reviews, only Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times actually has the temerity to suggest that Fitzgerald's source material is no masterpiece: 'Though it is gorgeously written and often cited as one of the great American novels, Fitzgerald's 'Gatsby' is in fact very much a slender reed, a tragedy in a minor key.' I would go further and argue that Fitzgerald's main character is not fleshed out at all and woefully unconvincing. Hence, no matter how Luhrmann 'jazzes' up 'Gatsby' (whether successful or not), Fitzgerald's source material will leave any film director handicapped from the get-go, in attempting to successfully adapt the novel from page to screen.The Gatsby slow-moving introduction appears intentional, as the mystery behind the elusive tycoon, is built up. Again, the gaudy production values (the costumes, the old cars, the set designs) are enough to keep one settled, until the story really begins to pick up. One notes that Nick Carraway, an ordinary 'Joe', plays the part of the protagonist's only true ally. Carraway, the film's narrator, appears to be a stand in for Fitzgerald himself.Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Gatsby is introduced to Carraway, his social inferior, and then takes him on a tour of 'his world' the next day, setting out in his Yellow Duesenberg (let's not be too upset that this is a 1929 Duesenberg, and the scene takes place in 1922!). Gatsby of course has an ulterior motive: he hopes that Carraway, will help him reunite with his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Carraway's cousin! The problem with all this is Gatsby's character. Can you really believe any of it? It's obvious that Fitzgerald, through Carraway, creates an idealized picture of a ruthless gangster, who just happens to go goo-goo eyes over a woman he fell for, five years earlier, before his 'trial by fire', as a confirmed bootlegger . You would think a gangster like Gatsby would have modeled himself on a realistic character like Tony Soprano, who never had any compunctions about going from one woman to another, disposing of them at his whim, in rapid succession. But no, Gatsby is such a noble, mushy guy, that he pines for Daisy (a complete airhead who we learn nothing about) and will even take the heat, when Daisy is on the hook for vehicular manslaughter (at film's end).Another convenient strategy is for Fitzgerald (again through Carraway's perspective), to ignore Gatsby's dark side by failing to show us any of Gatsby's malevolent behaviors in the bootlegger's world, which allowed him to accumulate all his money, and rise to the top. What's more, Tom Buchannan, the antagonist we must compare to the 'noble' Gatsby, is a flat-out cartoon racist who is constantly mouthing pronouncements about how the white race continually faces annihilation by 'darker peoples.'Fitzgerald wants us to feel bad about Gatsby when Carraway informs us that no one who attended his extravagant parties, shows up for his funeral. Why in fact should we feel sorry for Gatsby? If in fact, he resembled a fleshed out, real person, then I could have easily felt some sympathy. But the truth of the matter is that Gatsby exists only in F. Scott Fitzgerald's imagination. There is no attempt to create a real-life person here and isn't that what 'art' should be about?For those who say 'Gatsby' is purely a fable, I say a good fable should reflect 'reality'. Despite being a master of descriptive phraseology, Fitzgerald's characters are the stuff of cheap melodrama: a 'softy' sociopath with a heart of gold. Don't feel sorry for Gatsby as Nick Carraway does at film's end—and don't put him on pedestal. Break out some of your old Soprano DVDs—if you want a true portrait, of a REAL gangster!",5,1,3,23 June 2013
The Proposal," Deluded masses fall for Bullock's 'straw man'
","For those who haven't seen 'The Proposal', the plot is rather simple. Faced with being deported to her native Canada, publishing business career woman Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), proposes to her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) that she marry him, in order to save her job and offer him a chance at promotion. The film has been compared to the 2009 dramedy 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Ostensibly, they both are about smug career women who are universally hated by their employees. But Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly is a multi-dimensional portrait based on a real person and Sandra Bullock's 'Margaret Tate' is a dopey caricature.Many internet posters have condemned 'The Proposal' for its predictability. Sure enough, Margaret Tate eventually comprehends the error of her ways and finally softens up; but it's what happens before the predicable ending (the 'softening up') that relegates the film to the trash heap.There was a time when Sandra Bullock actually showed some talent as a comic actor. Consider Miss Congeniality—the film was humorous due to the cleverness of the fish out of water premise. Sandra's FBI agent character had to adapt in the prim and proper beauty pageant world. And we were attracted to Sandra since her character was realistically tough and confident.Not so in 'The Proposal'. You would think that a tough as nails editor-in-chief would know how to handle herself, especially in the rarefied world of the Paxton family—both Tate and the Paxtons are quite well off. But no, Bullock plays Tate as a buffoon, someone to laugh at. Somehow, being in the more rural atmosphere of Sitka, Alaska, is supposed to turn Tate into a total klutz. Not only is she unable to efficiently move her luggage or climb down a ladder but she also can't swim! While Miranda Priestly was arrogant and sometimes petty, she also had an aura of competency that made her an attractive and interesting character. Until her sudden epiphanies toward the climax of 'The Proposal', Tate is completely petty and never shows any sign of competence. Take for example, the idiotic scene where the family dog is snatched by the eagle; eventually Tate saves the dog but she's more concerned about her cell phone, after the eagle flies away with it.It's easy to understand why Bullock would be attracted to the 'straw man' character of Margaret Tate. As the dictionary tells us—a straw man is a 'fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person, object, matter, etc., used as a seeming adversary or argument.' The shrewd businesswoman that she is, Bullock realizes how the masses (the film going public) despise such characters as Tate, since most of us have encountered such arrogant people one time or another during our employment history. In reality, such people never realize the 'error' of their ways and usually are rewarded for their amoral behavior (take Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' as the perfect example). Since the masses can't face reality, they would rather indulge in wish fulfillment by cheering on the comeuppance of a straw man. And that's exactly what Bullock has done here—provided a buffoon that the masses can sneer at—while she knows full well that a real tough as nails editor-in-chief would never be anything like a Margaret Tate who 'hates shopping and sightseeing' and hasn't had sex for a year and a half!Before 'The Proposal' gets all mushy with the failed marriage ceremony and Ryan Reynolds rushing back to NYC where he convinces Bullock that he's truly fallen in love with her, numerous bloggers and internet posters have taken note of many other unfunny scenes in 'The Proposal', that crop up before the sentimental denouement. A few that come to mind include: Bullock and Reynolds clumsily falling over each other while in the nude, Bullock being entertained by an amateur Hispanic 'Chippendale's' stripper and Betty White playing the grandmother dressed up as a Native American, performing a bizarre Native American dance for Bullock (followed by her equally bizarre hip hop dance in response).Despite Ryan Reynold's sincere performance as Andrew Paxton, the character also doesn't make much sense. Paxton supposedly holds himself up as being true to himself (as well as being an anti-materialist) when he rejects his father's demand to come back home and take over the family business. But at the same time, he's willing to compromise his values by accepting Tate's illegal (and immoral) proposal, in order to further his career.Even if one's 'heart strings' are pulled by the sudden transformation of the lovers' affection for each other at the film's climax, the bulk of 'The Proposal' is 'comedy' of the lowest sort. And Bullock too has hit new lows by agreeing to be part of this enterprise. The next time around, she should look for more excellent screenplays. One is named 'The Devil Wears Prada'.",2,6,8,7 August 2010
Sully," Casting NTSB investigators as bogeyman is a cheap shot but Eastwood and Hanks still pull off the feel good film of the year
","As far as films about air disasters go, 'Sully' is a difficult one to pull off. The flight itself lasted only five minutes—so how does director Clint Eastwood manage to keep our interest for the 96 minute length of the film? The introduction is certainly gripping—Eastwood imagines what would happen if Sully decided not to ditch the plane in the Hudson. The imaginary sequence of events depicts a disastrous crash into skyscrapers reminiscent of what happened on 9/11. Instead of taking us to the airport right before the miraculous flight, Eastwood flash forwards to the beginning of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation where Sully's decision to ditch the plane is questioned by Board investigators. The first part of the investigation and its conclusion are book-ended into Acts One and Three of the film's narrative. Act Two is a recapitulation of the flight itself and the subsequent attendant rescue efforts.The actual crash is quite gripping, chronicling exactly how the plane went down after a huge flock of geese took out both the plane's engines. Tom Hanks as the expert pilot doesn't quite exude the gravitas of the real Captain Sully but once the geese hit, the A-list actor manages to more than ably convey the machinations of a genius of the skies on autopilot.For those who want more of the crash from different angles, the five minute anomaly is recapitulated in the third act through a series of flight simulations served up during the NSTB investigation. At first, it's posited that Sully had enough time to return to either LaGuardia or Teterboro airports. But once the human factor is added in, the additional seconds added into the simulation prove that the flight would have been doomed.Sully only fails in its rather unconvincing attempt to create villains out of the NTSB investigators. In real-life, the investigation took 15 months; here it's condensed to a very short time. While the investigators were just 'doing their job,' here their aggressive probing suggests that they were out to 'get' the intrepid Sully. The NSTB's statement regarding the film speaks volumes about Eastwood's attempt to make them the bad guys: 'we were not afforded an opportunity to ensure our actions and words were portrayed with accurate context or reflected our perspective.'Sully probably should be probably nominated and declared winner of the 'feel good' film of the year. In another sense, it can be viewed as the perfect 'anti-9/11' film, as it depicts a happy ending involving an air crash. Eastwood has done a good job crafting a narrative with limited potential for drama. Casting the NTSB investigators as the bogeyman here was somewhat of a cheap shot, but necessary to ensure that the film had some kind of antagonist.",6,2,4,9 October 2016
Valkyrie," Better off as a 'Made for TV' movie
","First off, I agree with those critics who found Tom Cruise utilizing an American accent while the other actors are all speaking in polished British accents, a big mistake. The film's verisimilitude is compromised quite a bit by Cruise's inability to convince us that he's truly Klaus von Stauffenberg, a sophisticated Army officer from an aristocratic German family.That said, Valkyrie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. It's basically a by-the-numbers recreation of the last plot to kill Hitler. While it lacks suspense (since the film's climax is a forgone conclusion) it does ably depict who the players were and how they concocted and carried out the failed assassination plot.Valkyrie fails in the area of character development. We never get to know any of these characters as multi-dimensional human beings. Director Bryan Singer chose to tell his story purely as an action-adventure movie. On the plus side, the movie looks like it was filmed at some of the actual locations especially the scenes shot at the 'Wolf's Lair' which looked pretty realistic.The most objectionable aspect of 'Valkyrie' is elevating von Stauffenberg to hero status. While certainly he was courageous, he was no hero. Had Germany been winning the war, it's not likely there would have been as many assassination attempts as there were. I find it difficult to believe that most of the conspirators were primarily motivated by a moral imperative.Daniel Goldhagen, in his brilliant book 'Hitler's Willing Executioneers--Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust', informs that von Stauffenberg's own brother admitted that in the sphere of internal politics, 'we had welcomed the basic tenets of National Socialism for the most part...The concept of race seemed sound and very promising.' Their objection was merely that its 'implementation was exaggerated and carried too far'. Stauffenberg's uncle, Count Uxkull, stated 'We should hold on to the concept of race as far as possible.' According to Goldhagen, one of the central documents of the resistance to Hitler, prepared at the beginning of 1943 by leading Protestant theologians and university professors, explicitly condemned genocide but still argued that Jews caused trouble for Germany, that a 'Jewish Problem' existed, that the Jews had harmed Germany and that a 'solution' was necessary that would prevent future harm to Germans.Valkyrie might have been better as a 'Made for TV' special. Instead of spending all that money about a minor footnote in the history of the Third Reich, wouldn't it have been better to focus on the complicity of the overwhelming majority of the German people who either enthusiastically embraced Hitler or looked the other way as he successfully carried out his nefarious plan of genocide and attempt at world domination?",5,14,33,4 January 2009
The Martian," Slow-moving but informative tale of beleaguered astronaut on Mars is undermined by lack of suspense back on earth
","After taking in the most entertaining 'Gravity' in 2013, I was looking forward to comparing it with 'The Martian,' which is similar in theme. Both Matt Damon and Sandra Bullock play astronauts, who as a result of a disaster, are forced to save themselves from certain death in the vast expanse of outer space. Gravity, unlike the bloated Martian, has a more than workmanlike plot that occurs in real time—the ticking clock forces us to view Dr. Ryan Stone as she battles one setback after another, placing the viewer on the edge of one's seat throughout the heart- pounding narrative. The Martian, in contrast, chronicles Mark Watney as he devises various stratagems for survival over a much longer period of time. Thus by the very nature of this most different, much slower-moving tale (based on a novel and not on an original screenplay, as is the case with Gravity), The Martian, is only mildly entertaining, more for its 'educational platform' than a scenario involving death-defying life-and- death maneuvers. Thus the first third of The Martian manages to be fairly compelling as we follow Watney in his initial stab at survival after the Martian storm separates him from his Ares III comrades and strands him on the virtually barren red planet, with no expectation of rescue for another four years based on NASA's projected schedule. Watney, brilliant botanist scientist that he is, devises a way to create a water supply from human waste and grow potatoes in a makeshift greenhouse. As the first half of Act 2 slugs along, there's more enormously clever stuff in store as Watney extends the battery life of his Rover and journeys for days, eventually locating an early Pathfinder probe buried in the sand. Watney reconfigures the Pathfinder which enables him to communicate with NASA. One of the film's thrilling moments occurs when mission control realizes Watney is still alive and eventually devises a way to communicate with him.Unfortunately, The Martian loses steam in the second half, after the focus shifts from Watney to NASA in their attempt to rescue him. We see this in high relief at the midpoint when a breach in the crew's Hab's airlock ruins Watney's potato crop and NASA is forced to send an unmanned probe full of supplies which blows up upon liftoff. This might sound exciting but it takes so much time for everyone on the ground to make this happen that the launch (reminiscent of the Challenger disasters), proves anti-climactic. There's a brief aside involving an offer from the China National Space Administration to send one of their secret probes to resupply Watney. The inclusion of a Chinese benevolent offer undoubtedly was inserted by the film's scenarists to perhaps promote better Chinese-American relations, but in reality it does little to heighten the suspense surrounding Watney. Ultimately the Chinese probe proves to be a time waster for both viewer and plot: its lack of practicality becomes obvious when it's postulated there's no way to control the speed of the ship when it enters the Martian atmosphere.The Martian almost grinds to a complete halt before the big climax when a coterie of geeks and NASA personnel are intent on explaining how the story ends before it actually does. A geeky astrodynamicist, Purnell, comes up with the idea of a 'slingshot trajectory' which will lengthen the Hermes mission by first hooking up with the Chinese resupply ship and then making a beeline back to Mars where they'll somehow 'catch' Watney in a module stripped of its top portion, covered only by a tarp. The tension of Watney's quest for survival is replaced by a tale of NASA infighting—the chief honcho nixes the idea of a Hermes reboot, but his assistant emails Purnell's risky maneuver to the crew who of course go against orders and decide to save Watney anyway. The big climax is once again outlined before it happens by the Aeres captain, who illustrates to the crew what's supposed to happen utilizing a set of salt and pepper shakers!Even though we finally get back to Watney, his trip in the reconfigured rover for a rendezvous with his getaway rocket is again somewhat anti-climactic, replete with clichéd orchestral music and wide shots highlighting the aforementioned barren Martian landscape. Finally Watney's rescue is exciting enough, but one cannot help but feel that we should have gotten to it a lot sooner (whatever happened to the old cinematic axiom, show don't tell?). One also can't help but feel that Damon's successful rescue is quite reminiscent of Bullock's maneuvers in Gravity. But Bullock's turn in outer space just seems to be a lot more exciting and well choreographed, than Damon's!The Martian also suffers from a lack of multi-dimensionality in its characters. No one except Damon really stands out. Damon, on the other hand, shines--particularly in his scenes where he details his machinations on the Red Planet in his trusty video diary. Those videos make Damon's Watney come alive and saves the film from the second half chronicle of mediocre doings on earth.The Martian is by no means a terribly bad film, and I understand that director Scott was determined to create some kind of paean to man's ingenuity and self-survival. Nonetheless, the unabashed jingoism in his misplaced salute to NASA and the US space program in general, leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. With all the poverty and suffering going on in the world today, isn't the space program, with its hopeless quest to find extraterrestrial life in the universe, nothing more than a terribly misguided canard? Ridley is one of those guys who still believes in 'The Idea of Progress,' that emerged from the Enlightenment in the 18th century. Better to have consulted the Biblical admonition found in Ecclesiastes: 'There is nothing new under the sun.'",5,17,36,7 October 2015
The Fighter," Overlong, feel good take on boxing family dysfunction, still entertains
","With so many fight flicks out there, it helps to be a little bit different. The film's creator, Mark Wahlberg, wisely explores Prizefighter Micky Ward's family conflicts for three quarters of the film, rather than dwelling mainly on the conflicts in the ring. Wahlberg was attracted to Ward's story since they both grew up in large families, in a working class Massachusetts environment. For those who have no interest in astrology, I apologize, but I would like to point out that the natural inquisitive nature of a Gemini (Wahlberg), goes quite well with the laid back, easygoing Libran (Ward). What we end up with 'The Fighter' is an 'airy' concoction—a film that manages to exude a 'feel good' sensibility coupled with the strong dialectic between two brothers, whose mutual attraction and repulsion is constantly shifting.Since 'The Fighter' is based on the true story of Ward's rise to the top as a champion welterweight, whenever reality weasels its way into the narrative, the film is quite absorbing. The entire scene where Ward, goaded by his mother, agrees to fight an opponent twenty pounds heavier than he is, and then gets his ass kicked, is something I've never seen before in a boxing film. Ward's brother, Dicky (played by a chameleon-like Christian Bale), also provides a great deal of 'color' to an otherwise traditional tale of pugilistic ambition. Who can forget when Micky ignores his trainer's game plan and adopts his brother's strategy to win the title fight? This despite Dicky's continual descent into the hellhole of crack addiction.The bulk of 'The Fighter', however, is much more a tale of filial obligation (or should I say obsession?) than the history of Micky Ward's ascent to the welterweight crown. Why does it take Micky so long to realize that Dicky is actually holding him back? The answer in a nutshell is misguided filial obligation. A deeper subtext is that the Ward brothers are both in an unconscious incestuous relationship with their mother (played by an over the top Melissa Leo). While Micky eventually breaks free, Dicky takes a more circuitous route toward redemption. He must first go to prison where he finally overcomes his crack addiction and eventually allows his brother to fight without any conditions (that is, with Dicky no longer acting as if his brother owed him something).I would urge anyone who has seen 'The Fighter', to also see Visconti's 'Rocco and his Brothers'--both films deal with two brothers who are prizefighters. In 'Rocco', the stakes are much higher: the successful prizefighter brother also has a misguided filial obligation to his now washed up sibling. Unlike Dicky (who eventually gives up his unhealthy family relationships), Rocco covers for his brother who has committed both rape and murder. Unlike the Visconti classic, Wahlberg is content to offer up a happy ending, where Dicky is welcomed into Micky's new boxing family, accepted by them despite all the past recriminations.The three principals here all acquit themselves well. The most impressive aspect of Wahlberg's performance is his physical conditioning; he trained for four years to get himself into shape to play this role. Even better is Christian Bale as Dicky. Bale lost approximately sixty pounds to play Micky's crack-addicted brother; when you first see him, you won't even realize it's Christian Bale. Amy Adams finally breaks out of her 'good girl' roles and plays a sexy, working class gal who helps Micky break his ties with his mother.Less successful is Melissa Leo as Alice Ward, the mother of the seven daughters. Yes, we get the idea that she's a control freak, but does all that 'control freak' stuff have to repeat itself ad infinitum? The daughters (described by many critics as a virtual 'Greek Chorus'), provide additional cartoonish machinations; the stale comic relief reaches its apotheosis in the scene where the daughters try and pummel Micky's girlfriend, Charlene.Micky Ward's victory during the Championship Fight in London seems a bit anti-climactic. Wahlberg went to great lengths to reproduce the actual fight as it appeared on HBO in 2000. The actual recording of the HBO announcers was utilized during the film and the fight sequences were choreographed to match the actual movements of the boxers. It just seems kind of lazy to pad the end of your film with the reproduction of an actual event, which you could probably better enjoy by watching the real thing.'The Fighter' probably would have worked better had it been cut down by about 20 to 30 minutes. A good number of the scenes feel as if they're improvised and sometimes drag a bit. Nonetheless, the holy trinity of Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, make this fairly traditional boxing yarn, entertaining. Wahlberg stays true to his Gemini sign—there is something for everybody here: whether it be over the top acting performances, intense family conflict with incestuous undertones and gritty recreations of fighters plying their trade in the ring.",6,2,5,25 April 2011
Up in the Air," Heartthrob Clooney can't save turgid, uninspired tale of corporate downsizing
","With the plague of 'corporate downsizing' now reaching its zenith, such a social phenomenon is bound to come to the attention of Hollywood's top name producers. Hence, Jason Reitman, son of famous Hollywood producer/director Ivan Reitman, has been given the reins to address this very issue. It also helps to have heart-throb George Clooney in the role of corporate down-sizer Ryan Bingham, who flies around the country as a sort of 'hired gun', informing various downsized employees that their services are no longer required.Soon a young upstart, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), comes up with the brilliant idea of firing employees via a computer video linkup. One wonders why Ryan's company hadn't embraced this method years before, since obviously it is much more cost effective. And it's also hard to believe that a new employee such as Natalie, who is just out of school, would be the one introducing the new prototype as these video linkups (as just pointed out) have not only been around for quite some time but it's more likely a more experienced person would probably be responsible for developing or customizing it. Somehow Ryan convinces his boss that 'face-to-face' firings still are much more preferable to firings via computer and that Natalie needs to understand the value of the 'human touch'. Ryan's boss puts the video project on hold and allows Ryan to keep jetting about firing people in person as long as Natalie accompanies him. This of course allows 'Up in the Air' to become something of a 'buddy' picture with Ryan and Natalie 'duking it out' over the nature of relationships. When Natalie finds out that Ryan has been having a casual affair with Alex, who he is constantly meeting up with while on the road, she castigates him for not getting involved. Let me add that Natalie only becomes emotional over this issue after she has been dumped by her own boyfriend (via text message). For the most part, she is a one-note cold fish who soon learns the delicate art of firing people face to face, under Ryan's tutelage.Not much happens during the 'second act' of 'Up in the Air'. Director Reitman spends too much time presenting cameos of real-life people recreating their reactions to the news that they've been downsized. Was it necessary to 'pad' the film with these cameos? Basically one minute of the fired employees would have been enough to convey the despair of these hapless people. There are additional repetitious scenes with Ryan, while moonlighting as a motivational speaker, utilizing a backpack to illustrate his 'life philosophy' to an audience of self-help junkies at various hotel conference rooms. Reitman wastes additional time with a scene where the three principals attend a corporate party, culminating with a 'heart-to-heart' talk between Alex and Ryan on a corporate yacht.You would think that the big 'Act Two Climax' would have something to do with the relationship between Ryan, Alex and Natalie, but it doesn't. Instead, there's an awkward subplot that pops up involving Ryan's sister's fiancé who gets cold feet just before he's about to get married. Ryan is called in by his other sister and uses his 'motivational speaker' skills to convince the errant husband-to-be, to go ahead with the wedding—which of course he does and the couple live happily ever after.The wrap up of Act Three is decidedly a downer—and thoroughly unconvincing to boot. Despite the fact that Alex attends Ryan's sister's wedding and seemingly is now ready to become more involved with him, it just doesn't turn out that way. After giving up his motivational speaker gig, Ryan somehow finds Alex's home address and knocks on her door—only to discover that she is a married woman. Since Alex only wanted a casual relationship, it would have been much easier for her to simply tell Ryan that she was married and there would have been no hard feelings. But since the film's screenwriter was desperate to create some kind of drama (and there is so little of it in this film), we're treated to the unlikely scenario of Ryan being deflated when he discovers the true nature of Alex's marital status. As for Natalie, she quits the company after learning that one of the downsized employees that she had fired, killed herself. It appears that both Ryan and Natalie did not heed this particular employee's pronouncement while on one of their firing jaunts, as the woman did indeed explicitly state that she was going to jump off a bridge. Inexplicably, Ryan's boss puts the computer video link program on hold despite the fact that the communication between Ryan and Natalie and this particular employee, took place face to face!Up in the Air is a slow-moving 'dramedy' with an underdeveloped plot. While it's a very nice-looking film, the actors can do very little with their parts due to the weak script. Clooney basically plays himself (as he usually does) and offers up an only serviceable performance. On the basis of director Reitman's last two films ('Juno' preceded 'Up in the Air'), it's likely we'll be seeing uninspired, mediocre films from him in the future.",3,7,13,20 March 2010
Atonement," A Tale of Two Stories
","Atonement reminds me of Scorcese's 'Gangs of New York' in that the director felt compelled to insert a 'second story' into the main narrative. In 'Gangs', there's a whole sequence about the New York Draft Riots which is completely superfluous, tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history. Similarly, in 'Atonement', we're treated to a glimpse of the British Army retreat at Dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Despite the Dunkirk scene's artfulness, it's all padding and it needs to be there because without it, 'Atonement' would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the British aristocracy. The first hour of Atonement is interminably long. The viewer soon discovers there's very little intellectual substance to this tawdry tale. In a nutshell, Briony, a 13 year old girl in an upper class family becomes jealous of her sister who has suddenly become intimate with Robbie, the housekeeper's son, who lives on their estate. Briony is the Brit version of the 'Bad Seed' but we never really find out what motivates her except for a schoolgirl crush and some unexplained revulsion toward adult sexuality (oh my, upper crust 13 year old snob is just so incredibly repulsed by witnessing her older sister and the housekeeper's son having sex in the library!!!). Speaking of that library scene, do you really believe that Cecilia and Robbie would have sex in the library where anyone could just walk in on them? And what about the crude note Robbie gives to Briony to give to her sister? If he loved her so much, why did he even think of writing that note in the first place and why would he entrust it to Briony (who he could have easily guessed would have looked at it?).Worse than these plot contrivances, is the accusation of rape that lands Robbie in jail. Notice how Cecilia hardly sticks up for Robbie at all as he's hauled away by the police. Wouldn't she have put up a bigger fight or was the whole point that she was cowed by her snobby family? The 'investigation' into the rape lasts about 3 minutes on screen. In real life, many people would have been questioned and various suspects and angles would have been pursued. There's none of that here since 'Atonement' must fit the classic melodramatic mold--an innocent lover (victim Robbie) is broken by Bad Seed victimizer (Briony). At least there is an antagonist--for awhile--but Briony then disappears until the end of the movie, only to reappear (in the imagination) of a now elderly Briony who is working on her '21st' and 'last' novel. The now reinvented Briony is a nurse (who opts not to go to Cambridge) and attempts to atone for her sins by throwing herself into the War effort. And the elderly Briony somehow 'atones' for her indiscretion by creating a fictional denouement: the 18 year old Briony apologizes to Robbie and allows the star-crossed lovers to live out their lives in a picture postcard world at the seashore (this clashes with the not so surprising true ending revealed to us by Briony the novelist that Robbie died at Dunkirk and her sister was killed during the Blitz).Atonement gets high marks for atmosphere and mood. It has some very nifty cinematography and the music enhances the dramatic encounters. The characters here are one-dimensional in that the upper-class Brits are petty despots (the children reflect the parents' hostility) and the working class are hapless victims (exemplified by Robbie and his mother). Atonement becomes another movie in the second half and overall sports two antagonists. The Bad Seed is replaced by the horrors of war. 'Atonement' is an empty vessel. Don't be fooled by all the 'bells and whistles.'",3,14,24,20 October 2008
