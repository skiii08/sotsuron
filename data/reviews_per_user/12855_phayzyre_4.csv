The Blair Witch Project," Horrible load of crap!
","Someone tell me, was this movie supposed to be scary? If so, it failed! This movie is dumb as a brick! Three college kids gallabanting in a wooded area that they don't know diddley-squat about, with a half-cocked sense of direction, looking for a fabled witch, ending up lost, hearing 'noises' in the night and belly-aching at each other?! And besides, in this day and age what screw-ball would camp out in the woods without packing a shotgun or pistol? This movie is a complete waste of time and film, and I'm glad I didn't buy it. It should have been called 'The Bull Sh_ _ Project'! Enough said!",Null,2,4,10 December 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Why even make this mess!
","After reading a good portion of the comments regarding 'Alien Resurrection' posted by others here at IMDB, I'm still dumbfounded as to why many praised this movie as a classic!  But what really confuses me is those who wrote how great an actress Wynonna Ryder is and how well a team match she was for Sigourney Weaver!  I have never been fond of her (Ryder's) acting!  And to pair/team her with Sigourney Weaver is an insult to Ms. Weaver!After Alien 3 I thought that this would be it.  Never again would there be another Alien series, right?  Then came the day that I learned of 'Alien Resurrection'.  I and I'm sure other 'Alien' buffs were very excited and couldn't wait for its release.Then came the day I saw it!The biggest beef I have with this film (as is the case with a lot of movies here lately) is crappy directing!  Its as if nobody wants to take the time anymore to make a good movie.  When if ever will those clowns in Hollywood stop focusing on money money money and more on effort!?  In my opinion this movie is not worth watching more than  once because of a lack of effort on the directors part.  I guess that the future holds more stinker movies if this type of directing is to continue!As for those who give this movie the praise they think it deserve, I think they should watch the first three series from start to finish again, then take a darn good look at 'Alien Resurrection' !  Just maybe they might see what I'm talking about!Rumor has it that more 'Alien' movies might be in the making.  If so I hope that they are more palatable than this junk!  This mess is nothing like the original Alien movies.  I give it a 5/10.",Null,0,1,1 March 2004
Event Horizon," Slightly bland, but watchable
","This movie has all the characteristics of a good sci-fi horror flick: good cast good story and good special effects.  Its plot runs parallel with other sci-fi greats such as The Abyss and the Aliens movies.  The acting was very good, however, this film does somewhat convey a undertone of being thrown together as it progresses.  The most likely culprit is the director. Its almost like they did not want to make it predictable, to which they didn't, but in the process of doing so they let a good starting storyline fall flat.   I can't understand why some movie makers do not spend more time developing their storyline into a more palatable movie.  I guess they just cant see past the dollar signs!  This could have been a great movie rivaling other sci-fi classics if only a little more time was spent.  I give it a 5.5 out of 10",Null,0,1,5 October 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Hanky-panky dulled film; Also ended incorrectly
","Spoilers present: At the start, I liked this movie very much, but it badly suffers from what from a directorial cramp.  Why directors try to marry war and sex I guess I never will understand other than to sell tickets! Also, I did not like the ending; It was not historically accurate!
This movie has a great start with the Nazis invading Stalingrad.  The acting and special effects were good.  Everything motored along flawlessly until the sex scene.  WHY cant directors leave it to just a sweet subtle kiss instead of flat out getting it on!  This has become SO cliche' with many war movies!  The movies Patton and Saving Private Ryan were war from start to finish.  Now most people regard these movies as classics, I dont recall anybody making woopie in those films.  The effect it had on this movie is like throwing an anchor off a boat thats doing 100 miles an hour!    The other beef I have is historical accuracy.  True is the notion that if you make a movie based on a true story, the historical element may be tweaked a bit here and there, I dont have a problem with that.  But nowhere in my readings of snipers was he, Vasily Zaitsev, trapped behind a stove in a wharehouse by Maj. Konig.  According to my readings the only confrontation they had was when they were at gunpoint with each other. Nevertheless this movie still portrayed this encounter, according to history, WRONG! 
This film took off like a rocket, yet it crashed and burned shortly thereafter.  I was very gung ho about buying the DVD but after seeing it, I think not!  The cast was great, effects were good but the script walked through a rose garden and came out a stinker!  I give it a generous 5.0 out of 10!",Null,1,2,21 December 2003
