Blade Runner 2049," Overall, Great
","Whichever user wrote that when Harrison Ford appeared the movie took a turn for the worse should never review movies anymore. Ford was outstanding.If I have one complaint about this film, it's that it's a bit too in love with its visuals, so its pace is too deliberate and plodding for me. When Ford's Deckard character finally makes his entrance the film picks up the pace, and I perked up a bit. But it might be too late for some people.This Blade Runner world is as rich and engaging as the previous '80s film-- complete with dreariness and grayness galore. It has its regular scruffy-looking replicants and even deeper questions about what it means to be human.I like Gosling, but he was usually devoid of emotion in this film. Ford picks up the slack and adds more than enough flesh tones to reel in that slack. The supporting cast is great, and the story is immersive. I just thought that director Denis Villeneuve and his video editors could have made it trimmer and busier.",8,7,16,5 October 2017
Detroit," I love the D, so I hate that I disliked this film.
","People are writing that it's mostly fictitious, which actually makes sense because the fact that so many people were remaining silent and taking a beating for a moron who caused the incident and was already dead was absolutely baffling.I'm white and from the Detroit suburbs. I've lived in L.A. for the last ten years. I know that this film is about a tragedy that occurred during the '60s (when I wasn't even alive), but I want to state that the Detroit and Michigan police in general--black, white, Asian, etc.-- were FAR kinder to me and much more scrupulous than the scum who patrol the streets in Los Angeles (almost totally white and hispanic), which is another thing that annoys me tremendously-- the racism of assuming that American white cops are supremacists who never abuse white citizens.This film is also obscenely long. I have made several short films, so I knew precisely which parts should have been cut out-- everything from meaningless shots to forced acting.Will Poulter is a remarkable actor, though. He was great in The Revenant, and he steals the show in this film. Anthony Mackie is an awesome talent as well.But overall, I just couldn't justify sitting in a theater for almost 2 1/2 hours while I and everyone around me had the same thought during 2 of those hours-- JUST TELL THEM THAT THE DEAD IDIOT DID IT.",3,14,36,7 August 2017
A Star Is Born," Enjoyable with great acting, but the third act is... ugh
","Bradley Cooper thoroughly understands the soul of an artist and what makes great art, and I think that he wanted to express that meaning in this film. For the most part he accomplished that mission.There are so many times when Stefani Germanotta or Bradley Cooper said something in a manner that made me slightly emotional. When Germanotta said simply, 'you hurt me' as Cooper's character was apologizing it was just gorgeous. She didn't overplay it or try to embellish the line. It was just naked and honest, like their awesome musical performances.Cooper and the production team also know how a corporate hack will try to steer an artist away from his vision as one steered Germanotta away from her voice. I love that she regained her voice through tragedy at the end of the movie, but I hated the tragedy itself-- it seemed so forced.I understand that they wanted to remain true to the original version, so the suicide was retained, but it just seemed to throw off everything. When I was in film school so many aspiring screenwriters included suicide as part of their stories, which was obviously usually lazy writing. Our teachers admonished us for it and said that we were all intelligent students who should strive for more. It's what I felt about the ending to this movie-- it had so much potential, and it could have amounted to so much more.",7,53,104,6 October 2018
Us," I majored in psychology. The 'shadow people' are painfully moronic.
","I wanted to like this film. It started out strong. But let's cut to the core of the story, which caused me to want to leave.If you know you know simple basics about human behavior then you know that the 'shadow people's' (there is a term for them that I don't want to look up now) behavior is stunningly unrealistic. Let's say that they're idiots who can't formulate sentences and act in barbaric ways. Fine. Even the basest *animals* aren't going to stick around and do tricks for overlords who aren't even present and aren't presenting a system of punishments and rewards to them.
Even the lowest I.Q. people would have escaped such inhuman conditions long before the girl had the idea. When they show flashback scenes in which they do mimicked movements there is no one who is barking orders at them. There is no one who is standing guard over them with weapons. There is no reason for them to even be there. There are just cameras that are mounted on the walls, which are apparently useless-- a little girl escapes easily.I have profound difficulty with accepting that millions of idiots thought that such conditions were acceptable until a 'topsider' child informed them that they could have better lives then they remained patient enough
(FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS) to escape en masse in a calculated way..... to form a human chain.What the hell did I just watch?",3,45,83,23 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," The funniest comic book movie to date.
","I feel like this movie is everything that the last 'Guardians' movie wanted to be. Whereas in the last two Thor movies the script relied on Kat Dennings to provide comedic relief and she mostly failed (sorry, Kat) almost all of the actors in this film had great comedic timing and cadence. It completely erases the brutal memory of the last Thor movie from my mind.Even its ending is fairly nontraditional and not what what you're expecting from such an irreverent (for the most part) movie. I LOVE it.",9,2,11,4 November 2017
"I, Tonya"," The Best Film of the Year
","First, I'm stating that it's the best film of the year, and I just barely care about women's figure skating. So you know that it's phenomenal. For me, it edges out 'Dunkirk,' which was my favorite 2017 film until the night I saw it. Director Craig Gillespie is obviously a Scorsese protégé, and unlike Martin McDonagh's cheap ripoff of the Cohen brothers, he manages to pay homage to the man without imitating him. Like Scorsese (and Bob Fosse) he meshes documentary with realistic drama seamlessly well.Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan deliver good performances. Allison Janney and especially Paul Walter Hauser deliver OUTSTANDING performances. In fact, I didn't feel like Hauser was even acting as much as he was just BEING. These performances are also a credit to Gillespie.Almost every scene is well-paced, has little 'fat,' conveys meaning and adds to the narrative, which indicates great video editing. The editing was so good that I didn't even check the time, which is rare for me. Outstanding pacing.When I entered the theater, I didn't think that I was going to get even slightly emotional about Tonya Harding's story. But she is truly a sympathetic character without feeling sorry for herself, which is rare nowadays. Nowadays, everyone seems to be competing for who has it worst and who is the most pathetic victim. In Tonya's world, it's just her life, and it's presented as factual rather than maudlin and soap operatic. As Tonya basically says at the end of the film, 's--t happens. Deal with it.'",10,36,73,18 December 2017
Molly's Game," Underwhelming Directorial Debut
","The San Fransisco movie reviewer phrased it very well when he wrote, 'at a certain point, everyone watching this movie will ask, 'why should I care about any of this?'' The question hangs in the air very early during the film, and it's never really answered-- at least not in the 1 1/2 hours that I watched it. Yeah, I bailed.I think that it sits currently at 7.6 on this site and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes because so many people WANT Sorkin's directorial debut to be great... But it's just.... not.Molly brags about her accomplishments and her intelligence throughout the movie (yes, the braggadocio is boring in itself) , but in the end she just exploited simple concepts from someone who she describes as an 'idiot.' Alright... So you supposedly put off attending law school at an Ivy League school to put yourself in the feds' cross-hairs with this 'idiot's' schemes? Brilliant.There are also the lacking technical aspects of the editing and camerawork such as the ESPN-like side panels when the guys are playing poker. The minutiae and graphics are mind-numbingly boring to novices and professionals alike. Jessica Chastain does voice over while they play with so much garrulity and monotony. It would have been much easier just to SHOW the game. Instead of, 'Max thinks that Jake has a jack, which would give him two of a kind, but Jake is overselling his bluff a bit too much which tipped off Max and made him--' just show it. We can see it: 'That dude had a great hand, but he tipped it off, so the other guy folded.' Wow. So complicated. It doesn't require paragraphs.There is also dull legalistic minutiae in which Molly is showcasing her intellect and supposedly correcting her own lawyer in the process. Again, who cares? She didn't want to actually apply that intellect in the way that her lawyer did, so now she must pay millions to him instead. Wow. Brilliant.The acting is shaky. Jessica Chastain is undeniably sexy, but she has all of the charisma of a DMV worker. For me, she just can't pull off leading lady.I majored in psychology, so I want to conclude this review by stating that it's ironic that Sorkin focused on the minutiae of poker and the law, but he is apparently lost on the details of my science. At one point when Molly is an adolescent she says to her father that she thinks that Freud was a 'moron' and a 'quack.' Her father bristles at these insults and says something like, 'I'M NOT A QUACK.' Well, although I respect Freud immensely and most of the theories of modern psychology are derived from his theories, even during the early '90s (when I assume this exchange occurred) few psychologists were heavily invested in the Freudian paradigm. I don't know why so many writers think that psychologists are obsessed with Freudian ideas. Anyway, this film is a sh** show.",3,85,170,3 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An attempt at replicating a Cohen brothers movie
","When I entered the theater I had not checked the director and writer for this film in maybe a week, so I continually asked myself if it was a Cohen brothers film, which to me is bad when it's actually written/directed by someone else. I think that there is a difference between paying homage to artists and downright imitating them.The protagonist (who is played by Frances McDormand) is presented to us a likable person at first. But when she speaks to the police about her problems she seems quite nazi-esque. She wants to draw and test blood from every person who lives in her town to find a criminal. When the police chief informs her that such a thing is impossible because it would be a gross violation of people's civil rights, she doesn't care. He replies, 'he could have been a man who was just passing through the state.' 'Then let's take blood from everyone in the country.' Sure... She says it quite seriously. Repulsive.Woody Harrelson provides good acting, but there are multiple scenes in the movie when he does voice-over for comic relief that are mildly amusing at first but feel stale and forced rather quickly. There were many times when I just wanted to shut it off-- when someone is stretching irreverence out to the point of being unrealistic and absurd it's just bad writing. It's also bad form to have so much voice-over in any movie.In the early going, Sam Rockwell's cop character is the type of person who would strike me as reprehensible yet tolerable. When he pistol whips an innocent man and woman then beats the man to within an inch of his life he goes from tolerable to I-want-this-moron-to-die. As other people have noted, the police chief (who witnessed all of these things in person) wouldn't just fire such a person. He would be arrested and convicted for attempted murder. Instead, the chief fires him in an almost nonchalant manner.There is also an additional embarrassingly stupid scene in which Rockwell's character thinks that he is overhearing a violent criminal brag to his friend about his crimes. When the criminal confronts him... he scratches his face... then stares at him. Again, the Rockwell character is borderline retarded, but even the dumbest among us have a survival instinct. When I saw this scene play out I thought that it was part of a strategy or plan-- the Rockwell character wanted to get the guys arrested for assault so he could make his case to the police chief. Nope. Just more idiocy.It has a few solid comedic moments. But I would never watch this film again.",3,69,137,25 November 2017
Baby Driver," Really?
","Yes, it starts strong and manages to carry a lot of that momentum forward even somewhat beyond the midway point. But the small flaws that I was willing to overlook up to that point become huge issues as its believability is getting stretched to the breaking point.I was raised for the first thirteen years of my life in the South, so the Southern accents were a major problem for me. Ansel Elgort seems to drop it whenever it's convenient for him. In a few scenes in which he converses with Lily James in a diner they are both using the accent surprisingly well, then it's just dropped out almost completely beyond that point. Throughout the movie it ranges from very deep to nonexistent. Annoying.Also, Jon Hamm's performance was usually quite painful. He could not portray a tough guy to save his life. I felt like he was in an SNL sketch and was going to burst into laughter at his own incompetence at trying to play a thug at any moment. I enjoyed seeing him only when he and his lady friend (Eiza González) were shooting up their rivals. In fact, I wish that González had far more screen time in this movie because she played her role in such a sexy-yet-convincing manner.There was a PAINFUL twist in which Kevin Spacey's 'Doc' character does a complete 180 in his personality, which wasn't warranted by anything. And he does it with one of the most clichéd lines in cinematic history-- 'I was in love once.' It's like Edgar Wright just decided near the end that he didn't like his character anymore and wanted to flip his ways completely without any real justification. It took me out of it completely.Also, Lily James's Debora character seems as if she is willing to follow the 'Baby' character through the depths of hell, which would be difficult to believe even if they had known each other for a few years. She knew him for *a few days.* Wholly unrealistic. Wholly unbelievable.Jamie Foxx was great. He does a great job of portraying an impossibly annoying, malicious jerk. He reminds me of so many Lyft passengers who I've picked up this year.It's mildly entertaining. It's mildly enjoyable. But there was nothing here that justifies an 8+ point rating on IMDb or 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.",5,27,67,27 June 2017
Yesterday," Enjoyable, but lacking
","I was extremely impressed with Himesh Patel's lead performance, Lily James is always nice to see and of course we all love the Beatles' music. But other than those things, I'm probably not going to remember much about this film.
The romantic problems between James and Patel's characters seemed as if they were more appropriate for people who are in their late teens, not thirty year olds. The way that they interacted with each other seemed downright bizarre for older people, and that subplot seemed to branch into several directions that just didn't interest me.
I was also disappointed with the things that randomly disappeared from Patel's new world in addition to The Beatles. Bill Maher said, 'Ronald Reagan didn't destroy the Soviet Union. The Beatles destroyed it.' When it's revealed that a band that was extremely popular in the '90s and massively influenced by The Beatles disappeared, I thought that director Danny Boyle was going to show us things that would have happened without their influence. Instead, random things that have nothing to do with them are erased from his reality. Also, the Soviet Union dissolved regardless of their absence. :)Kate McKinnon is funny, and I laughed at several of her lines as a talent manager. However, even her performance was a bit too goofy. I work in L.A.-- as much as I hate agents and managers, I realized that I've seen three films this year ('Stan and Ollie,' 'Rocketman,' and this film) in which they are depicted as a bit too evil... even for them.In terms of Boyle's oeuvre, it's like his Trainspotting sequel: I liked it. I didn't love it. However, unlike T2, I won't rewatch this film.",6,0,1,5 July 2019
No Country for Old Men," Mediocre
","The entire film relies on a ridiculous first act turning point that seems a) inconsistent with the main character's personality and b) is something that 99% of people would not do because we would KNOW that is was too late to act anyway. So if your movie opens on a flawed premise the rest of it is dubious anyway.There is no ending. The most pretentious among us can opine and preen about the TRUE GENIUS OF THE ENDING, but for people who see through b.s. we know that it's a joke.To this day I cannot believe that some people continue to believe that this movie was better than 'There Will Be Blood.'",5,2,6,21 May 2010
The Favourite," Dreary, Depressing, Tedious.... Sporadically Entertaining
","If Tarantino directed this film I think it would be titled 'The Hateful Three'--- but maybe the queen character isn't quite as hateful as she is pitiable.There were times when I didn't want to follow any of their lives just because they were so abhorrent. Usually when people are unlikeable I want to follow them if the comedy is working. In this case, I laughed at very few of the film's jokes. A lot of this story seemed like a study in psychopathy-- especially with Emma Stone's character.Also, the man who pursued Stone's character reminded me of so many *modern* American men who pursue soulless and uninterested American women just because they're pretty-- women who eventually make cuckolds of them. I rarely flirt with any woman, and when she shows the slightest sign of disinterest to me I withdraw my attention to her immediately. So even many of the male characters in this movie were nauseating to me.The final shots in the film are tedious to the extreme. When directors got close shots of Steve McQueen's facial expressions they knew that he could emote so much without even speaking lines. In this case, with the extreme closeups of Stone and Olivia Colman, it's painfully pretentious. It did nothing for me.It has merits, though. The acting is good, and it's generally entertaining regardless of its despicable characters. I wasn't really thinking, 'when is this thing going to end?' until its final ten minutes.",5,9,30,2 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," My third favorite Tarantino film
","During the '90s if you said to me, 'in time, Leo DiCaprio will be one of the most masculine actors in Hollywood' there isn't a chance in hell I would have believed you.
For a long time he had a scrawny build and a youthful face. Like most moviegoers, I didn't regard him seriously as a tough guy until I saw 'The Departed' in 2006.
'The Wolf of Wall Street' and 'The Revenant' followed, and they cemented his place as a rugged leading man throwback. He does not disappoint in this movie as Rick Dalton when the scenes demand it.
Brad Pitt, who was always convincing in such a role since the start of his career, plays his character Cliff Booth to perfection. It's probably my favorite Pitt performance other than 'Twelve Monkeys.'
Director Quentin Tarantino designed this film in a way that each scene serves the function of creating likeability and credibility for its characters, not necessarily advancing the plot.
And in this day and age of 'toxic masculinity' and when studios want five foot tall women to take over men's roles, he made many bold moves. Dalton and Booth aren't afraid or ashamed to kick ass and take names. Yet, unlike Tarantino's previous work in which a head exploded when it took a round from a small caliber pistol or torrents of blood gushed from minor wounds, the violence isn't cartoonish.
Yes, the movie is a love letter to Hollywood, and people who have lived in L.A. probably appreciate it more than outsiders. There are references to and visuals of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Burbank Boulevard, Toluca Lake, Van Nuys, Panorama City, etc. that caused my brain to smile during the film-- especially because these places that I've seen ten million times in person were shown in a '60s style. A meta reference that caused my audience to chuckle: at one point Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate character sees spotlights oscillating at 'the porn theater' down the street from a restaurant. 'What is going on at the porn theater?' 'A premiere.' 'Porn theaters have premieres?' In fact, it's The New Beverly Cinema, the theater that Tarantino now owns and that played porn films during the '60s and '70s.I'm ashamed to admit that, like most Americans, although I'm very familiar with Charles Manson's history, I knew little about Sharon Tate and almost nothing about Jay Sebring. Tarantino did an excellent job of making them three dimensional people rather than background characters who served the plot. Ironically, if anyone is a background character whose brief appearance serves the plot, it's Manson himself. Such direction honors Sebring and Tate.I have one complaint about this film. With all due (immense) respect for Tarantino, I agree with critics who stated that Robbie was underused. A couple of years ago I stated on this blog that 'I, Tonya' was the best film of 2017, so I've known for a while that she is a phenomenal talent. YET I personally don't know how her role could have been expanded without blemishing the film. She did an outstanding job in this film, especially with her facial expressions at a movie theater, yet Tate's real life story has almost nothing to do with Dalton and Booth's fictional lives. It's like if the Angels used Mike Trout in an optimal pinch hitting role in the sixth or seventh inning of five consecutive games, and he hit grand slams every time. No fan would want to interfere with that streak, yet you would think that his team is severely unserved with him on the bench for most of the game.I rate this film 9 of 10 stars. It's my third favorite Tarantino film, and it caused me to break my rule about not applauding in a theater unless someone who worked on the film is in attendance. I applauded during its climax, and the odds are good that you will as well.",9,54,94,26 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Oh, the horrible. It BURNS.
","As someone stated on a message board, 'I should have known that it was horrible from the moment that I read that George Lucas loved it.' Like his prequels, it seemed like they were just throwing CG garbage on the screen for the sake of throwing CG garbage on the screen. Most of the scenes between Rose and Finn were the worst offenders. It seemed like their side adventure was getting deeper and deeper into the realm of a Saturday morning cartoon. It culminated in an ultra-goofy moment when BB8 is revealed to be the thing that it shooting up a bridge. He/it looked completely unnatural in that moment like it was in a Space Jam movie. I know that even a lot of J.J. Abrams's critics admit now that there is something to be said for using CG sparingly as he did.People have praised Mark Hamill's performance, and I agree with them-- for the most part. When I read all of the spoilers in advance, I thought that when I actually watched the movie, Luke's death-- as moronic as it was-- would at least cause me to shed a few tears. Nope. Instead, it looked like (sorry to sensitive readers) a constipated man was trying to defecate and somehow forced a smile in the middle of it. Luke died an undignified, Elvis Presley-like death. And I felt nothing. Later they said, 'he died in peace.' Really? That intense, sweaty expression was the exact opposite of peaceful. If Rian Johnson were a real director he would have said, 'please just look at the sunset in the same manner that you did in the first film.' But let's be real-- he probably *was* taking on that expression, then Johnson ordered him to look like Elvis in his last hours.In addition to the bad CG, there is just god awful video editing in general. There were a lot of awkward cuts in the scenes and between scenes that just took me out of the film. It's why people complain about the film's pacing.It somehow got a few things right: I enjoyed the lightsaber teamup battle with Kylo and Rey throwing down against Snoke's elite guards. The striking red colors in that set the scene in that battle really impressed me. I guess that it's one thing that Rian Johnson read about Star Wars lore-- the red guard is fierce. Unfortunately, they seemed like a much fiercer challenge than Snoke ever presented, which is laughable. Why didn't they just strike them down themselves if he was that weak? It's one of the tenets of the dark side: if an underling senses a master's weakness he pounces on it, and in the spirit of evolution and keeping the chain strong, the master welcomes the challenge. I can't imagine any dark side 'master' was ever as weak as Snoke.I also enjoyed... well, the porgs. And, frankly, the porgs, as loveable as they are, should not have been one of the few 'great' highlights from the film.This thing is just as depressing as the ardent fans are stating. I know that Abrams will direct the next film (thank god), but I doubt that I will care much about it. And each film that Rian Johnson makes in the next trilogy will just feel like a painful chore for me to watch. The man just does not know how to make a Star Wars film.",2,2,3,19 December 2017
Logan," The Best Jackman-as-Wolverine/Logan performance by light years
","I'll be real: since 2000 (and until last night) I've disliked or outright hated every Hugh Jackman performance as Logan/Wolverine. I thought that he was overdoing it and not seeming like the jaded, battle-hardened character who I came to love in the comics long before the movies were made. There was too much pep in his step and awkward mannerisms, even when Wolverine was supposedly in a great deal of mental pain. I LOVE a few of the X Men films, but I never bought into Jackman's portrayal.But this film is a gem. It was the ultimate sendoff for two actors who are retiring iconic characters. Jackman nailed the nuances and behaviors of the comic character this time. It was also my favorite Patrick Stewart-as-Professor X performance. I just wish that it didn't require this film's story's brutal circumstances to bring it out of them. I wish that Jackman had always played Wolverine in a similar manner throughout his run.The story is outstanding. It has great, gritty character development, real tension (unlike most comic movies) and moments of profoundly deep emotions (again, unlike most comic movies). A couple of years ago I would have laughed if you told me that I was going to shed a tear at the end of Jackman's run as Wolverine. But it happened.If I have only one very slight complaint it's that the absence of many other mutants is never quite thoroughly explained. Maybe the studio wants to do other films to fill in those gaps.But that slight deficiency will not cause me to lower my ten star rating. This movie is now my favorite X Men or X Men-related film.",10,0,3,3 March 2017
Midsommar," Pretentious Death Porn Disguised as High Art
","If you're familiar with 'Hereditary' then you probably know how this film will proceed: at first it seems like a conventional film with a glossy polish. That polish is eventually stripped bare, and you're left with very graphic, grotesque imagery.I will state that it definitely has merits, though. I value independence and other people's independence. I think that relying on communalism is a flaw, so when someone depicts cults well, my stomach turns. I'm also claustrophobic, so the cloistered, sheltered aspect of the cult in this movie freaked me out to a certain extent. I would not have remained in such a place for even a day, so I would have avoided all of the horror if I were in a similar situation in real life.But it's far too slow paced, and it lingers on human anatomy and its various states of decomposition a bit too long. I'm neither a mortician nor a necrophiliac, so such things did not interest me. I also want to state that the previous imdb viewers who have written, 'We really can't tell who are the evil people in this movie' scare me more than the movie itself. They are the simpletons for whom cults are designed. I believe that most sane people can agree that murder is a bit... ummmmm, draconian for the 'transgressions' (and even this term is debatable in some cases) that the visiting party committed against the cult.But their mentality makes for good horror. I just wish that director Aster had focused more on these reviewers-- I mean, cultists' mentality and less on defacing human flesh.",5,17,37,24 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Lowbrow, useless nonsense
","I only watched this movie because I love comic books. I thought that the first film was so-so, and I was slightly interested about the continuation of the story. I'm now done with this franchise.As other people have stated, it's 'Fast and Furious' in space. It looked like it was directed by Michael Bay-- a lot of CG vomit that amounts to nothing.The humor was very poorly timed and usually appealed to the dumbest people in the theater. For the smart people, the horrible 'dramatic and poignant' moments inadvertently made for the best comedy in the film.Even my favorite part-- Kurt Russell as a warm, nice father-- was ruined by a moronic script twist.To paraphrase a great movie line, 'what you have just shown to me is the dumbest thing that I can imagine. We're all dumber for having watched it. I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.' I'm hoping against hope that the huge cash haul for this film and 'Suicide Squad' isn't going to lead to dumber comic films for the troglodytes among us.",1,9,21,12 May 2017
The Disaster Artist," Good Comedy
","As a stand up comic myself, I was very pleased to see so many stand up comics in this film. They acted well. I've always wondered why so many stand ups of yesteryear (i.e.: George Carlin, Dennis Miller, Bob Saget, etc.) who were themselves onstage couldn't quite transfer that ability to screen acting well. I think that it's a rather easy transition after you've had your soul drained out of you onstage.Anyway, it was a pleasant element, as were the jokes in the script. James Franco is to be commended for acting poorly so well. Even his physical acting when his Tommy character was 'acting' in his movie was absolutely horrible. Nailed it. It's probably difficult for an experienced, talented actor to discard everything that he knows about his craft for weeks at a time.If you're familiar with film making, you're going to laugh when you realize that Seth Rogen's SCRIPT SUPERVISOR character seems to be taking over the role of director as Tommy's incompetence is exposed.It also had surprisingly touching and sympathetic moments between Tommy and his closest friend near the end.There were a few lulls in which I wasn't laughing and getting somewhat bored, but overall I was impressed.",10,1,2,9 December 2017
Inception," New Adventures in Movie-making, Starring Nolan
","It has only two faults: 1) Although Ken Watanabe is a good actor and delivered a great performance, I couldn't understand what he was saying half the time. 2) the obsessive focus on the top-- there were maybe 20 shots/insert shots of the top- whether it was spinning or motionless. We needed maybe 5.Otherwise, it's the kind of movie that I wanted to make when I moved to L.A. three years ago -- a stunningly brilliant psychological thriller.John Lennon said that he couldn't listen to the radio sometimes because when he listened to a great song he was driven mad with envy because he wished he wrote it. I am not comparing myself to Lennon in a movie sense, but as a small-time filmmaker, I understood that feeling when I watched 'Inception.' I doubt that I will watch anything that comes close to matching its greatness during the next 5 years, and I am astounded and pleased that the public received it so well. I thought that the masses were permanently stuck on wanting something as juvenile and basic as Avatar.",10,1,4,30 July 2010
Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman
","I got somewhat emotional as I drove home from the theater because I know that Zack Snyder, who is going through a family crisis with the suicide of his daughter and who suffered a lot of criticism for casting Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, absolutely nailed it.He knew what he was doing when he cast a stunningly gorgeous woman who was in the Israeli army. Who else who looks like Gadot could pull off the battle sequences so convincingly? It would seem absolutely moronic if he cast a sheltered beauty queen from America-- before this movie was released, many of his critics wanted him to use a busty, curvy American model instead of her.Gal IS Wonder Woman. With all due respect (and the respect is well deserved) to Lynda Carter, she owns that tiara now. I can't imagine that they will ever find a more perfect actress for the part when Gal hangs it up.Other than my adulation for Gal, I want to state as a World War I buff that director Patty Jenkins and her crew arranged the period pieces and the CG period pieces perfectly. I didn't see anything that struck me as out of place-- among the inanimate objects, anyway.Maybe it would seem odd at the time that an American (Chris Pine's character) was working solely with British intelligence as a spy or-- especially more confounding-- that a native American just randomly joined the battle in Europe as some sort of rogue agent for hire. But we must use the same suspension of disbelief that we use when we accept that Wonder Woman is a princess from an enchanted island who must fulfill her prophecy of destroying a god of war.Gadot's sensuous and intense facial expressions, her sweetness, her awesomeness in the role-- that's what I took from this movie even when the story went off the rails sometimes.Henry Cavill is probably the worst Superman ever in film or TV, Ben Affleck makes for a great Batman, and Gadot is incomparable as Wonder Woman. I'm looking forward to seeing how The Flash and Aquaman will play.",8,2,11,1 June 2017
Green Book," Definite Best Picture Candidate
","Confession: when the film introduced us to Dr. Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali), I thought that he was disgustingly pretentious and garish. He had exotic furnishings and clothes, and he sat on... a throne. I didn't know if the film was trying to present us to him as a self-actualized and respectable person. Although Viggo Mortensen's Tony character was ignorant, he seemed much more likeable to me than Shirley.I was extremely pleased as the film progressed to confirm to myself that they were willing to expose some of Shirley's pretentious tendencies as character flaws. Although his character arc wasn't as extreme as Tony's arc, this film's director Peter Farrelly and the multiple screenwriters who constructed it did a fine job of illustrating profound growth in each man. One of the saddest and most meaningful moments that I've ever seen in a film is when Tony returned to a massive, loving Italian family, and Shirley returned to his empty, sanitary, lonely apartment. Whereas he was a pariah in the deep south, he was now also a solitary figure in his own home. I'm unashamed to admit that I bawled. So my opinion of him did a complete 180. Mission accomplished, film.If it has flaws, I believe that it made Tony seem a bit too oafish, and he was condescended to by various people a bit too much. I enjoyed the hilarious, ironic
moments when he doesn't even seem to realize what he is saying-- i.e.: when speaking about Robert Kennedy: 'what else does he have to do?' What else does the Attorney General of the United States do aside from bailing out lesser-known musicians from jail? But I thought that they leaned on it a bit too much. Also, if you're really familiar with film making (a curse, to be sure) some of this material might feel a bit too 'safe' and paint-by-numbers.However, it's twenty times better than last year's 'Best Picture' winner ('The Shape of Water') even the vast majority of last year's Best Picture nominees.",8,2,5,27 November 2018
Alien: Covenant," Disaster with a few glimmers of accidental brilliance
","If this movie has a single glaring problem, it's that it takes the worst elements of '80s slasher horror and puts them in a couple of scenes. The most unpardonable moment in the film is when the David android thoroughly proves that he/it has a ghoulish fascination with biological weaponry and creating and befriending man-eating organisms, yet one of the characters follows him down a dark corridor alone. Anyone who has an I.Q. over 50 would outright refuse to follow that thing anywhere and/or destroy it immediately and/or call for assistance from the other crew members who were waiting nearby.There are also scenes in which the David character is very clearly aboard the ship, yet the crew just trusts that he is his 'safe' android brother Walt and does not run any sort of test to verify that he is, in fact, Walt. Apparently the ship has enough technology to amplify and project a distorted image that randomly appeared on someone's helmet just by scanning the helmet, yet it can't detect subtle differences between androids. Or the crew is just too lazy to safeguard their lives. Kill me.In a movie that emphasizes that organisms are mostly interested in their survival and propagation, humanity seems to have little concern about its survival. But if humanity were as dumb as the characters that are in this movie, we probably wouldn't deserve to live anyway.Katherine Waterston was a revelation to me, though. She injects sexiness, charm and great acting into a film that should have had its script thrown into a bonfire long ago. I'm looking forward to her future roles.",3,5,11,19 May 2017
