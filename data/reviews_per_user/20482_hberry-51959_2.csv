Blade Runner 2049," boring...
","The visuals are stunning.I enjoyed the soundtrack. Lot of people seem to dislike it. Actually the music was what did draw back my attention to the screen!The story seems forced.What is most bothering is that it is like the creator of the films and story, may it be P. K. Dicks or whoever, hates women or has a disturbed relationship with them.Almost every single woman in the film gets killed...They are just sex objects except the lieutenant and the other thing dressed in all white.they are either sex objects or their tummy gets sliced up or they are kept in isolation.Harrison Ford just looks old and the minute he turns up the film definitely goes downhill. They tried to squeeze in a cheap story to quickly make a connection to the first Blade Runner movie. Pathetic...I never liked the first Blade Runner neither. Just remember parts of it, but enough to see the main connections and I think in the first film the characters have not been idealised rather than being anti-heroic personas. Here the story/relation between Harrison Fords character (I do not bother remembering the names) and the android is turned into a romantic love story. It is ages ago when I saw the first BR but I remember that their 'romance' was more a kind of abusive rather than romantic.This new film at least has great visuals.The film is just a film about ???? and naked women, who may be able to give birth to a child or not and nevertheless are just there for sex or getting their tummies sliced up...",4,4,9,10 October 2017
Mother!," Very good - but will be misunderstood by most
","I was interested when I saw the advert of the film and who wrote the story and had a feeling what it might be about, as well because the posters seem to mislead you.I was wondering. OK It says Mother! but you see a young woman and obviously here husband. And then there is a couple that appears. Who is mother?With scepsis I went to see the film thanks to the bad reviews here. Glad I went anyway.The film is actually very easy to understand, with certain knowledge, but I think a lot of people will miss absolutely the point.If you get what the film is about, you will have fun. I think the fact people will miss the point of the film is, that they are not aware of the existence and power of mentally abusive mother-son (well actually mother-child, but here it is about mother-son) relationships and the psychological results. It is a butterfly effect which is described in this film. This explains the overwhelming and at some point stressful sequences at the end of the film, but when you get what the author wants to tell you, you realize it all makes some sense and that he is trying just to mirror the reality. The world. Chaos and destruction, caused by mankind.The title is Mother! Like in Black Swan it is about the influence of egocentric mothers on their children, their behavior and there relationships. No worries I did not spoil the plot mentioning this.. This is just the essence of the film and if you understand this and the psychology, you understand the plot.Think of Hitchcocks Psycho, Oedipus, projection, narcissism, emotional development. There is minimum one absolutely obvious analogy to Oedipus in this filmThere are more symbols, but a lot of them I did not get yet. Will watch it again when the DVD gets released. It is not entertainment. It is actually like a picture he drew. I am not much into art, but even I can see and appreciate this.I think the actors are doing there job well. Sometimes it was a bit theatrical and exaggerated I have to admit. But here again, only if you grasp the plot, you'll get why they are playing their roles the way they do. It makes sense somehow. Taken that nothing is what it seems to be in this film. Nothing is 100% something. Mother, wife, son, father... These are just symbols. Each character is a symbol. That is why they do not have names. it is not a story about a couple that meets an other couple. It is a story about Mother! I think that is why they put the exclamation mark behind it, so that people pay attention to the title! At the end I have to say, that it is not all Mothers!s fault... I have to say this, because like in Adam and Eve, the film transports a similar message about mankind, women and paradise idea. It can be therefore something that is serving the ideas of sexist people which is negative about the film, but does no harm to its quality! He is doing and telling a story that (man) literature is telling since ever... :)therefore for Mother! 8 stars!",8,3,17,16 September 2017
