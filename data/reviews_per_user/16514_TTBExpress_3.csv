Gremlins," Spielberg does it again!
","Along with Stephen King,Stephen Spielberg is one of my favirote movie writers/directors,and his 1984 classic Gremilins is great.It had great suspense and horror,of course it wasn't enough to scare me,but no shame there,although there are movies that can scare me,there are very few,no more than five.ANyway,Gremlin dosen't try to be a comepletely Horror film,it also has some great comedy,like when the Gremlins are watching Snow White.It has very good and likeable charicters,and a not so bad sequel,get the family,popcorn and soda,Gremlins will give you a night of thrills,laughs and fun,by the way,you can thank me later!",Null,0,1,24 May 2002
The Others," An upcoming classic!
","It can't be a classic yet,because it's not old enough,but still good.Not many good horror movies are made today,because of the Freaking,lousy,obnoxious crappy retarted moronic,perverts who only come for the sex/nudity!That's not cool,that's sick,it's because of you we get so many dumb movies today,you should be ashamed of cursing the movie industry,what slime!Anyway,the Others,although it couldn't scare me,still,it was a good movie,with decent plot,good scares(not for me of course)and some great effects,and one of the most twisted endings in history,I won't tell you because IMDb wouldn't approve,but I will tell you,it is shocking,one of the things this movie is famous for,only PG-13,so get the family,get the movie,but you better watch out for...The Others!",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A great adaption,not to be missed!
","Usauly when I see a movie that's so called adaption of a book,I haven't read the book,but here,I read all 4 before seeing this.Okay,it isn't a perfect adaption,but what is!This is definetly the best adaption of a book movie out of the ones I've seen.Other adaption novel movies in which I read the book to,not only sucked on terms as an adaption,but sucked period,even if the movoies weren,t novels,I still hate'em,but not here!Sure they add and subtract a few scenes here and there,but what adaption movie dosen't!Reccomended?You can bet your life on it!",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
