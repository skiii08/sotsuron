Requiem for a Dream," Addiction is what you longed for
",One of my favorites. A must watch for everyone as it deals with addiction in all ages. Each and every character in the movie played their part perfectly to make this movie an epic. The movie is about drug addiction. And the aftermath of drugs. But in my opinion the movie also depicts a lot about addiction and not only to being the drugs. The addiction of wanting what you wanted for so long that you believe it is true. Once you can resist addiction you can do whatever you want to do in your life. But teenagers do not understand this. At first they say 'We want to just try out' and then can't resist. There is medical treatment for drugs but your self will is the most effective way of letting them go off. In my opinion everyone should watch this movie and see what drugs can do to you.,9,0,1,22 January 2016
Airlift," A must watch movie
","This is really a must watch biopic for everyone. The movie is about will of two people to save 1, 70, 000 Indians. One worked hard through all the efforts in Kuwait and Iraq while the other one moved rocks inside India to save the people.This is the movie about the largest civilian mission ever and yes after watching this movie you all can say that Bollywood's standards are moving fast. Akshay Kumar perfectly demonstrated the frustration, will for survival and humanity everything in all aspects.I loved the movie and yes surely wants say 'Well Done' to real the person 'Sunny Mathews' who made this all possible back in 1990 when India was not as renowned among the world as it is today.",10,3,5,25 January 2016
The Secret in Their Eyes," Truly Remarkable
",I just loved the concept of the movie. Even the acting the acting was to class but the concept behind the movie and portrayal just left me speechless. I do not understand the language and watched it with subtitles only but still I find this one much more worthy than other usual English or Hindi movies as the movie bounds you all the time. It does not let you get bored. The acting was good too it totally complements the storyline and the direction. I can not pick out any loose ends in this movie and would surely remind to everyone who wants to see a movie with a great storyline.PS : These are my personal opinions. You must watch the movie and write yours.,8,3,3,21 February 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," All it takes is will
",As everyone else must have mentioned first things first. Each character portrayed their role to perfection that is why this movie has got so good reputation.Now I will talk about my point of view. The thing i liked the most was the will to stay alive by Ron Woodroof and his willingness to help others. The transformation from being some one who does not gives a damn to the one who cares about each and everyone around him is the real thing. Not everyone can transform like Ron Woodroof did in his real life and Matthew McConaughey in its reel counterpart. Matthew McConaughey perfectly demonstrated the pain what Ron Woodroof might have gone through. He really showed the willing to have more of life whatever he can get. The urge each and every dying person has. In my opinion the everyone 'dying or not' should have a will to do something that is what they all might be lacking if they are not succeeding.,8,3,4,23 January 2016
Frozen," Great VFX
",One of the very good VFX movies. I loved the movie because of the effects the movie has and the detailing that they bear.The detailing of the snow palace was phenomenal. The way the snow shines and the every detailing that a natural ice has is been shown in the movie. Though storyline is not the best among the animated movies but still the movie is a nice watch. For children it is really a good movie. I liked the movie only on the visual effects part and nothing else as it is one of the good animated movies. I would recommend this movie only to those who love to watch animated movies with good effects and not to the ones who are looking for good screenplay and storyline.,6,0,5,26 January 2016
Schindler's List," Masterpiece
",The movie is one of the fewer biography movies that I have recommended to others. The portray of each and every character is spectacular. Liam Neeson's acting was no less than a pure portrayal of shear reality. He depicted each and emotion with all its perfection. From an unconcerned person to a emotional being with so much humanity is the real transformation showed by him. The difference between what you can do and what you should do is the best thing shown the movie. Though a biography still all the additional factual details are also so minute that you can not differentiate. Spielberg is a gem of cinema.,10,28,48,22 January 2016
When Harry Met Sally...," Good Movie
","I used to watch thriller movie. I rarely watch comedy movies but the ones I have watched I will rate it third in my all time comedy movies after Forrest Gump and me, myself and Irene. This movie is not just about comedy but also about the question 'Can two people of opposite sex be friends only?'. I do believe that yes they can. The movie is also about love and marriage. 'Divorce' is not common in India as it is in US. But still 'Love' always thrives over 'Marriage'. As you can't be happy with a person you are not in love with. As depicted in the movie as well that it is all about love and not about sex only. If you really love someone you will always want them to be happy. This part is perfectly demonstrated in the movie and I loved that about the movie.",7,2,2,24 January 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," A must watch
","One of the best movies I have watched till date.A must watch for people of every age and gender.You just don't know the whole time has passed.You will not be able to miss even a single moment of the movie.Best Screenplay One of the best acting I have seen in movies.Storyline is just WOW I do want to see this movie in theater if it is again shown on multiplexes.This kind of movie remind you that you do not need VFX to make a good movie.This movie is just the magic of the writers, actors and all others without much need of any high tech gadget that will add up the cost.Really Awesome",10,0,1,15 January 2016
Spectre," Nice Movie But Not The Best So Far
","I do acknowledge that this is not by far the best bond movie but neither is the worst one. I only watched 4 of the bond movies (Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale, Skyfall and this one). In my personal opinion I will rate this movie third out of the four just ahead of quantum of solace. The main thing that I liked out the movie is the attitude that James Bond bears from the beginning. That fearlessness and attitude of being someone with great significance are the highlights that I liked about this movie.Not every actor can act as Daniel Craig acted in the movie. He totally justified the character in all aspects. I really liked the movie and would recommend this movie too.PS : Do watch the Skyfall before watching this movie.",7,1,4,20 January 2016
The Martian," Mars no far away
",Thought the movie is fiction but the things like growing food on mars is not too far away. With all the efforts our space companies putting to make this fiction a reality will show results soon.The second aspect that I liked about the movie was the joining hands of Chinese and US space agencies for the greater cause of humanity. If we share what we know with all others then we can expect a speed up space exploration missions.The center stage the movie was Matt Damon and he really performed to the pitch perfection. Movies which are centered at a single personality sometimes get boring but this movie was not felt boring at any point of time.I will recommend this movie to everyone who really wants to see the pure acting.,8,2,4,25 January 2016
