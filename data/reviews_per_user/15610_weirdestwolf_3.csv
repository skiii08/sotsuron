Black Swan," Black Swan- Blown Away
","If there's one thing I could say about Black Swan, it would be that it is definitely not overrated. Obviously, the movie is supposed to win a gazillion academy awards and such, but in all honesty, it deserves every single one.With such a great cast, how could one go wrong? Natalie Portman has truly outdone herself in this one, her character escalating from a mere nervous perfectionist to a textbook case schizophrenic. I found the analogy of the transformation the white swan and the black swan to Nina's transformation very interesting. The hallucination scenes were skillfully done and felt real every time. I also felt that the beautifully rendered Tchaikovsky music contributed greatly to the tone of the music.We have all heard about how dark, disturbing, and depressing this movie is, but when I came and saw it I found that it was also strikingly beautiful. The visuals were simply amazing- I especially loved the dance at the very beginning of the movie. The lighting was great and so was the camera work. The story was also beautiful in a kind of heartbreaking way, as I find destruction to have its own kind of beauty. Nina's journey to the top and her fall were fascinating and beautiful.The only complaint that I have about this movie was that it was constantly intense, all of the time. There was no lull in the action for the audience to catch its breath. Still, Nina's character was developed very well even while all of these events were going on.I loved it so much I feel like everybody should go see it, but of course it contains profanity, blood and gore, sex scenes, and intense hallucinations, so of course it's not everybody's cup of tea. However, if you can stomach all of these things, you must see it!",9,1,4,30 December 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Eclipse- better than the last two films.
","I do not claim to be a fan of the Twilight Saga- either for the movies, or the books. In my opinion, the writing of the books and the movies is mediocre and some parts of the story are rather shaky.However, I do find the story sweet. To me, of course it is a story of a human girl who falls in love with a vampire and also has feelings for a werewolf, but it's also about the many different facets of love, and what they can lead to, for better or for worse.So, obviously, I was frustrated with the first two films- I did not think that the writing allowed perfectly capable actors and actresses to portray the sweetness and humor of the story in full. It seemed like a shame- Kristen Stewart being my favorite actress, I had seen her in other films where she did a stellar job at acting her character. The scripts were written too darkly and kept the characters from developing into a three dimensional person, vampire, or werewolf.From the first ten minutes I could tell that Eclipse was different- the characters were lighter and more real, and easier to take seriously. The acting improved ten fold with more realistic lines, and it was a visually pleasing film. Not to mention the soundtrack, which was simply to die for (at least for my musical tastes.) Of course, not everything could be rock solid, though. There were a couple chunks of dull long dialogue that slowed down the movie. However though, Eclipse being such a complicated story, I suppose some long dialogue was required to convey the plot to the audience, some of which had never read the books.All in all I found it a very sweet and entertaining movie and would be pleased to see it again.",7,3,10,9 July 2010
The Runaways," The Runaways- Spot On
","I can't say that I've been a fan of The Runaways for a long time, but when I saw the trailer for this I liked their sound so I researched them a bit, found out more about them. Now I think I can say that I am a fan of The Runaways. Having never read Cherie Currie's book, I didn't know exactly what to expect, but from internet research I had a rough idea of how relationships should go- between the girls, between the girls and Kim Fowley, and between Cherie and her family.From my point of view, it was spot on. Dakota, though she didn't remind me at all of Cherie, did a wonderful job of showing her steady downhill spiral into drugs and her strained relationship with her family. Kristen Stewart, as far as I'm concerned, nailed the role of Joan Jett right down the the 'cool hunch.' It was a delight to get to see her play such a different role than the ones she has played in the past- she should play more like this. I especially loved the part where she was yelling at Lita and trashing the recording studio- fierce! All in all, it was a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of fifteen.",8,3,8,27 July 2010
