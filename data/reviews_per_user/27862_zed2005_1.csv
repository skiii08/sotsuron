The Avengers," If you liked Transfomrers you would love this movie!
","I initially had a feeling that this movie would be a too much superhero overload for my taste. But then I saw the positive reviews on IMDb and RottenTomatoes and also the comments Youtube etc... and I felt I had been wrong and they might have pulled it off really well! So I went to watch it.But I felt completely cheated after watching this film, how could IMDb ratings be so misleading?! The only reason this film might be remembered could be because it would become part of the case study 'How a below average film could be made into blockbuster by hyping it up on internet and social networks.' I don't write reviews in general, but forced to do it for this film such a a letdown and waste of time even though it's got one of the best ever ratings on IMDb.If IMDb rating is actually true I feel worried for the people who can't see through the actions and special effects.Overall, you might enjoy this Film if you have enjoyed Micheal Bay's Transformers, if you didn't you might find it very difficult to sit through this movie as well.",1,386,786,29 May 2012
