Black Swan," Style over Substance
","Although there are many great user reviews here, I am certain the critics influenced much of that.Yes, the ballet sequences are filmed beautifully. If you're a fan of ballet, this may be more interesting for you than most audience members. And yes, Natalie Portman is a brilliant performer. Sweetness and innocence literally exudes from her in a some magical way. She's a phenomenon. Vincent Cassel is so sexy and magnetic --truly, the cast was great.But, the movie is still style over substance. Way over. There is just not much happening. It's pretty slow. The only interesting parts are her hallucinations. This movie is SO MUCH like the director/writer's last two films, 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Pi'. (And 'Pi' is possibly the worst film I've ever seen!) Black Swan has better-known actors and a much bigger budget, but the bottom line is this: these films are about a person who is slowly spiraling out of control. The person is paranoid, anxiety-ridden, obsessive, fearful, and eventually hallucinatory. There is almost always hallucinated self-inflicted injuries, gore, and gratuitous sex, in addition to a lot of nothing-happening scenes..... just nothing. I am heartily pulling for Natalie Portman for the Academy Award as she is and always has been a 'to-die-for' actor. I think anyone who doesn't adore her has not seen her films. But, I certainly hope this mess of a movie doesn't receive any other awards!",4,7,14,7 February 2011
Warrior," Incredibly moving story! Great screenplay.
","Wow! They took what could have been a maudlin concept and made it remarkable. Our group absolutely loved it. Most of us sat there and cried our eyes out. I cried toward the end, during the end, and even AFTER the film on the way home.If you have a brother or a sister that you love, you must see this film. And you should see it on the big screen. The score, soundtrack, filming, direction, editing.... all were integral pieces of this beautiful puzzle.What MOVING performances by all three men --Nolte, Edgerton, and Hardy. It has a brilliant, subtle, quiet kind of screenplay, to be a film with so much action and drama. You have to keep watching and don't miss a moment, as it's totally unpredictable. And yet, it's absolutely realistic.An incredible, moving story. Not just for men, but for women too. We absolutely loved it. I can't wait to see it again.",9,7,17,1 September 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," Everything a movie should be.....
","We laughed our heads off; we got teary-eyed; we held our collective breath(s); we beamed with happiness and pride; we were stunned with surprise a few times, too. These characters are LIKABLE -- a little unpredictable -- but still WONDERFUL. The story was mesmerizing, well-paced, and COMPLETE.Robert DeNiro was, as always, brilliant. Simply brilliant.This film is a breath of fresh air in all ways. Although deeply troubled and confused, Bradley Cooper is absolutely lovable here. One just can't help but pull for everyone in this story.I DO hope this film does well at the Academy Awards. Many of the other films nominated are overly artsy, pretentious, lack story-telling talent, and are DULL. Not this movie! Go see it on the big screen --you will love it.",10,4,8,12 January 2013
The White Ribbon," Wow! What a waste of time this was!
","Wow! I think the only time I've been more frustrated by a film is when trying to figure out a David Lynch film (or two). Except this was SLOWER.... much, much SLOWER! I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless he or she is the most ardent student of film who is interested in modern black and white cinematography. Please don't waste your time if your like a gripping screenplay or story.None of the questions raised in this film were answered. The viewer is left hanging at every turn. The crimes committed were brutal and the ONLY reason to stay with this film for the two plus hours (very long hours)is the hope of getting some answers, but to no avail. No answers whatsoever! Just questions.I'd say the only bright spot in this film was the romance between the upright, honorable school teacher and his shy fianc√©e. They were both charming and memorable.But the rest? Yikes! There were no characters developed that one could pull for. So many of the children and teens favored the others that it was difficult to figure out who was who for the longest time.... not just favored each other physically; but in manner and spirit as well. Everyone seemed the same. The children were all alike, the women were all alike, etc. Dull, dull, dull.And yes, there are some parallels between the villagers and the soon-to-come Hitler's Third Reich. But, come one... there were parallels between this film and The Village of the Damned, too. But that doesn't make this a good film. It's screenplay is terribly weak. There are many spots where it simply ceases to exist. Overall, I can categorically state this was a very unsatisfying film for me.However, I DO highly recommend the original 1950's version of The Village of the Damned (starring Ray Milland), however. :)",4,11,34,30 August 2010
Pi," Boring, painful, claustrophobic
","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I went to see it with another movie fan at the theatre in 1998 and we almost left about 3/4 of the way through. We later regretted not leaving and joked about how bad the movie was for years! It became our benchmark for movies --you know, 'How bad is it? Is it as bad as 'Pi'?'Pi' is about a young man slowly going insane, mostly alone in his apartment. He hallucinates a lot. There is lots of hallucinatory self- inflicted gore and violence. He's very paranoid, claustrophobic, fearful, but brilliant. You watch the paint dry on his apartment walls, watch his face while he does nothing, and even watch as he picks his nose. There was some meaningless dialog between shallow, not-likable characters.I agree with the other reviewer here who said it should have been called 'Pain'.Amazingly, 11 years later, I have just seen Black Swan because the critics are AGAIN calling this writer/director's work brilliant --and they even mention his earlier work 'Pi'. (I actually laughed out loud when I read it.) As much as I adore Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel, I was determined not to go spend money to see Black Swan at the theatre, remembering 'Pi' as I do. But the stupid Academy Award has nominated Black Swan for awards in several categories, so I felt compelled to go see it. I always see all or almost all of the nominated films every year before the Oscars, so I decided to give it a chance and hoped it would be good.Guess what? It's about a young woman who is slowly going insane. She's hallucinating, dreaming up a lot of self-inflicted gore and violence. She's very paranoid, anxiety-ridden, fearful, but she's brilliant....Of course, Natalie Portman IS actually brilliant. Her performance was incredible, as were many of the actors' performances in Black Swan; but sadly, the story and script are TERRIBLY SIMILAR to 'Pi'. I wouldn't see 'Pi' again on a bet. Seriously, life is too short.",3,2,5,7 February 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," We loved it! Imaginative, Romantic, Intriguing
","I was invited to a free screening with a big group of friends in Atlanta. I thought it might be right up my alley and it definitely WAS. It's similar to 'Inception' (one of my very favorites), but simpler.This fantasy-suspense-action-love story is very intriguing and ROMANTIC. I don't think any of us have seen Matt Damon be this passionate about a woman in film before. THIS is the very best Matt Damon I've ever seen -- he is at his most charming, lovable, and most moving here. And that's coming from a big fan of the Bourne Identity films, The Departed, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Rounders, and many other Damon films.The Adjustment Bureau has a great supporting cast. Emily Blunt was delightful and mysterious..... There were quite a few laughs as well as some gasps from our audience (a packed house, too.) Most importantly, the STORY is intriguing. Yes, that's what makes the film unforgettable is simply the story. It's imaginative and very well-written.It's a family-friendly film as best I remember --maybe PG-13 because of some almost-nudity; but no swearing, no gore, no bad scares, and no drugs or alcohol. It's all suspense, charm, intrigue, action, and romance!If you are not a fan of The Matrix, Inception, Moon, Memento, or other fantasy type mind-benders, then you may not enjoy this film. We loved it though. We heard rave reviews from other audience members afterward, too.",9,238,374,7 February 2011
Prisoners," Go see it! Go see it! Superb thriller.
","If you liked 'Mystic River' or 'Gone Baby Gone', GO SEE THIS FILM! It was one of the most intense, suspenseful, moving, frightening films I've ever seen (and I'm a 53 year old film buff.) 'Prisoners' is not a horror story; not a murder-mystery; but a sort of 'kidnapped' thriller genre. It's exquisitely told without modern-day-film tricks like shaky cameras; without an actor saying 'the F word' in every other sentence; without a dub-step sound track; and without gratuitous frights or even unnecessary action or car chases. It's a story of a horrible kidnapping and those who are affected. It's told with such compassion and believability. The characters make excruciating choices --choices that make you shake your head in stunned wonder. And the cast! Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano! How much acting chops can one get on a movie set? And the screenplay is superb. I was on the EDGE OF MY SEAT for the entire film. I am simply blown away by this film --blown away. It's a 10 out of 10. Go see it on the big screen so you'll know why it's nominated for many awards in a few months.Congratulations to all involved in the making of 'Prisoners' for a fine, classic film that will haunt your audience and make us very thoughtful for quite a while.",10,2,4,29 September 2013
Zombieland," Fun, Fear, and Laughter!
","We loved this movie! We will definitely watch it again and again. Woody Harrelson was born for this role. He's just fantastic. It was definitely very gory. It had a lot of action and suspense, but it was sweet, too.There was GREAT character development and a brilliant modern script. And there is a terribly surprising, wonderful cameo. I LOVED THAT SURPRISE!I think it's one of the best movies of the year. If you are even the slightest bit interested, go see it. Be prepared to have fun! We sure did.",8,1,4,5 October 2009
Defiance," Unforgettable, Moving, Oscar-worthy film.
","I cannot say enough wonderful things about this film. It was so moving, so beautiful, and simply unforgettable. I am thankful to Edward Zwick for making it. This is a gripping, incredible true story of bravery and responsibility, as well as human failings and flaws. I can hardly wait to see it again. It is a must-see. I have seen most everything released in 2008 and it is one of my top picks, no doubt.This is the kind of film that should be required viewing for all high school students (along with the Pianist, Valkyrie, and some others). I hope it will be one day.The actors and script are first-rate. The story is inspiring and simply unforgettable. I hope there are many, many awards for this film. I think, even if the Academy is short-sighted enough to ignore it, that it will go down in history as one of the greats.",9,6,15,17 January 2009
Tombstone," One of the best ever!
","I saw this on the big screen when it came out in 1993. After enjoying most every minute of this rich, colorful, and gripping movie, I just couldn't believe it wasn't getting more attention. It's one of the most quotable, fun, moving, memorable films ever. THIS is what movie-making is really about --creating and celebrating unforgettable characters in a compelling story.And they managed to make it tense and moving with minimal cursing, sex, nudity, gore, etc. It is simply wonderful. Certainly not a family film; but tame on some levels, and I love it. I especially adored Dana Delaney in her role --she was breathtaking and fascinating. Oh, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday? Are there words? He SHOULD have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards for that performance. It's a crying shame he was not. To this day, it is a crying shame he was not nominated.There were many good performances in Tombstone. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was achingly sad and believable as the morphine-addicted Mattie. Sam Elliott was in top form. He was so calm and reserved --when he lost his temper in one scene, it was really frightening. Billy Zane, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Boothe, Kurt Russell, Stephen Lang --many of the actors were simply fabulous. And WHAT a cast of actors! My gosh! If you watch it today (2011), it's amazing how many actors you recognize who were fairly unknown then.Wonderful character development. It was so easy to get involved in the characters' stories and to pull for them. Yes, they took a few liberties with historical facts; but they brought the gunfight at the OK Corral and its back story to life in a grand, wildly enjoyable film with rich, interesting characters.Tombstone is a '10' in my book. It always will be. Our family LOVES it and we quote it often. Thanks to everyone who took part in making such a great film for us, your audience, to enjoy again and again for years to come.",10,0,2,7 February 2012
V for Vendetta," Fabulous Film
","For every U.S. Congressman and State Representative or Senator who has been afraid to speak up in the past four years or so -- PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM. This film is patriotism at its very core; at its best and most heroic. My family loved this movie, and we're recommending it to every thinking person we know. However, if you're a fanatical Christian or a Republican conservative -- don't bother watching it; you probably won't like it.Once again, thank goodness, Hollywood filmmakers and actors have GUTS and foresight when most of our American so-called leaders in our state capitols and in Washington DC do not seem to.V (portrayed by Hugo Weaving) is intriguing, moving, and truly unforgettable -- and I describe him so even though he is behind a mask; and he must make us understand him without the benefit of any facial expression whatsoever. He is really spectacular. All around great performances, brilliant writing, and explosive subject matter. I believe it is a ground-breaking film, and I hope for a huge success. We will go back to the theatre to see it again soon. Bravo! Bravo!",9,2,5,19 March 2006
