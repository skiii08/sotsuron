The Blair Witch Project," Most over-rated movie ever...
","This movie was the most over-hyped film ever.  I did not find the film remotely frightening.  The only thing that left in terror is that I paid to see it and wasted 90 minutes of my time.  If this movie scared you, please stay away from Scooby Doo: The Movie and Winnie the Pooh's Halloween Adventure or you may never sleep again.  And please, don't watch Casper. Just my two cents.",1,0,2,1 August 1999
