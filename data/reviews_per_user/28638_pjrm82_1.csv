The Ring," Wonderful movie which will have you hugging yourself in your seat
","I saw the movie tonight. It is great. I was very scared. The geography of the movie is very accurate. I am from Seattle and they did a great job getting things right. After coming out of the movie theater, I was a little scared because we were only a few blocks from the apartment where Rachel lived. I screamed, I laughed, and I felt like I was sitting through a very entertaining movie. Side note... As I got home tonight I looked on my caller ID and saw the phone number 000-0000 called at 6:13 PM. 7 days, 7 rings, coincidence? I don't know. But its got me shaking.",10,0,0,16 October 2002
