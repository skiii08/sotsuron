Hereditary," UNEXPECTEDLY SCARY
","Wonderfully written, viciously acted and Toni Collete really bring her demons to the movie set. This movie will keep you on the edge and with every twist and turn, you cant afford to blink. For some viewer, this sort of slow poking horror drama wont suit your taste but for a horror buff liked me, this is a jewel of them all. Only every few years this sort of breathtaking movie comes along so enjoy it while you can.",8,0,1,27 August 2018
