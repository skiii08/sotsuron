The Benchwarmers," Average; had potential, didn't use it...
","The Benchwarmers/2006/**Main Stars: Rob Schneider David Spade Jon Heder Jon LovitzWell, the good news is that this film was actually one star funnier than Jon Heder's feature film Napoleon Dynamite. Congrats! Not as stupid or nonsense and this film actually had a point to it. Yet did I laugh much? Sorry, no. This film had a story but was missing the directing. Where was the acting involved? Why was the slapstick getting so old? Maybe because every scene involved it. I have to tell you this film was probably the film with the most 'comebacks' I have ever seen. 'Hey, it's Richie (David Spade), the gay video store clerk and Clark (Jon Heder), the retarded newspaper boy.' Gus (Rob Schneider) 'comes back' with a good one. 'Hey, it's Fairy Jerry (Craig Kilborn).' Then Jerry 'comes back' with one of the most horrible ones I've ever heard! 'Hey, it's Gus Bus!' No laughs. Gus instead sarcastically says that that one was too good. Then here comes Mel (Jon Lovitz) wanting the grown men that act like kids to join his created team 'The Benchwarmers'. This team is a little league team (even though three grown men are on it). Okay then. Then there are the nerds that start the team up putting it on the internet for other nerds to watch. They even get a bus called Gus Bus brought to you by the very odd Mel. The team gets their own baseball cards consisting of not only their name but their stats too. Gus gets all the good stats while Clark and Richie get the fouls and strikeouts and even swinging the bat so hard it flies out of his hand and hits a windshield of a car- that's Clark. Then he gets beat up by the opposing team member. The film continues to impress the audience with many kids laughing at stupid slapstick or nauseating or 'comeback' scenes. While the teens are either gossiping to their boyfriend or girlfriend or cursing at a scene that just happened which I did hear a stupid teen do. Yawn. The story continues with slapstick and stupid jokes. It also gets involved a little too much in some scenes which was amateurish on the writers' parts. I'm telling ya, the movie has potential; it just doesn't use it. Instead of all these stupid 'comeback' scenes which got really old, really fast, they could have had some actual funny scenes where I burst out laughing not just sniggering or smiling which I did throughout the entire film. While the audience is going 'HAAAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA!', 'HOLY S**T!', 'AAAAAHHHH, THAT'S NASTY', I'm sitting there with no emotion, wondering when there will be an 'LOL' (Laugh Out Loud) moment if there will be one at all. I have to admit they tried and succeeded in about two or three scenes. But I didn't just look for the humor. Okay, maybe I did. But there was also meaning in the film. People getting bullied, picked on. How can you improve that? Will you ask for forgiveness, bullies, before it's too late? There was actually a story which is also important. But I mainly looked for the laughs and didn't get much out of it. They had potential and they could have gone a lot further yet they just didn't use it. Too much slapstick and 'comeback' scenes and also scenes that really did not need to be shown. No, sorry, I do not recommend this film. I will recommend it for people that use 'comebacks' often or like slapstick. In my opinion, slapstick got really old, really fast, after 'The Three Stooges'.

National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Treasure: Movie of Secrets
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets/2007/**1/2Main Stars: Benjamin Gates: Nicolas Cage Riley Poole: Justin Bartha Abigail Chase: Diane Kruger Patrick Gates: Jon VoightNot bad. Not bad at all. Not good either. I don't care about the farfetchedness. I just care about how the story is laid out. It is confusing, really. There are dozens of clues that lead to even more clues and more and more. I thought the first one was a lot but this is the story of number one times two. You're in for a lot of cramming in those two hours. Time went fast though because regardless of how utterly ridiculous the whole thing is, it is a thrill ride. A cinematic thrill ride.The first one was great. I don't know why I liked it so much but for some reason it hit the spot. It was extremely far-fetched but almost ingenious in a way. It kept my attention throughout the whole thing. This one did too. But with not as much interest in the plot and how it would all resolve. The resolution for number one was good. However, I was not satisfied with how this one ended. Don't ask me why. Maybe it's a psychological thing.Anyway, this film's plot is one that can't be described in words, actions, writing, customs or any other form of communication because it is the most convoluted plot since the third 'Pirates' installment. Remember how much difficulty I had with describing that plot? It'll be the same for this. That's why I'm not going to tell you anything but what the previews implied and a few other summaries, etc. etc. Nevertheless, it's the opinion that counts.What is a good way to summarize the entire convoluted two hour film? Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is on yet another mission. He's a history nut so he's perfect for the job. The mission is to find out secrets about the assassination of President Lincoln. Things like: Who was involved in the assassination? What lead to it? Why did they choose to cooperate in the plan? But how is that going to happen? About fifteen convoluted clues later, we end up with an unsatisfactory ending that doesn't really prove much except for the main thing in Ben Gates' mind. Was Ben Gates' great-great grandfather Thomas Gates involved in President Lincoln's assassination? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Even after seeing the film I might still have both thoughts. That's what I didn't like. None of the clues really led to anything except more clues and no final result. All that happened just to be lead with another question. Perhaps they did that on purpose. However, the first one ended with not another clue but actually ended well. It was summed up pretty clearly, I think. Plus, it was much more entertaining and not too many plot points were put in to make it more and more confusing.The movie is still entertaining though. I'll give it that. It takes a LOT of effort to make a feature length film and one that still keeps your attention is worth a positive rating. And I think the way I rated this film was fair. It's right in the middle of average to good. The characters in the film can assist to that. Cage, Voight (playing Patrick Gates, Ben's father), Bartha (the clueless friend Riley), and Kruger (playing the brains of the pack and the woman) are all well-written and entertaining characters. That's another positive note. Helen Mirren (playing Ben's mother) was OK. So was Ed Harris (playing the villain that wants the treasure just as much as Gates). I have a feeling all the writers involved in this film know how ridiculous the premise is. We all do. But they write for fun. They want it to be fun. They want it to be mindless entertainment. But, when you think about it the entertainment is not mindless. You do have to know at least some of what's going on. Otherwise, there's no point in watching the movie.But I still won't call the film good. It's ridiculous; it's exhausting; it's entertaining; it's convoluted. And they most likely used some formula.All that comes out to about what my rating is. It's hard to rate a film like this. Because, again, you're not looking for any plausibility at all in a film like this. And if you are you must have been born yesterday or even today.But the fact that even at the end of the film you don't really feel satisfied but instead feel confused and none of your questions really seemed to be answered.I felt that way. It's almost like I didn't really see a film. I saw what was more like an idea or tons of ideas plopped into one package. The film is a book of secrets and a book of confusion.Did you find my review disorganized and convoluted? If you did I'm perfectly fine with that because I know I'm not alone.Movie directed by Jon Turteltaub.",6,2,6,25 December 2007
Vertigo," Excellent, raving! The best Hitchcock film EVER!
","Vertigo/1958/****Main Stars: James Stewart Kim NovakAlfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' and 'North by Northwest' are tied in first place. Followed close by 'Rear Window' in second place and others in third, fourth and so on The first time I had seen this film was not that long ago and I only saw the second half of the film. The second time I saw it, I was in to it so much, I probably only blinked a half a dozen times. Everyone knows that you blink every six seconds but when I saw this film, I hadn't realized one blink at all! This is a movie I would add to my must-see/recommended list along with 'The Untouchables' and other classic films. The main star in 'Vertigo' is John Ferguson (James Stewart) who is afraid of heights ('I have acrophobia which gives me vertigo and I get dizzy', he says). This is one film where you are let me stress the word required to listen to the dialog. At first I hadn't listened to the dialog and so I was extremely confused. So what you have to do is listen very carefully to get the point (main point) of the movie. In this movie, Ferguson is madly in love with a woman named Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). If you listen to the dialog in this film, you'll know why John had to go searching for her and to follow her every move. If you didn't listen to the dialog, too bad for you. This film is definitely Hitchcockian because it has drama, some scenes of humor, romance, mystery, suspense, everything you want from a Hitchcock film. One thing I was expecting was the cinematography. Hitchcock always has a great cinematographer to do his films. I think the same cinematographer probably does every one of his films. Alfred is also physically in his films. Not only does he direct, but he also has a cameo in each of his films. Every film of his I try to point out where he is and I always find him because of his distinctive look and his plump body. Of course he's no longer with us anymore because he was born in 1899 and not to many people live to be 106 years old (he would be that age if he was still around). His last film was in 1975 and it was called 'Family Plot'. Now there is a lot to the story of 'Vertigo' but it's still interesting and easy to catch on to if you are a good listener. Now Madeleine (who's real name is Judy Barton) seems possessed in John Ferguson's eyes but he still loves her. She seems to not know where she is or why she's there when it comes to her great grandmother. Every day she goes to look at her great grandmother's grave and her portrait that hangs in a museum. John Ferguson is required by her 'so-called' husband (you'll know what I mean when you see it) to follow her and see what she's up to. With John's former occupation of being a detective (now he quit the job and starts to wander), he was called back again by Judy's 'so-called' husband to watch her. In my eyes, it's like a case that needs to be solved. Madeleine (real name Judy) tries to trick John Ferguson several times by falling in to the San Francisco Bay and others. This wonderful Hitchcock film (to me it is) has the biggest twist (in my opinion) of all his movies and the best one yet! What I mean by 'yet' is I haven't seen every single one of his films yet but believe me; I will. Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",10,17,28,9 December 2005
Mission: Impossible III," The best out of the series
","Mission: Impossible III/2006/***1/2Main Stars: Tom Cruise Philip Seymour Hoffman Michelle Monaghan Laurence FishburneJ.J. Abrams (Lost and Alias creator) takes the director's chair for M:I:III. Being a fan of Abrams to begin with (because of the great Lost series), I was even more of a fan after leaving the theater. Out of the three M:I films, this one is by far the best. Sure, this is just like any action film: shootings, explosions, edge-of-your-seat scenes... but this one has a little more wit to it. The second, which I own, was good and smart because of the imaginative masks and scenes to try to find out this plan. Yet this one obviously was more realistic than both the first and second and had more intense scenes and didn't have the stupid infra red clocks that signal that you have a certain amount of time to get outta there. This time they were white. You know what's old though? And what the movie still kept? It was when one person died when they could have lived. There was about three seconds left according to the white numbers and the person dies. I know it's not as bad as getting out just in time or dying at exactly one second left but they could have made it look a bit more realistic saying the person died at 33 seconds or something like that. But the movie overpowers the number complaint and continues to impress the audience with some pretty creative ways to trick security: taking a picture from the camera that's filming the grounds at an enormous castle. It's showing no one there so when Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is about to go in front of the camera he pastes the picture, showing no one on the grounds, on the camera, and turns the cameras back on so that security doesn't get suspicious, and walks in the castle dressed up like a priest. That's the first part of the mission which is taken place in Rome, Italy. I could have sworn I saw everyone inside the castle drinking Merlot. The evil plan/object is called the Rabbit's Foot which seems to be confusing at first because you don't know what it is. Ethan personally asks his boss, 'What is the Rabbit's Foot?' It's secret. The Rabbit's Foot has some sort of radioactive sign on it. Will it ever be revealed? You'll find out. The movie doesn't only consist of the typical shootings and killings of an action film but, as I said before wit, AND some humor. But usually action films have humor anyway. The movie was loud and so was the soundtrack by great Italian composer Michael Giacchino (The Incredibles score). But the original main theme is by Lalo Schifrin. So the explosions made noise and gunshots were obnoxiously loud and the movie overall was exhausting but still very entertaining. The second destination was in Shanghai, China to basically receive the Rabbit's Foot and get hurt by swinging from buildings and get outta there in a CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME yet it all changes at the end. The thing I disagree with most in this series are the names of the films. They are called impossible missions and even the agency Ethan works for is called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) yet are they really impossible or are they just interpreted that way by the people? Who knows? First movie of this series was directed by the master of gore- Brian DE Palma. Second was directed by the master of slow motion- John Woo. And this one isn't a master yet since he hasn't become very popular. But I have confidence in Abrams; he's done well in his TV series' so he probably will be a master someday but nobody can be the master of suspense except for Alfred Hitchcock. Movie directed by J.J. Abrams.",8,0,2,7 May 2006
The Longest Yard," pretty good remake...
","The Longest Yard/2005/**1/2Main Stars: Adam Sandler Burt Reynolds Chris RockThis movie is mostly about the prisoners of a Texas prison getting their revenge on the prison guards by playing a major football game against them in a real stadium with a lot of football fans in the stands. They practice for the big game outside of their jail cells. There are many actors (some not even actors; some wrestlers, rappers, and sports announcers) in this movie. This movie is actually a remake of the original The Longest Yard with main star Burt Reynolds. Burt Reynolds does actually have a part in this remake as the coach of the team of prisoners. If you are a big football fan or player, it's obvious you'd like this movie. But I'm neither one of those and never will be. I used to hate football, then I liked it, then I went back to hating it again and I think it'll stay that way. Movie directed by Peter Segal.",Null,0,2,2 April 2006
50 First Dates," good family film
","50 First Dates/2004/***Main Stars: Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Sean AstinGood film! For Adam Sandler fans this film is yours to see! This movie has kind of the same type of story as Groundhog Day. Of course you wouldn't know unless you saw it. I won't tell you why the title is called 50 First Dates but I did tell you it was a little like Groundhog Day and if you use your inference, you would probably guess why it's called 50 First Dates right. When you see this movie, if you haven't yet, you will be roaring with laughter! But this movie also has a serious story to it- not just comedy. It has some known actors/actresses and it has some obscure actors/actresses. I recommend this movie and if I were you, I'd see it! Movie directed by Peter Segal.",7,0,0,2 April 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Excellent Spielberg/Zemeckis Production besides Back to the Future
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit/1988/****Main Stars: Bob Hoskins Charles Fleischer Christopher Lloyd Joanna Cassidy Stubby Kaye Alan TilvernOkay, I know I've seen this movie thousands of times. It's just I've never had a chance to review it so don't wonder that I've never seen this or the classic Jaws just now! Especially not Jaws that I have seen countless times. Now this is a wonderful most original film yet it could have been extended. Anyone knows that yet it is still the enchanted, original, ultra loud, excellent film brought to you by the people that brought to you Back to the Future: Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg among others! So, where do the filmmakers get the title? Well, Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) was framed for killing the famous Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). But since he was 'framed', who really did the killing? Well there's one person so sinister, so dark, and so evil, it's not even funny. Who, WHO could possibly be that person? Well, you'll find out the answers even though it's pretty obvious. Who's the most evil character that tries to kill the valiant Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins)? Who's the evil immoral jerk that killed Eddie's brother ('D-dropped a piano on his head!')? Who tried to kill Eddie himself by trying to kill him with a razor sharp yellow cartoon wheel that spins round and round to slice him in half? Who's the 'inhuman' toon that has bulging eyes? All those answers are revealed in the movie for you. Because the movie is so great but too short, it has bunches and bunches of things you need to follow that are actually surprisingly 'fun' to follow! The movie opens with a scene from a cartoon starring Roger Rabbit himself. Roger has to save the baby that's stuck on the counter who could careless about Roger. He just wants to get to the jar of cookies at the top of the refrigerator and then Roger gets injured a lot in that. So at the end of the cartoon, Roger gets smashed in the head carelessly, and sees tweedy birds around his head instead of stars that he was supposed to see. So the director starts yelling at him. Surprisingly the innocent baby in the cartoon even started yelling at him in an annoying raspy middle-aged fat man's voice. So Roger starts hitting his head trying to prove to the director that he can see stars instead of chirping tweedy birds around his head. Then it focuses in on Eddie who then says in a typical-annoyed-basically-stating-that-all-toons-are-that-way voice, 'Toons'. Anywaaazz, how would Roger try to keep secret and hide by neither keeping secret nor hiding? By hiding in a bar owned by Valiant's 'friend' Dolores (Joanna Cassidy). He would have to make sure not to cause too much attraction unless he wants to be submerged face down into Judge Doom's (Christopher Lloyd's) THE DIP! So Valiant keeps him with Dolores in a bar that shakes every time a trolley goes by causing the lights to shake and almost hit someone in the head. Yet Roger is a TOON and can't keep secret at all. He 'has to make people laugh!' So he sings to them and uses a record as background music. When the record gets stuck in one spot and does the same note over and over and over again, Roger will also do the same thing over and over and over again using plates to crash on his head (do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH)! So Eddie picks him up from the bar knocking over the remaining plates and lets them shatter and throws him in to a dark room to shut him up. That's where he needs to hide but not for long In the movie there's the will of Marvin Acme involved in the external conflict and the body and soul of R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), owner of Maroon Cartoons. But then Cloverleaf butts in and la-di-da and if you haven't seen the film, I suggest you do since it's a classic and will remain one. Toon Town, Maroon Cartoons, Acme Cartoons, the whole story of Judge Doom and the freeway needing to be built, THE DIP, the characters themselves and the names of them are rather clever, the whole deal/package! What a wonderful, excellent film! Movie directed by Robert Zemeckis.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006
Coraline," Selick is right up there with Burton!
","Coraline/2009/***1/2Main Stars: Coraline: Dakota Fanning Mother/Other Mother: Teri Hatcher Wybie: Robert Bailey Jr.They don't make movies like Coraline very often but perhaps that's a good thing. Why? It's simple. If shown too often, stop motion animation would lose its novelty. Only fourteen years ago the spectacle that was Toy Story was released and it received tons of attention and rave reviews not just for its very witty screenplay but also for its rare look. Not one film had looked like that and had a FEATURE LENGTH running time to it until Toy Story was released in 1995 by Pixar. Yes, Pixar had released fully and digitally animated films but they were all within the duration of ten minutes or less.But now what do we see AT LEAST 5-10 times a year? An animated film. I'm not saying this is bad. It's alright if it's digitally animated by computer as long as the screenplay is very good. Pixar has absolutely no problem with clever screenplays in their animated films. Wall-E was sheer brilliance as was Ratatouille the year before. But I'm still partial to Toy Story more than any other film Pixar released. DreamWorks, however, might need to work a little on those screenplays, excluding their best work, Shrek.Coraline is based on the graphic novel by Neil Gaiman about a bratty little girl named Coraline (Dakota Fanning) that finds a secret door in the family room/living room of her house that leads into another version or rather alternate version of her life. This alternate version you will find is quite different from her real life. Completely the opposite, in fact. It reminded me so much of the joyous atmosphere of the dead in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and the completely dull life of the living. What an ingenious contrast.Coraline is ingenious in itself as well but in a different way. Not only is the animation astounding, the screenplay decent, the originality brilliant, but there is a moral as well. One that's not too hard to find out but also one that is pretty important to keep in mind. The story is different and this moral has been used before.Coraline is a pessimist, always finding something to complain about; whether it's her life or the situation she's in. Nothing seems to be going her way. Even the boy living nearby, Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), annoys her. But, she's curious and adventurous and gets her nose into every little thing. As she's browsing around the house to pass the time she notices a door. It has to lead somewhere. She manages to unlock it after a bitter argument with her mother but nothing's there. This doesn't stop her. Finally, following some mice, she enters this portal if you will. It reminded me of an air duct. She passes through it and arrives in the same house! Only this one is brighter, more colorful, smells of delicious food and features buttons for eyes. Her parents are much more cheerful. In the other world her mother (Teri Hatcher) is boring and so is her father (John Hodgman). The other mother and other father, however (played by the same people), are completely exuberant, almost forcing their smiles. The ringleader you could say is the other mother. There's also other Wybie and all the other neighbors in cheerful versions and if they're not, this is to be fixed.Coraline loves it! At first. But she is pessimistic and pretty cynical and if something doesn't go her way or someone wants her to do something she doesn't want to do, she'll get ticked off. It's all a gradual process in the other world, kind of making her be like everyone else. Does she follow suit?The whole button metaphor, or, at least the way I interpreted it, plays a major part in the story and is total genius as is the film as a whole. Like many Tim Burton films, this one has so much originality, vision and quirky characters, it comes to be one of the most entertaining stop motion films I've seen.Movie written for the screen and directed by Henry Selick.",9,0,2,1 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good and very entertaining but has some mistakes to avoid a great rating.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest/2006/***Main Stars: Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley Bill NighyAm I the only one in the state of Florida that actually likes this film? Maybe so. The movie was definitely not disappointing. The people that didn't like it that much should think so to which is pretty much everyone. The movie was cleverly written and well-done special effects wise. The movie, however, switched between many scenes and that's what kinda ruined the fun for the scene you were first watching. It also flips over to the power-hungry ruler in Britain who wants all the ships for himself. Meanwhile we have Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) acting his usual self- drunk who owes a debt to Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), captain of The Flying Dutchman and the sea himself. Oh, but what does Jack owe? Why would I tell you and ruin the movie for you just like a local critic ruined it for me by telling in his article that there was a surprising guest appearance right before fade-out and actually gave the person's name away, that idiot. I would have preferred to see it myself, thank you very much. But it's over now and I saw who it was and, when you think about it, you could have suspected this person after the crew of The Black Pearl asked the question that made the person clomp down the steps of the tiny building which housed a woman that spoke horrible English. Like instead of saying 'Earth' she'd say 'Eart'. Some things she said I didn't even understand because the stupid woman can't speak English very well! That made me mad but the story was not complicated. It was cleverly written as I already pointed out and well-done. However, it was not great because of the one reason of flipping between so many scenes when you were just starting to enjoy the first fight or confrontation and getting into the music which was originally composed by the brilliant Klaus Badelt who made the 'Pirates' soundtrack so famous and taken over by none other than Hans Zimmer, the extremely odd German composer. Trust me, he's odd. I've seen the way he acts and he's a bit goofy. But he was of course serious for this film and did an extremely fantastic job. However, the film didn't seem to have the best directing. Gore Verbinski, the Polish director who directed the first 'Pirates' movie and The Ring. Yes, an odd career isn't it. Two completely different films indeed. So he comes back to direct this one and doesn't pronounce it as much as he did in the first which he directed Geoffrey Rush (as Captain Barbossa) and did a brilliant job. Rush, a serious actor, did a wonderful job as being humorous and using humorous facial expressions. He also had that dry humor in his voice especially when he said 'Why THANK you, Jack.' Sparrow says your welcome. Barbossa replies, 'Not you; we named the MONKEY Jack.' Dry humor plus the facial expressions (mainly the bulging eyes) made him the star of the film which was impressive. This one was still impressive though with Bill Nighy (as Davey Jones) playing the villain very well although not very humorous, more evil and there's nothing bad about that. Then there's Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) being his usual serious self just like in the first film and is SUPPOSED to be married to Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) but the marriage was interrupted by this adventure of Davey Jones and the rest of his crew on THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. Bootstrap Bill Turner should I say? Nah. You find out about him and you will believe me. As you know already, Johnny Depp has something to give Jones and also, as I said before, I won't spoil anything for you because I'm not an idiot. Norrington (Jack Davenport), as you know from the first as Commodore Norrington, is also involved in this film but is only minor so nothing spoiled really. However, what he does is another thing and he does something significant toward the end of the film There's of course more to this 150 minute (2½ hour film) because it's so darn long but those are only minor details but details that are still fun to watch. Okay so some extra details are significant but my job is to give you the plot outline or gist of the film and of course tell you if I liked it or not. And I did like it but those flipping scenes; the not as pronounced directing; and some other minor mistakes in the script that didn't flow correctly only made it good. But you can already tell I liked it by my star rating. Movie directed by Gore Verbinski.",7,0,1,8 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Excellent! C.S. Lewis has a wonderful imagination!
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe/2005/****Main Stars: Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes William Moseley Anna Popplewell Tilda Swinton Liam NeesonBeing a big budget film, the makers of the film sure put a lot of effort into this. I respect them for putting a lot of effort in and I loved the film! It was worth the money definitely! From the very beginning to the very end were non-stop, well-acted great thrills, some humor (love it), creepy moments, dramatic moments, great music, and perfect storyline! I respect C.S. Lewis's imagination for creating the wonderful fantasy world of Narnia consisting of a witch (Tilda Swinton), and a lion (Liam Neeson). Then there is Mr. Tumnus (being one of the mystical creatures), and a few beavers, wolves and other creatures/animals that can actually talk. The witch pretty much symbolizes Satan and the lion symbolizes Jesus Christ. This did seem to remind me of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy a bit (which I refuse to review) because of the battles of good versus evil (Gandalf versus Saruman from 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'). Now, in this film, hide and seek is a main thing because that's what starts it all. When their mother sends them far away from home after a catastrophic bombing attack, the four kids are sent to an enormous home. The home houses the four of them, a professor (who owns the place), and a housekeeper of some sort. The four of them are extremely bored and decide to play hide and seek and that's what starts it all. The little one of the four, Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), is a curious child and finds the world of Narnia by herself while searching for a hiding place. Her two brothers, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Peter (William Moseley), don't believe in her and her fussy, annoying, picky older sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) doesn't believe in her either. The three of them apologize to Lucy in an unconvincing way of course after they discover the wonderful world of Narnia too. There was one really well done battle scene in this film consisting of Aslan (the lion, voice by Liam Neeson) and the satanic witch. What was good about the battle was the music, special effects, and the acting. This battle was extremely long though but very, very entertaining! The whole movie was entertaining! Being all British actors (minus maybe a few), I could understand what they were saying for once. But I've seen many British films so I'm used to their foreign way of speaking. This film is a remake of a televised production called 'The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe' and had the same story based on C.S. Lewis's famous novel. I think they should continue the C.S. Lewis 'The Chronicles of Narnia' series until they have turned all seven books into seven films but who knows if they'll keep making the series. It depends on if they get enough money (I don't doubt it) from this one. And if they do continue making the series, how long will it take? Movie directed by Andrew Adamson.",9,0,0,2 April 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Better than I expected
","Ice Age: The Meltdown/2006/***Main Stars: Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Queen Latifah Josh Peck Seann William ScottHmmmm I'm still trying to think if three stars would cut it. I mean, I liked it but yet there were also some scenes for tiny, tiny really young kids who were extremely annoying to listen to in the theaters. But overall the movie was impressive. The color, the music and a few scenes that fit with the music that reminded me a bit of 'The Lord of the Rings', the characters especially Sid (John Leguizamo). He's amusing. Then there's Manny and Diego (Ray Romano and Denis Leary) who seem to amuse themselves making fun of Sid just like in the original. Then there are the three NEW main characters, Ellie, Eddie, and Crash (Queen Latifah, Josh Peck, and Seann William Scott). The two guys were REAL possums and Ellie thinking she's a possum but she's really a MAMMOTH. Manny gets furious when she can't get that through her. So what's the story this time? Well in the original the mission is to head south because of all the ice. Now it's heading in a different direction to get away from all the water. All caused by that idiot Scrat (squeaks by Chris Wedge) and his stupid acorn. Even though it's funny to watch him sniff around and twitch to find his acorn, it's also painful. He looks for it and then falls down and hits his head hard or anything else that causes pain. You feel sorry for him when he can't find or have it especially at the end. You'll see So everyone knows this so-called 'meltdown' is going to happen not just from the wannabe news reporter named Fast Tony (Jay Leno) but because they believed it after hearing a few hawks say it. The hawks are excited for everyone to die in the meltdown so they can find some meat to eat ('Food Glorious Food'). So the movie continues with amusement here and there also with a little romance involving Manny mainly and Ellie who is not too fond of the way Manny speaks to her about them needing to reproduce but actually is flattered when he compliments her gigantic butt saying he is so sweet. And he saying, 'Yeah, that's the biggest darn butt I've ever seen!' Please if I ever said that to a girl anywhere I probably would have been slapped or worse I would rather have kept it secret. Sure if girls were so crazy about it and got complimented about it more than they didn't I would have let it out if I saw an extremely large woman on the street. 'Hey, your butt's looking enormous today! Eat some more, why dontcha! Have a great day now!' Cartoons and their weird embarrassing humor, what can I say? I would have to say the original Ice Age and this one are both the same in rating like some originals and sequels are. But in the original Ice Age at least I had the advantage of not hearing a bunch of kids going 'HAAAAAAAAA!!!!' while I just smiled. Movie directed by Carlos Saldanha.",7,0,1,2 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," Excellent sequel!
","Spiderman 2/2004/****Main Stars: Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst Alfred MolinaThis film was the other perfect film of the summer! The reason why I say this is because the acting was perfect for this story and the special effects were great! I like the way Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) swung from the buildings and how Spiderman climbed the walls. I also liked how Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) climbed the walls with his robot arms. The special effects for his arms were the best! But his arms were also real in some scenes accept for the wall climbing. The music by Danny Elfman carried the movie along very well. The main reason for this movie was to catch Dr. Octopus. Dr. Octopus's robot arms were the reason why he turned bad because they told him to do the same experiment as in the beginning of the movie. His experiment was to get the power of the sun. Anyway, Spiderman has to catch Doctor Octopus before he destroys all of New York City! But while trying to hunt down Octopus, Spiderman also has a girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst). So, while trying to catch Octopus, he has a girlfriend he has to worry about, too! Basically, he has two sides of him (as you know from the first), a normal side and a heroic side. NOTE: I do have this movie and I count on you to get it.

The Day After Tomorrow," Good disaster film
","The Day After Tomorrow/2004/***Main Stars: Dennis Quaid Jake GyllenhaalIn the great movie- Independence Day, and the flop- Godzilla, Roland Emmerich's next movie- The Day After Tomorrow was another great movie. The special effects were astonishing and the acting was not bad for a disaster movie. What I mean is that in disaster movies, there is normally terrible acting. As you've seen from the previews, you probably think this movie had to do with horrid weather. Well, if you guessed that, you are correct! At the very beginning something happened to make the storm happen. Of course, if you want to see it soooo bad, I won't tell you anything that happened that would really spoil it for you. In my opinion, I haven't spoiled it for you yet. All I said was this movie had to do with horrid weather and the special effects were astonishing. I don't think I've told you many things at all. See the movie please and I hope you enjoy it! Movie directed by Roland Emmerich.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," If this film isn't a hit, it's not the end of the world.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End/2007/**Main Stars: Jack Sparrow: Johnny Depp Will Turner: Orlando Bloom Barbossa: Geoffrey Rush Elizabeth Swann: Keira Knightley Davy Jones: Bill Nighy Lord Cutler Beckett: Tom HollanderBetter than the first? No way!! Better than the second? Nope. As good as either? Sorry. The third installment in the POTC adventures is a drone. Too long and too much. The too much part of it is all the insignificant characters involved. We don't care about them or what they do. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) I would say was interesting. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) was also interesting. All others didn't do enough for us to say, 'They acted well, etc.' Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) disappointed me. He wasn't near as funny as he was in the first installment. This time he was there... He had one funny moment toward the end. That was it. As for Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), there was nothing to them! They just stood and talked. In the first two films, we saw them as good, interesting characters. In this one, completely the opposite. Plus, they have a predictable moment together at the end that got me fed up. I truly think this 168 minute long film could have been sliced in half or at least a quarter. I honestly think the film would have been more enjoyable if it had been shorter. Some films are made to be long. This one was not. The second was exactly 150 minutes long or two and a half hours long. That's a tolerable running time. This one was pushing it with practically three hours. No need for that. The story wasn't bad. The screenplay was. The effects were fantastic. So were the costumes and makeup. But what really matters? The story AND screenplay, direction, acting, blahbbity-blooh Those things really didn't show up except for those two characters I mentioned earlier. The only good MINOR character was Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin R. McNally). He's always fun to listen to. The last MAJOR character to be mentioned is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). He was the most annoying and the least important. Sure, he wanted to wipe out all pirates. But he wasn't the only one. Norrington (Jack Davenport) shows up for a brief, also unnecessary role and so does Governor Swann (Elizabeth's father played by Jonathan Pryce). You see the film has so much potential. The fact that writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wrote such a great film like POTC 1 and a good POTC 2, don't forget Aladdin, and wrote the masterpiece Shrek, means they have enough skill to write a full screen story and screenplay for the LAST installment of the POTC adventures. Of all POTC films, the last one SHOULD be the best in THEIR eyes. I predicted this to not be as good as the first and second and I was right. They tried TOO HARD to make it the best and it turned out they failed to impress. I gave it two stars for the fact that they tried as hard as they possibly could and for all the junk I mentioned earlier. As for the story, it is all mixed around. Chow Yun-Fat/Yun-Fat Chow as Captain Sao Feng shows up for a brief moment. He wasn't really entertaining but he wasn't annoying either. He was the minor part who was there as another plot device; otherwise, fluff. He started the film. Then the film finally went to what it was all about. Turner, Barbossa, Swann, etc. are on a mission to rescue Sparrow from the depths of Davy Jones' locker. But before that, they have to encounter treachery and deceit from opponents and even allies. More treachery and deceit than needed!! First, someone deceives another. Then that person deceives that person who's friends with another person that has just been killed but then that dead person happens to be another plot device just put there for fun. Then all the people that had just betrayed each other hug and do it again. What I just wrote wasn't completely accurate but that sure was what the film felt like. And what was also ridiculous was the decision of who will be the king/leader/captain of this adventure. First it was this then this but then a that comes in and intrudes but what about these and the thoses. A who shows up but then is killed by a what. The what is killed by the who's friend, sir. A ma'am shows up and it turns out she is going to be the captain. Again, that wasn't completely accurate. But what fun! It was almost like a game! But it was as aggravating as Aggravation! So, what about Davy Jones? Well, he has something happen to him at the end of the film. It was sooooo surprising You know what? I think the film deceived the audience a bit and even gave them some treachery by making them sit through a three hour film. That wasn't very nice. And by the time the last part of the film showed up- the final titanic battle- I think most of the audience was asleep by then. But they shouldn't fret because they really didn't miss anything.

Spider-Man 3," 'Spidey' spins darker web
","Spider-Man 3/2007/***Main Stars: Spider-Man/Peter Parker: Tobey Maguire Mary Jane Watson: Kirsten Dunst New Goblin/Harry Osborn: James Franco Sandman/Flint Marko: Thomas Haden Church Venom/Eddie Brock: Topher GraceTobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, a breathtaking action thriller. Although not as good as its predecessor, Spider-Man 2, Sam Raimi still gives us another entertaining blockbuster everyone will be talking about for a while. When I walked into the AMC 24 Theater at Veterans in Tampa, Florida, I saw, to my surprise that the theater was not as crowded as I thought it would be. Sure enough, however, when I walked out of the theater after seeing the exhausting film, the entire hallway was packed. The next showing was at 10:00 P.M. The ropes were up and people were waiting in line. I was glad I saw it earlier. Oh, where do I begin? The movie has about a thousand sub-plots (at least), and I actually thought the extra sub-plots made the movie more fun and showed creativity on the screenwriters' part: Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi (his older brother) and Oscar-winner Alvin Sargent. Sam Raimi, who's also the director, gives us a visually impressive film. Some parts would leave you hanging but would resolve some time later. Plus, there were moments that would not be further elaborated. But that's the reason why they are making yet another 'Spider-Man'. Spider-Man 4 is due to come out circa 2009. Well, Spidey is in for yet another movie filled with misadventure. He gets beat up constantly thrown into walls, getting slammed in the head, falling from high levels Literally, I'm surprised he's still alive. But hey, comic book films are creative and far-fetched and they always will be. There is the major plot with Spidey and his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Are they going to continue their relationship together? Then there's the major plot with Harry Osborn/New Goblin (James Franco) (son of Old Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe) who wants to kill Spidey for murdering his father. But is revenge the best thing? Then there are the sub-plots with Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who is an alleged killer and escaped criminal, who perhaps has killed someone close to Peter. And then there's Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace), an arrogant photographer competitor to Peter. Brock has a girlfriend named Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who shows up for brief moments in the film. Although her part is small, she actually is an imperative part in the film. She somewhat wavers the relationship between Parker and Watson. The film takes off where Spider-Man 2 landed and goes from there. The action starts almost immediately. He fights New Goblin and that's all I'm saying. Parker is still the photographer for The Daily Bugle and J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is still the top guy/big cheese/head honcho of the newspaper, funny as ever. Parker, however, will have a tough time with a competitor now. Just watch. The venom that attacks Parker and makes him a darker person appears out of nowhere and is not further detailed. But hey, that's what sequels and sequels and sequels are for- to elaborate on things its predecessors neglected to. That's the beauty of a sequel; however, sequels aren't always entertaining. Spider-Man 2 was a departure for mediocre sequels because it was excellent. It was the best 'Spider-Man' movie ever and one of the best superhero films besides Batman Begins and Superman. I thought when Parker became darker was a great part of the film! It was dramatic and funny simultaneously. Can you imagine nerdy Tobey Maguire trying to act cool? Not gonna happen, right? Well, hate to break it to ya, but it did. He bee-bopped down a New York City street and every time he would see a chick he would wink and point and act stupid. But it was comic relief to a previous dark scene and then another dark scene pops out but then the bee-bopping continues, each one less appealing than the previous. So, what's the Sandman's problem? Actually, the way he turned into Sandman was quite well done but that's not the point. According to him, it was family matters. Perhaps that will also be further elaborated in the fourth installment. It might go more in depth into his family history. You never know. But what about Brock? Brock's nickname is Venom! He had to be exposed to the venom somehow right? How he turned into Venom was also quite well done. But, again, that's not the point! He turns into a monstrous creature that looks oddly like Spider-Man and the entire town is shocked and dismayed that someone like Spidey would do this! But it wasn't Spidey! Or perhaps Spidey contributed. Actually he did! Why not see the movie to find out how yourself? Great idea! So, overall, a sticky mess but yet still had some breathtaking action sequences, good acting, directing, clever writing here and there Spider-Man 3 is a good, dark, messy family film and that you can take to the web.

The Prestige," Not your typical illusion show.
","The Prestige/2006/***Main Stars: Michael Caine Hugh Jackman Christian Bale Scarlett Johansson Rebecca HallChristopher Nolan's The Prestige is brilliantly unexpected! When I saw previews for the film, I knew the movie was about intense, intriguing illusions. Illusions so intense that the one performing it might die right in front of the audience or make YOU walk out of the theater. But I can take intense scenes in movies. This one was one of the most intense films I've seen this year! I could hear and feel my heart wanting to escape my chest. Actually, at the end of the film I think my eardrum was damaged. The film was that loud at least during one of the many illusions. One that had the biggest mystery. One that was supposed to have more than just a) the pledge (taking something ordinary and showing it to everyone) and b) the turn (that one ordinary thing becomes something extraordinary). It had to have the most important something. Something that's not just important, but is very difficult to perform. That's c) THE PRESTIGE. That one illusion actually resulted in the climax and resolution of the story so why should I tell YOU? You would kinda predict the climax though after seeing the illusion. At least I did. But everyone's different. The story takes place in London, England. It takes place in the bad parts of London. You might not notice that from the previews. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are competing magicians who both seem to have a lot of talent in magic. You would think that this competition is peaceful. Well change your thoughts now because it's not. Robert and Alfred are both vengeful people and are both hungry for audience attention. So they both compete and compete with each other. They both hate each other, might I add. They were friends before that until they became hungry for more power over the other. Friendship that became a rivalryRivalry that became a battle. This is an excellent and very true tagline for the film, which brought me to the prediction that this film will be pretty intense, and that's the reason why I didn't run out of the theater after seeing some intense scenes. What is even worse about the competition between these two maniacs and their hunger for attention and power and better magic is that it's interfering with their family. Robert and Alfred both start out with wives and Alfred ends up with a kid. Robert does not. But does Alfred really love his wife (Rebecca Hall) or does he love Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson), a woman who works for show and as eye candy in both Robert's and Alfred's department? Maybe he likes neither; maybe he likes both. Usually movies answer your questions. You have that question? See the movie. Then there's Robert who's more of a mystery than Alfred is because he seems to have more on his mind and can't get it out clearly. But you'll find out what his plan is. In my opinion, Alfred is worse than Robert. To not be so blunt, I'll specify it a little more. He's worse in the way of how violent he is and what he does is terrible, and I think he caused Robert to be that way. He influenced him to be as violent as he is. Plus, he may have been influenced by his manager Cutter (Michael Caine) who really pressured him and wanted the best of the best out of him. And to think this movie is supposed to be about magic and friendly competition and the magicians reading each others diaries and tricking each other with odd codes and twists and turns that might take years to decode. The decoding of diaries was actually in the movie. But it's not that way in this film. The Prestige has more than just a stupid illusion show; it has a good illusion show and it has a good background story. It shows how messed up some people get when they want attention and that turns into a plausible, intense thriller! Movie directed by Christopher Nolan.",8,1,2,3 November 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd: Sweeney Blood
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street/2007/***Main Stars: Sweeney Todd: Johnny Depp Mrs. Lovett: Helena Bonham Carter Judge Turpin: Alan RickmanTim Burton calls it The Sound of Music with blood. Indeed it is. Lots and lots of blood. However, it wasn't the color of real blood: dark, cherry red. It instead had a much brighter red color and it was of thinner volume.I've never been a fan of sadistic violence. There's absolutely no point to it. But I decided to go and see it and I saw graphic, bloody violence. And it will be that way and there's no turning back. I do not recommend this film to anyone who has that same thought. It is and is supposed to be disturbing and dark. What do you expect from director Tim Burton? He is dark-minded and apparently likes to show sadistic violence to a certain longer extent.There was one reason why I wanted to see this film. I like Tim Burton. His films are very entertaining and this was entertaining. But I have to admit I hate pointless violence or any violence for that matter because I see it as evil, sadistic and highly immoral. Excuse all the bloodthirsty, sadistic people out there that like to see this type of stuff. Go ahead and see it.So why did I recommend this film? I found the music, the directing, acting and even some of the macabre humor to be entertaining. Johnny Depp is very versatile and played his part to perfection and so did all the other actors. The acting could have not been better. The entire picture is very impressive, so one should expect from a bloody big budget film like this.It is a marginal recommendation. The film is dark, evil, and disturbing. It's ghastly. But it is meant to be that way. This is based on a musical by Stephen Sondheim and based on the play by Christopher Bond. Who knows? Maybe Sweeney Todd was a real demon barber and he slit people's throats, had the people grinded, put into meat pies, had people eat them at Lovett's (Carter's) restaurant then have the people that just ate the people come up, get a shave and a haircut (HA) and get recycled.Doesn't the story sound lovely? Lovely and bloody? Yes. It would actually come across to me as not surprising if I found out Benjamin Barker (changed name to Sweeney Todd when he wanted revenge) was a real person. If this whole thing was made up, then Christopher Bond is one messed up fellow or just highly original.But hey, there are insane people in the world like Benjamin Barker. But he was sane until he was separated from his love and child by the person (Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman)) he desperately loathed. Was he satisfied? In a way, yes.If this story was made up then I will say to Christopher Bond that it is highly original. I have never seen anything like it before. If it is real, however, then I will say that God have mercy on Benjamin Barker's soul, who was obviously an insane man clouded from logic thoughts by his vengeful attitude because he loved his wife and child so much and hated Turpin to death.Johanna (Todd's daughter) was held captive by Turpin and Todd's friend and comrade who came across to London with him loved her. But Turpin held her as his prisoner which made Todd madder at him and, well, proved that he didn't care who he slit. DEMON!The film is a melancholy tragedy. It is disturbing, dark and sad. I felt a slight pity for all the people that were slit. Because, again, this could all have really happened. It's a horrifying thought really but so is the world.So if you're expecting a happy musical with jolly moments, happy conflicts, climaxes, and resolutions, then you're on a fool's mission. This film is deep and dark and thrilling and musical at the same time. It is produced well with the Tim Burton style to it.That's what I saw it for. Tim Burton has an ingenious visual talent, symbolic, and, in this, dark and evil.I hate violence. I like movies. It evens out to a positive rating. Movies overthrow the violence because movies are escapisms and violence is life. Life is unfair. Violence is unfair. Movies are a different form of life. Something you can soak yourself into for two hours or three and walk out with either a happy, or sad, or angry, or nauseous, or scared, or neutral feeling. I think I felt all those. I like movies. This is a movie. I try not to look at it as a real thing but sometimes you do. And even Sweeney Todd can't stop me there.Movie directed by Tim Burton.",7,2,4,1 January 2008
The Polar Express," Great classic entertainment!
","The Polar Express/2004/***1/2Main Stars: Tom Hanks Daryl Sabara Eddie Deezen Nona Gaye'This is the Polar Express!' Tom Hanks's marshmallow voice says when he encourages the main kid star (Daryl Sabara) to get on the train so he can go to the North Pole. There's also another character that instantly becomes friends with the main kid, another person that was on the train, (Nona Gaye) an African American girl, well at least in the movie she is. Of course, as I just said, the North Pole is pretty much the setting for this movie except for the kids' houses. There is also a know-it-all kid (Eddie Deezen) in this movie. He thinks he knows everything about the North Pole and Santa and he has a really annoying voice. This is really a delightful movie with a wonderful imagination! Well, Chris Van Allsburg is the writer of the book and did a very good job writing it but the book is only the main point of this movie. There are also screenwriters that write things to fill in the movie to make it longer. There is also an object in this movie- a bell from Santa's (Tom Hanks') sleigh and you'll see why they have this bell in this movie. This is a classic just like the two classics- The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The two of them just have a delightful story!

Capote," A good slow moving drama...
","Capote/2005/***Main Stars: Philip Seymour Hoffman Catherine Keener Clifton Collins Jr. Bruce GreenwoodAhh, there's nothing like a good slow-moving film that teaches you a moral. Capote was one of them. It was not EXCELLENT like some critics thought and neither was Lost in Translation, which so many critics RAVED about. They were both good, slow-moving films. Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the pompous, high-pitched, little twerp, who is famous for writing articles in the New Yorker, now wants to write a book on a tragic event that happened in a family one day in 1959. The tragic event was the gruesome death of a family of four in Holcomb, Kansas. Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) is Capote's 'partner in crime' for this story. What makes Truman so obliged to create a book based on the tragic family event is when he digs deeper into the story and wants his audience to know about it in much detail. The book he writes based on the event is called In Cold Blood, which was also made into a movie. It is an attractive title and sure did attract a big audience. But before the book was finished, Truman felt a need to help the man who committed the murder. This man, named Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.), had a troublesome life and Truman had pity for the man. Yes it's kind of hard to see Truman Capote show love and compassion for a man UNDER him yet he did and really TRIED to help him out but didn't exactly succeed. So yes Truman has a soft side to him as he does for his 'partner'. No not Harper Lee but is other 'partner' and Capote's lisp and high-pitched voice might convince you that he's a bit on the swishy side so his 'guy partner' is Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). I have to admit Truman Capote may be a snob but he sure has or had an interesting life in which he was also a bit troubled so he can kind of easily relate to Perry's life a bit. I also have to admit that Philip Seymour Hoffman does an excellent job portraying him. He does not as much imitate him as channel him. It actually seemed you were looking at the REAL Truman Capote on screen, which is obviously impossible because he died in 1984 from supreme alcoholic problems. And no I did not know that myself. I just saw the footnote at the end of the film that described that. It also described that after In Cold Blood, Truman Capote never wrote another book again. This is the last line from the book In Cold Blood: 'More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.' I guess it makes sense because answered prayers do remain with you and are most likely more important than unanswered prayers. God will always hear your prayers and definitely grant the important ones that will remain with you forever over the trivial ones that will probably soon vanish or fade away from your thoughts, that is if you have too much on your mind.

Corpse Bride," Great Tim Burton film!
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride/2005/***1/2Main Stars: Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter Albert Finney Joanna Lumley Emily Watson Christopher LeeTim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' is a delightful story about a young man named Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is living and a young woman named Emily, the corpse bride (Helena Bonham Carter) who is dead. You are probably thinking this movie is about these two and no one else. But actually there are quite a few other characters involved. There is Victor's 'living' fiancé he was originally going to marry (you'll find out what happens to those two toward the end). Then there are the sets of parents for Victor and his 'living' fiancé; the butler; the maid; the priest; etcetera. All the characters (except for a few) have either weird looking faces, bodies, hairstyles or walks. The story is definitely original but had one problem most movies have: it was too short! I can see why the movie was too short though; it was made with frames (like 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). What I mean is it was made by taking a picture of a character, moving them slightly, taking another picture of them, moving them and a few people in the background again, and then taking another picture. This way of making films is very time consuming but worth it because it is entertaining to watch. This movie is involving a real life situation and a fantastic situation (the living world and the nonliving world). Victor is in love with a 'living' woman named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) and is at a rehearsal wedding and can't get his vows right. The priest (Christopher Lee) becomes very impatient and tells him the wedding is off if he can't get his vows right in time. The strict parents of Victoria, who are named Finnis and Maudeline Everglot (Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley), are not to fond of Victor and think Victoria should marry someone a bit more wealthy like Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) and you'll soon find out what happens to him! HAHAHAHAHAHH! Victor goes into a forest and practices his vows (still getting them wrong). He then finds objects in the forest to practice with. He uses a tree branch as a hand to put the ring on and that's how Emily, the corpse bride and Victor meet. The tree branch cracks and out comes a skeletal hand out of the snow. Emily had thought all this time that he was talking to her but really he was practicing the vows with a tree branch. When you do watch this movie and you better, you'll be heading in the direction of adventure. Movie directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bracin' Jason racin' and chasin'
","The Bourne Ultimatum/2007/***Main Stars: Jason Bourne: Matt Damon Nicky Parsons: Julia Stiles Noah Vosen: David Strathairn Pamela Landy: Joan AllenIf you are one of those people that like to go to a movie theater, get some concessions, sit down, relax and watch a slow-moving film, then don't think about seeing The Bourne Ultimatum at all. Not only will your concessions fall all over the floor, but the concessions you already digested will want to come out. This is an action-packed, seat-vibrating thriller.My first two sentences were complete dramatizations of what would really happen, but I have to write a review. No critic sits and types: The film is good and leaves. No. They have to not only write what they think of the film and the plot outline, but also write a bunch of fluff sentences to fill in space. I do that as well. Although this movie is good, I don't know if I can think of a bunch of words to describe my opinion and the film itself, so I put in unnecessary sentences like the first two to make it longer. In other words, the film is extremely convoluted (as are all 'Bourne' movies), so I don't think words would be able to completely summarize if it's good or bad and what it's all about. I'll try my bestJason Bourne (Matt Damon) is close to death again. There Yeah, there's more. He's still trying to run away, be left alone; but, unfortunately, that can't happen. There is always someone that takes him out of his peace and almost (perhaps) goads him to come out of hiding. This time a newspaper gets him out.An interesting article by London-based reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) catches his attention about something called 'Operation Black Briar', formerly known as 'Project Treadstone'. If you didn't see the first two films, you will have no clue about any of this.'Project Treadstone' was some kind of secret CIA plan ('a kill squad, black on black', as described by the great Brian Cox in the second installment) run by the people that had formerly hired Jason Bourne as one of them. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen all the films. The project was created to eliminate Jason Bourne. So now it's back once again, but basically with a different name.As a result to this article, Jason Bourne wants to arrange a meeting with the reporter, but, unfortunately, is being watched by the coordinator of 'Operation Black Briar'- Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). But of course Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), another CIA big shot, has to get involved and basically take over the operation because she also wants information on Bourne.In the meantime, Bourne continues to have visions about him first being hired by the top dog of the 'Project Treadstone' kill squad, Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney). The vision gets more and more lucid as the movie continues. The first two had the same aspect.Along with all the goings-on Bourne is teamed up with former logistics coordinator of 'Project Treadstone', Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), and gets into a lot of well-choreographed chase sequences and fights, and almost dies You know; typical stuff you see every day.But, regardless of the film's farfetchedness, it's still fun to watch because not only is there a lot of high-voltage nonsense going on, but the characters play their parts so well and believably we can't stop watching.And I must compliment Paul Greengrass' direction of this film. The second one was as intriguing and thrilling as this one and was also directed by him. He also did United 93 that also had a lot of fast-paced action. He is qualified. He does a very good job with the camera as well. He may not be the director of photography or the photographer, but I can tell he puts his touch into the film.Once again, this film is not relaxing. It is exhausting. Fast-paced action and choppy shots could get the squeamish dizzy, so I wouldn't recommend it to all the delicate people out there. Even I had trouble focusing on everything and walked out of the theater very tired and didn't feel like writing this review until a week later.

The Aviator," Excellent!
","The Aviator/2004/ Main Stars:Leonardo DiCaprioCate BlanchettKate Beckinsale I never knew Howard Hughes's life was really that interesting. I thought that Howard Hughes was just a rich obsessive-compulsive guy who wasn't worth knowing about. When I saw this movie that thought definitely went away. He really had a big influence on planes and movies about them. Of course, seeing Leonardo DiCaprio's buttocks was extremely nauseating but the movie itself was amazing! Some people may be familiar with the movie 'Hell's Angels' (a movie about World War I) and in this movie there was a big scene about that with planes flying around like one hundred birds in the air. What I really thought was amazing in this movie was the cinematography (the filming) because of how the camera moved around it is really difficult to explain why it was so good but in my opinion, it just was. Actually, the movie did win an Academy Award for the cinematography so apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this movie had really good filming. As you probably know, this movie won a few Academy Awards and was nominated for a few more besides cinematography and I thought it really deserved that. I especially wanted Leonardo DiCaprio (playing Howard Hughes) to win an Academy Award for Best Actor but he was only nominated for that. He, along with Cate Blanchett (playing Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (playing Ava Gardner) were the best actors (actresses) in the movie. Howard Hughes is known to be obsessive-compulsive. He also is known to be one of the most famous aviators of all time. Katherine Hepburn is known to be outgoing, independent, and to me she seems quite annoying in a way. And Ava Gardner is known to be adventurous, quite calm, and also independent. In my opinion, the actor and actresses that played them played their roles perfectly. In my opinion, nothing at all was boring in this movie but my brother really thought so because he doesn't like these types of movies at all. He really is a big fan of vulgar comedies. Anyway, in this last sentence, I will tell you what this movie was about- this movie was specifically about the history of Howard Hughes's life. I'm sorry for a very long review but there's just a whole lot to talk about in this classic film. By the way, this movie is very long (about three hours) and I think you know what I am going to tell you- go to the bathroom. Movie directed by Martin Scorsese.",Null,1,2,2 April 2006
The Village," worst M. Night Shyamalan film. OK...
","Village, The/2004/**Main Stars:Joaquin PhoenixBryce Dallas HowardAdrien Brody After M. Night Shyamalan's classics- The Sixth Sense and Signs, it went a little down hill with The Village. Now, the reason is because it was another one of those mysterious/weird films. You see these very Amish-like people lived simple lives in a small and creepy village. Of course, I thought this story took place in the 1800s since there were no cars or electricity, but later in the movie you will find out what happens. Meanwhile, back at the village, they are trying to hide from this monster that has a red cape covering it. They send this blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) into the woods to find medicine for a person that had gotten stabbed in the movie. Then while she was in the woods, she sensed someone there. Of course, she couldn't see the person because she was blind. But what it was, was a suspicious creature that was chasing her down for who knows how long and why The rest and other parts of this movie are secret and cannot be told. But I do want to point out that this was an okay movie and you should see it and tell me what you thought of it. This paper will self-destruct in 5 secondskidding, haa! Movie directed by M.

Little Miss Sunshine," A clever dysfunctional family comedy-drama...
","Little Miss Sunshine/2006/***1/2Main Stars: Greg Kinnear Steve Carell Toni Collette Paul Dano Abigail BreslinI would have to agree with the Oscar nominations this film received. Abigail Breslin does deserve some type of reward for doing such a good job. Same with Alan Arkin. He played a much different role than he usually does and was very convincing. It may even deserve the Best Motion Picture of the Year! Best Screenplay is what the film deserves the most, however. Movies like this come around a couple times in a lifetime. Rarely do you have an awkward comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family to pick up off the shelves at Blockbuster. These days we see movies filled with insipidity. Such as movies with explosions, predictable moments, and violence, and a couple other things that viewers younger than thirteen would be affronted by. Movies like this that have wit, are awkwardly funny, and have unpredictable moments, TRUE ACTING, and have a story are enjoyable to watch! This is one of those films. It is set around one fractured family trying to travel to California to enter Olive (Abigail Breslin), the eager seven-year-old who wants to be a beauty queen, into the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. However, the quirks of the family somewhat hold them back. First off, there's the dad (Greg Kinnear) who enjoys lecturing people on if they are winners or losers. He doesn't like the fact that people put themselves down and would rather remain losers. He would rather them admit they are winners (ones who mainly TRY). 'You don't have to succeed to be a winner'. The family gets irked by his lectures later on. Then there's the mother (Toni Collette) who seems to be a typical depressed mother trying to raise children (meaning practically everyone except her) and trying to take a trip to California without going insane. Then there's the son (Paul Dano) who's a rebel and will not talk to the family until he gets accepted into the Air Force. However, he seems to be the one that says the most 'F' words later on. Then there's the uncle (Steve Carell) who's gay and tried to commit suicide when finding out he was. Then there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin) (who had a shorter part than the others) who seems to be an extremely uneducated old man who smokes, takes drugs, etc. He obviously doesn't have the slightest bit of wisdom. However, the last line he said made him special and made who he said it to feel special on the inside and out. Last is Olive whom I already gave a brief description of. Even more detailed is that she is also a rebel just like her brother. She seems kind of naughty on the inside. Or perhaps 'spicy' is the word I'm looking for. She is a kind and talented kid. The only questions that are hanging are: Will she win the beauty pageant? Will they ever get to California in order to find out? Well, since they are driving a crappy Volkswagen bus, that might delay them right there. But the dad thinks there is an easy way to solve this. Teamwork. No matter what, teamwork always helps (no matter how little the help may be). Instead of one person helping make it to California, why can't all six help? It would make things go a lot smoother. Their VW bus, unfortunately, cannot accelerate very well. So, to get it in gear, all six help in a way and get it to gain speed. That's where the teamwork part comes in. The family, as I said before, is dysfunctional, however. And their quirks may delay things a little, but are the delays that serious where they will completely damage the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant for their sweet little seven-year-old girl who wants to be a beauty queen? Who knows? She is not the most beautiful person on the outside (perhaps a little chunky around the middle), but her face and on the inside she is a beautiful girl longing for the purpose to help her family in the state of depression they're in (like severely in debt). Perhaps the family doesn't feel so well after the excitement that was brought to them. I wouldn't have an answer to that because the movie stopped in an odd spot. Perhaps their teamwork and excitement paid off, and they would have enjoyed taking that ride all the way to California to end up being Movie directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.",9,2,5,6 February 2007
North by Northwest," Excellent Hitchcock film
","North by Northwest/1959/****Main Stars: Cary Grant Eva Marie Saint James MasonThis is more of a 'classic' Alfred Hitchcock film. 'The Birds' was a classic but not as intriguing and suspenseful as this. It was more of a 'HORRORIFYING AAAHHHH!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!!!!!' type movie and I'm not a real huge fan of those movies. Other Alfred Hitchcock classics consist of Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, Frenzy, and The Man Who Knew Too Much. Other ones are more mediocre like Jamaica Inn and Marnie. Those two I just mentioned are a bit more down on the scale of 1 to 10 according to Hitchcock fanatics. My dad for instance is a great Hitchcock fan and loves most of his movies. The thing is the classic 'Vertigo' wasn't one of my dad's favorites. He thought 'in his usual way of thinking'- meaning very picky- that it was too confusing or it wasn't that good. What he says goes basically. No one can tell him off when it comes to arguing; he always wins! But what a stupid thing to argue about MOVIES. Back to 'North by Northwest'; it's a wonderful film about a man named Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) (Roger being mistaken for a man named George Kaplan). The thing is why????? DUN DUN DUN!!!! You find out!!!! You will find out everything that happens in this movie yourself (except for the things I tell you). There is a lot more to the story besides just being mistaken by someone named George Kaplan. Roger (wanted for murder) races to a train in this movie and meets up with someone he thinks is beautiful named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Unfortunately he thinks she's good but she's both good and bad (being a double agent). The good side is being with him. The bad side is basically everyone else she hangs out with. Such as: Leonard (Martin Landau) and Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Other scenes include (at the very beginning) a kidnapping, driving while drunk, many chases (for Roger Thornhill), of course the journey down Mount Rushmore and many others. This movie is so full of information that I'm surprised I filled up only 1 ¾ pages. Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",Null,1,4,2 April 2006
"I, Robot"," Fun!
","I, Robot/2004/ Main Star: Will SmithThis film was the perfect film of the summer! The story was awesome and the special effects were perfect, too! It was very good robot animation but of course seeing Will Smith's buttocks was disgusting! They could have done without that scene! This movie took place in 2038. The whole story was about these robots that are trying to take over this town from the commands of a computer system. Of course at the beginning of this movie the robots are just obeying their owners and doing nice things and helping out the town. But then they turn bad because their commander is telling them to do all of this. So, basically, it's not the robots' fault for doing this but it's the commander's fault. My review may not sound interesting but the movie itself is great! Movie directed by Alex Proyas.",Null,0,2,2 April 2006

During this movie, Dracula develops baby vampires by electricity to conquer the whole town of Transylvania so he can rule it along with his other billion sons and daughters. Of course Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) will stop him! Many critics thought this movie was very quirky. Other critics did not, like me.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not as good as the first two but still very imaginative and dark!
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/2004/***1/2Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson David Thewlis Gary OldmanOnce again the magic of J.K. Rowling and the magic of film combine together to make another amazing Harry Potter film to be released in the theaters. The first two are still the best to let human eyes set upon. But, as usual, we wait for another Harry Potter film to beat the first two; yet still it has not come but it can still be possible because I've read all the Potter books and the fifth and sixth seem to be tied with impressiveness. The sixth has the best beginning. The fifth and sixth have the best middles. And the fifth has the best end. I would have to say all of Rowling's books are impressive and deeply interesting in, at least, most of the parts. So the third movie is finally released in theaters. I'm excited to see this one because it looked like the best one from what the previews showed. It wasn't the best but I was deeply immersed in the story. As usual, this Potter film had another major storyline behind it. The evil and crazy Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison and is the first to do it. This causes tensions and worries throughout not only Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but throughout all of London. Everyone's on the lookout for the supposed lunatic. Harry has a discussion with Mr. Weasley (Ron's dad) about Sirius Black and that Harry should keep a look out for the man. He tells Harry very firmly to not go looking for Black because he wants to kill him and Harry answers, 'Why would I go after a man who wants to kill me?' You could see that Harry did not solemnly swear to not go looking for him. He actually wanted to after what information he overheard Professor McGonagall, Madam Rosmerta and Cornelius Fudge talking about in an upstairs room of Rosmerta's pub. But before this Professor Dumbledore (replaced by the gruff Michael Gambon) had warned each and every one of the Hogwarts students to be very cautious and said that dementors would be guarding the school. He said not to go near these creatures. They're very dangerous. And it turns out they were. School matters were mixed in with Sirius/dementor matters like the Quidditch Final. This turned out not to be like it was planned. However, school matters seem to wane when the film gets closer and closer to the dramatic ending which reveals many answers that refer to people's suspicious questions. Professor Remus Lupin caused a bit of uneasiness. As did Scabbers, Ron's rat. Harry, Ron and Hermione were the first to investigate. During the intense and adventurous scenes, John Williams was really going crazy with his orchestra to try to catch the moment. I have to say, he succeeded in doing it because William's music was definitely the most pronounced in this film especially during the parts with Sirius and Lupin and the rest of the gang and, of course, Quidditch. So if you haven't seen this very well done, dark and intense film yet, which I highly doubt, buy it (DO NOT RENT IT BUT BUY IT!) on DVD or VHS. But you should think of getting it on DVD. I enjoy it better at home because I saw it in the theaters the first day it came out. It wasn't very fun. We were supposed to go to an early showing. However, there was an idiotic woman in front of us in the ticket line fiddling with her purse. So it was SOLD OUT after five minutes. So, an hour and a half later, we see a later showing and we went inside the theater passing by two security guards with real guns in their pockets. I know the Potter films are popular but securing a theater so no one comes in without a ticket which only cost a maximum of ten dollars is pretty pathetic to me. And I just hope that purse woman had a bad dinner that evening if she had dinner at all. Movie directed by Alfonso Cuarón.",9,0,1,4 July 2006
Ratatouille," 'Ratatouille' satisfied my appetite
","Ratatouille/2007/***1/2Main Stars: Remy: Patton Oswalt Linguini: Lou Romano Skinner: Ian Holm Colette: Janeane Garofalo Gusteau: Brad GarrettDuring and especially after this film I was hungry. The film had very convincing food; I'll give you that. You know why? Because the animation was truly brilliant! So much detail put in Pixar Animation Studios has started a reputation to now release a Pixar film every summer and they still convince, compel, enchant, etc. with their brilliant animation, clever scenes and compelling story. It's truly amazing to me how they can release a film every year and still be able to maintain an intrinsic beauty! As for Ratatouille, it filled my expectations more so than I thought. I had read a couple of critics' reviews and they were not mixed. The unanimous was good. One gave it three stars. Another gave it three and a half stars. And finally four stars. So I thought I don't know what to expect. Although the unanimous rating was good, that doesn't mean that that three could have been for animation purposes so it was only mildly recommended. So I told myself to remain sober throughout the entire film regardless of what other people say. And, as a result of NOT expecting it to be great like most Pixar films are, I was very impressed. Good job, Pixar. And mainly, good job, writer and director Brad Bird, whose The Incredibles was also extremely impressive. He showed his unrecognized talent once again! One other thing that spit at me to remain sober throughout the film was the preview for it. The preview didn't make it look very good and I'm actually glad. I think that previews shouldn't spoil films. Some films release the previews that have the funny parts already in them. So, when you see the movie, you don't like it as much as you should have because you have already seen a funny scene! Not for this film. But the previews were good enough to have me checkin' the film out and not to be completely turned away. The basic premise I found interesting and the movie proved that even more. But what is the basic premise? It's actually kind of odd. But there is nothing wrong with oddity, is there? It's what makes the world revolve on its very axis. And something like Ratatouille is something you don't see every day. Good. No clichés. It's about this rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). He is the more motivated of the rats in the rat colony he is in. His ingenuity in cooking is what motivates him and makes him want to do more. So soon he visits actual Paris, leaving his family and friends behind. He never knew he lived in Paris until he finally was inspired by a future friend and restaurant owner Gusteau (Brad Garrett) and had enough courage to leave the sewer, climb a tall building and be surprised to see the Eifel Tower. How much more revealing can you get that you're in Paris than seeing that? He then awkwardly meets with a young adult looking for a job named Linguini (Lou Romano). Remy then becomes the chef behind the hat. Although continually being spied on by the fastidious head chef Skinner (Ian Holm), he still continues to do well at what he does best and practices and practices with his chef acquaintance. Linguini's personal feelings start to bloom for a Miss Colette (Janeane Garofalo) later on. On worse news, he doesn't seem to have what it takes to be a chef and that gets a little hard on him after a while. Food critics come in and out and continue to rate the restaurant good or bad. Before Linguini was hired, the restaurant had lost a star and then another from the insanely picky, arrogant food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole). Although a secondary character, Ego is also a vital character in the film that not only proves the moral of the film, but also proves one of the morals of life. And I, as a film critic, need to keep some of the lessons learned in this film myself and learn from my mistakes as well. Maybe I won't learn my mistakes by eating some food but maybe I'll learn by watching an impressive, enjoyable film like this one. Movie directed by Brad Bird.",10,3,6,1 July 2007
Quantum of Solace," A different Bond better than Casino Royale
","Quantum of Solace/2008/***1/2 Main Stars: James Bond: Daniel Craig Camille: Olga Kurylenko Dominic Greene: Mathieu Amalric M: Judi DenchThere are many reasons why I like certain genres of films. It is safe to say that James Bond has created its own genre. Yeah, it's an action-thriller movie most of the time. But there are also plenty of gadgets and cars and bombs and stuff, so it could be considered a machinery, techno film. Regardless, this film fits the James Bond genre. What did NOT was 2006's Casino Royale. It had the agent and the car and the gun, but where were the incognito parties/meetings? The gadgets? The cleverly named villain? Nowhere.Quantum of Solace delivers on countless occasions and succeeds greatly in the long run. It's fast and furious (literally), smart and engaging. With the slight motifs of the James Bond theme in the background, everything is present. Yeah, there is no Q or MoneyPenny but there are gadgets and women that are flattered by Bond's charm.Daniel Craig does very well as James Bond, second best Bond following Sean Connery. Now, he's faced with a man named Dominic Greene and ones that work for him and/or with him. And yes, the film does have the question, 'Who do you work for?' in it. What is Greene planning? It's simple: to take control of a country's water supply. Why? Who cares? But the film does get released during the right time. He's an evil environmentalist, which meets right up to today's standards.The film was directed by Marc Forster, whom I find to be quite a visionary. I think he did put his own twists on some scenes but he's not known for action movies at all. He's known for creative talking films. But if this is his first ever action film, he did one hell of a job! There's plenty of action here and plenty of vision, so it was a smart decision to choose him (unless he chose himself for the job). Two of his past films are Stranger than Fiction and Finding Neverland, two films which I liked very much. There was no action in these movies, but there was plenty of vision.This film has both plus a few extra. And doesn't that make the movie all the more enjoyable? Bond films should have everything. A little dialogue, action, comedy, romance, etc. Even if it's corny dialogue or comedy (like the originals) it's still better than just one aspect.This film was highly entertaining but I don't know if I should have my hopes up for the next Bond unless maybe I see Forster as the director, who's proved himself to be an excellent action director and visionary.Movie directed by Marc Forster.",8,1,4,19 November 2008
Batman Begins," Awesome! The best Batman film of the series!
","Batman Begins/2005/****Main Stars: Christian Bale Liam Neeson Katie Holmes Michael CaineWow! What a great movie but it was very long. I have to say this was the best movie I saw this year in the theaters besides Star Wars III! The music! The action! The loudness! I can't say I like loudness that much but it seemed to fit in this movie. Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) has to face his fears and what he fears most is bats. His parents own Wayne Enterprises (you'll find out what happens to them early in this movie). This movie finally tells the whole story of the 'Batman' series. First the movie actually starts out when he's an adult in a Chinese prison (you'll find out how he got there). This movie has quite a few flashbacks though when he was a boy and a young adult and goes back to the present with his trainer (Liam Neeson) for martial arts and facing all of his fears. Finally, after maybe an hour, he starts doing some hero work with the help of Arthur (Michael Caine)- Bruce's butler. Bruce gets all the Batman equipment from Applied Sciences dept head Lucius (played by Morgan Freeman) in the basement of the Wayne building. The city where the movie takes place is, of course, 'Gotham' but it was really filmed in the city of downtown Chicago. There was also a villain in this movie (as there always is) that was quite a frail person but quite an effective and disgusting villain. Although he was quite wimpy, his mask gave him power. In this movie Bruce's trainer surprisingly turns against him (and you'll find out what his evil plan was in this movie) This was a long movie and there are many other things to talk about in this review, but I'd like to give every person that is reading this review to have some rest for your eyes! I definitely recommend this movie to everyone! Movie directed by Christopher Nolan. Oh, by the way, you better go to the bathroom before you see this movie. I'm glad I did.",10,1,1,2 April 2006
Meet the Fockers," Funny sequel!
","Meet the Fockers/2004/*** Main Stars:Ben StillerDustin HoffmanBarbara SteisandRobert DeNiro There is one word I'll have to call this movie- 'odd'. The Focker parents are the odd ones in this movie. As you know from the previews, the Fockers meet up with Ben Stiller's character's wife's parents. The crazy Focker parents don't really care what they do in the public because they are very odd. This movie may be odd, but it also has some funny moments. Meet the Parents was a funny movie also and I'd say both Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers were the same in rating. This was the usual 'Meet the Parents' type movie. I'd say the oddest character in this movie was Bernard Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and the character that messes up everything is definitely Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). And, of course, I'd say the smartest character in this movie is Robert DeNiro's character. You might think (from the previews) it looks stupid but it is actually quite funny. If you want to see something about crazy, bumbling, and smart people, then this is the movie for you. Movie directed by Jay Roach.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006
Cars," A very impressive Pixar Animation Studios Film and it's not just the story that caught my eye...
","Cars/2006/***1/2By Eric Staab/ July 3, 2006Main Stars: Owen Wilson Paul Newman Bonnie Hunt Larry the Cable GuyThroughout the entire month of June, John Lasseter's very impressive film Cars has been one of the most talked about films in the nation and has been one of the tops at the box office which is why I wrote my review later to show you how popular the film really is. It still is making some big bucks so the three years of making it was obviously worth it. It was positively impressive and I'm not just talking about the clever story; I'm talking about the crystal clear animation. It was incredible just like Brad Bird's prior Pixar Animation Studios Film The Incredibles which is still THE BEST Pixar film yet followed closely by Toy Story (1&2) and Cars and all the others and I won't name them now. When I saw the previews for this film I thought it wouldn't be that entertaining because it's about racing and I'm not as huge a fan of that as I was years ago. But it turns out the film wasn't just about sports car racing it was about friendship. The film didn't always have a racetrack as a set. There was a town called Radiator Springs (clever name) and that's where most of the story takes place. As you may well know, there are no humans in this movie which makes it even more entertaining to watch. Instead of pesky little flies, they are actually tiny cars with wings which was very clever from the animators. Everything living has to be a vehicular object: a car, a tractor, a truck, a bus, even a Ford Model T which was played by an extremely old woman. That's another thing. Newer cars are younger people. Older cars are older people. The age of the car resembles the age of a person which was very clever indeed. Instead of cows there were tractors so the tractors would go 'MOOOOOOOOOOO' but you can't mess with Frank (the enormous plow) or he'll practically cut you up. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) calls it tractor tipping instead of cow tipping and Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is the main character who is told this. So Lightning McQueen is the big rookie car star that everyone likes. And if he wins the Piston Cup (the championship trophy that the racecars win) he'll be the first rookie to have done it in, I guess, ages. Unexpected guest voices are instead of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno it's The Jay Limo Show where Jay makes a silly joke about Lightning McQueen which makes everyone in his audience laugh and Leno himself plays Jay Limo. Then instead of Bob Costas, it's Bob Cutlass and played by Costas himself. Richard Petty (an elderly former National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing racecar driver which is abbreviated NASCAR) is in this film playing The King. And Michael Keaton plays the sinister Chick Hicks (who is very aggressive like Dale Earnhardt). Dale Earnhardt Jr. plays Junior in this film or the number 8 car which he always has been. Darrell Waltrip (another real racecar driver) is in this film playing Darrell Cartrip. So they got quite a few stars in this film and then there's Paul Newman himself playing the crotchety Doc Hudson. He's the leader of the Radiator Springs town. The top dog, big cheese, head honcho (a line from Airplane!). The film shows a point not just about racecar driving but friendship. McQueen makes quite a few friends like Sally Carrera (CARrera) who is voiced by Bonnie Hunt. She seems to really like McQueen in this film. However, the Doc is not too fond of him and tries to avoid him more than speak to him or settle out his problems. He's a bit stoic and doesn't like to settle his problems with anyone, more just wants to keep it in himself. After McQueen is reported missing he finds the tiny town of Radiator Springs and simultaneously being chased by a sheriff. That's where he meets the interesting ol' gang. He even has to do some manual labor before he's supposed to be let free after messing up their road with his reckless driving after being chased by the sheriff for a few minutes. His final destination is California where he is supposed to have his next race but the manual labor needs to be completed before he is let go! It is a fun movie with an impressive story and interesting characters. I know very young kids won't be astounded by the animation but they'll most likely still have fun. And at the end you feel good because McQueen did the right thing and it was all thanks to his Radiator Springs buddies who influenced his life in a good way.

The Incredibles," A classic! INCREDIBLE! Definitely a must see movie!
","NOTE: This is a short comment on 'The Incredibles' for those who don't feel like reading a very long comment.'The Incredibles' was FANTASTIC! You can see it again and again and it will never get old. This movie is definitely full of non-stop action. It also has some humor that will split your sides. Some people say they're getting sick of computer-generated films; but I still love them 100%. The characters show a lot of enthusiasm, emotion, etc.Some people are oafs because they want to know why it always takes so long to make computer-generated type films. It involves a lot of drawing, editing, sound, animation, motion, lighting, sets, etc. This movie was also very good because of the crystal clear picture and great surround sound even on the DVD! If you like movies about crime fighting, explosions, humor, and things related to those descriptions, than you must see this movie! I saw 'The Making of The Incredibles' on the DVD's Special Features and the sophistication these days is unbelievable! I saw how they made the movie of course. I also saw the director- Brad Bird. Brad seems like a funny, sarcastic type of guy. He seems like a guy I'd like to work with. Brad also did another but older classic (well, at least I thought)- 'The Iron Giant.' I also saw the outtakes, deleted scenes, etc. and I thought all of it was entertaining. If you haven't seen this movie yet than you better because you should want to see a movie full of action, explosions, and humor.

","The Mist/2007/***Main Stars: David Drayton: Thomas Jane Mrs. Carmody: Marcia Gay Harden Amanda Dumfries: Laurie HoldenThis is from the mind of Stephen King, not Frank Darabont. Although Darabont adapted this into his own film, this is based on a novella by Stephen King. So, if you think this film is a typical stupid horror film seen dozens of times a year, think again. The true horror is not in the monster, the bug, or the animal; it is in the people. Yes It is true this film has monsters with tentacles, weird looking heads, strange eyes, a bunch of legs, deformed bodies basically gross-out pieces of crap. That is typical in every stupid gimmicky cheap horror flick. This has all those things plus grotesque scenes with the people. But it also has something deeper. The people themselves: what they think and how they act.It took me a while to whip up a star rating, but I finally gave it three stars for not only its effort in directing, performances, etc. but the chilling truth of it all. Not the bugs. But the people and how circumstances like these are taken. This is a truly chilling film in ways.Just what is the premise? Actually, it is very simple. A strange collaboration of mist reverberates throughout a town. Within the mist are creatures. That could have been worded better but oh well. These creatures in the mist basically have no purpose of even living. Practically all they do is kill what they HEAR. If they hear the humans they kill. Easy, right? So how is it possible to make a feature-length film with that lame premise? Well, concentrating on the charactersThe main character David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the one this movie circles around. Drayton is an artist. He creates movie posters for a studio, is a married man and has a kid. Unfortunately, the mist comes after a violent storm, and after a while he, his kid, and all the other characters we will soon know are trapped in a convenience store. We soon get used to the store as being the home for the characters. So that's settled. However, this convenience store isn't as convenient as it seems. Unfortunate events happen, people get killed. It's realistic but it's also not. It's confusing sometimes when you think about it. Stephen King messes with your mind. Even though he had nothing to do with the production of this film besides being the guy that Darabont snatched the idea from, I just can't help but feel that he is all over this. It's disturbing in a way and so is the film. So deep but yet not hard to comprehend, probably not hard to create either. Although he messes with your mind and emotions or tries to anyway, his stories aren't extremely complicated. They are actually kind of juvenile. But it's what he puts inside that is truly deep.The character we seem to hate as soon as we see is the crazy bible thumper Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden). She is insane, truly. She continues throughout the film to smash the bible and its words in the peoples' faces. It causes people to get stressed out. She thinks this is all how God wanted it to happen. She is bible crazy, overly dramatic about every event and expects it to happen the way the bible words it in Revelations. Harden is brilliant here as Carmody. She played her part so well I actually thought she was really insane. Very convincing. Or if someone just walked on the set he or she would probably think she was truly out of her mind. Actually, all the parts were played very well. Not one bad actor/actress present. Even Drayton's kid played his part to perfection.Someone we begin to like is Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), who begins to develop a friendship with David and take care of his kid. The actress is great and played her role so well. The entire film is convincing, wonderfully acted, well done!But I can't give it any more than three stars. Something tells me we have all seen this before. It reminds me a lot of John Carpenter's The Fog but that was a two star at most film. This is better but still not excellent. Something continues to tell me that this has been brought about before, the beginning, the middle and even the ending, which was very good by the way. Some people disagree and thought it was too much to handle. Come on people, it's a film.Perhaps this has been made before. Not just The Fog, or this storyline or even the people. Maybe the whole thing has been talked about before. Maybe it truly has been written (implied) in the pages of the bible and preached by bible enthusiasts throughout the world.Movie directed by Frank Darabont.",7,0,2,25 November 2007
I Am Legend," A legend worth remembering...
","I Am Legend/2007/***Main Stars: Robert Neville: Will Smith Anna: Alice BragaThe title is perfect. Basically, the entire film is Robert Neville (Will Smith) and creatures. So he is legend because it says so in the title. When I first heard about this film I seriously didn't have a clue what it was about. And, to tell you the truth, I really didn't know what it was about when I walked into the theater, sat down, and watched. It took practically thirty minutes for me to understand the plot because the majority of the beginning was Will Smith saying perhaps one or two words to his dog and sniping deer. That was about it.The setting: Manhattan. If you haven't heard anything about the film or read an outline then you most likely wouldn't understand what's going on, just like I didn't. All I knew was that Manhattan had some sort of tragic accident and it resulted in the entire city being evacuated. The special effects were quite convincing in the beginning. Whoever designed what Manhattan would look like without any people occupying it, did an excellent job. Talk about a difficult job. The streets are constantly flooded but not for this.I liked the beginning because there weren't too many jumping scenes, horrifying images, etc. It was quiet perhaps too quiet. Because then the true action began with unconvincing CGI creatures that were supposed to look like diseased humans but looked more like zombies. What's the difference, though? They had similar features to humans but their mouths were about triple the size of a normal human. They were also paler, uglier, and greasier than humans and that's about it. Triple-sizing their mouths can only mean one thing. These creatures won't speak; they'll just scream for no reason taking up the entire screen with their mouth, which you see a lot of times in horror films with also nasty creatures and gigantic mouths. How else will they be heard?Do we need to hear them? No. I preferred if they didn't scream at all so they wouldn't disturb the peace. But once I heard the first bellow I knew the movie was gonna last for quite a while.It didn't. The movie actually ended rather abruptly just like it started.So how did these once normal humans turn into these annoying, abnormal humans? Well, a virus spread throughout the vicinity, killing way too many. He was the only one left. He sent out radio messages for about three years without an answer, hoping, just hoping there would be someone to answer to him, someone out there he could help or perhaps someone who could help him.He lived an O.K. life. He and his dog lived in a house he once lived in with his wife and kid. Flashbacks demonstrated it throughout the film. Usually when he was sleeping, it would flip to a flashback to show us what was happening and how it happened, and then later it would all become clearer to us.Most importantly, though, you must watch the beginning scene. All it shows for about a minute is an interview with a doctor (played by Emma Thompson) on TV. Listen to the interview. We soon see Will Smith and his dog three years later.The movie did flip around a lot so pay attention.Now obviously there has to be a human that shows up eventually. Yeah. Anna (Alice Braga) and her son Ethan (Charlie Tahan) show. How did they get there, knowing that all bridges were destroyed, all humans were gone, only manikins were in stores, and objects, animals, and creatures are the only sources of life? Perhaps they swam or took a boat. They obviously cared a lot about Neville and wanted to save him. Why did she show up all of the sudden? Divine intervention, perhaps? Francis Lawrence is a good director. I have to credit him the most because there wasn't much of a screenplay. Instead, Neville just fights these 'superhumans' and uses his dog as a companion. Lawrence, however, builds the suspense in a way we really like. Smith did a wonderful job. He's a good actor, but maybe this time it wasn't all acting.Movie directed by Francis Lawrence.",7,1,3,18 December 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Excellent! Yet not as good as Cinderella Man
","Million Dollar Baby/2004/ Main Stars: Clint Eastwood Hilary Swank Morgan FreemanOne of the best films of the year besides 'The Aviator' and 'Batman Begins!' It definitely makes sense to give this movie four Academy Awards! Now, a lot of you people probably think that this movie is all about boxing; well it ain't! You see this movie has a lot to do with relationship between a young woman named Margaret 'Maggie' Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and an older man named Franklin 'Frankie' Dunn (Clint Eastwood). At the very beginning of the movie (believe it or not) there's a boxing match taking place and you see Frankie standing near his boxer's corner and the boxer just happens to be a guy. About a day later he sees a young woman (Maggie is who he sees) punching a punching bag and Frankie is known to be an old grouch. So, he walks down to see her and growls, 'I don't train girls!' after she repeatedly asked him to be her trainer for boxing. About a day or two later he finally said, 'Okay.' As everyone should know, Morgan Freeman was in this movie playing a former boxer named Scrap, now the caretaker of the gym where people practice punching punching bags and boxing. He wasn't a trainer but he knew a lot about boxing just like Frankie. He also helped Maggie when she needed help. After much training and many fights Maggie had saved enough money to buy her 'trailer trash' family a new house. The thing is instead of thanking her, the family was mad because the mom didn't think she would receive her welfare payments if they were going to live in this new house. So Maggie gave up on her family and continued to box and got better and better until the World Title fight, when a very unfortunate thing happened (I won't tell you). You and you only will find out the ending to this remarkable, extremely well acted, and fantastic movie. Movie directed by Clint Eastwood.",10,0,1,2 April 2006
Shrek 2," Funny sequel
","Shrek 2/2004/***Main Stars:Mike MyersEddie MurphyCameron DiazRupert Everett This movie is a must-see movie! The first movie is a star better than this one in my opinion. This is definitely the Shrek type of movie though- adventure, comedy and romance. Shrek (Mike Myers) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are on another adventure and this time Princess Fiona's (Cameron Diaz's) real knight (Rupert Everett) comes to save her from the tower but of course she's gone. Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona visit the land Far, Far Away to see Fiona's parents. The parents don't know about her marrying Shrek so they're very surprised. I'm not going to tell you other things so don't get worried but I will tell you that there is also a fairy godmother and this magic potion in this movie. You will figure out why both her and the potion relate to this movie. It was a good movie, rent it! Movie directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury.",7,0,0,2 April 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not as good as the original...
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory/2005/**1/2Main Stars: Johnny Depp Freddie Highmore David Kelley Deep RoyIt wasn't a really good movie. Just because this movie follows the book by Roald Dahl more than the original movie ('Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory') doesn't mean it is better. The movie was good at the beginning but it went a bit downhill when Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appeared in the movie. There are a few reasons why I did and did not like this film; one of the reasons why I did not like this film was: Johnny Depp (Willy Wonka) had a very pale face and a very annoying voice in this movie. The reason why he wanted to be like this is because he intended to be like a kids' talk show host but some people predict he intended to be kind of like Michael Jackson in this movie. Even if he intended to be like Michael Jackson it would be weird anyway. Another reason is that the acting was not Oscar-caliber although Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelley) were good. The last reason is that this was the strangest and quirkiest movie I saw this year and I really can't explain how it was strange and quirky, it just was. The things I did like were the sets of the movie and Danny Elfman's musical score. It was also creative how the oompa-loompas' were played by the exact same person (Deep Roy). The story was kind of interesting, too. There were quite a few sets in this movie (the chocolate factory, the house, etc.) and they were all fantastic! There were a few comedy scenes but not many. In comparison, I'll have to say the original was better than this one. These are the reasons why I liked the original better than this one: Better acting (Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, for instance), more songs, better screenplay and it was overall delightful!

World Trade Center," Excellent departure for Oliver Stone. A Masterpiece!
","World Trade Center/2006/****Main Stars: Nicolas Cage Michael Pena Maria Bello Maggie GyllenhaalDirector Oliver Stone (writer of Scarface and director of the recent film Alexander) is known to be a director of violence and profanity. Here he departs himself from that and directs this masterpiece filled with emotion and tragedy and also inspiration. Cops are assigned to where they need to go or guard for the day of September 11, 2001. It's just a typical day on the job until a few cops see a shadow of a plane reflected on a near building. That is the start of it all. You would think some of this film would be related to politics. And you would hear people's opinions on this tragedy and whose fault it is. People would most likely blame President Bush because he's the perfect person to blame right? Rumors are he's stupid. Plus, he is the Head of State and who better to blame than the person in charge. He's sitting behind his desk clueless. However, this film did not have any of that which most people are sick of hearing. And that is another reason why this film is so grand. It concentrates on two men- John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena)- who saw something other than evil. Something other than what the world saw. They saw that they had a chance to live and a chance to save and do their best to evacuate the people from the Twin Towers. What's inspiring about this film is that even though they are having an extremely hard time building up claustrophobia while under the rubble, they stay with it, they don't give up because they are tough and are built to take hardship. And that is exactly what the real Will and John did; they remained as calm as they could be and instead of panicking too much, they stayed strong. Back at home Will and John's wives obviously start to get nervous. Their husbands are out their breathing in dust and rubble and are stuck in one spot. John McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) is the one always to be scared and rarely has any hope. However one of her four children wants to get out there and find dad and bring him back. Will Jimeno's wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) also is stressed and is pregnant which makes it even worse. It was definitely emotional and also very well done. They flip back and forth between families who don't even recognize each other when crossing each other in the hospital. Then they flip back to the scenes with Will and John trying to occupy them with something while they wait for rescue teams. Some of their conversations were actually a bit humorous and also emotional Conversing about past things and even envisioning them again and again. When they envision these flashbacks, they feel like getting out of the rubble even more. They need to find something to attract a rescue team so they can be saved. We urgently wait for one to come while we feel exactly what Will and John feel. Misery. I hope what I'm saying isn't discouraging you from seeing the film. The film is excellent (inspiring and not politically charged) but, yes, very emotional. I usually don't cry out loud and need a hanky to store all the moist snot. But I do on the inside and I feel sad when leaving the theater. Because right before the end credits, it tells you all the true events in captions that really did happen on that day and later when two men saw something other than evil and the rest of the people saw hell.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Flight of the Order has its ups and downs
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/2007/***Main Stars: Harry Potter: Daniel Radcliffe Ron Weasley: Rupert Grint Hermione Granger: Emma Watson Dolores Umbridge: Imelda Staunton Sirius Black: Gary OldmanThis adaptation of the very entertaining book proves that movies can never beat the books. Although a good film, it lacks the magic, excitement, and suspense that the books and past movies had. The past Harry Potter films have actually intrigued us a lot with the stories. In this one we seem to observe what happens with moderate interest (which is good!), instead of wanting, extremely eagerly, to know what will happen next. That is my main negative point. Glad I got that out of the way. I seriously hate talking negatively about a Potter film but I did have to let that out. The film still gives us some entertainment, especially by the wonderfully portrayed Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who gives us so much entertainment just by her brief clearing of her throat: 'hem, hem'. Staunton has given us a character to laugh at, laugh with, and even to relate with for those of you who are intolerably bureaucratic. The acting is great here by the KIDS, surprisingly. The adults, except Umbridge, seemed a little dull, not really depositing much life into their characters, especially Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Radcliffe did a wonderful job; Watson and Grint, too. Gary Oldman (playing Sirius Black) didn't have as much life in this chapter as he did in the third. Then again, the book didn't really portray him as lively But he played his part well, I guess. As for the script, it was good. The script was well written and original, just like the book. The music by British composer Nicholas Hooper was good. His best was Umbridge's theme. Not as good as Patrick Doyle, who should have been up for an Oscar for number four. And, of course, not as good as Williams' score for the first three. If you don't know who I mean, I feel sorry for you. The third was his best achievement for the franchise and actually was up for an Oscar but Williams didn't win. The first was in the same boat. Back to the story what a convoluted, although well written script. The third 'Pirates' script was convoluted and crappy. This one was convoluted and good. Remember, it wasn't as intriguing as the other four! But when Harry started creating a rebellion, sure, we wanted to see more. I mean, come on. I couldn't be bored by it. That's not possible when it comes to Harry Potter. So I watched and was impressed to see Harry finally get aggravated with all the nonsense going on. I agree with him. There is a lot going on that needs answering quickly, especially the dream he has been having about a certain door at the end of the hallway of a certain building that is certainly going to answer a lot of certain questions. Well something inside the door SHOULD. But does Harry know yet? No, that's too easy. Meanwhile, havoc is reeking at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by one certain teacher. Umbridge. She is basically making Hogwarts into a bureaucratic school and enjoys doing it. The Ministry of Magic, under the control of Cornelius Fudge, is behind quite a lot of it. There is also a sub-plot about Sirius Black and his evil cousin Bellatrix Lestrange. But that's not near as vital as Umbridge's role but it is slightly important, but I'm not going into any of that. See the movie for yourselves for that. There are also some things that were somewhat vital in the book that the movie didn't even mention! There was something about Ron joining Quidditch. They didn't include that; no Quidditch at all! There was another slightly important aspect about a girl named Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), who is in this film, and her father's newspaper/magazine articles entitled, I believe, 'The Quibbler'. None of that was even mentioned except for just showing one scene with her reading it. So, if you haven't read any of the books, you ARE missing some extra detail. Some important and some not. Depends on what you think. As for the duration, it was adequate. I actually wouldn't have minded if they had increased the running time. This is THE shortest Potter film of the series running at 138 minutes; followed by the third (142), the first (152), the fourth (157), and the second (161). I believe they tried too hard to reduce all the unimportant (TO THEM!) scenes and made it shorter than initially planned (the book is 870 pages long!). Whereas, the second film, running at 161 minutes, was longer because they didn't try as hard to reduce it because the book was shorter (341 pages long). It most likely turned out longer than they initially planned. You know what I mean; you know what I'm sayin'? Overall, however, this film is good. Yeah, it had some minor mistakes, a bit too short, dull acting, convolution, etc. But hey they tried and whatcha gonna do? No film is perfect, but this one has an imagination and gives you entertainment and escapism for a good 138 minutes. This film is the funniest of the series, also. It is definitely worth the money to spend. You will enjoy it. I guarantee that. Although David Yates' direction could have been slightly better. Okay, I'm done criticizing Movie directed by David Yates. Oh, by the way, Dumbledore and Voldemort finally fight in this one! It's a rather different conflict, however. You'll know what I mean when you see it",7,0,0,16 July 2007

The Da Vinci Code," Why all the controversy?
","The Da Vinci Code/2006/***Main Stars: Tom Hanks Ian McKellen Paul Bettany Audrey Tautou Jean Reno Alfred MolinaEvery single person in the United States knows that this film has caused more controversy than any film in decades and decades. I don't listen to one word those people say. They might as well shut it because no one is listening to them and if anyone is listening to the people who waste their breath they're in the crowds shouting like lunatics like all the others. I think the unnecessary ranting and raving should stop because now it's just getting ridiculous. 'IT'S BLASPHEMY! DON'T BELIEVE ONE WORD OF IT! DON'T SEE IT OR YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL IN BURN IN ITS FIRING, EVIL DEPTHS!' the overly-melodramatic people roar. I will have to say for the sixth trillionth time, it's FICTION! Do NOT blame Dan Brown or Ron Howard, one of THE BEST directors of all time besides Spielberg and don't blame the actors either or the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman who does wonderful scriptwriting for several Howard films. I also have discussed the film with three of my teachers and they all believe it is FICTION and should really be left alone and not be insulted the way it is. No, when I talked to the teachers, they said they hadn't seen it yet but they are planning on it. So even the TRUE CATHOLIC SCHOOL teachers aren't making as big a deal about it as much as these extremely annoying protesters that are really starting to get on my last nerves. But yet I tell a few students that I had seen the film and they gasp and say it is against our religion. Is it? Yes. Is it FICTION? YES! It shouldn't be offending the Catholic Church or our Lord. You know why? Because it wasn't us that thought of the theory. It was Da Vinci who thought that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had a child and that the famous painting The Last Supper proved it. All the movie is is a fiction. A fiction with fictional characters and crisisTHE FILM: The film was far-fetched and entertaining at the same time as was the great National Treasure which I thought was much better than what the critics thought. It contained a murder mystery and also contained a few secrets which I obviously will not reveal The murder mystery was an old man that supposedly had to tell an albino (Paul Bettany) this information that is later explained in the film. The albino is part of the religious membership Opus Dei which is another religious group besides others that are mentioned in the film. Opus Dei also includes French actor Jean Reno playing the captain named Captain Fache. It also includes a bishop named Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) who also seems to be part of the Opus Dei scheme. Opus Dei seems to be portrayed as the criminal group here or at least in my eyes it is because it tries to seize the Priory of Sion's secret which is a secret religious organization. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the one to solve the murder mystery. The ones that find the body pick Langdon because they think he is an expert on examining religious symbols. He is a quite impressive symbologist! His photographic memory also comes in handy during the investigation. Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) is the woman who is gifted with wonderful experience in cryptology and who also is the woman who joins forces with Langdon with this murder mystery. The symbols and codes they find and try to find lead up to the Priory of Sion and what it is. And unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher puzzle in time everything will be pretty much be lost. And that's not good. So it kept you going with intense, preposterous scenes and even some humor from which you wouldn't expect it from, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing. He was a very interesting character that seemed very wise and yet it was a surprising end that involved him but obviously it is not fair to tell unless you've already read the book. The reason why I'm not making this movie review as long as some of the others I write is because most of the film is secret so if I say too much you have just been told a secret from the film and you will blame me for spoiling the film for you. My lips and words are shut about the film's story now. The movie was not excellent but it was not stupid either as some of the anti-'Da Vinci' think. I thought it was good and Ron Howard, as I said in my Cinderella Man review, is becoming better and better and will soon be the Steven Spielberg of film.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Wonderful imagination and just like the first book! But they don't include Peeves...
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone/2001/****Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert GrintOkay, so this is the starting film, the very first film of the seven-part series of HARRY POTTER! What a wonderful, charming, and imaginative book and movie! I was extremely entertained with the book after I saw the movie. I was only in third grade when the movie came out so I was not the best at reading nor the most convinced of reading. I have read all of the books and I say I am very impressed with all of them; however, I also am safe to say some were better than others. I'm totally interested in the whole series and many readers can't wait until the seventh book of the seven-part series comes out and neither can I Well I can wait because I have other books to read but I will, when the seventh book comes out, start reading immediately because the sixth book actually leads into the seventh which makes you hang on for a long time. But before the seventh book and movie and the prequels before that happen, the world lay at the mercy of the young 11 year old Harry Potter having to face the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone in his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He becomes Hogwarts's newest celebrity on the very first day when everyone whispers in gob smacked voices, 'Harry Potter!' Harry Potter, as clueless as he is since he lives with the foul, evil Muggle Dursleys', doesn't know he's a wizard until the keeper of the keys, Hagrid, tells him. And the most expected scene would be Harry getting his letter which is inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and to become a very complex wizard in his seven years of learning; progressing toward the end until finally BEcoming one of the best, smartest, cleverest wizards to ever live. Ever since Lord Voldemort gave Harry Potter that scar on his forehead Harry has become famous throughout the wizard world. In the Muggle world, however, everyone could careless about him as though he's some regular pedestrian on the sidewalk with a normal and dull life. Yet in the wizard world everyone shouts enthusiastically, 'HARRY POTTER! WE MEET AT LAST! YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR PARENTS DID. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER BUT YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHER'S EYES! YOU LOOK JUST LIKE I DREAMED YOU WOULD!' Then they bow down to Harry like he's there ruler, their lord and so on and so forth So this so-called Sorcerer's Stone is a secret, very secret stone and it's all Hogwarts's business according to Dumbledore and Hagrid. Yet later in the magnificent film, the stone becomes Harry's, Ron's, and Hermione's quest to find the secret of it. Nicolas Flamel has something to do with it and Nicolas is a friend of Dumbledore and Dumbledore himself wouldn't dare give out valuable information regarding the Sorcerer's Stone. What exactly is it? Oh come on Lord Voldemort thinks it is power for him but obviously it's not. It's a stone and a useless piece of junk (supposedly), which is then later, destroyed. But what then makes this film so magnificent? The original Quidditch matches of course and all the rest of the guts that fill in the movie and it is all from J.K. Rowling's magnificent, creative imagination. The story (the book) and the movie are both equally entertaining because the movie follows the story of the book very well. Then there's the very original character Lord Voldemort Wow how awesome was the very last scene when Lord Voldemort escapes in a very painful way from Professor Quirrel's weak body and how he turns to dust/dirt at the very end! One thing is for sure, the movie itself and book will become classics ten to fifteen years from now. They'll always remain classics to me, now and forever.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not as good as the first three but still wonderfully imaginative and dark!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/2005/***1/2Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Robert Pattinson Clémence Poésy Stanislav Ianevski Michael GambonThis film is great and wonderfully imaginative but is probably my least favorite of the Harry Potter movie series. I had a feeling this would be greater than expected after seeing the preview a dozen times. Yet I was not exactly correct. The thing is the composer was not John Williams (as it was in the other three Harry Potter movies). It was Patrick Doyle whom I have never heard of. The direction was by Mike Newell whom also I have never heard of. So there are quite a few people that are new to me but there still is Steve Kloves (the screenwriter for the whole series so far). I have heard of him so there's one. I um It's heard to explain this movie because there are too many things going on at once. Basically it is a great film but yet not as good as the first and second which were astounding. Let me try to define; Harry is in yet another adventure of almost getting killed. There. Okay. Okay. Yes, there is a lot more to the story than that. Harry finds that his crush is going to the Yule Ball (the dance) at the school with someone else named Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson). Harry's crush is named Cho Chang. Having read half of the book already, I knew about most of the beginning and knew what was going to happen. The thing is they cut a lot of the information (the details) from the book out in the movie because (obviously) you can't fit a whole amount of detail from a 700-page book in a 2-½ hour movie. You just can't. But to me it was still great and extremely dark and I can tell it took a lot of effort to make this film (especially for the visual/special effects coordinators). This film probably had more special effects than any of the Harry Potter movies out there. Now in this movie not only does Hogwarts house the Hogwarts students but also houses the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Those two words I mentioned are names of different schools of magic besides Hogwarts. They are housed at Hogwarts because they consist of a champion of The Triwizard Tournament. There is a champion of Hogwarts named Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), a champion of Beauxbatons named Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy), and a champion of Durmstrang named Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), but Harry Potter also is included in that because of a magical goblet that spit out his name on a burning piece of parchment (along with the other three champions). Now you notice that it's called The Triwizard Tounament; meaning that there should only be three wizard/witches that are in it. In this case it should be called The Quadrawizard Tournament since there is a member of Hogwarts that is joined but Harry is also in there. So there are really two people from Hogwarts and one person from the other two competing schools. Now, this so-called goblet is the main thing in this book and film because that goblet tells whom the champion will be from each school that competes in The Triwizard Tournament (That's obviously where they get the title of the book/film). Whoever those champions consist will be the ones who are assigned three tasks that are very difficult. Whoever wins will win the cup. 'Wiz' is emblazoned on the cup and whoever wins will be the 'Wiz' of The Triwizard Tournament. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) was obviously not as good as Richard Harris (the one prior to Gambon) because he had was too gruff and too loud and not as wise as Harris was. Richard was a tough guy though because he still played Dumledore even though he was very sick while on the set of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and then soon passed away. There also is a teacher that shows up in this movie and teaches the Defense against the Dark Arts class (a new teacher) named Mad-Eye Moody. At the end is a shock though and it involves this character so watch closely. Other than that you have your usual other characters: Hermione, Ron, and Draco Malfoy who didn't have a huge part in this movie (Draco I mean) nor did his comrades. Movie directed by Mike Newell. Oh! By the way, this is also the film where you see Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) in person! Very awesome!",10,0,1,4 July 2006
The Untouchables," A classic! A must-see mob thriller!
","Untouchables, The/1987/****Main Stars: Kevin Costner Sean Connery Robert DeNiro Andy GarciaThe first time I saw this film, I saw only half of it and it was not that long ago. But this time I saw the whole thing. I just popped in the tape and watched the whole thing two weeks after I recorded it off of the AMC channel. Obviously there were commercials to fast forward through but I didn't care because whenever the movie would fade and go to a commercial, it kept me going wanting to press the two arrows pointing to the right (on the button). Every time a commercial would come, the suspense killed me! I could literally hear my heart thumping THUMP pause THUMP pause THUMP in the dead silence not even hearing the VCR fast forwarding. I actually wanted to fast forward through all the disgusting commercials. It was near Halloween when I recorded the movie meaning AMC had their traditional 'Monsterfest' movies throughout the month of October. They showed the clip of the famous 'knife' scene from the movie 'Carrie' (Stephen King novel). Then showed the famous 'jumping' scene from the John Carpenter classic 'Halloween'. Then a not so famous scene from the very disgusting movie (I could tell because the person had no skin but just bones, blood, muscles showing) Hellbound: Hellraiser II. That was one of the worst movies of all time besides the original 'Hellraiser'. Stupid, Stupid! Other movie clips shown were: 'Scream' (1 and 2), 'Friday the 13', another clip from 'Carrie', and the horrible acted movie 'The Amityville Horror' (original). Woops! I forgot! I need to be reviewing the movie. Let me shorten this a bit. This movie was basically trying to catch the notorious villain named Al Capone and the rest of his gang members. In the middle of trying to catch Al Capone and his gang members were many gruesome killings and many gunfights, and an interrogation. There was another very long scene where Kevin Costner's character Agent Elliot Ness has to help a lady bring her baby stroller and luggage up these steps to a train station but he also had to shoot some guys in the process. He shot a guy and then accidentally knocked the stroller over but his sidekick Andy Garcia's character Giuseppe Petri (Agent George Stone fake name) saves it just in time. This movie also includes a chase on rooftops of many buildings until finally a member of Capone's gang gets pushed off one of the building's rooftops. Okay, why did I like this movie so much? Well, mainly because Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors. I also think Kevin Costner and Robert DeNiro did a great job in this movie as well. Andy Garcia was okay in this and so was everyone else besides Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert DeNiro. I also thought the story was quite entertaining and suspenseful. The cinematography was excellent which was directed by Stephen H. Burum, A.S.C. and the music was also excellent which was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Ennio Morricone. Even though this movie was violent and had some blood and gore, that doesn't mean you can't see it. Since I had the cut version (taped from AMC which cuts out every little thing), it wasn't as bad as if I had the uncut version. I still thought it was violent but I could tell they cut out a few swear words. I know if a movie like this has a person that says 'darn' or 'goodness' or 'golly' and has all this blood and gore, there is something wrong with the makers of the movie!

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Even better than the first! WONDERFUL!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/2002/****Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert GrintOkay the first one was WONDERFUL! But it turns out I liked the second one even better than the first! Okay the first deals with the Sorcerer's Stone while this one deals with The Chamber of Secrets. Okay I'd choose the chamber before the stone or maybe even after because best is for last. Yes, this had an imaginative, creative story to it with even more and better characters and better story, longer than the first: Aragog, Dobby the House-Elf, Tom Riddle, Moaning Myrtle, and Colin Creevey. They were all interesting and entertaining characters and of course more so than the first. This so-called Chamber of Secrets is a wonderfully looking chamber with an old man's head in it (Salazar Slytherin) where the basilisk (a giant snake) comes out of and chases Harry. This is the first time you physically see The Burrow, or the Wealsey's house, which is a very tall building for a house. Also you see the old Ford Anglia for the first time that is able to fly (because Mr. Weasley enchanted it) and turn itself invisible and helps Harry and Ron escape from the Forbidden Forest in one scene that includes the spider Aragog in the scene. It also is the car they fly to Hogwarts itself since someone in particular closed the barrier and didn't let them get onto Platform 9¾. When they are actually inside the castle you see Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris) for the first time in the film. He obviously didn't look good because he was very sick in the film and I'm surprised Harris was able to make the film with how ill he was. He passed away shortly after the film was released in the theaters. That is one cast member dead from the Harry Potter series. The new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is worse than and not as convincing as Richard Harris. I'd prefer Harris over Gambon because not only is he wiser and has straight posture (like Dumbledore should be) but he's calmer and not as loud and annoying as Gambon. So, on with the mysterious chamber The chamber has supposedly been opened and Hogwarts needs to be under supreme caution because, as I said before, the chamber is a home to a vicious monster snake, or basilisk. The teachers were getting anxious and were also thinking of closing the school if the culprit behind the attacks was not found. Harry and Ron also seem anxious and use the Invisibility cloak to get around to places where they really need to go like Hagrid's hut. Hermione tries to discourage them because it could be dangerous but she did not succeed. Students are supposed to be in their dormitories or accompanied by a teacher at nine o'clock at night. Each Head of House tell their student that. So Harry has the Invisibility cloak idea. They have many questions for Hagrid like how the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Hagrid, however, could not finish this statement because someone knocked on the door at that exact moment. Harry and Ron were unconvinced. They were then told to follow the spiders if they needed any specific information on the chamber and who opened it and blabitty bloo So they arrive in the Forbidden Forest, which is home to many terrifying creatures, and the one they were going to interrogate was the giant spider Aragog. He gave them as much info as he could give them, which was very limited. Ron was still unconvinced; but Harry found out a big piece of information concerning it. That led to one of my favorite parts of the film, the chamber that Harry, Ron and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (Gilderoy Lockhart who is played by none other than the stage actor Kenneth Branagh) discover. He's the cowardly teacher that thinks he's one of the best wizards in history. This made the magnificently adventurous film become even more magnificently adventurous. This is definitely THE BEST Harry Potter film ever to be released and probably will remain. I made a big mistake saying that the fourth one was the most spectacular. I was just astounded by it in the theaters but now I've found out that the second one is still THE BEST. I would be astonished if there was a Potter film that could beat this one. So now we wait.

War of the Worlds," Steven Spielberg with his mediocre film
","War of the Worlds/2005/**Main Stars: Tom Cruise Dakota Fanning Justin ChatwinThis film is the Steven Spielberg version of 1953's 'The War of the Worlds'. Obviously the Steven Spielberg version has better effects (by Industrial Light and Magic) because of the fact this film was made in early 2005 while 'The War of the Worlds' was made in 1953. The story for both films actually came from a book by the famous author, H.G. Wells and then became a radio show and the radio show said that aliens were coming to earth. At the beginning of the show, however, the DJs' said it was all a joke. But some people didn't hear the beginning of the show and tuned in when the show had been going on for a while and thought they were really serious about the aliens. Of course, everyone found out it was fictional after a few years (or even more or less time) and that's what started 1953's 'The War of the Worlds'. Back to 'War of the Worlds' Let's just say this was not what I was expecting. This had a totally different storyline to it then what I saw and thought from the previews. Yes, yes the special effects were great (assisted by Steven Spielberg, who is also the director of this film) but the story was most definitely lamer than what I hypothesized. I know now not to hypothesize what the movie is going to be like. Now, this film is mainly about aliens (the third film Steven Spielberg has directed that involves aliens along with 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.'). You see 'E.T.' is an extra terrestrial that comes to earth but from a more peaceful planet. While the aliens' ships from this film have been underground (under the streets, lawns, etc. in the earth) for over a millennium or two or three or four or five and the aliens themselves come down in capsules from the sky and enter the ships. They are not quite as harmless and peaceful as our little brown friend named E.T. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is the main star of this film that discovers a severe lightning storm happening in the sky near his apartment. The other stars are Rachel Ferrier (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie Ferrier (Justin Chatwin). The three of them have to find a way (somehow) to survive and escape from the notorious aliens and storms the aliens themselves cause. I have to say this was not Steven Spielberg at his best nor was it Tom Cruise in his best performance. I would say it was Steven Spielberg at his mediocrity. Tom Cruise in his mediocre performance. I mean what happened to Steven Spielberg's 'touch' in his films. He doesn't have it as much as he did with the classics 'Duel' (Spielberg's first directorial film), 'Jaws', and 'Close Encounters' and other films in that time frame that he made. As Spielberg starts to age and get older, his movies start to rise in mediocrity. I wouldn't be surprised if his last film was a flunk. In this case, the story is basically 'hiding' and nothing else. And the only highlights in this film were the acting (not bad) and the special effects (impressive) but I do have to give credit to the people that made this film because I can see this was a big, big budget film and most likely cost a lot of money to make. But to me this film (entertainment wise) was only marginally entertaining. Movie directed by Steven Spielberg.",Null,0,1,2 April 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Funny! Good Will Ferrell flick
","Anchorman/2004/***Main Stars:Will FerrellChristina Applegate Steve Carrel Anchorman was a good movie because just seeing Will Ferrell makes me laugh. His other teammates on the Channel 4 News Team were also very funny especially the one that was a little off (played by Steve Carrel). There wasn't really a main point for this movie except for doing the news. But there was one thing the main character, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) wanted to be- a network news anchor. Then the Channel 4 News Team gets a new news anchor- it's a lady named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). She also had a great passion to be a network news anchor. Anyway, all of the Channel 4 News Team were obsessed with ladies accept for of course Veronica but also one other person that was a guy, Brick Tamblin (Steve Carrel). The Channel 4 News Team also had to do a major story- a panda being born at the zoo. They did the story successfully and went on to different jobs after thatÂ… accept for Veronica and Ron. Veronica and Ron finally became network news anchors at the end. This was another great movie. I count on you to see it. Movie directed by Adam McKay.",7,0,1,2 April 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," A clever fiction that is stranger than fiction...
","Stranger than Fiction/2006/***1/2Main Stars: Will Ferrell Emma Thompson Dustin Hoffman Maggie Gyllenhaal Queen LatifahA clever fiction that is stranger than fiction.Marc Forster's Stranger Than Fiction is a pure delight. Writer Zach Helm shows us his intellect by writing this movie and succeeding rather well. Before seeing this movie, my crazy predictions were telling me that this movie is just going to be about this well organized guy that has a narrator narrating his life 'accurately and with a better vocabulary'. However, the story goes much beyond that, and shows us that Will Ferrell is THE perfect actor to portray Harold Crick. Harold Crick is SUPPOSED to be a fictionalized character in Karen Eifel's (Emma Thompson's) new novel. What Karen doesn't know is that her character is a REAL person. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has a rebellious IRS client Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who just doesn't want to pay (in her words) 'unnecessary taxes'. He tries as nice as possible to make her to. She wouldn't. The movie flips between scenes with Karen Eifel and Harold Crick very frequently. The Karen Eifel scenes are disturbing in some ways because she is a messed up author who smokes and drinks. When you think about it, she's basically playing a TRUE author, because a lot are messed up. A lot of authors in the world today are just a bit 'off' in how they get their ideas. In her case, she sees a fruit rolling down the road and it gives her an idea on how to kill Harold Crick. It shows she does have an imagination but an imagination so 'out there' like, a perfect example, Stephen King. The movie is a comedy-drama, and it even has scenes where Harold uses a journal to find out if his life is a comedy or a tragedy. He puts a tally mark under Comedy if something comedic just came about, or he puts a tally mark under Tragedy if something somewhat tragic came about. He uses this as an experiment to see what kind of story Eifel is writing, that is after he finds out she's writing a story about him. He goes for help a couple of times to find out if he's losing it. One person told him if he's hearing voices in his head, then he's suffering from schizophrenia and should go on qualified medication. Others were of no help until he went to a literary professor named Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who was very humorous in this movie and played his part perfectly. Crick was insisting help from Hilbert. Hilbert asks him loads of unnecessary questions, including, 'What's your favorite word?' Crick replies, 'Integer.' Funny, yet not helping his situation a bit. Plus, this might interfere with his love for Ana Pascal. Crick is desperate and doesn't know what to do now that he finds out that Karen Eifel is going to kill him. Will Eifel kill him? If she did it would be a very depressing ending, especially since Crick is such a kind person in this film. And after a little while in this film, Crick stops thinking about counting his brush strokes from top to bottom and from left to right, and stops thinking about counting his steps before work and catching the bus at the exact time. His wristwatch is one to keep him so organized. And the story is about him and his wristwatch. And he is an organized person. But what happens when your wristwatch goes bad. You might not get up at the exact time in the morning or get somewhere at the exact time you need to. You lose your perfectionism after that. I would focus on life a little more too if I knew I was going to die. You shouldn't worry about the trivial things in life, but the important things in life. He had many important things in his life and had even more when he stopped worrying about being perfect. Do Karen Eifel and her assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) (who helps her find an ending because she has writer's block) know that she is writing a story about a REAL LIFE person? It is not my job to tell you, but it's your job to find out. Movie directed by Marc Forster.",9,0,1,20 November 2006
Jaws," Great classic horror!
","Jaws/1975/***1/2Main Stars: Roy Scheider Robert Shaw Richard DreyfussA handful of people calls this one of the best movies ever made and THE best Spielberg film ever made and it will become an instant classic! It's EXCELLENT! You know what I say? I say it's a great entertaining film but it's not one of the best films ever made, trust me. The best SPIELBERG film would have to be a tie between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Yes, I agree, Jaws is a classic and always will be but yet not as much as ones like the old classic Disney cartoons orrr, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. That would be The Untouchables. It's a wonderful crime-drama just like another EXCELLENT film, The Godfather. They both have their own sense of style and both directed by different Italian directors, Francis Ford Coppola (for The Godfather) and Brian DE Palma (for The Untouchables). They both involve Italian mobsters, Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). I was tempted to put Dona Vitoa Corleonea when talking about the Italian character but I held it back. See those are two classics. Jaws to me is a great but not EXCELLENT film to be ranting and raving about. I mean the story is about a killer shark haunting the citizens of Amity Island. The highlight is definitely (the late) Robert Shaw's character, Quint, who plays the crazy boat captain also trying to look for the killer shark along with Richard Dreyfuss, playing the wacky Matt Hooper whom is very experienced at his job. Then you got Roy Scheider playing the friendly police chief. He's nothing much. Robert Shaw tops 'em all however in his acting. He was always a great actor and also the highlight of James Bond: From Russia With Love. What do these people have to do with this killer shark? Well, the gotta kill it! Before it kills everyone in Amity Island and then continues on its journey to kill other people too. However, the annoying, roly-poly mayor disagrees with their intention. He'd rather keep the beach open in order for people to enjoy the nice, soothing, relaxing water. Basically he bribes with them. If they want to do this and close down HIS beach, he'll want a lot of money for this doing. So the adventure goes on and on and on until finally the classic ending which everyone should know about. Not only does Quint pass away gruesomely in this film but also Robert Shaw himself is dead in real life too. Then leave it up to the people hungry for more. Here come some more sequels, Jaws II, Jaws III, and Jaws the Revenge with whom of all people, Dennis Quaid! Now what's he doin' in a flop like that. When it comes to classic ORIGINAL films, they're great! But then they get put down because of the horrible sequels that follow it or the prequels that begin it. It usually happens that many original films either have sequels or prequels or both. It happens all the time unless every single character dies in the original film or it's based on a true story so they'll just have one film and give up.

Hitch," Funny!
","Hitch/2005/ Main Stars: Will Smith Eva Mendes Kevin James Amber VallettaIt's funny, it has a good story to it, and my mom said it was cute but I wouldn't go that far. This movie (as you probably know) has to do a lot about love but not in that sissy way. Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith) is whom we could call the 'Date Doctor.' He's the one that helps single men get together with single women. But he respects women very much so he knows how to get men together with women the right way. There is one guy named Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) that's a klutzy guy that really cannot find the girl he wants- Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Alex helps him out by helping him dance because he would be going to a restaurant to dance with Allegra Cole later. The dance scene with Alex and Albert was definitely the funniest scene in the whole movie. The bad thing is Alex's woman of his dreams- Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) gets mad at him thinking that he was someone trying to get men together with women the disrespectful way. But, heading towards the end everyone figures out he gets single people together the respectful way. This is a film that I could say doesn't have a need to be made but it's still a hilarious comedy that anyone will love. Movie directed by Andy Tennant.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006

I had been waiting so long for this and now it's here!

The Silence of the Lambs," An excellent Jonathan Demme picture
","The Silence of the Lambs/1991/****Main Stars: Anthony Hopkins Jodie Foster Ted LevineWho would have thought such a peculiar story would have won five Oscars? Well, pretty much every one. There are so many Academy Award Winning films that are very unique including this one. It won five academy awards being BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST ACTOR, BEST ACTRESS, and BEST SCREENPLAY. I think that the BEST SCREENPLAY academy award is the most important mainly because the screenplay is what makes the film. The movie itself involving acting and directing could be crappy but yet if the screenplay itself is good, than the movie would still be good. That's my opinion and you have yours but yet many people agree with what I say (about the movies I mean). Examples of bad acting (somewhat) and directing (somewhat) films would be the original Star Wars films that had pretty bad acting (not counting the Emperor) from quite a few actors but yet the screenplay was adequate. So all the originals were average to good. But yet Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was excellent! The acting wasn't bad at all (not counting Hayden Christensen) and the special effects and script were great! But not all films are that way too bad. Anyhoo, The Silence of the Lambs would be considered excellent and definitely deserved the Oscars it received. And this film definitely deserves to be on ECLASSICS. 'Why was this film so excellent?' People ask me. 'Because of the wonderful story by the author named Thomas Harris who wrote the book and the screenwriter named Ted Tally that transformed it into a movie.' 'Oh' This is an all-around film to me because it has a wonderful story, screenplay great acting especially by Anthony Hopkins, great directing, and great music! You see the story is mainly about two psychopathic killers (Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), and Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). Hannibal Lector (as you all should know) is an intelligent cannibal. He enjoys beating people and BITING people to death but yet speaks rather calmly when talking to FBI agent Clarice Starling. The brilliant Lector has to tell her about another psychopathic killer who skins his victims named Jame Gumb or Buffalo Bill (his nickname). He's one deranged man. Not only does he skin his victims but he also shoves a bug cocoon down each of his victims' throats. But at least he doesn't eat people like a cannibal or Hannibal Lector. One good scene was when the FBI agents actually find out that Lector has killed two cops by releasing the hand0cuffs from his hands and beating them both, biting, etc. When the cops run to the door that leads to the enormous room with Lector's cell, you see a shadow on the door that's shaped like an angel. When they go in, one of them identifies the shadow being a person and the cop goes 'O dear God'. The camera instantaneously cuts to the scene with the cop. He is hung on the cell like an angel with a light pointed to his back to make him look glowing and the music goes crazy being so melodramatic, it gave me the chills. It was expected though. The gimmicky DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!! It was a freaky scene but a well-done scene the same. This movie was filled with great scenes including the end when he says he's going to eat an FBI agent (Jack Crawford played by Scott Glen) for supper that evening. Great ending, great! Then there are the sequels to this which weren't that good because they seem to be exactly the same as their predecessor just like almost all sequels are.

Casino Royale," Not the typical 'Bond' style. Perhaps on purpose?
","Casino Royale/2006/**1/2Main Stars: Daniel Craig Eva Green Mads MikkelsenWhen it comes to James Bond, of which I am a huge fan, I expect Bond to be the typical dark-haired/eyed, suave, charming, petite Bond. Daniel Craig is the blond-haired, blue-eyed, gritty, tough guy Bond. Do I prefer the dark, don't-touch-the-hair Bond? Or the light, gritty Bond? Well I prefer the dark. Sean Connery is obviously the best Bond there is by far. But Craig shows a little more realism. He's not afraid to get down and dirty in more than just one thing too. Yes, the other Bonds are strong obviously but you never see them bleed nor sweat; or at least it's rare when you see that. However, Bond should be the mysterious one, who never has one hair out of place. You shouldn't see him getting hurt! No, no, no, that's all too real! Bond is supposed to be 'cartoony' and fake. That's what makes Bond interesting. Yes, I love realistic films, but when it comes to Bond I expect a cartoon with gadgetry and charm. This had a bunch of explosions and deaths and card games. Goldfinger, which is the BEST James Bond film by far, is a cartoon practically with fake acting and gadgets but not TOO many explosions or boring parts. Casino Royale is just the opposite; too many explosions and too many boring parts which would be the card games. That's why the movie is two and a half hours long. Half is card games. A lot are explosions. However, the rest would be some interesting talk here and there. The talk was entertaining because of the words and actions James used. I didn't say Daniel Craig was bad as Bond, but I didn't say he was good either. Remember the dark is better. Perhaps there might be a reason why Bond isn't as good as he is in the other films. Remember this is the first novel of the Bond series. Casino Royale was the first novel Ian Fleming (creator and author of the James Bond series) wrote for the series. So maybe James Bond is not SUPPOSED to be good yet. He is STARTING to LEARN how to be the Bond he should be; meaning the classic Bond. However, this is set in modern times and not all the way back in the 60s. Who knows what the filmmakers wanted? But Craig DID do a good job. The MAIN reason why I gave this 'a bit of a disappointment' rating is because the movie itself didn't have a very good story. I was expecting a great story followed by the acting, action, and obviously what Bond does best. But I only received three out of the four. I didn't receive an exciting story. Usually Bond stories are a little cliché, I have to admit. But this one was mainly about this man named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who needs to win money at a casino in order to fund terrorist activities. Bond is aided by an accountant named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) whom 'M' places as her watchful eye on Bond to make sure he doesn't go out of control, and also just in case Bond needs help. They start a bit of a relationship during the movie. At the casino, Le Chiffre plays obviously Bond and a couple other no names. The card games weren't exciting, because they were longwinded, and I really didn't care. The only thing you're supposed to care about is Bond winning so that this evil guy won't fund terrorism. And if Bond wins, Le Chiffre's organization will be destroyed. Does he win? What happens to the evil man? But, in the movie, it kinda shows the guy is PRESSURED to win. He gets strangled by someone who really wants the money. Afterward, he cries, and instead of crying tears, he cries BLOOD! Isn't that terrible? I would definitely not wanna cry knowing that blood would run down my face a couple seconds later. That was an interesting part in the movie also, and, I have to admit, the guy DID play his part well. But as I told you before the story was a bit lame and not original. Anyone could think that this guy needs money in order to fund something. Kinda obvious when you think about it. I can't fund anything without money. Thank you, Captain Obvious!

The Ringer," Funny film from the farrellys
","The Ringer/2005/***Main Stars: Johnny Knoxville Brian CoxWell this film was another enjoyable, successful 'Farrelly Brothers' type film (like 'Stuck On You', 'Fever Pitch', 'Dumb and Dumber' and others). You see, they didn't direct or write the film. They merely produced it but the film was definitely there type of one. You see, the Farrelly Brothers are known to have mentally challenged people in their films. And in this one they had quite a few because (of course) the storyline consists of a Special Olympics season and tournament at the end of the season. Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville's character) competes in this as a 'fake' mentally challenged person with the name of Jeffy Dahmor. His uncle, Gary (Brian Cox, who really wants Steve (as Jeffy) to win the Special Olympics tournament), named him that because Steve needed help so his uncle butts in to tell him to fix the Special Olympics and gives him a name upon the name of a past serial killer with the name of Jeffrey Dahmer. His uncle had to have gotten the idea from him. I mean what else would have convinced him. Basically Steve (as Jeffy Dahmor) is competing in this because he's a good athlete and wants money to help a guy named Stavi (Luis Avalos, who always refers to himself in the third person) get his fingers sewed back on. It might sound stupid but really it is quite funny with the mentally challenged people actually coming back with great comebacks to Steve (as Jeffy) and other people. But yet Steve has to face an impressively good disabled athlete named Jimmy (Leonard Flowers) and doesn't do so bad. But how hard can it be to keep the identity of a mentally challenged person? Not the easiest thing in the world. And that was another funny thing to watch in this film. Steve (as Jeffy) would change voices, would only tell a few people he wasn't disabled in a way, and would be recognized by an old high school friend that was normal and asked how he was doing. But the bad thing is, there was a Special Olympics supervisor with him (a girl Steve liked named Lynn (Katherine Heigl) and he had to act mental or else the supervisor would know he was a fraud. Hee hee. It truly is a funny film but with a heart like the Farrelly films are always like (except for the older ones like 'Kingpin' which was waaaaay over the top). Movie directed by (not the Farrelly Brothers but) Barry W. Blaustein.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006
Rear Window," One of the best Hitchcock films ever besides Vertigo!
","Rear Window/1954/****Main Stars: James Stewart Grace Kelly Raymond BurrExcellent! Another well-written, thriller brought to you by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. I had seen this many times before this review but I have never had the chance to review the classic. But since I have time to spare, why not? Why is it Hitchcock is so good at making films and even his mediocre ones become famous a month or two after they come out in theaters? Why (?) because he was always on track making his films with witty dialogue by hiring perfect screenwriters (this one at most). But he's not a director that sits in his chair and eats, gets fat and just moves his hand around and says, 'You are here, and you are there!' No! He plans out the scene in his brain while the actors/actresses rehearse and get ready. Normally before shooting (even the first scene) begins, he has already made the movie himself, planned it out with all his tricks, twists, and turns. When they start shooting, he gets it done fast since he has already planned it out. His camera moves, twists, humorous and factual dialogue, everything! He's a perfect director and this ('Rear Window') is one of his best films he made (besides 'Vertigo', 'North by Northwest', 'Rebecca', 'Shadow of a Doubt', 'Saboteur', 'Rope', 'The Trouble with Harry', 'Psycho', 'To Catch a Thief', 'Dial 'M' for Murder', 'Torn Curtain', 'Frenzy', 'Topaz', 'Family Plot', 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', 'The 39 Steps', 'Notorious', 'Suspicion', and many, many more)! You notice I didn't mention 'Marnie' or 'Jamaica Inn' because they were two of his more mediocre ones. Pretty much all his films were big hits and only a few flunked! Not bad, not bad at all! Hitchcock had a big sense of humor and therefore all his films have at least one scene of humorous dialogue or humorous action, adventure, or whatever scenes. But mainly his humor comes from the mouths of the actors. Like in 'Rear Window' there was a scene where one of (the main character) L.B. Jefferies's (James Stewart's) buddies comes over to the house and browses around for this salesman (named Mr. Lars Thorwald who is played by Raymond Burr) that is so-called 'a murderer' (by Jefferies) (very Hitchcockian) and that he killed his own wife! The thing is Jefferies's buddy wasn't looking over at the so-called 'murderer's' apartment window but yet looking at an attractive woman in a window on the other side of him named Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy). He watched for a while and smirked until Jefferies (Stewart) asks him out of the blue, 'How's your wife?' And the buddy (named Thomas Doyle played by Wendell Corey) said, 'Oh, she's fine.' He looked away. See, witty humorous dialogue. Not only does Jefferies's buddy look at Miss Torso but also so does Jefferies himself. Even though he already has someone he's kinda in love with named Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) he still looks at other woman and admires them. AND there is a very funny character named Stella (Thelma Ritter) who takes care of Jefferies while he has his cast on (caused by a car crashing into him) and is in his wheelchair spying out at all the people on the other side of him. Stella definitely is a character and really shows how the dialogue is funny in a Hitchcock film. It's great! You have to respect Al and his films because he worked so hard not just to bring you a film, but a great film and to entertain the movie watchers. The films that come out now are definitely making more money but are not as good and wit (more violence, blood, sex, vulgarity). But at least the films that are literally good are still around and can be restored if not good qualities, which are the versions I have of 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo'. They are both restored and in much better condition. This is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces staring famous actors and actresses (at the time) and has a great ending (not as much of a twist as 'Vertigo' and other Hitchcock classics), middle, and beginning. This film has the most creative set ever seen in a Hitchcock film: an apartment courtyard and that's it! You mainly see Jefferies peeking out his apartment window into others (as a window shopper) and seeing what he sees and the camera is never in a different apartment room. Never! As I just said the ending was perfect. Well the reason why is because of the suspense and if he'll die from this fight with the so-called murderer that breaks in to his apartment room. But yet how hard is it to fight with a wheelchair? Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",10,6,11,2 April 2006
Fantastic Four," Good! Silly but fun.
","Fantastic Four/2005/***Main Stars: Ioan Gruffudd Michael Chiklis Chris Evans Jessica Alba Julian McMahonI really was looking forward to this movie and it was good! Of course, it was not as good as I thought it would be. I really thought this would be the movie of the summer. That's the reason why I saw the movie the first day it came out- July 8, 2005. This movie has a lot of what audiences want to see- action, some humor, and drama. It did have about one or two scenes of romance but who cares? In this movie, there are five scientists (Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba). All five of them are affected by rays caused by a (I won't tell you what the rays were caused by) that changed their tendencies and gave them super powers. But, unfortunately one of the scientists turned bad on the other four scientists. As you probably know from the previews or if you read the comics, the scientists have nicknames now that they have powers. Ben Grimm is The Thing, Reed Richards is Mr. Fantastic, Johnny Storm is Human Torch, Susan Storm is Invisible Woman, and don't forget about Victor Von Doom being Dr. Doom. Dr. Doom kills a few innocent people (one he wanted to get his revenge on for sacking him) in this movie and also has an evil plan to eliminate the Fantastic Four. This movie has spectacular effects that drive you insane. No one could ever hate this non-stop dramatic, comedic, thriller. Every actor/actress in this movie played their parts fantastically well. I'm going to say this though that 'Batman Begins' tops this movie for sure but this was fantastically well-acted, etc. but it just wasn't what I thought it would be- the most fantastic movie of the summer.

Aladdin," Robin Williams is hilarious
","Aladdin/1992/***1/2Main Stars: Scott Weinger Robin Williams Linda LarkinThe start of 'classic films' is exciting. I've done many reviews so far and doing even more is exciting. I've seen a lot of 'classic films' for my age including a film which I didn't think was so classic, 'Jason and the Argonauts' (1963). I know for the timeframe that special effects were not too good but I still laughed at how fake the effects (done by Ray Harryhausen) were. Especially when the main character Jason had to fight a dragon and the dragon was pathetic! It looked like clay attacking this horrible actor. Actually, all the acting was horrible in the movie. Great, I wandered off again. Back to the movie I was supposed to review; Aladdin is a great, hilarious, well-acted movie. The only thing wrong with it was that it was too short (at least to me it was). They could have easily made it longer with more comical, great scenes. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie but I thought some extra scenes could have been added. You're probably thinking that I saw this just to make the review and never before; but actually, I have seen this movie many times before this review was typed. I won't tell you too much, but this movie is about a poor peasant boy (Scott Weinger) who discovers a lamp and the lamp beholds a Genie (Robin Williams) that grants three and only three wishes. Aladdin meets this beautiful princess named Jasmine (Linda Larkin) and wishes to become a prince and marry her. But someone named Jafar and his stupid annoying parrot (voice of Gilbert Godfreed) keeps delaying him. If you haven't seen this movie yet (I doubt it), you should see it now and laugh at the comical scenes and also cry at the songs ('A Whole New World'- by Alan Menken & Tim Rice) but I really didn't cry at the songs at all.

Shark Tale," Better than what the critics say even though i am one
","Shark Tale/2004/***Main Stars:Will SmithRene Zellweger Jack Black This is an animated comedy no one can resist! This also has some romance scenes in it- like the scene with Oscar (Will Smith) and his girlfriend (Rene Zellweger). This is a kid film yet it has adult situations in it. But who cares because really what you want is a few adult situations in kid films to make it more exciting. There's also another person in this movie (Angelina Jolie) that tries to take Oscar away from his girlfriend and wants him to become her boyfriend. She's one of those people that try to let you hang out with them and then they dump you and let you be a single bum for the rest of your life. This has nothing to do with the subject but in this review and the other reviews I will write, I will not spoil the movie for you. I am just going to talk about characters and I few scenes but no more 'main points'. What I will tell you is that Oscar is a 'whale wash' worker. You'll find out what I mean by that. But also he gets stuck in this situation with his shark friend (Jack Black). The brother of Jack Black's character is the main part of this and Oscar tries to make up a story of what happened and calls himself 'The Shark Slayer'. But at the end it all works out and Oscar tells the truth finally and becomes one of the sea's most famous fish. Very good movie, see it!

The Birds," good classic thriller
","The Birds/1963/***Main Stars: 'Tippi' HedrenSuzanne Pleshette Rod Taylor Jessica TandyNot only was this a classic but a fake classic with fake birds on strings or drawn birds that were somehow put into the screen but also some were real. Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' was one of his goriest films. I'd say the tamest one was 'North by Northwest' which was even better than 'The Birds' because it was more intriguing, suspenseful (not that 'The Birds' wasn't though) and had a very good storyline to it. I'd give it four stars out of four stars. 'The Birds' was 'good' (not any worse, not any better). The main star, Melanie Daniels ('Tippi' Hedren), is a lady that gets involved with the 'birds' thing just because she wanted to know who this mysterious person named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) was at a bird shop. She decides to give his daughter Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) a gift. The gift was two lovebirds in a cage. She delivered it to the house by boat because Mitch lives near water (a lake). Melanie interrogates an old man, who happened to be a cashier, when she wanted to know where the Brenners' lived and he told her where they lived and that there were two ways to get to the house: by road or boat. She decided to take the boat option and bring the lovebirds to Mitch's house. She then got to the house and decided to invite herself in without knocking and put the cage right in the living room along with two cards. Then they meet and while she's going to return the boat to where she got it (the dock), a bird (fake) swoops down on her and cuts her. She then goes in to a restaurant to get some help and that's when she meets the strict mother of Mitch's (Jessica Tandy). In this movie there are about four bird attacks. One is at a schoolhouse, at a party, at a restaurant/telephone booth, and inside Mitch's house. There are a few other minor attacks also. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should so you can see how good and fake it is at the same time. Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",Null,1,1,2 April 2006
Cinderella Man," Excellent! The best boxing film ever!
","Cinderella Man/2005/****Main Stars: Russell Crowe Paul Giamatti Renée ZelweggerRon Howard's 'Cinderella Man' is truly a wonderful film! It's about boxing just like Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby'. There is also Sylvester Stallone's 'Rocky' but that was a long time ago. But Ron Howard's boxing film beat Clint Eastwood's boxing film by a little. Although 'Million Dollar Baby' was excellent and all, it was about a woman boxer and seeing a woman getting beat up and bloody just didn't feel right. Yes, it was excellent because it was different (about a young woman instead of a man), had excellent acting by everyone, and had more to it than just plain boxing. But so did 'Cinderella Man'. It had a background of what James J. Braddock's (Russell Crowe's) life was like beyond the boxing, about his children, wife (Renée Zelwegger), job (besides boxing), and, of course, The Great Depression. This is definitely a period movie. Set in the 1930s, everything looked convincing; the sets, cars, outfits, buildings. This is definitely a good-looking film let alone an excellent film by itself. The film starts out with a boxing match and ends with a boxing match (how original). But yet that's just the beginning and end. In the middle, there is so much going on and you really get into it. Why(?) because there has never been a film like it before. Yes, there are many films about boxing including 'Million Dollar Baby', 'Ali', 'Rocky' (A CLASSIC), 'Rocky II' (III, IV, and V), 'Raging Bull' (A CLASSIC), 'Champion', 'Body and Soul', and many more But yet not too many films are about boxing and The Great Depression (when the stocks went down, not everyone could get jobs, etc.). This truly was a Ron Howard masterpiece! Then you get his other films that were flunks (got a lot of money but weren't that good) like one I can definitely name: 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' with Jim Carrey as THE GRINCH! I was surprised to see Directed by Ron Howard for that film because his films are always good and and that one just wasn't. He doesn't seem to direct a film of that type meaning a pretty bad comedy. He I can see directing 'Cinderella Man' because that is a type of movie he would make: an adventure-drama, action, maybe some humor too This film, even though it was a drama, had some humor from Jimmy Braddock's trainer (played by Paul Giamatti) and it's always good to have some humor. Throughout the film, Jimmy fought and fought and never gave up and soon earned the nickname 'Cinderella Man' and even Renée Zelwegger's character thought it was girly. She chuckled in the movie, 'Cinderella Man', that's kinda girly.' Everything was fine and dandy in the film (except for some of the beginning during the horrible Great Depression) until Jimmy's trainer starts to get a little stricter when he has to face someone named Max Baer because he is known to be a tough boxer; killing already two people in the boxing ring. Jimmy is a little nervous when watching footage on an old projector of this guy punching and punching and punching this other boxer until the boxer slows down and falls to the ground. Max Baer then looks at Jimmy with an evil face. This gets Jimmy thinking. Should he fight or should he not? Remember he has kids and a wife that he has to take care of and who are scared for him. But there is a somewhat not melancholy ending. It is an excellent film! Throughout the film, is a great story (a dramatization of a true story), great acting, and great sets. I sincerely think that Ron Howard will become one of the greatest directors of all time! Movie directed by Ron Howard.",Null,0,0,2 April 2006
Dodgeball," A hee-hee movie. I was amused
","Dodgeball/2004/*** Main Stars:Vince VaughnBen Stiller Dodgeball was a good movie because White Goodman's (Ben Stiller's) comments made no sense but they were funny. In this movie White was supposed to be dumb. Another great thing about this movie was Patches O'Houlihan. I think that's how you spell it. Anyway, the reason why he was funny was because he was a strange character and he threw wrenches at people. The main point for this movie was for the Average Joes to beat the Cobras in the dodgeball tournament and win 50,000 dollars so they can pay for their gym. There are other details about this movie, but I wasn't told about this movie before I saw it so I want you to see it yourself. It was a great movie. I recommend it!

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," What happened to the star of Anchorman?
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby/2006/**1/2Main Stars: Will Ferrell John C. Reilly Sacha Baron Cohen Gary ColeRicky Bobby is no 1st place earner.Adam McKay (director of the very funny Anchorman and who has a little cameo in this film as a fat racecar driver) returns to direct this lowbrow and disappointing comedy. I did think from the same team that created Anchorman that this film would be a little worse or as good as its previous film but I know it wouldn't have been better. Having seen the previews, I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that this film wouldn't be that good. It turns out my prediction was correct. I'm not saying this was a bad film. I'm saying it was not a good film. And it wasn't. It was fair to good. The first half of the movie was not funny except for the quote at the very beginning. It was random just like Anchorman but it didn't have the constant laughs like Anchorman did. It had laughs more in the second half when Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) kinda loses his driving racecar spirit. His quote is 'I wanna go fast!'. But when he thought there was no hope left his quote was more like 'I wanna give up!'. I thought the second half had more GIGGLES than the first half which had maybe one more besides the quote. There were definitely no LAUGH OUT LOUD moments. More frowning at how much they tried rather than succeeded. More laughs came out of Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) than Ricky Bobby. Or as his arch competitor Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) would say 'Ricky Booby'. However Ferrell did succeed in a few scenes like pretending he was on fire and running around in his underwear with his flab jiggling. Then there's the father of Ricky Bobby (Gary Cole) who influenced his son to drive like a racecar driver- reckless and fast. Cole was okay. He was nothing special either. When Jean Girard comes in from the French Formula One to be introduced into NASCAR, Ricky Bobby's talents are put to the test. The urgent question that needs to be answered is 'Who is better?'. Ricky has that 'If you're not first, your last!' blood in him from his father and Jean Girard is the assertive and swishy Frenchman that also has only to win blood. But what is his objective for coming to America? To be what? You find out. And his friend Cal who made up this stupid 'Shake and Bake' phrase is also in this challenging match against the pompous Girard. He invented it because it rhymes and they're both verbs. And he thinks he is smart because he said it. Is our national hero Ricky Bobby going to be beaten by the gay Frenchman who has a husband? That's kind of unbelievable actually. I mean Ricky Bobby had a foul-mouthed tough father and he also has two foul-mouthed sons who were definitely taught their lesson the granny way. As I said before the movie was random with smiles and some minor laughs in select scenes or as a local critic would call them- sporadic laughs. Will Ferrell was definitely not the main funny star. It was actually more from his friends than him. And people in the theater were laughing like crazy at the dumbest most idiotic jokes. I sat there with a straight face until, as I said before, the second half. It was indeed funnier than the first half. The story was sort of original and extremely random kinda like 'Family Guy' except less funny. So a fair to good rating for Will Ferrell's disappointing Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. I had low expectations for this movie to begin with but at least have Will Ferrell as the funniest character! Movie directed by Adam McKay.",6,1,4,8 August 2006
