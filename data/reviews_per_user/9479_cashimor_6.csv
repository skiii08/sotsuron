Antz," This movie should be seen in the cinema
","Due to the scale of this movie, I doubt it would ever work well on television/video. The storyline is full of morale and hints at western culture, but done in a better way than Hercules of Walt Disney. I liked this movie a lot, and would recommend watching it, in a big screen cinema.",9,0,0,31 January 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Excellent script and imagery, average Will, fast cuts.
","Especially in the beginning of this movie the fast cuts make it slightly difficult to get into the plot, but once you're there, it is irresistable, with wonderful links to the real Romeo and Juliet, and the making of that play compared to the movie itself. I myself would've chosen a different player for Will Shakespeare, but I didn't mind him either. This is a movie you should see.",9,3,5,28 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Black/white story with graphics that need more maturity
","I'm not sure if this is true, but I believe that Mr. Lucas said at some point that he hadn't done movies 1-3 first because of the fact that the technological advances in film making weren't yet at the level that he needed to make these movies.Given that statement, and after seeing this movie, I have the feeling he should have waited a few years, still. Yes, the graphics are state of the art and much better than what we saw before. However, if you look at scenes, you will notice that each time only a certain set of colors is used, rather than the whole spectrum (which you would see in a normal movie, recorded on film rather than digitally). I'm not an expert on computer graphics, but I have the feeling that the color was removed from the recorded images, to allow the computer generated graphics to blend in better: without removing colors and enhancing the other colors, the computer generated parts would stand out too much. I had the same feeling while watching 'The Lord of the Rings - The fellowship'.There are more similarities with 'The Lord of the Rings'. They both end at an odd moment (as they are both movies that have a planned sequel). They both are based on the 3D video game culture that exists nowadays (in fact, both movies might have been much more effective as a video game). They both make a clear distinction between 'good' and 'evil', with only rare attempts at creating a character that is in between (Boromir/Anakin), but not without giving the audience ample notice of this 'anomaly'.I'm not saying it is a bad movie, but if you want to be awed by the graphics, it might be wiser to consider 'Ice Age' or 'Shrek'. As for a better story line, I won't make suggestions for that, but there are plenty of movies in this database that have more depth. If you just want to see how the Star Wars hexology comes together, you should watch this movie, however.",6,0,0,21 May 2002
The Mummy Returns," Doesn't it remind you of Star Wars?
","Now I have seen the Mummy, the Scorpion King and the Mummy Returns, I am beginning to feel that together they might become like Star Wars, but then without the big hype around it. The storylines begin to look similar, the quality degrades as time passes, and there are too many computer graphics.Of course, the computer graphics in these movies are notably worse than those in Star Wars, and some of the action sequences last too long to remain interesting, but the remarks were notably wittier.I think it might be wiser to just watch any Indiana Jones movie than the Mummy Returns, though.",6,0,0,4 October 2002
Pretty Woman," The whole movie is sad, but the separate scenes are great.
","Unfortunately this movie suffers from quite a weak story line. I think the alternative (mentioned in the trivia) would probably be much more interesting. However, many scenes in this movie are a delight to watch, and I would probably watch the movie again just to see these.",7,0,0,23 December 1998
Apollo 13," Predictable and sometimes slow, but still thrilling.
","This movie was more exciting than I at first thought when I heard about the scenario. The movie is probably too long to keep you captured all of the time, but there are moments that you can really feel the tension and stress that is pictured. Some of the parts are quite sentimental, but correctly dimensioned.",7,0,2,17 November 1998
