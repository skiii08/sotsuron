Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Describes the film (no spoilers)
","Last week everyone is obsessing about this movie called Star Wars Episode 1 Phantom Menace.  I did not really enjoy the first three (or last three, no matter how you put it).  I was wondering why so many people were crazy about it, because it was nothing that special.  I decided to see the movie with my friend.  Getting tickets was quite easy, over the internet, point click, tickets.I got to the theatre almost an hour early, and got my tickets.  I went in there and it was over halfway packed.  We sat kind of on the side.  It was wild in the theatre, on a wednesday.  It was rocking.  I loved everything about this movie from the intro to the credits.  Although it did have a few weak points along the way, it generally was an awesome movie.  The special effects were beyone incredible.  The sound was beyond incredible.  This movie is a must see and I am sure I am gonna see it again and again.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
