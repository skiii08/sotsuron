The King's Speech," Witty, emotionally satisfying, and topped off with an impressive cast. The King's Speech is a success.
","The film is a slow moving, but also outstanding historical feature that stars Colin Firth as Albert Frederick Arthur George (Or 'Bertie' by his family), the Duke of York. After a lifetime of neglect, and favoritism for his older brother Edward, Bertie has developed a nervous and fearful stammer. Hoping to cure him, his wife, the future Queen Elizabeth (Played by Helena Bonham Carter), seeks the help of an unorthodox Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Played by Geoffrey Rush). The two make steady progress, and develop a strong friendship, but when Bertie's brother gives up his throne, Bertie is pushed to a true test as England is now on the brink of World War II.It's an inspiring and emotionally satisfying movie. The film is directed by Tom Hooper, who draws excellent performances out of his cast, and written by David Seidler, who draws a cohesive sense of focus between the film's narrative, and theme explorations, such as the senses of social hierarchy. It's a dramatic, witty, and passionately crafted form of art from a man who had to overcome his own stuttering problem. A personal story like that often tends to translate quite well.But the main draw of the movie is the interactions of the two unlikely friends. Colin Firth is simply excellent as George VI, continuing a hot streak that started with last year's A Single Man. He not only pulls of a convincing stutter to gain sympathy, but also draws focus to his prickly faults, such as a short fused temper, and his uncertainty in Royal placement. Rush is also pitch perfect, approaching his role with patience, sheer heart, and sharp wit. Chemistry like the kind that these two share is simply impossible to fake. The movie is also handsomely produced, especially boasting impressive production and costume design by Eve Stewart and Jenny Beavan.The King's Speech is a fine, fine film, indeed, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,1,20 January 2011
Moneyball," An inspiring true story that has, nor deserves any shame for its schmaltz.
","I was shocked when I discovered that THIS movie would be Aaron Sorkin's follow up to The Social Network. I knew that it wouldn't match that level of masterpiece, but I didn't think that even Sorkin could pulls this off. Guess what? He and co-writer Steve Zaillian proved me wrong. The presentation of this movie is a traditional approach, but that was probably the best way to go. The true story it tells of is inspiring. Who wouldn't be inspired by the story of the Oakland A's, who defied the logic of baseball, and utilized unconventional methods to lead them on a string of back to back victories.The script is very funny, heartfelt, brimming with snappy dialogue, and filled with good characters. Brad Pitt is aces as Oakland A's manager Billy Beane, and Jonah Hill refreshingly plays against type as Peter Brand. Some moments of the film may feel too clich√©d, but for the most part, Moneyball hits a home run.*** out of ****",8,0,3,18 January 2012
The Avengers," Straight up one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies ever made. SMASHING good time!
","Starting in the Summer of 2008 with the first Iron Man film, and wrapping up with Captain America last July, Marvel finally brings the 'Avengers Initiative' full circle in high fashion. The Avengers finally arrives, receiving mad critical raves, and smashing box office records (Specifically grossing $207 million dollars opening weekend, more than any movie in history), and all for good reason. The Avengers is straight up one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies ever made. It's the Raiders of the Lost Ark of superhero movies.Here's the gist of the plot: Exiled god of Asgard Loki returns to Earth, and attacks the base of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division) to retrieve the powerful tesseract, and unleash his vengeance with an army of creatures known as the Chitauri. To fight this new threat, SHIELD director Nick Fury decides to call in the help of sarcastic billionaire Tony Stark (Iron Man), superstrong patriot Steve Rogers (Captain America), ill tempered scientist Bruce Banner (Hulk), Asgardian thunder god Thor, Russian double agent Natasha Romanov (Black Widow), and expert marksman Clint Barton (Hawkeye). Six heroes for the price of one, with an awesome cast and action sequences that would make even Spielberg jealous, all directed by fanboy extraordinaire Joss Whedon?! I want a sequel, now! The achievement that The Avengers represents is simply unprecedented. All of the previous singularly released Avengers movies were wonderful in how they took their time and delivered consistent quality. Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America were all wonderful breaths of fresh air that delivered the laughs and the thrills. Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk may have been slight weak links, but still remained enjoyable. To have The Avengers bring this idea all together so seamlessly is terrific, but it also makes just as good a separate achievement, a heartfelt, hilarious, and exciting ride to behold.With such a big cast of characters, the fact that they all feel satisfyingly developed is something of a miracle. Not everything is always perfect, but as both a writer and director, Joss Whedon is spot on with how he treats these characters. He gives them all their equal share in the spotlight, and literally NO ONE stands out amongst the others. Robert Downey Jr. is delightfully deadpan and sarcastic as Stark, Chris Evans continues to play a very likable character with Rogers, Chris Hemsworth's Thor is just as fun and hammy as ever, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are aces as Black Widow and Hawkeye, and Tom Hiddleston brings a fantastic villain out of Loki. As for Mark Ruffalo (replacing Edward Norton), his calm and cool personality as Bruce Banner is the perfect opposite for his split personality, and the green muscle man is so awesome - and hilarious - when he finally takes the stage. Hulk smash, and we love him for it! This isn't even mentioning the bravura action sequences. Whedon is smart to not overwhelm the audience with braindead action without first giving an honest emotional investment, and throughout most of the movie, he's smart in how he spreads them out. When the movie's epic 30 minute climax begins, that's when Whedon finally lets it all loose in genuinely, gleefully exciting fashion, complete with stellar visual effects and awesome sound design. Also, this is a really long movie, nearly two and a half hours, but it doesn't even feel that long. I honestly felt like I could have watched it for even longer, maybe even all day. The original cut of this movie was apparently three hours in length, and I would have loved to see that version, just because the whole thing just flies by so smoothly.With such a great kick off to the Summer movie season, we can only hope that everything else will be at least half as fun. The Avengers is the ultimate in Hollywood nerdvana, and I can't wait to see it again.****1/2/ *****",9,1,4,16 May 2012
Black Swan," What more can I say except, 'Perfection?' Natalie Portman gives the year's best performance.
","The film reveals a side of Darren Aronofsky not explored since the 2000 mind screw known as Requiem for a Dream. Forgive me if that sounds harsh, because I was nothing but intrigued, and horrified by Requiem. I say this because Black Swan is an outstanding return to past form for the man, but obviously not for the faint of heart.Natalie Portman stars as Nina Sayers, a sweet and dedicated ballerina who's given both roles of the White, and Black Swans as part of her group's upcoming rendition of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. She has no problem performing the innocent, and frail White Swan, but her director Thomas (Played by Vincent Cassel) feels a lack of passion for her performance as the Black Swan. He urges her to bring out her underlying dark nature, long suppressed by her overbearing mother (Played by Barbara Hershey), her dedication to technique, and the need to please critics. Over time she begins to realize the dark side of her soul, but begins losing her grip on reality......an arc of storytelling handled perfectly by screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin. The themes of which they present (Sexual desire, paranoia, self-inflicted injury, and jealousy) are eerily, but exceptionally explored, helping to put us inside this dark descent. But Aronofsky is slightly more to thank for this film, as he makes clever use of sound, film editing, and special effects to ease us into uncertainty, heightened only by the cinematography by Mathhew Libatique, who presents us with a warped, and creepy view of Nina's mind, often stylized by the presence of a mirror, evoking a strong sense of her intimidating transformation.Actors are also quite wonderful too. Vincent Cassell and Mila Kunis are brilliant as Nina's director, and rival, who acts as the perfect contrast to her more fragile nature. Barbara Hershey is also brilliant, while Winona Ryder makes great use of her relatively small role.And Natalie Portman, obviously I can't really say anything about her performance that hasn't already been said, but she's brilliant. The arc of her character is nothing if not for her dazzling, and devastating portrayal. She's also a damn good dancer, and gives the performance of the year. Simply put, if there's ANY justice in the world, she'll win the Academy Award for Best Leading Actress.If it wasn't completely obvious halfway through my review, I give Black Swan **** out of ****",10,1,4,25 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," It delivers on the action, comedy, and visuals, but lacks in coherent screen writing and direction.
","In On Stranger Tides, Johnny Depp returns as everyone's favorite rum guzzling, scenery chewing swashbuckler from the Pirates of the Caribbean saga, Captain Jack Sparrow.Several years after the events of At World's End, Jack is in London seeking a crew and a ship to set forth on a journey for the legendary Fountain of Youth, but after a chance meeting with an old flame of his named Angelica (Played by the lovely Penelope Cruz), he is brought aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the merciless Blackbeard (Played by Ian McShane), who is seeking the fountain for his own selfish needs, and who may possibly be Angelica's father. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Played by Geoffrey Rush), now a privateer for the English crown, is also on an expedition for the fountain, but above all else, has a personal score to settle with Blackbeard.The film is directed by Rob Marshall, the man behind Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha, taking over the helm from Gore Verbinski, which is the first problem that this movie has. It's not that Marshall's direction is terrible, but it feels stylistically disjointed from the previous installments. The movie's screenplay also features moments of lazy writing, and quite a few incomprehensible subplots. But it's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, so you know what you're getting: an admirable cast, highly effective humor, and fast paced action sequences, such as one particularly outstanding, and unsettling mermaid attack sequence.Another problem I have with the film, albeit to a lesser extent, is how it sounds. This isn't a knock against the creative effects, or another great score by Hans Zimmer, accompanied this time around by Mexican musical duo Rodrigo y Gabriela, but sometimes during the film, the blend of ringing swords, cannon fire and French horns mixed with the somewhat chaotic nature of the action scenes can become a bit bludgeoning.Still, like the previous entries, the film is typically beautifully designed through the great visual effects, lovely sets and costumes by John Myhre and Penny Rose, and incredible makeup work on mermaids, zombies, and injured sailors, so you can expect to hear me singing the praises of makeup designers Joel Harlow and Peter King for the rest of the year.On a final note, I do admit that the series has become a big cash cow, and with each new installment it had been getting worse, but I think this one is pretty much on par with the last installment. It's not a good movie, but it's fun enough.So I'm gonna give On Stranger Tides a tepid **1/2 out of ****",7,1,2,26 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Back is the fun charm of the first movie.
","Did you love the first Men in Black? Me too! With its razor sharp writing, awesome visual spectacle, brisk pacing, and the hysterical chemistry between stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, it was the Sci-Fi genre's ultimate answer to the buddy comedy. And even if you wanted to neuralyze the second film right out of your memory, fear not. Men in Black 3 recreates the same unabashedly campy, slightly gross charm of the first movie, adding up to one surprisingly satisfying whole.In this third movie of the MIB - a top secret agency whose primary objective is to monitor extra-terrestrial activity on the planet earth - J and K are still kicking alien butt and taking names. However, due to a strange warp in time, K is killed by Boris the Animal, who travels back in time before K can shoot off his left arm and arrest him. J now has no other choice but to travel back to 1969 to work with a young K and help him stop Boris' evil plans once and for all.Aside from some massive gaps and inconsistencies in continuity, this is a delightful movie, and what I think the second film should have been. By returning to the roots of the first movie, Men in Black 3 anchors itself with solid pacing, and a fun story, and even if the humor is definitely not as successful as it was in the first movie, it's still funny enough, and even the bad jokes are still tolerable to a degree. As you would also expect, it continues to play up the seamless chemistry between the two leads, giving them plenty of shining comic relief, but also adding a surprising heart to their back stories. And to back all that up, plenty of great visual eye candy to go around. Specifically, makeup design legend Rick Baker is seriously deserving of Oscar attention for his really cool alien designs.Will Smith, aside from managing to make the film fun on his own, has a big task in the chemistry between two different actors. Tommy Lee Jones is absent for most of the film, leaving Josh Brolin to take his place as young K. Brolin is so uncanny in his mannerisms and deadpan delivery that one must assume that Jones gave him lessons on the role while the two were filming No Country for Old Men together. Jemaine Clement plays Boris the Animal with sinister relish. Not as humorous as Edgar, but nowhere near as flat and dull as Serleena. Michael Stuhlbarg and Emma Thompson also make the most of their small supporting roles.**** / *****",8,0,3,22 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The most fun I've had all year. Even a simple game of chess becomes enough to put you on the edge.
","In case you don't already know my thoughts on the first Sherlock Holmes, I loved it. I loved its fresh take on the literary detective, I loved how Guy Ritchie's directorial flourishes fit wonderfully with the mind of Sherlock, I loved the slick action and fantastic production values, and I loved the wonderful chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Bigger, but not quite better than the first film, A Game of Shadows features everything I liked and disliked about feature one, and it's about as good a December blockbuster as you can get.Like the first film, the film is light on plot, occasionally uneven, and a tad more confusing if you're not paying full attention. However, Ritchie continues to show what a great fit his stylistics are for this movie, and the action, which is perfectly paced, staged, and choreographed, continues to thrill and astonish. The friendship between Holmes and Watson continues to set the screen ablaze, but begins to play things up more. Producer Joel Silver once said that Downey and Law's chemistry had this 'Butch and Sundance' quality to it, and he was right. Their chemistry is the main attraction, absolutely electrifying, surprisingly emotional, and often quite funny, occasionally hysterically so.Though, with the exception of the film's villain, the supporting cast isn't quite as strong. Jared Harris couldn't have been anymore brilliantly cast as Professor Moriarty, but Sim, the film's leading lady, isn't very much of an improvement over Irene Adler, even if Noomi Rapace has a bit more to chew on than Rachel McAdams did. Still, the film is beautifully designed. Sarah Greenwood's stylish production design is gorgeous, Phillippe Rousselot's cinematography is ever so flowing, the costumes are beautifully realized by Jenny Beavan (who, in my opinion, provided the best costumes of any film in 2009 for the first Sherlock Holmes), and Hans Zimmer raises the pulse and fun with his exciting musical score.Prognosis: A light, refreshing piece of popcorn entertainment. Probably the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie. When even a simple game of chess is enough to put you on the edge, you know you're in for a good time.*** out of ****",8,0,2,17 February 2012
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch = Frontrunner for worst movie of the year.
","Well, April is often known as the time of year in film where truly great movies finally start to appear into the mainstream... so it's only ironic that I should be dragged along to the claptrap March release that is Sucker Punch.The film centers on BabyDoll (Played by Emily Browning), a girl who is framed for murder by her evil stepfather, and sent to an insane asylum to be lobotomized in a matter of five days. She concocts a plan with four other inmates (Played by Jamie Chung, Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens and Jena Malone) to find five items to help them escape through the asylum's dance underworld, and imaginary worlds so anachronistic and ridiculous in explanation, you'd swear I was shouting deleted paragraphs from The Divine Comedy.The film is directed by Zack Snyder, the man best known for mediocre action films such as Watchmen and 300, he also co-wrote it with a friend of his named Steve Shibuya. The film is an obvious ploy to objectify women masked by half hearted empowerment submorals, but I was hoping the film could be as interesting as it's somewhat clever five minute opening... but, to bring up Dante again, Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. I like to watch whole movies before passing unfair final judgment on them, but had I known what I know now, I would have walked out after 35 minutes.It's easy enough to blame awkward pacing, and a nonsensically sloppy screenplay, but what's most disappointing is the performances. The film has a talented collection of attractive twenty-somethings performing as its five main characters, but they all can't get past being unexpressive robots, except for Jena Malone, who plays Rocket, the only character in the film I even cared about. It also wastes the older talent, such as Carla Gugino speaking in an inconsistent Polish accent as Madam Gorski, and Scott Glenn as the Wiseman, the wisest filler character to ever grace the silver screen.Even the technical standpoints are lacking. Snyder's signature ultra slow motion shots grow from tedious to unbearable halfway through the film, the sound mix and design is overly bombarding, and even the visual work on the creatures and environments in the imagination sequences are garish, sub par exercises in effects animation.With a final rating of * out of ****, Sucker Punch is the current frontrunner for worst movie of the year.",2,5,12,18 April 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This affecting teen drama is surprisingly very honest.
","I'll confess, that when this movie ended, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to say about it. All I knew is that I loved it. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on the beloved book by Stephen Chbosky (who actually wrote and directed the movie), really seems to resonate with a lot of people, and I can see why. I can also see why others might not like it.We open up with our main character Charlie (Logan Lerman), who is beginning his first year of high school. He's an outsider at first, but soon finds unlikely friends with two seniors. the flamboyant and energetic Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his step sister Sam (Emma Watson), and he's then later accepted into their larger group of friends. Sam refers to them as the island of misfit toys. Everything is not all a bowl of cherries, though. Problems arise in several areas between each of the characters, Charlie having the most focus of them.Charlie may just look and act like a typical teenager on the surface at first, but that's something that Stephen Chbosky transcends. Charlie, and the other friends he makes, are all complexly written characters with believable problems, their own charms, and unique personalities. All of the cast help with this as well. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Mae Whitman, and especially the terrific Ezra Miller, keep their characters from feeling like one note stereotypes, serving as appropriate embodiments of real problems teenagers face.You can especially thank Chbosky for balancing out all of these characters so well, for this is such a rich, character driven experience. But on top of that, he also takes time to properly examine themes. He brings up issues of depression, social outsidership, bullying, childhood trauma, failed relationships, closeted homosexuality, and even suicide without dancing around them. In fact, he confronts them head on.I do understand why people would think all of this artificial, arguing of how things like this have been dealt with before. As for that, I do agree that there are moments of artificiality, but not too much to destroy it for me. Is it perfect? No, but for me, it always depends on execution, and something about this just feels very honest.****1/2 / *****",9,1,3,28 December 2012
The Expendables 2," You get what you're promised¬Ö and I love it.
","OH MY GOD!!! THIS WAS LIKE THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!Okay, so that above statement isn't true. Without ever trying too hard, The Expendables 2, a movie that recreates the mindless high octane thrills of the 80's, is even bigger and better than the guilty pleasure original. It features a cast of former and current action stars including, but not limited to Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Terry Crews, Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, and the catch-phraseinator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger.Reliably cheesy, thoroughly ridiculous, and almost devoid of any character development, the movie succeeds as a throwback to the brainless banter and over the top stunts of old school action flicks. The script is basically an excuse for a string of these action scenes stitched together, but other than that, the movie just plays it simple in plotting. It moves quickly, it holds a sense of nostalgia, and any movie with Rambo, John McClain, and the Terminator in the same frame is okay by me.Most of the dialogue is the witty banter between the characters (and that adds to the already great chemistry), with some good ol' one-liners thrown in. It even gives the cast chances to poke fun at themselves. Moments like an exchange between Willis and Schwarzenegger that recalls previous movies of the two are particularly golden. It's the ultimate in self parody, and the action's pretty entertaining, too. Bring on the next installment, and for that female expendable that's supposed to join the cast, may it either be Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton. That would make my day!*** / *****",6,1,7,7 September 2012
Source Code," May this suspenseful Sci-Fi lead to more, equally impressive movies.
","That time of year - beginning in the month of April - where truly great movies start to emerge is finally upon us, so it's no surprise that I should get exactly what I wanted out of the Sci-Fi/Suspense Source Code.The film stars Jake Gylenhaal as Colter Stevens, a US Army helicopter pilot recruited for a top secret operation known as the Source Code, which enables a person to relive the last eight minutes of a life deceased during a major catastrophe, and used to prevent further foul happenings from taking place. He is repeatedly sent into the scenario of a pre train explosion in the guise of another man to try and piece together the mystery of the bomber, all the while falling in love with a woman (Played by Michelle Monaghan) sitting in the row directly across from him.The film is directed by Duncan Jones, the man behind 2009's intriguing Moon, and he's obviously not a one trick pony. One of the things I love so much about the film is that it reminds me of the sort of film Alfred Hitchcock would have directed, right down to chilly atmosphere and editing, kinetic cinematography (Supplied here by the great Don Burgess), and a ubiquitous musical score which evokes all the tension that Hitchcock's longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann would extract. Jones is a visually impressive director, and he only does good things for this movie.But the screenplay by Ben Ripley is just as much to thank for how good the movie is. He balances the arks of the characters, the action sequences, and the ever present desire to solve mystery in erect, orderly structure, and offers appropriate opportunities for the cast, specifically that of Gylenhaal, as well as Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, and Jeffrey Wright, to truly shine and showcase their talent. Just be sure you're keeping your uninterrupted attention on what's happening.The movie is a huge collaborative effort, and as a result, a tense, intelligent film that must not be missed. May Source Code lead to other fantastic works in 2011.*** out of ****",8,0,1,18 April 2011
Skyfall," 007 is still as sleek, suave, and thrilling as ever. I guess you really can teach an old dog new tricks.
","Sometimes, a movie title can bear an ironic metaphor. Indeed, longtime James Bond fans could find little solace amidst the disappointment of Quantum of Solace, the lackluster follow up to Martin Campbell's Casino Royale, the thrilling 2006 reboot to the 007 franchise. Amends had to be made, and with Sam Mendes (Of American Beauty and Road to Perdition fame) in the director's chair, the hype behind Bond's 23rd venture in 50 years was justified. The result, Skyfall, an exhilarating, intense, and even emotional movie that should please longtime devotees, and even win the franchise some new fans.After a failed mission to retrieve a hard drive containing the identities and placements of MI6 agents in criminal organizations around the world (complete with a motorcycle chase that would justify Gary Powell and his stunt team claiming the SAG stunt ensemble award on its own), Bond (Daniel Craig), believed to be dead for months, reemerges to uncover the identity of whoever stole the hard drive. The years have finally caught up with Bond, as he proves to be less invincible and more psychologically damaged than in previous incarnations.Nonetheless, he's still cleared for duty by his superior M (Judi Dench). This makes for one of the movie's fascinating emotional elements. Despite the questionable methods between the two, we get to see a warm, almost maternal bond between them. The trail eventually leads Bond to Silva (Javier Bardem), a troubled ex-agent who seeks revenge for M's past sins. Bardem is fan-freakin'-tastic in the role, and everything a great Bond villain should be: Intimidating, intelligent, vengeful, conniving, and at times, even hilarious. You can tell that Bardem is having a blast in the role, and he makes for one of the best Bond villains, especially since it's more intimate than an evil corporation, less on a global scale, and more on a personal scale.Moving on from that, Skyfall makes for both a great update, and a pleasant throwback to the old Bond staples. It ties evenly into the thematic context of Bond's character, often humorously referred to with 'old dog, new tricks.' For both new and old fans, you get the best of both worlds. It makes a great effort at looking into Bond's psychological state, and you also get the exhilarating action he's known for. The pacing is usually very kind to this development, although the third act does get a little tiresome.From a technical standpoint, the movie is flawless. Mendes brings together a veteran team of craftspeople that all do everything the job requires of them, and then some. Roger Deakins, who provides beautifully composed and stunning digital photography, is worthy of another Oscar he's not going to receive. The sound design, and the overall mix, is certainly top notch stuff. Dennis Gassner nails the tone of each scene with his detailed production design. Chris Corbould's practical effects are great, and the stunt work, again, is great. Early on, we also get a listen to Adele's beautifully melancholy title track, which deserves consideration as one of the year's best original songs, set to Daniel Kleinman's fabulous opening titles.Overall, Skyfall is a smashing good action thriller that should entertain both the initiated and uninitiated viewers of 007. A much needed face lift that takes the series into new stylistic directions, but still stays true to the essence of what made James Bond a household name over the years. 'Old dog, new tricks'? That sounds about right.***** / *****",10,2,9,2 December 2012
The Hangover," MYeah's review: The Hangover
","Hello everybody! This weekend I saw The Hangover.The film centers on four best friends: Phil Wenneck (Played by Bradley Cooper) Stu Price (Ed Helms) Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), who all travel to Las Vegas, to celebrate Doug's bachelor party before he gets married. But the morning after, they wake up to a massive hangover. And for some reason, they cant remember ANYTHING from last night. And what's worse? It turns out they have lost Doug. They find out that the reason WHY they can't remember anything is because they were slipped roofies. They have to retrace all of their steps from the twelve hour period that they have no memory of to find Doug.And the film is absolutely hilarious!The script is creative, inspired, and brilliantly structured. The film is occasionally very random, but it's still so funny. The film is very well paced, and isn't hindered by slow pace that the first few minutes does suffer from a bit.The performances are great in this movie. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis all play off of each other so well as an ensemble (They're the three best friends that anyone's ever had. :D ), and just as good separately, along with Justin Bartha as well. They're all supported by some great cameos from Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong, Rob Riggle, and Mike Tyson among others.Overall thoughts: The film's strongest benefits are from it's creative, and hilarious screenplay, and performances.The movie gets *** out of **** from me.",8,2,4,25 May 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," This thing takes itself too seriously.
","Listen, the title alone writes the movie. I mean, it's... It's Abraham Lincoln killing vampires! Why does this movie take itself so seriously? The movie feels like a long, boring history lesson, despite the fact that it holds little historic credence. The whole thing is bland, hollow, weakly acted (Except for Marton Csokas, but that's only because he's a walking, talking hambone), and the action screws with the tone. There is one good action sequence, A train sequence near the end. That scene is how the rest of the movie should have been like. Seth Grahame-Smith, between this movie and Dark Shadows, you are an awful screenwriter.** out of *****",4,1,4,23 October 2012
Iron Man 2," Not as good as the first, but still a fun thrill ride.
","The film is based on the Marvel comic book series. Six months after Billionaire Tony Stark (Played by Robert Downey Jr.) has freely admitted to the whole world that HE is Iron Man, he is now being asked by the government to hand over the Iron Man suit, which he refuses to do. He appoints his secretary Pepper Potts (Played by Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries. He tries to deal with several dangerous things, such as a rising toxicity level within his blood from using the Iron Man suit, his friend James Rhodes (Played by Don Cheadle) using one of Tony's suits to become 'War Machine', and a dangerous new supervillain named Ivan Vanko (Played by Mickey Rourke) arriving on the scene.And what did I think of the film itself? I thought it was rather fun, not as good as the first though.I think one of it's main problems was the script, which seemed to get a little hectic while balancing all the subplots, but it didn't drive it to the point of no return. It was a nice story. Fast paced, although the length is noticeable once or twice.Performances are pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. once again shines as Tony Stark, adding much needed humor to the movie. He and Gwyneth Paltrow have excellent chemistry together, Paltrow herself is a great performer. The same chemistry can't exactly be said for Downey and Don Cheadle. Cheadle was alright, but Terrence Howard just played the character better. And Scarlett Johansson seemed to add little to the story as Natalie Rushman aka. Black Widow, she seemed like eye candy, but what gorgeous eye candy.Now villains. Mickey Rourke played a really good villain, Sam Rockwell, not as much. He tries to be funny, but half of the time it's a bit more annoying than funny. But, I won't deny that it was still a good role.The Visuals of this movie are remarkable, once again Industrial Light & Magic has brought brilliance to the screen. But what good is a movie without it's Sound? The sound design is just as brilliant in the movie, and I think I see another possible two Oscar nominations to Christopher Boyes' tally.In short, the film is a bit over the place, but it's still thrilling, hilarious, and features some good performances.I give it **1/2 out of ****",5,0,1,25 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Everything die hard Hunger Games fans, and even non-fans, could hope for.
","When it officially went into wide release over two months ago, The Hunger Games, based on the first book of Suzanne Collin's acclaimed trilogy of books, was the most eagerly anticipated literary film adaptation since Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Before you ask: Yes, I AM a fan of the books, and I can say that the Hunger Games movie, directed by the great Gary Ross, is one seriously good movie.In the country of Panem, the 74th Hunger Games - a yearly event where one girl and boy between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of twelve districts compete to the death in an arena - is taking place. Katniss Everdeen of District 12 volunteers to compete in place of her younger sister, traveling to the Capitol of Panem with fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark, a boy with ties to Katniss's past. As the tournament looms closer, Katniss and Peeta begin training and preparing for what will come in the arena, fighting against kids from other districts who've trained for this their whole lives.As a director, Gary Ross' visual style is impressive. He's an expert at structure and staging, pacing the movie perfectly, and making it look and sound fantastic, especially Tom Stern's involving cinematography. But beneath the flashy aesthetics is also a film of genuine depth. If you're watching for full on action, look elsewhere. Any action scenes are lucky if they're longer than two minutes, but what I appreciate is that action is entirely not the point. The movie is more interested in building intensity and emotion to match the huge scope. Surprising depth also lies within the ideas the story presents. Themes of corruption in politics and government, social inequality, as well as society's disturbing thirst for exploitative reality television is explored very often. If I have any major complaints, I guess I'd say that the ending definitely rushes things.As far as talent goes, look no further than that of the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, who fits the role of Katniss like a glove. Katniss can be thought of as an enhancement of Lawrence's fantastic Oscar nominated performance in Winter's Bone. Her emotional range and confidence adds so much to this character. Tough, fearless, and highly likable, Katniss is one of the greatest movie heroines in years. A fine young group of actors that play tributes from other districts are exceptional, and there's also a stellar cast of supporting adults that includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, and a virtually unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks. Scene stealer notice must go to Stanley Tucci. With razor sharp comedic timing, charismatic enthusiasm, and unexpected warmth, his Caesar Flickerman rocks the movie.What can be expected of the inevitable Catching Fire? Well, My anticipation will be sky high. On a side note, a little fun fact: Second unit portions of the movie were directed by master of versatility Steven Soderbergh. So Hollywood, if you're reading this, please get Soderbergh on board to direct the sequel.****1/2/ *****",9,2,6,30 May 2012
The Impossible," Very emotional, visceral, and intense, this one hits hard.
","Based on true events, The Impossible centers on a family on vacation in Thailand, whose lives are affected after they're all separated by the tsunami that struck the land in December of 2004. Through the eyes of this family, we're witness to all the devastation and heartbreak surrounding this catastrophe, all gritty to the point that makes it hard to watch at points, although some of that may be the shaky cam as well. The whole cast is great, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor specifically giving some of the best performances of their careers, pouring out so much sincere emotion. On a visceral level, on an emotional level, it hits HARD. Not only does it hit, it practically delivers a punch to the gut. If you can stomach the bloody material, you owe it to yourself to see this undervalued gem.**** / *****",8,1,2,12 April 2013
Argo," With the funny, exciting, and highly entertaining Argo, Ben Affleck has given us a truly great movie.
","After an unfortunate string of critical and commercial failures in front of the camera, Ben Affleck made a complete career turnaround behind the camera, wowing everyone (myself included) with his thrilling directorial debut Gone, Baby, Gone. He would direct something even better three years later with The Town, a fabulous movie. His latest effort is Argo, where he pulls triple duty as director, producer, and actor. I will admit that I thought all the hype and buzz surrounding this movie might be all for naught, as there are certain kinds of movies with hype I just can't buy into (just ask Prometheus), but this is one of those cases where I was happy to be wrong. The tense and highly entertaining Argo is seriously a great movie.The film takes place between 1979 and 1980 during the Iranian Revolution, where angered citizens storm the US Embassy in Tehran, taking all but six people ‚Äì who take refuge with the Canadian ambassador ‚Äì as hostages. With time growing short, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, himself) concocts a plan to pass the six people off as Canadian filmmakers on location scouting. This requires him to seek help from makeup designer John Chambers (John Goodman), and Hollywood producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), settling on a Star Wars rip-off called 'Argo'. With the plan in motion, and time growing shorter, the hard part is for Tony to convince the frightened refugees to go along with it, knowing the consequences should their cover fail.Considering the fact that the movie is based on true events, you may already know how it plays out in the end. Even with that in mind, I don't care. Ben Affleck knows that the journey to that point is what really matters. Evoking the very best out of Chris Terrio's layered screenplay, he does an excellent job at emphasizing the tension of the situation, even amongst the more satirical moments of the film. His balance between the dramatic and comedic aspects is a highlight, as these two things manage to flow smoothly from one to the next without feeling disconnected from each other. With his creative sets, costumes, and photography, he also does a great job at immersing us in this believable late 70's setting.I especially appreciate how he and Editor William Goldenberg handle the pacing of Argo, making sure that not a single scene in this movie is boring. You tell me this is two hours? The way it moves, I wouldn't have believed you. The movie uses a simple, but effective race against the clock structure that places an emphasis on intensity, and if you're heart isn't racing during the climax... Well, then you may want to check to see if you have a heart.Of course, it's not all Affleck's direction, the script, or the detailed technical design that makes this movie. The Ensemble cast and the chemistry they share is just as vital. Ben Affleck is just as good in front of the camera as he is behind it, and the supporting cast he surrounds himself with is excellent. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame heats up the scene as Tony's CIA supervisor Jack O'Donnell. John Goodman is warm and funny as John Chambers. The six refugees are all also quite good, particularly Scoot McNairy as the hesitant Joe Stafford. The hilarious and satirical Alan Arkin wins standout notice, getting most of the film's best lines and jokes.After all my apprehension to buy into Argo's hype, it's not hard to see why this is such a well liked movie. In fact, it's considered to be one of the front runners for this year's Oscar race. Could it end up winning big there? I sure hope so, because it's earned it.****1/2 / *****",9,1,3,23 October 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," The first good film adaptation of a video game.
","Maybe Jerry Bruckheimer was hoping this movie might become the next Pirates of the Caribbean. Well, this movie fell short of that feat. But, you know what? It actually fell closer than you'd think.Based on the video game series, the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan, a young man who years earlier, was living on the streets of Persia, until he was adopted by the king. He helps his brother, Tus (played by Richard Coyle) invade a kingdom accused of forging weapons for enemies of Persia, all the while finding a mysterious dagger. Life is good, until Dastan is forced to live as a fugitive, after a traitor in his family frames him for murdering the king. He travels across the desert with the guardian of the dagger, the beautiful Princess Tamina (Played by Gemma Arterton). Dastan learns that the dagger has the ability to turn back time, and only the holder of the dagger is aware of what has happened. They both must protect the dagger from ending up in the wrong hands, and if it does, it could unleash a sandstorm that would destroy humanity.Okay, so the plot is pretty much by-the-book Bruckheimer. It has a rather simplistic action filled plot, the threat of an oncoming apocalypse of hellfire proportions, silly, yet clever comic relief (provided here by Alfred Molina), and two romantic leads who sometimes choose the oddest of times to kiss. It has a bit of predictability to it, but it's simplicity honestly isn't a bad thing. And the action in the movie is fast paced, and never loses interest thanks to film editors Mick Audsley, Martin Walsh, and film editing LEGEND Michael Kahn.The performances are good in the film as well. Jake Gyllenhaal (who probably isn't THE most obvious action star) was very good in a very physically demanding role, and carries the film so well. Gemma Arterton was fine in the film, and she has good chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Alfred Molina was such fun in his role, providing some great chuckles. And Ben Kingsley (Bald and/or scarred villain number 964 and counting) was great to watch as the jealous brother of the king, who murders him, and wants the dagger to, you guessed it, take over Persia.I also have to throw out praise to the technical crew, who made this movie look and sound so impressive. I'll give special mentions to Production Designer Wolf Kroeger, who made an epic Persia with a little style thrown in, and Costume Designer Penny Rose of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, for creating such lovely costumes.And, I am happy to say that this is the first film adaptation of a video game that was actually GOOD. It's always a tricky source material to adapt, but it did it so well. It's not perfect, but it's a vast improvement.Predictable, yes, but I never once got bored while watching it. It has good performances, good humor, and thrilling action sequences.It's a good movie, that's a lot of fun, so I give it *** out of ****",8,3,6,7 June 2010
Ted," Tonally uneven, but totally hilarious.
","Seth MacFarlane is one unique comical voice, and he brings his Family Guy-like formula to his first feature, Ted. A movie about a bear who swears, smokes weed, and makes frequent crude remarks has serious potential. And that is why Ted deserves to be seen: It is flat out hilarious. Tonally uneven, and overly familiar, but still hilarious with hardly a dull moment. The movie provides some golden antics, especially between Mark Wahlberg and MacFarlane (playing Ted through motion capture). The delightful pop culture references are also tickling, none the least of which was an homage to John Williams' legendary march from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi provide their own laughs in supporting roles, Patrick Stewart gives a droll narration, while Norah Jones provides a couple of jazzy original songs. With his comedic resources, and a possibly stronger screenplay, you can only hope that MacFarlane will make something even better the second time he releases a movie.***1/2 / *****",7,1,4,10 August 2012
127 Hours," Boyle's auteurial stylistics may be a bit of a misfit, but James Franco delivers one of the VERY best performances of the year.
","I recently saw 127 Hours, a rock (no pun intended) solid movie about the true story of Aron Ralston.In the film, James Franco plays Ralston, a thrill seeker whose arm became pinned between a boulder and a canyon wall while he was rock climbing in Utah. He became trapped for over five days, taking drastic measures to survive, before finally resorting to amputating his arm off, and eventually making it out alive. At this point, it's a clich√© to say, but this is nothing short of a remarkable, and incredible true story.Some would accuse the film of being style over substance, I'd disagree, but I can see the point of their argument, but just hear me out. Danny Boyle is a remarkable director whose films usually include frenetic film editing, inventive camera techniques, and thumping music. Those traits work well in other films of his (like Slumdog Millionaire and 28 Days Later), but while they are clever, they tend to remove focus from the main plot line of THIS film. Unfortunate to say, but the editing and camera-work had a tendency of irritating me.Still, that's no reason AT ALL for me to call 127 Hours a BAD movie, especially not for the film's true driving force, James Franco. He carries the whole film on his back, and 99% of which is entirely on his own. His performance is intense and emotional, and never feels false, never feels preachy, and never lets us take our attention off the screen. One of the year's very, VERY best.And even if the aesthetics tended to get in the way, they can't bog down the passion behind forming the screenplay. Not only is it a successful story of survival, but it also ties in a theme of embracing, rather than shunning society. The sound mix is also sleek, and the pacing tends to hop between slow and fast, and I mean that in the best possible way, as it appropriately shows how the daily struggles of Aron's life either glides by, or drags along. It also features a beautiful end credits song by Dido and A.R. Rahman.If you can look past whatever flaws there are, you'll find A LOT to admire.I give 127 Hours *** out of ****",8,7,14,8 January 2011
Rise of the Guardians," It's an absolute delight. An imaginative holiday treat I look forward to watching again.
","Happy Holidays, everybody! Well, it won't be long until Christmas day finally comes, and boy, am I excited! One of my favorite traditions this time of year is the numerous Christmas movies and specials that come out leading up to the day itself. With that in mind, one movie that I decided to lend my attention to was Dreamworks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. Does it meet the high standards of How to Train Your Dragon, or, even worse, does it prove to be just as boring and stale as Madagascar 3? I'm leaning towards the former, because this holiday treat brought me nothing but enjoyment.Sort of an Avengers for childhood icons, the movie mixes together Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and the Sandman all together as guardians, those who protect the youth of the world from fear. However, fear is about to fight back, as the menacing Boogeyman Pitch (Jude Law) wages war against the four, tired of no one acknowledging his existence. They need extra help. That comes from newly appointed guardian, the mischievous Jack Frost (Chris Pine), who resents the idea of joining their ranks, but is eventually convinced to do it, hoping he'll find answers to his past life along the way.The main talking points I want to bring up will be divided into four sections.1. The eclectic voice cast assembled for these characters is just wonderful. All of them give just the right amount of what their characters need, fleshing them out as authentic and fully dimensional. Pine is energetic and sincere, Baldwin is virtually unrecognizable, Jackman is tough and hilarious, Fisher is sweet and funny, and Law brings just the right amount of underlying terror. As for the Sandman, he doesn't speak, but his simple expressions do all the acting he needs. I honestly love how character driven it feels.2. The way this movie looks is nothing if not breathtaking. Say what you will about the majority of Dreamworks movies, but their animation is always a highlight. The design, color palettes, and surrounding ambiance of the visited cities, and the individual worlds of the Guardians, rival some of the best production designs of any live action feature. And don't get me started on the beautiful glowing textures of the dreamsand.3. The sound is also done quite well. The sound design and mix, though not that fantastic, is professionally done, as you'd expect, but now we get to the movie's best aspect. The music heard in this movie is not only Alexandre Desplat's best score of 2012 (and one of the best scores of the year), it may very well be the best score he's ever done, plain and simple. The themes, moods, and varied orchestral flavors he brings to the table is unique all in its own.4. The story in this movie may not be anything that special, and it has been done better, but at least they manage to put a creative new spin on it. There is simply so much passion, so much creativity, and so much imagination in this movie, and considering it comes from the mind of William Joyce, such a thing shouldn't surprise me. I really admire the issues of lost identity, the longing of purpose, and of faith that the movie explores, the latter of which draws comparisons to aspects of Christianity. The balance between the action, humor, heart, and development may not always be smooth, but it does the job well enough, and it's beautifully paced.All I know is that I'd recommend this movie to anyone in a heartbeat. While it may not be Dreamworks' best movie, it's certainly one of their finest films, and one of the best animated films of the year.****1/2 / *****",9,0,1,28 December 2012
Midnight in Paris," A sweetly sentimental movie with an excellent cast and script.
","Woody Allen's script is an impressive one. One that he clearly took his time with. Midnight in Paris features an impressive cast of characters, an array of interesting sub plots, and a very sweet sense of nostalgia. The sequences of the roaring 20's after midnight are magical stuff set up with care by Allen. They balance sentimentality, comedy, romance, and drama on perfect keel. The movie places us under an irresistible spell, and the whole thing just flies by, never getting boring.The way that Allen also writes his characters is wonderful stuff, and his incredible ensemble cast (Including Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Corey Stoll, Michael Sheen, and especially Alison Pill... the list goes on) bring out the most of their characters with total conviction. In particular, Adrien Brody has a hilarious cameo as a rhinoceros obsessed Salvador Dali.The backdrop of Paris only heightens the movie's charm. Allen begins the film with a lovely, but somewhat draggy, four minute montage of the city, but I can't deny that it's a nice way to establish ambiance. Allen chooses fascinating aesthetic styles to further enhance the movie's nostalgic effect. The element that truly brings this out is Darius Khondji's cinematography, which Allen wanted to have a very wide range of warm colors to give a very flattering light. The color spectrum is gorgeous, no less than such a city as Paris deserves.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,3,3 January 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Have I finally found the best film of 2011? I think so.
","It may not be the flashiest movie of 2011 by any counts, but for my money, I wouldn't be surprised if it remains the BEST.The information and dialogue in this movie is staggering to be totally honest, but the movie's confidant pacing gives the audience time to piece together the narrative puzzles as the movie goes along. The script is pure brilliance, utilizing perfect blends of tension, intrigue, suspense, paranoia, chills, thrills... the list goes on, and the food for thought is incredible. Even after having seen it a few days ago, I still can't get it out of my mind.Tomas Alfredson paces this movie with precision, crafts it with a perfect eye of detail, and hits us with mistrust for on screen images in a way that continues to heighten the suspense factor. The cinematography and editing are pitch perfect, as is the Art-Direction.Most impressive is the cast, quite possibly the best assembled of the year. They're all as integral to the tension as the screenplay is, with sparks flying all around, and any one of them could not be who they say they are. The acting is not all flashy, but lies more within eye movements and vocalization to give a deeper, believable depth. Some of the excellence is owed to that of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt, Mark Strong, and Tom Hardy. Standout notice must go to human chameleon Gary Oldman, perfectly embodying George Smiley, and not just with his fine hair and makeup. He excels in this movie with his controlled emotional layers, impeccable timing, and flawless line delivery. Gary, you've done it again!It's also worth noting that Tinker Tailor improves upon multiple viewings, and the result is a film that can be called nothing less than flawless.**** out of ****",10,2,6,18 January 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," All that epic dazzle and action aren't matched by the film's undercooked characters. It is what it is, an entertaining popcorn movie.
","Before I get into to actual review, I must confess to not being familiar with the comics by Herge that the film is based on. So if you ask me, 'How much did they right?' or 'Were they true to the spirits of the comics?' you're honestly asking the wrong guy.The film follows investigative reporter, Tintin (Played by Jamie Bell), and his canine companion, Snowy. While at the market, Tintin comes across a model of a legendary ship known as the Unicorn. What he soon discovers is that the model is one of three identical models that contain a secret scroll within the mast, each of which is sought after by evil Ivan Sakharine (Played by Daniel Craig). The scrolls contain a mystery that can only be solved by Captain Archibald Haddock (Played by Andy Serkis), a descendant of Francis Haddock, the original captain of the ill fated Unicorn.First of all, I give high praise to the sound, which is incredibly mixed and edited, and features one of the year's very best musical scores - courtesy of the great John Williams. Secondly, I have even higher praise for how the movie looks. The film showcases brisk, snappy editing, fascinating film noir camera work, and slightly cartoonish, but near photo realistic visual effects by Joe Letteri and his team from Weta Digital.It would be really easy for me to get really excited about the movie... if only the concepts were as fine tuned as the aesthetics. I think Spielberg and his team seemed so intent to nail the styles and visual looks of the comics (Did they? I don't know) that they forgot to keep a more narrowed focus on the screenplay. Now it's not that I anything against the story. It's pretty decent stuff, aside from a somewhat useless sub plot with a pickpocket (Played by Toby Jones), and an abrupt, awkward ending that sets things up for a sequel.My bigger issues lie with character. The movie features an abundance of two dimensional characters, with the only character getting any full, proper development being Captain Haddock. But let me just ask this. If the movie is called 'The Adventures of TINTIN', why is our lead character so less interesting than a supporting character? Oh well, at least I found myself delightfully distracted by some really clever action sequences. Such as a daring escape from a cargo ship, an epic clash between two manually operated construction cranes, and a thrilling high speed chase through Bagghar that I'd easily jot down as one of the year's best overall scenes. However, a few creative action sequences in an hour and forty five minute movie doesn't quite cut it for me.My arguments still stand, but I also realize that I can't be too harsh on Tintin. It is what it is, an entertaining popcorn movie.**1/2 out of ****",7,0,3,26 November 2011
The Expendables," It's a star packed, action packed, and utterly ridiculous movie... and I love it!
","OH MY GOD! THIS WAS LIKE THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!Okay, my first comment isn't accurate, but the one accurate thing I think CAN be said about The Expendables, is that it's a pretty fun guilty pleasure movie. In fact, guilty pleasure really doesn't give the film enough credit.The film is written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also stars in the film as Barney Ross, the head of a team of mercenaries, comprised of other skilled men such as Lee Christmas (Played by Jason Statham), Ying Yang (Jet Li), and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). They are hired by a mysterious man named Mister Church (Played by Bruce Willis in an awesome cameo) to travel to South America, and overthrow a power hungry dictator. But once there, they try to protect his daughter as well, and later find out that this mission also involves a ruthless crime lord named James Munroe (Played by Eric Roberts).The story is kind of secondary to the real star that is the action,, a little predictable, but it's still pretty engaging that we're able to have fun with, and enjoy the dialogue. The movie is very funny with the chemistry between its actors, and the interest is always pretty high.The ensemble cast is simply huge, and fun, featuring just about any major action movie star you could ask for. Stallone, Statham, Li, Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin, and Randy Couture are a pretty impressive badass lineup, along with Eric Roberts, and Mickey Rourke in great supporting roles. and brilliant cameos by Bruce Willis, and 80's action movie LEGEND Arnold Schwarzenegger (Rocky Balboa, The Terminator, AND John McClane in the same frame together?! EPIC WIN!).This is to say nothing of the action, which is overblown, over the top, and completely ridiculous... AND I LOVE IT! It's way too much fun, the sound design and mix is impressive, the stunt coordination is top notch, and the visuals are simply killer. Thumbs way up.My only real complaint is that I wish the film would have given Schwarzenegger a chance to make a brilliant one liner, which he's undoubtedly the king of. Even an 'I'll be back.' or 'Hasta la Vista, baby!' would have made my day.Still, it's a highly passable summer action flick. Predictable, but never boring.I give the Expendables **1/2 out of ****",7,3,8,27 August 2010
The Way Back," The Way Back isn't for the faint of heart, but it's visceral, and visual creativity makes it an experience worth taking.
","I recently got a chance to see the grand epic The Way Back. This isn't a perfect movie, but I'm gladly going to give it thumbs up.Based on an impossible, but incredible true tale, the film centers on a group of people who escape from a concentration camp in Siberia, and attempt to travel all the way to India on foot. This includes the leader, a young Polish POW named Janusz (Played by Jim Sturgess), a no crap from anyone criminal named Valka (Played by Colin Farrell), an American immigrant simply known as Mr. Smith (Played by Ed Harris), and the mysterious Irena (Played by Saoirse Ronan), an orphan who tags along with the group.The film is a dazzling epic directed by Peter Weir, a visual artist best known for films like Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show. And while it certainly isn't his best directed, it's certainly one of his most beautiful. He doesn't fall back on the well known three act structure, but that's probably for the better, as the film beholds plenty of things to keep us watching. The journey is a long and visceral experience, and his ensemble cast is deeply effective, specifically that of Saoirse Ronan, who steals each and every scene she's in by delivering brilliance through understatement.Each and every one of Weir's technical crew deserves nothing but praise, such as Russell Boyd for cinematography that calls back to the epics of David Lean, Lee Smith's smart film cutting, and the incredible Oscar nominated makeup team of Edouard Henriques, Greg Funk and Yolanda Toussieng. Their work which includes hardships like overheat, illness, exhaustion, and malnourishment adds a subtle depth to the pain of the characters, and makes it feel more genuine.The Way Back isn't for everyone, but it's an experience I think most should have at least once.I give it *** out of ****",8,6,10,23 February 2011
Megamind," An amusing, albeit unspectacular, diversion with a great voice cast.
","I recently saw Dreamworks animation's Megamind, a film about a failed supervillain who discovers he makes a better good guy than bad guy. A plot like this hasn't been tackled at since... last Summer with the release of Despicable Me. And out of these two movies, Megamind is funnier, much more finely fleshed out, and just a better movie in general.Will Ferrell voices Megamind, the blue skinned, bulbous headed title supervillain. His evil schemes to take over Metro City are frequently foiled by his nemesis Metro Man (Voiced by Brad Pitt), a superhero who always saves the day, and the Lois Lane of their hometown, Roxanne Ritchi (Voiced by Tina Fey). But when Megamind accidentally defeats his nemesis, he falls into a slump. But decides to alter that by creating a new superhero out of a nerdy cameraman (Voiced by Jonah Hill), and in the guise of a museum curator, strikes up a relationship with Roxanne, all the while, his cold heart begins to warm The idea of taking the clich√©s of superhero movies, and turning them into quirky and unfamiliar territory is really nothing new, especially to those who've seen Pixar's The Incredibles, but what you'll get is a pleasantly surprising animated feature, albeit an unspectacular one. The characters tend to hop between emotions sporadically, and the story isn't all THAT inspired, (Plus the film's third act kind of drags) but the humor of the film, which ranges from witty one-liners and tickling sight gags, made me laugh a great many times, especially an homage to Marlon Brando's character from the Superman movies.The film also has a great voice cast, Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, and Hill are all given great material to work with, and their timing is effective, though one of the more interesting mentions is David Cross, who voices Megamind's scene stealing fish henchmen named Minion. The animation is slick, and dazzling, and the sound design by Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl is some impressive craftsmanship.I can't quite say Megamind is a 'Three Star' movie, because it just isn't. It doesn't completely nail down the tone it wants of itself, and to be honest, it might be a tad forgettable, but It's really enjoyable for what it is.I give Megamind **1/2 out of ****",7,1,2,11 January 2011
Horrible Bosses," Witty for what it is. Just don't expect a comedy of total hysteria.
","I'm just gonna be blunt... I was not crazy about this movie. I'm sorry, but I honestly was expecting to enjoy it more, especially since I had heard so many funny things about it. Maybe it was aimed at those with something of an acquired taste, because the movie has a very specific, very twisted sense of humor that goes down some pretty dark roads. I mean, this review is coming from someone who laughs harder at the Monty Python show and movies than anything.At least the cast is pretty admirable stuff. They each get their own unique moments of hilarity, with Charlie Day and Colin Farrell standing out in a field of such talented comics. When the movie is funny, it's hysterically so (Day has one particular scene with Kevin Spacey, whose character has a peanut allergy, that had me rolling). I just felt like the comedy was a bit on the uneven side. A lot of outrageous things happen, but I'm not laughing that much.Still, I can't be too harsh on something that was actually not half bad, so I'll recommend it for a rental.**1/2 out of ****",6,0,1,20 December 2011
The Town," A tense, and gripping crime thriller from start to finish. Ben Affleck is no one hit wonder.
","Recently I got a chance to see Ben Affleck's latest crime drama, The Town, based on the book 'Prince of Thieves' by Chuck Hogan.In the film, Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a man in league with a band of bank robbers recruited by a threatening flower shop owner, and crime boss. After a recent heist involving taking a bank manager (Played by Rebbecca Hall) hostage, and later releasing her, Doug begins to charm her, and the two seem to hit it off well. However, complications arise from not only Doug's closest friend, Jem (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner), but he's also ceaselessly pursued by FBI agent Adam Frawley (Played by Jon Hamm), who will do any and all things possible to bring Doug to justice.The movie is essentially two things: A) Proof that Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone was far from a fluke, and B) In my opinion, a better movie than Gone Baby Gone. His film is expertly structured, and set up, thanks to the efforts of he, and his co-writers Peter Craig, and Aaron Stockard. It can be a risky move to write, direct, and star in your own movie, but Affleck handles them all with adequate balance, and the result is a film that suffers from very few faults, most of which aren't even worth noting.He really is making a comeback into the acting world, taking on a role perfect for him, and always taking it just as serious as is necessary, and shares great chemistry with Rebbecca Hall, who is also a great fit for her role. One of the more interesting mentions is Jeremy Renner, who leaves a lasting impression with his chilling, but quietly careful performance, and also worth mentioning is Jon Hamm, whose character is not quite afraid to embrace a subtle dark side of himself while trying to capture these criminals. Other fine examples of casting include small, but vital supporting roles by Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper.It's expertly cast, and scripted, as well as handsomely crafted. The action scenes of the film are pretty nail-biting, fast paced, and well staged, specifically a very tense car chase through the narrow streets of Charlestown, complimented brilliantly by Robert Elswit's energetic cinematography, the highly involving sound mix by Gregg Landaker, Steve Maslow, and David J. Schwartz, as well as the brooding underscore by Harry Gregson-Williams and David Buckley.It's a great film that's not only an engaging crime drama, but also a gripping action thriller.And for that, The Town earns ***1/2 out of ****",9,3,6,6 December 2010
Life of Pi," A mess of a narrative, but a beauty of visual art.
","Often considered a book to be ultimately unfilmable, Ang Lee faced a struggle in adapting Life of Pi. Was he successful? Well, anyway, the movie follows young Pi Patel, the lone survivor of a ship sinking, trapped for a long time on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger as his companion. The film highlights some weighty and thought provoking issues of faith and religion, taking a bold road rarely seen in family films. It does sound like something that would work well in the script's favor, but then I have to back up and remind myself that the narrative is uneven, diminishing the emotional impact that should be felt, and the narration and present day sequences overstay their welcome.To be fair, for a movie that spends half the time on a boat with only a young boy and tiger on screen, Life of Pi is still a decent movie to watch. No one can accuse Ang Lee of not knowing what he wanted this film to be, for his direction is the movie's strongest point. Lee is the proper example of a director fully confidant and in control of his own vision, so I do respect the film more than I actually liked it. If nothing else, we can all marvel at the visual aspects, which are quite enchanting, if at times a wee bit too obvious.*** / *****",6,0,1,12 April 2013
Tangled," A witty, catchy, and beautiful movie that touches my inner child.
","I just got home from seeing Tangled, the latest animated fairy Tale from Disney animation.Rapunzel (Voiced with sincere enthusiasm by Mandy Moore) is a girl who has long, long hair that contains the ability to heal, a power she obtained from a flower that saved her mother during pregnancy. For this reason the evil Gothel (Voiced wickedly by Donna Murphy), a woman who had stolen Rapunzel as a baby, keeps her hidden in a tower so that she may use it to keep herself young forever. But when a sly thief named Flynn Rider (Voiced by Zachary Levi) sneaks into the tower, she forces him to take her to see a city where lanterns are sent floating every year on her birthday.The film follows the always classic Disney formula, and the prologue is worrisome, but directors Nathan Greno, Byron Howard and writer Dan Fogelman of 2008's Bolt manage a fine balance between humor, a lot of which was most welcome, divine heart, and wonderful character development. But the real storytelling comes from the brilliant animation. The animation is dazzling, specifically that of every strand of Rapunzel's golden locks of hair, which is simply gorgeous, and the physicality and facial expressions of each character are a great match.The cast clearly have a lot of fun, Mandy Moore's Rapunzel is a sweet, and honest character, Zachary Levi is cleverly funny as Flynn, but the standout is that of Donna Murphy. It's a daring performance, as each time her character manipulates and lies to get her way, it makes the hatred for her rise, but that's the beauty behind it.And of course, I MUST mention the music by the legendary Alan Menken, whose return to the animated musical is very much welcome. The orchestral score may not be one of his very best, but it's a sweetly arranged and brilliantly put together craft. The songs, by he and his lyricist Glenn Slater, are especially great ranging from old fashioned Broadway, to fast paced Honky Tonk, the best of which being the songs 'I See The Light', taking place during the beautiful lantern sequence, and 'Mother Knows Best' a catchy tune taking place in the film's first fifteen minutes, and re-prised at a later point in the film.There's something else about Tangled that I love, but just can't explain. Maybe it's the cast, the characters, or even the music, but there's something about Tangled that warms my heart, and touches my nostalgic inner child. It makes me feel like I once did when I was a little kid.So I obviously say go see Tangled, which I give ***1/2 out of ****",9,2,5,15 December 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," With a nice cast, exciting action scenes, and a retro visual vibe, Captain America is the funnest movie of the Summer.
","As I walked out of Captain America: The First Avenger, I felt the gleeful aftermath of a truly great popcorn flick. It's safe to say that Captain America is THE most fun I've had with ANY 2011 movie I've seen, thus far.Chris Evans stars as Steve Rogers, a true patriot if there ever was one in the 1940's. Though he has the selflessness and bravery of a hundred men, he's forbidden to join the armies of World War II due to his 90 pound body frame. But, with the help of a caring Scientist named Abraham Erskine (Played by Stanley Tucci), he's recruited for a special super soldier infantry, and through the power of science, successfully goes through an experiment that gives him the muscles to match his heroic spirit. But, trouble arises when the USA are facing a threat from an underground organization known as HYDRA, lead by a disfigured Nazi named Johann Schmidt (Played with hissing intimidation by Hugo Weaving). Growing tired of his celebrity status, Rogers decides that it's time to take action, and fight the good fight. Captain America is born.It's not often when visual effects designer turned director Joe Johnston makes a good movie, let alone something as great as Captain America. The movie is a refreshing return to a retro vibe not seen of Johnston since The Rocketeer. He and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely manage a consistent tone, and never make the exciting action sequences feel like they're one too many.As you would expect, Johnston's tech crew have crafted the film very well. Mainly through stylized, but era appropriate sets by Rick Heinrichs. Costumes specific to character and mood by Anna Sheppard. An exciting, and glorious return to past form for composer Alan Silvestri. And last but not least, prosthetic makeup of Red Skull by Lisa Westcott that is so good, it's scary.As for the cast, Chris Evans is especially of notice. Steve Rogers is a highly likable character from the beginning. He never does anything to make us dislike him, and though that threatens to make him feel one note at times, Evans has no problem with keeping the character feeling fresh, a highly beneficial trait. Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving are delightful in their roles of Col. Chester Philips and Johann Schmidt (aka. Red Skull), and the beautiful Hayley Atwell gives it her all as Rogers' love interest, Peggy Carter.It's not always perfect, but the film also features some really exceptional scenes. A daring raid on the HYDRA facilities, a claustrophobic tussle within the confines of a train, and an amusingly creative musical montage of Captain America's celebrity status, set to the original song 'Star Spangled Man' with lyrics by David Zippel, and music by the LEGENDARY Alan Menken.The movie is a pleasant addition to what has been a surprisingly good Summer. Certainly better than last year's. So I hope just as many people going off to see Potter's final bow, or the Transformers' final war will pay just as much attention to Captain America.Before I sign off, I must note two things. My rating, which is *** out of **** Also, I must remind you to stay for a special scene after the end credits, which then leads into a teaser for the upcoming movie, The Avengers, due out in the Summer of next year. If you walk out before that, you're missing too much. My anticipation for the film is now at an all time high, and I can't wait to see it.",8,13,26,1 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The darkest entry in the series so far, but by far the best since Prisoner of Azkaban.
","The film is based on the first half of the final book in the series by J.K. Rowling, so it's understandably incomplete. Not to sound too enthusiastic, but the movie is outstanding, and the best Potter film since Prisoner of Azkaban.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma 'The Standout' Watson return as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. These three are trying to defeat the sinister, and malicious Lord Voldemort (Played by Ralph Fiennes), who sends his Death Eaters on a mission to find Harry, so that he may destroy him once and for all. Harry, with the help of his friends, tries to find, and destroy the remaining horcruxes, hidden objects that give Voldemort eternal life. As they try to uncover each of these objects, jealousy starts to arise between them, emotions are tested, and the mystery of a secret known as the Deathly Hallows is uncovered.I'm normally not too vocal about censorship, but I personally wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of ten. The series that started with the family friendly Philosopher's Stone, has evolved into by far and away, the most tonally dark, and brutally violent entry in the series so far. This inspired ambition is thanks to director David Yates, who holds the record for directing the most feature film adaptations of the series. It's not only a great fantasy, but it works as an effective study of the character's hidden desires, and secret jealousies. The movie at times feels slow, but slow pace aside, the movie is totally enrapturing, none the least of which is a terrific animated segment explaining the origin of the Deathly Hallows, right up to the film's heart stopping finale, comparable to the brilliant cliffhanger ending of The Two Towers, that leaves me so excited to revisit the film.The film's main cast, that include Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Gambon, Fiennes, Coltrane, Rickman, Carter, Felton, and Staunton are back in top form, and most are better than ever, specifically the three children, who have come a long way over the past ten years, and deliver truly adult and complex performances. These returning members are helped out by great newcomers such as Bill Nighy, and Rhys Ifans, who clearly enjoy playing their characters, despite short screen time.Such a dark entry in the series like this is nothing if not for the brilliant tech crew. The visual effects artists provide brilliant work, Stuart Craig's production design is darker, and grimmer than ever, the brooding cinematography by Eduardo Serra is right on the money, and the subtle mostly strings score by Alexandre Desplat is the best non-John Williams score for the series, and compliments the movie perfectly.The only flaw is making us wait eight months for the last installment, but since such a day will be bittersweet at best, I'm content on waiting as long as possible to see it all conclude.I give Deathly Hallows Part 1 ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,24 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Manages to be at level quality with the first film.
","Continuing the adventures of Dragon Warrior, Po the panda (Voiced by Jack Black), the next phase of his training to become a master of kung fu is to attain inner peace. But he can't seem to reach that state. He's conflicted after he finds out that he was adopted as a baby, a truth he learns of after repressed memories finally come forth. On top of this, the disgraced peacock prince Lord Shen (Gary Oldman at his intimidating best) has taken over Gongmen City with a deadly weapon that threatens to destroy China and Kung Fu, and if Po and the Furious Five can't stop him, Shen will accomplish his dark goal.The first Kung Fu Panda was a really good movie. It opened in 2008 to high critical praise, and to become a smash hit at the worldwide box office. Kung Fu Panda 2 improves upon a lot of the first film's traits, but falters in other ways, basically keeping both movies on a nearly even keel.The movie covers familiar grounds to those who liked the first movie, and you can detect the clich√©s of other, better animated movies, but the movie makes up for those things in many ways. A common demise for sequels is that they just keep adding more pretty visuals, more action, and more characters, but fails to give the story proper development, thankfully Kung Fu Panda 2 is not a movie that succumbs to that.It never loses sight of putting heart first, and continues to properly develop character, and explore sides of them never before seen. Another plus is the incredible voice cast, specifically Gary Oldman. But it is worth pointing out that the jokes in this film weren't as funny as the jokes in the first film, and I feel that one or two action sequences had a bit too much slapstick, but those are only minor gripes. I also thought that the film's third act was really exciting.It may not be perfect, but it's still a decent movie, so I'm gonna give Kung Fu Panda 2 **1/2 out of ****",7,0,1,24 June 2011
Hugo," As great a movie as it is an intensely personal one for Marty.
","Martin Scorsese made a family film? A wholesome one? And in 3D? GASP! Yes, believe it! Legendary director Martin Scorsese, best known for Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and The Departed, has made a terrific family movie out of Hugo.First shot of praise goes to the film's cast. A talented bunch of actors to behold, each of them giving it their best, even if some cameos may seem superfluous (Honestly, anything's better with the great Christopher Lee in it). The movie's main focus is that of young Asa Butterfield, nailing the character of Hugo. He gives a very convincing performance, and tremendous sparks fly between he and his co-stars, whether he's holding his own against the secretive Papa George (The terrific Ben Kingsley), outwitting the relentless Station Inspector (The hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen), or sharing an adventure with the eager Isabelle (The lovely Chloe Moretz).But this is still Marty's movie, and a very personal one for him. He and screenwriter John Logan have a delightful time dabbling in the history of film. Cinematic history practically courses through Scorsese's veins, and he infuses generous portions of his knowledge of cinema into the film. He excellently captures the spirit and nostalgia of old movies, movies that wowed audiences before technological advances in cinema (CGI, for example) were even thought possible. The film reaches more than a few levels of pure Cinema Paradiso inspiration. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for Marty, and you might also say it was even based on himself in several ways.On top of that, he's hired technical crew members who make the film look and sound incredible, no less than it deserved. Dante Ferretti's superb production design, and Sandy Powell's wonderful costumes are to die for. Bob Richardson's cinematography and Thelma Schoonmaker's film editing are pure aces, especially when showcasing the film's truly special effects. And Howard Shore writes a lovely, if sometimes over done, musical score complete with graceful piano and accordion motifs.**** out of ****",9,4,8,18 January 2012
Warrior," My emotional response to this movie was surprisingly strong.
","First of all, I'll get down to Warrior's script. The screenplay may be littered with clich√©s, but you know what? I don't care about any of that. Rather than pick apart predictability, I was practically amazed by how massive my emotional response to this movie was. Something in this movie manages finding sincerity.At the center of the script is the crippled relationship between two brothers. The movie's rousing strength comes from their relationship, and we don't root for one to beat the other in their tournament. Maybe we do, but I don't know. What we really want is for the two of them to reconcile. These roles needed serious life to get them off the ground, and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton prove they have enough emotion to match their bulky physiques. Not to be forgotten is Nick Nolte, taking what could have been a typical role in any other hands, and managing to give it deeper meaning.Finally, I must mention the editing. The film is a bit over long, but the work by the film's quartet of editors (Sean Albertson, Matt Chesse, John Gilroy, and Aaron Marshall) is quite excellent. The film manages to find a consistent rhythm, whether it be showcasing the more subtle tactics of the characters and sub plots, or the more flashy styles of the brutal fight sequences, especially in the film's fight heavy second half.*** out of ****",8,1,4,18 January 2012
Salt," It's not perfect, but it's one the year's more ambitious films.
","This weekend, I got out to see Salt, a recent Summer action flick.In the film, Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a woman working for the Central Intelligence Agency, who is happily married to a German arachnologist. But Salt's world is turned upside down once a mysterious Russian man walks into the offices of the CIA with information. He states that Salt is a double agent for the Russians. This leads to steadily, and swiftly raising paranoia, none the least of which from fellow agent Ted Winters (Played by Liev Schreiber), and ONCIX agent, Peabody (Played by Chiwetel Ejofor). Salt proclaims she is innocent, but actions later in the movie seem to imply otherwise. Serious deceptions begin to cloud many serious truths, initiating a chain of events that places Russia, and the United States on a course of self destructive collisions.The plot of this movie is... kind of predictable, to be honest, and on top of that, a little reminiscent. You can kind of think it as a cross between The Fugitive, and the Bourne Identity, with a woman in the lead role normally played a man. There are lots of obvious Boom, boom, bangs! Gunfights, fistfights, car chases, and a couple of over the top, yet strangely awesome death scenes (Which of course, I won't go into detail about). But the movie is actually fun in its simplicity. The action is well staged, fast paced, pretty impressive, and expertly choreographed. It does help the movie.As does the cast. First bit of praise here goes to Jolie, who continues to prove that not only can she be a pretty capable dramatic actress, but she still knows a thing or two about how to be a sexy badass action star, and carries the film pretty damn well, might I add. Although, I could possibly imagine some people taking her performance for granted, simply because she only makes it look so easy. The rest of the cast such as Schreiber, Ejofor, and Daniel Olbrychski are pretty top notch.However, I must stress that Salt is a far from perfect movie. I think director Phillip Noyce could have seriously worked out some of the flaws of the movie, maybe even working some kinks out of Kurt Wimmer's script. Some things in the story feel pretty rushed, but it's balanced out by the good things about the movie, the last of which being the techs. The film's technical crew, such as DP Robert Elswit, film editors Stuart Baird and John Gilroy, Stunt coordinators Simon Crane and Wade Eastwood, and Sound Mixers Jeffrey Haboush, Scott Millan, Greg Russell and William Sarokin did their jobs fantastically.Simply put, I think I've found what will be one of my biggest guilty pleasures of the year. It's predictable, but the action is fun, and pacing is fast. And Angelina Jolie on her own, makes the movie worth a look.I give Salt **1/2 out of ****",6,1,4,23 August 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," Led by David O. Russell's strong writing and direction, Silver Linings Playbook is a powerfully acted, meaningful little movie.
","In 2010, director David O. Russell ended his six year absence, and returned to the big screen with his knock-out hit (No pun intended) The Fighter, which managed a grand total of seven Oscar nominations, including wins for actors Christian Bale and Melissa Leo. Flash forward two years later, and his next movie is up for a whopping eight nominations, also setting a record as one of the only movies to ever have nominations in all four acting categories. That movie is Silver Linings Playbook. I've been anticipating this one for months, ever since it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Let me just say it didn't disappoint.Inspired by Matthew Quick's book, Silver Linings Playbook follows Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), a man released from a stay in a mental institution after catching his wife cheating on him, and beating her lover to near death. He's staying with his caring and worrisome mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver), and his obsessive compulsive Eagles fan father (Robert De Niro). Pat is hopeful, despite a restraining order, that he'll be able to reconcile his marriage, and that's only one of the problems that are running around in his mind.As bad as Pat's problems are, he's got nothing on Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a recently widowed woman with whom Pat finds a kindred spirit. Tiffany strikes up a deal. If pat will compete in a dance competition alongside Tiffany, she'll deliver a letter to his wife explaining about his current situation.Much like our central character, the movie is understandably prone to certain mood swings, balancing out between personal drama and laces of dark humor. This is a very personal movie for Russell, known for his own history of off screen controversy. The ease with the dramatic pace of this movie, the issues of familial turmoil, our main character's quest to reconstruct his life, the well timed wit, and a whole slew of fascinating characters is only part of what's done excellently by Russell, who drew upon his own experiences and that of his own son in writing the script. The mental issues are met properly, but through Russell's eyes, we also get to witness the vices of many of the other characters here, which ensure that the movie never gets boring.Just as strong as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said of the man, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief role.But I know who you all really want to ask me about: Jennifer. Lawrence. I can say absolutely nothing about her that hasn't already been said. She steals this movie, serving as that perfect match for Cooper. The best parts of this movie are when we get to see the irresistible chemistry between these two, and Lawrence sells them all convincingly. This is such a peculiar, but very warm, sincere, and charming performance. One of her strengths is how well she conveys Tiffany's emotion, but at certain times, she'll even play it up to convey several at one time. She has one specific scene in a diner that left me unsure of how to feel towards her. Pitying, tickled, intimidated, uncomfortable? It's not common when I find a performance like that that makes me feel so many different things all at once. Lawrence is far and away one of the best performances of the year!As such, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best movies of the year, allowing O. Russell to stretch his legs with a challenge, and unqualified success. It's a sweet and meaningful little movie that should resonate deeply with many a member of its audience. Now if only Ernest Hemingway would stop triggering such negative reactions...***** / *****",10,1,4,12 April 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," It kinda tries your patience, but David Fincher and Rooney Mara excel.
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is David Fincher's follow up to The Social Network. It had some serious hype behind it, and for the most part, lived up to it. The movie begins with promise in the form of a stellar opening credits sequence (They had me at Karen O.), and leads into a very unnerving two and a half hours of suspense and mystery.The movie has to juggle together the narratives of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. This type of back and forth cross cutting between the two is a bit on the uneven side, but when David Fincher's involved, such a thing can be expected, and forgiven. From head to toe, this is a Fincher film, and it's probably his most brutal film since Fight Club, so it's never an easy watch. He's enlisted expert crafts people that nail his style, including Jeff Cronenweth's brooding, sometimes claustrophobic cinematography, and a moody (if at times grating and overplayed) score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that works nicely in the film (Thanks more to Fincher and his music editor than the composing duo), but makes a hideous listen as a stand alone.Though I praise Fincher's direction, I still have issues with the script and with the pacing. I don't always think the script quite ties everything together as well as it should, but that may have a bit more to do with the editing. It's not that Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter's work is bad, In fact, it's actually good stuff. But the second hour of the film tends to drag, as does the ending, which goes on much longer than it needs to. I'm willing to be forgiving up to a certain point, but Fincher was really trying my patience.Oh well, you can at least say that it wasn't a wasted experience, if only because Rooney Mara is spectacular in this movie. She not only looks the part for Lisbeth Salander (complete with excellent makeup), she vanishes into the role. This character is troubled, sexual, intelligent, and completely scary. Mara manages to convey subtle, filtered emotions, also topped with the occasional humorous sprinkle, to the point that I forgot that she was even acting. Undoubtedly one of the best characters of 2011.*** out of ****",9,1,5,3 February 2012
The Intouchables," It's formulaic, but sincere.
","Inspired by a true story, The Intouchables follows the friendship between a rich man paralyzed from the neck down, and the man who aids him in his daily life. The story itself is not overly special, and it's been done better many times before, but the movie rises above the mostly standard quality thanks mainly to the rich chemistry between the two lead actors. Their interactions are strong, humorous, and sincere, much to the film's benefit. It's a feel good movie, and just as enjoyable as a feel good movie can be.**** / *****",8,0,1,12 April 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not as amazing as implied by the title, but still pretty thrilling and pleasantly romantic.
","Most would probably look to Chris Nolan's intense and morally complex The Dark Knight as the pinnacle of the superhero genre (which it arguably is), but if you ask me, the Spiderman films from quirky director Sam Raimi were what validated the genre in the first place. With an expert mix of sincere emotion, stylistic action, and just the right amount of Raimi's trademark goofiness, Spiderman and its superior sequel saw the genre at its most entertaining. After the disastrously disappointing Spiderman 3, it seemed like an odd move for Sony to reboot the series so quickly. But what the newly released The Amazing Spiderman may lack in the same creativity, it makes up for with heart and scale.Peter Parker is your not quite average high school kid. He struggles with bullies at school, his feelings for Gwen Stacy, and trying to figure out the secrets of his deceased father, a former scientist at Oscorp who worked with Dr. Curt Connors, a man trying to invent a serum that would restore the amputated limbs of many people, including his own arm. Searching for answers, he is bitten by a genetic spider that gives him superhuman abilities, and through a series of events that take place, Spiderman, as we now know him, is born... again. But it isn't long after Peter takes up his job as the masked webslinger that complications arise, becoming sought after by the NYPD as a vigilante, and facing off with Connors, whose serum has transformed him into the hideous Lizard.Look, it's hard not to compare this to Raimi's first Spiderman film, especially when it revisits a lot of the same plot points, but it still provides its own uniqueness on the hero. Fun, funny, and superbly realized, The Amazing Spiderman also drags occasionally, and leaves several loose ends that may frustrate some viewers, or maybe just leave them scratching their heads. Action is also surprisingly spread out in light doses, but thankfully so in how it lets the story flow so smoothly. Marc Webb, director of the sleeper hit (500) Days of Summer, wouldn't appear to be the obvious choice for this movie, but you really begin to understand why he was chosen as the movie moves along.At the core of this movie is the irresistible love story between Peter and Gwen, delicately played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. This movie was what apparently led to the two stars becoming a real life couple, and it's easy to see why, because they share chemistry that makes the love feel genuine. The acting is uniformly good, from Garfield and Stone especially. The supporting performances from Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, and Martin Sheen are excellent, although I can't help but wish they'd have given Leary and his character George Stacy, Gwen's father and a captain of the NYPD, more on screen time.Technically, the film is excellent. The editing, though occasionally sluggish, is still carefully handled by Alan Bell and Pietro Scalia. The effects supervised by Jerome Chen are pretty stellar, and Shannon Mills and Addison Teague provide creative and robust sound effects. Prepare to be blown away by composer James Horner, who gives us his greatest musical score since that of Titanic, a thematically rich and proudly old fashioned throwback complete with a heroic, and memorable main theme. It truly is spectacular, barely surpassing Danny Elfman's music for Raimi's movies in the process.In short, though it's really not something I'm encouraging anyone to look too deeply into, did we really need this movie so soon after the originals? Maybe we didn't, but for what it is, you can't fault it for not quite living up to high expectations when it still is pretty entertaining. Not as amazing as the title may imply, but close enough.**** / *****",8,10,20,23 October 2012
No Strings Attached," It's cute, it's just not cute enough.
","In the film, Ashton Kutcher plays Adam, a stand by assistant for a TV show who, after finding out his dad is dating his ex-girlfriend, calls up all the women on his phone until someone agrees to sleep with him. The next day, he passes out naked on the couch in a home of his once Summer camp friend Emma (Played by Natalie Portman). She's a medical resident in L.A. who's overly frightened of the concept of a real relationship. Together, the two of them create a system for themselves to use each other for sex at any time, until one of them falls for each other.I wanted to like No Strings Attached more than I actually did. It's not terrible, but I really think there was so much untapped potential. First problem with the film is the script and tone. The film can't decide whether it wants to be a serious romance, or a silly, sometimes raunchy Rom-Com. The serious bits are probably the more interesting, but the film just flip flops from charming to dull too often.The only real glimmer of hope is Natalie Portman. Emma is not that well written a character, but someone as energetic and charismatic as Portman brings full enjoyability out of it. It's hard to keep your eyes off of her in any scene she's in. However, despite moments of sentimental chemistry between her and Kutcher, the romance feels contrived, and not much of the other cast are that great. Even talents like Kevin Kline and Olivia Thirlby can't bring much out of their inconsistently written characters.Overall, No Strings Attached is not that great, but as a date night popcorn flick... you're still probably better off choosing something else.I give it ** out of ****",5,4,7,14 July 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Visually dazzling, and outrageously energetic. Die hard video gamers will especially have a fun time.
","The film centers on Scott Pilgrim (Played by Michael Cera), the bass guitarist for a band, and an overall slacker living with his gay roommate Wallace (Played by Kieren Culkin). His life is suddenly turned upside down when he falls in love with the mysterious Ramona Flowers (Played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Not only does he face the problem of currently dating a clingy teen four years his junior (Played by Ellen Wong), but in order to date Ramona, he must battle, and defeat her seven evil exes (Played by the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, and Brandon Routh), and along the way learns how to be a less selfish person.It's not hard to see why the film, based on the series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, might turn some away. The novels' built in fan base will love the film I imagine, but it might be pretty divisive to those who aren't familiar with the source material, this includes myself. As for the overall product, I loved it.The film is directed by Edgar Wright, who you may remember best for directing truly original, energetic, and hilarious comedies like Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. Like those two, he does this film beautifully. The comedy is wonderful, his direction is great, and he makes this film a visual and audial spectacle. He smartly presents the film in the style of video games, making great use of graphics, and audio, as well as providing some inspired sight and sound gags. Unlike myself though, it could prove exhausting to some, even to the point of Terry Gilliam exhausting, but Wright knew full well what he wanted to make, what he wanted the tone to be, and he hit it right.As for the talent, I do think Michael Cera is getting majorly typecast in this sort of geek role, but he does a good job and provides some good laughs, and fans of his will be surprised by how much ass he kicks. Mary Winstead's character, and performance is great. She adds some clever nuances to her performance, and the mystery of her character makes her all the more interesting. The rest of the cast which includes Kieran Culkin, Ellen Wong, Anna Kendrick, Allison Pill, and the exes who I won't list individually, are fantastic as well, and get some great laughs.Now for the action. There are a few directors who do action better than Wright, but there's no one who does action quite like him. He's simply a master of scene build up, and pacing, and how he shoots the film, matched with the brilliant efforts of his film editors Johnathan Amos and Paul Machliss is simply inspired. Every cut, every transition, every change in frame rate is a pure masterstroke of ambition for a film that is fast paced, hilarious, visually stunning, exhilarating, and brimming with great talent in spite of the film's few imperfections.Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is one of the year's finest films, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9,6,19,18 September 2010
Bridesmaids," Superbly acted, believably scripted, and delightfully vulgar: all in one.
","Today, I got out to see Bridesmaids, a raunchy female-driven comedy that stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, a woman in her 30's, living in Milwaukee, and crumbling under personal crises. She's gone through a bad break up, has been forced to shut down her bakery, and has also been chosen by her recently engaged best friend, Lillian (Played by Maya Rudolph), to be the maid of honor at her wedding, but due to this wedding, Annie fears that she may lose the one relationship she's been clinging desperately to, and along the way, discovers that she needs to get her own priorities in line.Director Paul Feig, and especially screenwriters Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig delight in blending real human flaws and quirks with gross out gags and snappy one-liners, while still being able to retain control of character development. The movie is very sweet and thoughtful, and it's also the funniest movie I've seen this year, so far, even if not everything in the picture works. It has a slight tendency to drag, and a hit or miss romance subplot between Annie and an Irish cop.But where would this movie be without its great ensemble cast? One of the main cast standouts is obviously Wiig. She gives it her all in a quirky, and quietly subtle performance that holds the whole movie together. She proves she's got lead star chops to spare, so I'll be waiting in line for her next movie.Not to be forgotten is co-cast standout, Rose Byrne, who plays Lillian's rich, over preparing friend, Helen, with whom Annie is constantly competing with, and whenever Byrne takes the stage, she doesn't disappoint.Then there's Melissa McCarthy, who earns some of the biggest laughs in the movie as Megan, the raunchy sister of Lillian's fianc√©. They're just the tipping point of a great cast that also includes Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, as well as the final film appearance of Jill Clayburgh. These cast members give it their best, and Bridesmaids benefits immeasurably from that.I'm gonna give it *** out of ****",8,1,3,14 July 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It's overlong, but it's still true to the spirit of what made Middle Earth so enchanting in the first place.
","It's been nine years since Peter Jackson ended his epic retelling of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga, which in its lifetime garnered billions of dollars in worldwide gross, and won a combined total of 17 Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Return of the King. The whole trilogy is a collective success that is one of the few cinematic achievements that I would ever consider as perfect. Flash forward to the present day, and we now take a trip back to Middle Earth with The Hobbit, the prequel to the trilogy. Originally slated to be split into two sections and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, Jackson later took the helm, and decided to split the book into a trilogy like that of The Lord of the Rings. While this may sound quite excessive, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey mostly justifies the viewing experience. Mostly...Set sixty years prior to The Fellowship of the Ring, An Unexpected Journey sees a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, excellently filling the shoes of Ian Holm) in his life in the Shire. He is approached by the grey wizard Gandalf (Played once more by the terrific Ian McKellen) on aiding him and a band of thirteen dwarfs on a quest to their home on the lonely mountain, where they plan to reclaim it from the treasure obsessed dragon Smaug. Bilbo is understandably apprehensive to go on the perilous travel, but the adventurous spirit proves too hard to resist, and the band of fifteen begin their long journey. Only took 'em forty minutes to get to that point.I can certainly echo the sentiment that this movie is excessive in both its content and length, clocking in at about 2 hours and 45 minutes. In the movie's defense, I can't recall a single moment where I was ever bored. Sure, the overload of material does keep the movie from reaching the massive heights of its predecessor, but this is a project that deserves to be judged on its own strengths rather than those based on comparison. The movie still stays true to the spirit of what made Middle Earth such an engrossing world in the first place. Those who criticize the movie for being a bit more weighty in tone than it needs to be may have a point, but I think that helps in keeping consistency with the tones of the previous films.If one thing can be made sure of, Jackson clearly hasn't lost a step when it comes to visual splendor. He rallies together the same talented craft crew that he worked with before, including DP Andrew Lesnie, Production Designer Dan Hennah, Makeup Designer Richard Taylor, Composer Howard Shore, and Visual Effects Supervisor Joe Letteri. All of these people perform their work to the highest caliber possible, hardly ever missing a beat during the epic set pieces, dazzling environments and towns, and the sweeping views of the terrain. Nine years later, and Middle Earth is still as enchanting as it ever was.I haven't even gotten into the talent that goes in front of the camera. I've already mentioned how good Freeman and McKellen are. The Dwarfs are all quite entertaining, some more than others, even though they mostly blend together. If you're looking for some more veteran cast members besides McKellen, you'll find them as well, including the likes of Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving. Even Gollum, played to perfection once more by Andy Serkis, gets to make an appearance. What more can I say about him that hasn't already been said. He shows up in what is without doubt the best scene in the whole movie. A sequence where he and Bilbo engage in a high stakes game of riddles, all set within the dimly lit catacombs of his lair. The foreboding sound and creepy imagery all work wonderfully in raising the tension of the situation.Not everyone will enjoy The Hobbit, however. It asks a lot of patience, perhaps more than it should be, and I feel that something with a slightly simpler script and trimmed running time would have allowed it to be the amazing prequel it deserved to be. Judging it by what it is, though, there wasn't much detriment to my enjoyment of this movie. Besides, it's unfair to judge only a portion of a full movie, much in the same way of the original Lord of the Rings films. I'll gladly tune in to the next two chapters yet to be released.**** / *****",8,7,15,11 January 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The story is solid. The visual effects great. And Andy Serkis is tremendous.
","Based on the long running Planet of the Apes franchise, the film stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer 's disease. The experiment ends in tragedy, but there's still hope, in the form of an incredibly intelligent chimpanzee that he adopts, and names Caesar. Several years later, Will's experiments are working well, but Caesar attacks a man in his neighborhood, and he is locked in an ape sanctuary, wherein his whole world is turned upside down, and in secret, he plots revolution.This is a really stylish, solid action movie. Much to thank for that is director Rupert Wyatt's even tone and pace, and a sense of excitement that never overbears the audience. It really takes what it's doing seriously, and never loses that strong emotional core. But it isn't perfect. Notable faults include the fact that the film falters whenever focusing on a romance subplot between James Franco and Frieda Pinto, the latter of whom has near nothing to do in the film.Still, for whatever conceptual problems it has, it makes up with its aesthetics. The action sequences, what well used few there are, are quite exciting, and I was also unsurprised to learn that the film was shot by one of my favorite DPs, Andrew Lesnie. Job well done.The biggest praise I must make are for two things.1: The Visual Effects designed by the one and only Weta Digital of Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The apes are completely convincing, and the motion capture technology is put to great use.2: Caesar being the best character in the film. We're fooled into thinking he's a real being, and he really submerges us into his emotional state, something that the film benefited from big time. For the rest of the year, you can expect to hear me giddily singing the praises of Andy Serkis, who gives us another one of his fantastic motion capture performances, and adds another character to his roster alongside Gollum, and King Kong.While not perfect, Rise of the Planet of the Apes provides solid entertainment, and I give it *** out of ****",8,1,2,11 August 2011
Django Unchained," It's pure Tarantino. And if that's what you love, then you're bound to have a blast here.
","Equally loved and hated for his indulgent stylistics, Quentin Tarantino is the proper definition of an auteur. Often regarded for classics like Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino specializes in a unique visual identity, and his signature long conversations that showcase his writing. I can only speak for myself, but no one writes dialogue better than he does. After flirting with spaghetti western undertones in Basterds, it seemed only obvious that his next would be a full on, gritty western. However, the question still remained: Would it translate well to the screen? Let's put it this way. If you're not a fan of his style, this won't change your mind. If you are a fan, you'll probably have a blast with Django Unchained.We open in the 1850's, where German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) purchases the freedom of a slave named Django (Jame Foxx). Schultz teaches Django - the D is silent ‚Äì the ways of bounty hunting, and the two ride into various towns killing wanted criminals. In exchange for helping him with this job, Schultz offers to help Django find his missing wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is currently in the possession of the unpredictable land and slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).If you've seen any of Tarantino's other films, you know what you can expect here. He is very indulgent in his own stylistics, supplying the movie with over the top humor, anachronistic music, and a slight air of silliness to it. Needless to say, it's not perfect... but, that's why I love it so much. The movie's imperfections are its charms, and even if I have a few nit-picks, criticizing Tarantino for indulgence would be like criticizing the winter for being cold. I adore the direction he was going for this movie, and the overall tone and technical prowess offers much to be admired.As always, Tarantino's writing is the highlight. Once again, he uses his extended conversations well, building up the tension of each one to hold one's attention. You can never predict when a character may go flying off the handle, and what that may entail. Tense, character rich, and gritty, the movie also fully delves into the issues of racism with uncompromising detail. Tarantino also finds a way to mix in well placed humor, with an argument over white hoods that made me ache with laughter. The movie is pretty long, about 2 and three quarter hours, but it's surprisingly easy to sit through until it's over. It's certainly one of the most entertaining movies I've watched all year.The cast is equally impressive, all selling the traits and personalities of their characters. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz are both impressive, cool, and share an easy chemistry, Waltz in particular selling much needed comic relief. Samuel L. Jackson, a Tarantino staple, gets to steal the scene as Calvin Candie's seedy and suspicious right hand man Stephen. Then we get down to Leonardo DiCaprio. For a long time, DiCaprio has been an actor who really seemed to take himself too seriously when it came to roles. Here, he gives probably his best performance since The Aviator. It's so much fun seeing him play such a delightfully wicked and viciously comical villain, providing him with the dramatic break that was perfect for him. He's chewing the scenery, and having a blast with it.Like I said, this is not a perfect film, but it is pure Tarantino. Those who love that will eat it up, while others may not get too into it. The fact still remains that Django Unchained is constantly entertaining, varying on the eye of the beholder, of course. One of the year's best. Adult supervision is required...***** / *****",10,1,4,11 January 2013
Drive," A nail biter of a thriller. Gosling and Refn knock it out of the park.
","I recently lent my attention to Drive, an art-house thriller from director Nicolas Winding Refn. And yes, in case you were wondering, it really is that good. Drive is outstanding.Ryan Gosling plays Driver (His real name is never revealed in the film), a man who works as a car mechanic and Hollywood stunt driver by day, but by night, moonlights as a getaway guy. He gives his clients a five minute window, and carries no weapons. 'I drive' as he puts it. Across the hall from him is that of Irene (Played by Carey Mulligan), and her young son, leading him to help them out, and forcing him to suppress feelings he's developed for Irene. But Irene's husband (Played by Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, and sought after by criminals who force him to complete one last job for them, enlisting Driver's help, and sending everything afterward into a spiral.Let me say this: There's a reason that Refn won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. Obviously, what he does with actors and story building is quite strong, but the atmosphere and ambient sounds do just as much storytelling as the former two do. He paints a violent, chilling portrait that places an emphasis on tension, and even the sense of paranoia. He does this, along with the lens of DP Newton Thomas Siegel, the interesting cuts and dissolves of editor Mat Newman, and particularly well staged driving sequences, to involve the audience as much as he is involved, none more attention grabbing than a very well handled scene in an elevator.As for the story, - adapted from the James Sallis book - it's also an essential to the mood. Something in the film is always up, something always feels off. Whether it's the action of a character looking over their shoulder, or a bit of improvisation of one actor to keep another on edge and at the ready, the actions feel legitimate.Ryan Gosling gives a no holds barred performance as Driver. His quiet expressions give off a deceptive, perplexing facade to something that's boiling with emotion. Emotion is there, it's just not incredibly obvious. The penetrating glimpse of Gosling's eyes and what his character must be thinking conveys a very fascinating side of him that you might not expect.It's also worth nothing the rest of the cast. Carey Mulligan shines as Irene, as well as flawlessly hiding her British accent. Bryan Cranston, as Driver's mentor, manages to get a sense of warmth across. Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman do well with their supporting roles, while Christina Hendricks achieves solidity with her small cameo. But let's not forget Albert Brooks, cast as far away from type as humanly possible as crime boss, Bernie Rose. His subtle stance manages to hide a darkly intimidating persona chilling enough to make yours truly gulp.All this praise aside, Drive can be polarizing. Either you'll love it in a big way, or you'll probably be turned off by a lot of it. As for me, I'll be looking forward to giving the film a couple more looks.As expected since the start, I'm giving Drive **** out of ****",10,5,10,7 October 2011
Cars 2," It has problems, but it delivers an action packed, comedic punch.
","his is a sequel to the first film from the masterminds at my favorite animation studio, Pixar. The film has recently been receiving a huge wave of negative criticism, and it's the first Pixar film that has ever received a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.It takes off five years after the events of the first film, with Lightning McQueen (Voiced by Owen Wilson) now a winner of four Piston Cups. So, he is invited to the first annual World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car, and to advertise a new brand of alternative fuel. He invites his friend Mater along, and while Lightning is racing in the tournament, Mater (Voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) gets swept up in a case of international espionage. He's mistaken for an American spy by a sleek, British Intelligence agent named Finn McMissile (Voiced by Michael Caine), and an agent in training named Holley Shiftwell (Voiced by Emily Mortimer), two cars seeking to bring down a plot to take over the world by a league of old fashioned, more broken down cars.The recent reception mentioned earlier had made me a bit gloomy, as I'd hoped I'd never have to see Pixar make a bad movie. And you know what? While it's worth noting that it's their worst film, and isn't among the ranks of WALL¬∑E, Ratatouille, or Finding Nemo, I was incredibly relieved that, personally, I still haven't had to see Pixar make a bad movie. I think it's just as enjoyable as any of their other movies.This is Pixar's second stab at a full on, fast paced action film (The first of which was The Incredibles), and the movie is highly gleeful in its 1960's spy movie tone and stylistics. The plot is like an animated twist on a James Bond film, right down to the cool cars and gadgets, international jumping between scenic locations, even the film's villain, Professor Zundapp, delightfully based on the foreign, scientific masterminds of the James Bond series. That, and Finn McMissilie is clearly an homage to Bond, himself.I do think it slightly lacked the same stellar character development we usually expect from Pixar, and sometimes it feels a little too crowded, but I think Cars 2 has a lot of charming factors that propel it. The action is really exciting, the movie moves briskly, and it's filled with so many hilarious gags. I especially admire the voice-over performances, which also includes the likes of John Turturro, Thomas Kretshmann, Eddie Izzard and Joe Mantegna.The technical side of the film is also utterly amazing. I need not bring up the animation, as anyone who's ever seen one of Pixar's movies would expect it to be of the highest quality, which it is. The sound design by Tom Myers will surely go down as one of the year's best, and I would be a fool not to mention composer Michael Giacchino's thrilling mixture of John Barry and surf guitar. And while 3D is a polarizing factor for movies, I think it really added to the excitement of this one.And now, while I go anxiously await Pixar's next feature film, Brave, I'll most likely be back to the cinema once, or even twice more to give Cars 2 some richly deserved business.I give it *** out of ****",5,2,4,29 June 2011
Kick-Ass," Fun, energetic, and kicks major ass.
","The film is based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. It centers on Dave Lizewski (Played by Aaron Johnson), a kid who lives alone with his dad. In Dave's home town, crime runs amok, and thievery is everywhere you turn. So one day, Dave becomes a superhero. After a brief, but disastrous attempt to stop two men from stealing a car, he later saves a man's life. He names his altar-ego, Kick-Ass. He later meets Big Daddy (Played by Nicolas Cage), and Hit-Girl (Played by Chloe Moretz). They are two people looking for revenge against a crime lord named Frank D'Amico (Played by Mark Strong). Things get more complicated for Dave, not only having to balance his life, and his altar's life, but dealing with a new superhero arriving on the scene simply called Red Mist (Played by Christpher Mintz-Plasse), who is actually Frank's son in disguise.So, how do I describe this movie in four words, or less? Like this: Kick-Ass, KICKED ASS.The story is brilliant, inspired, and wonderfully realistic. It doesn't suffer from, nor do I remember it having the typical clich√©s of a normal superhero movie.So what about the performances? Excellent. Aaron Johnson was a great lead performer. Christopher Mintz-Plasse played a great role. Mark Strong, who seems to be typecast as villains, is pretty good with what he has. Then there's Nicolas Cage, who is stunning, and Chloe Moretz, who is a great deal of fun to watch.And the action? Edge of your seat awesome. The action and fight scenes are intense, gritty, and brutal. They have wonderful stunts, and fantastic pacing and film editing. All year long you can expect me to be singing the praises of Pietro Scalia, and his co-editors. The film is smart, hilarious, and thrilling to watch.If you haven't seen this film yet, go. You won't regret it.I give it *** out of ****.",8,5,13,25 May 2010
Lincoln," The tag team of director Steven Spielberg, star Daniel Day-Lewis, and screenwriter Tony Kushner equal a powerful examination of Lincoln's life.
","I've been eagerly anticipating this movie for months, and what wasn't there to look forward to? It's directed by Steven Spielberg, my favorite living director, as well as the director of my all time favorite movie Jurassic Park. It stars a magnificent cast, including Daniel Day- Lewis, one of my favorite actors, and it's written by Tony Kushner, the mind behind the masterpiece Angels in America. With all three of them working together, how could this go wrong? In short, it doesn't. Lincoln is among the best movies of 2012, and at least better than that horrid Vampire Hunter clone.The movie focuses entirely on the last few months of Lincoln's presidency. In this time, he seeks to put a stop to the Civil War, which has now begun its fourth year, but in doing so, he also hopes to pass the 13th amendment and abolish slavery. He has no problem with getting help within his own house, but he faces a challenge in convincing enough members of the Democratic Party to pass the bill. On the side, he's also facing troubles within his own family, specifically his oldest son wanting to enlist in the Union.That may seem fairly standard for a biopic, but the movie manages to transcend that. It's a character study and commentary that gets down to its issues with aplomb. This is some of Steven Spielberg's best direction, wisely dialing down the sentimentality, and allowing for a more refined, procedural, and organic presentation. Even his usual craftspeople tone down their own style, much to the film's benefit. The way Spielberg handles actors is always a highlight as well, with a large cast of fantastic character actors that makes finding a standout among the supporting players tedious. None are better than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Virtually unrecognizable, and comfortably slipping into the emotion of the character like a pair of shoes, he gives another incredible performance to add to his already strong portfolio.Then we get down to Tony Kushner, whose screenplay is the final necessary piece of this beautiful puzzle. He manages to get right into the head of Lincoln, his familial troubles, and his personality traits, and strongly examines the racial issues and bipartisanship without glossing over them. There are a lot of long conversations in this movie, and Kushner does well to make sure that they're never boring. He deserves kudos for the riveting dialogue, and the appropriate doses of humor, but just as much thanks ought to go to Editor Michael Kahn and his fantastic pacing. The ending does seem a bit too long, but considering everything that came before it, I'm willing to forgive and overlook such a thing. The movie is a brilliant look into history, and a definitive representation of who Lincoln was as a person. Recommended without hesitation.***** / *****",10,4,10,11 January 2013
Brave," Brave represents a huge rebound for Pixar. Die-hard fans, prepare to be unsurprisingly amazed.
","When thinking of the best animated movies, one's mind always flashes immediately to the Pixar filmography. Since 1995 with the first Toy Story, they've been charming audiences with wonderful movies like Finding Nemo, Up, and WALL¬∑E (the latter being one of my all time favorite movies). And after a recent critical lashing to Pixar's previous Cars 2, and a year of waiting impatiently, I was given a chance to finally see their latest movie Brave.Consider me stunned, and unsurprisingly so! Breathe a sigh of relief fellow movie-goers. Brave is not only the year's absolute best movie so far, and Pixar's best movie since WALL¬∑E, it's also the best animated movie in years.In ancient Scotland, Princess Merida, a skilled and tough as nails archer, grows tired of her daily life. Finding the age old customs enforced by her mother restricting, she decides to go against the traditions of her royal history, refusing to take a husband from the oldest son of one of three lords from other clans, causing controversy due to her series of actions. Seeking to change her fate, Merida receives a spell from a reclusive forest witch, but by doing this, unleashes a terrible ancient curse, and now must discover the true meaning of bravery, and make things right.As is expected of any Pixar movie, there is a strong investment to story, with plenty of spectacularly memorable characters, strongly developed and realized sub plots and arks, and a lot of great humor (only a few jokes briefly overstay their welcome). Another interesting element of the movie is the fascinating magical side to it. Co-writer and director Brenda Chapman based the story partly on her love of fairy tales by Hans Christian Anderson, and the wonderful fairy tale aspects of the movie work very well in the film's favor. Sure, it may not be Pixar's most original premise, but it still hits all the right marks.But beneath all that is also genuine emotion, and the most potent emotional element is the troubled relationship between Merida and her mother. Aside from fairy tale lore, Chapman also based most of the story on how she raised her own daughter, and the relationship between mother and daughter is one that evokes so much heart, made all the more better by the voice overs of the great cast, including Kelly MacDonald, Emma Thompson, and Billy Connolly. MacDonald and Thompson give so much in voicing Merida and her mother, and that makes the heart of this movie all the more special. I'll admit that by the time all was said and done, I was starting to cry.Lastly, it cannot be understated how much a thing of beauty Brave is. Dazzlingly designed and realized, the sweeping and jaw dropping animated Scottish environments are among some of the best production design I've ever seen for an animated movie. Not to mention how perfectly the characters are animated. From the fearless expressions of Merida, to the hideous and menacing bear Mor'Du, everyone is all as they should be. Brave is also a movie that sounds terrific, with a catchy and lovely Celtic score by Patrick Doyle (This is the best music in any Pixar movie since Finding Nemo), and detailed sound design from the great Gary Rydstrom.I cannot sing Brave's praises enough, and I'm already eager to watch it again! It's first movie of 2012 to receive the highest possible score I give out.***** / *****",9,32,62,22 June 2012
Clash of the Titans," Sam Worthington goes from great Avatar, to Titan sized bland.
","The film is based on the original 1981 film directed by Desmond Davis. The film centers on Perseus (Played by Sam Worthington), the mortal son of the Greek god Zeus (Played by Liam Neeson). Perseus is raised as a fisherman, but years later, his family is killed by Zeus' nefarious brother, the god of the underworld, Hades (Played by Ralph Fiennes). Perseus discovers that it is his destiny to defeat Hades, and prevent him from destroying mankind by unleashing the Kraken. He takes a band of soldiers on a journey to defeat the Kraken, and prevent Hades from overthrowing Zeus, and destroying mankind.So, what did I think of the film you may ask? My answer: Mediocre.The story is one that has potential, but came across as cheesy, and sloppily done. You'd think an action movie based on Greek mythology, filled with tons of visual effects, and huge ass monsters would manage to hold one's interest for almost two hours. But the way the editing just went from sluggish to rushed, sluggish to rushed, had me wanting this movie to end after 45 minutes.The inconsistent pacing, and unspecial screenplay with cringe-worthy dialogue aside, what really made me drowsy was the characters. The performers just didn't seem to really care, or try. Sam Worthington, who was great in Avatar, is almost completely bland in this one. It doesn't seem like he's traveling across Greece defeating monsters. It's like he's walking down an aisle of Whole Foods looking for soy chips. However, Fiennes and Neeson were great, as usual, and the only two cast members who didn't seem bored.The movie itself made me want them to just rush to Neeson saying 'Release the Kraken!' or see the next action sequence. The action is lacking through the first three quarters in the movie. But, there is a fight scene later in the movie with Medusa which was awesome. It's fast paced, and never loses interest. And the Kraken sequence was absolutely astonishing. The action and visuals in that scene were magnificent.Howver, the rest of the visuals in the movie aren't THAT creative, and aren't that special. Any monsters or settings in the movie that aren't Medusa, and the Kraken, are poorly realized by sub par effects animation.If the movie could have been on equal quality to those two awesome action sequences I mentioned earlier, I definitely think it would have been better. But, that's not the case.I give it ** out of ****",4,0,1,25 May 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," 2011 starts on a solid note, with plenty of thrills and intellect to go around.
","Last year, I started 2010 with Martin Scorsese's fantastic Shutter Island. Now 2011 has come, and I'm starting the cinematic year off with The Adjustment Bureau. While I don't think it's a perfect movie, I will say this much: It is a rock solid movie with thrills and intellect to spare.Matt Damon stars as David Norris, a New York congressman running for senate. After a huge loss, he has a chance encounter with a mysterious woman (Played by Emily Blunt), a woman who after another chance meeting is revealed to be named Elise. But unbeknownst to David, he was only supposed to meet her once, as part of a grand plan by an entity of black suited overseers. But David decides to challenge his destiny by pursuing Elise, but doing so is an action that could not only destroy his personal ambitions, but Elise's as well.The screenplay by first time director George Nolfi is an interesting one, and delivers serious food for thought on the concept of challenging fate, and the consequences of one's actions and deviations. Nolfi proves he has talent as a director, as he not only keeps a firm grasp on characterization, stages the action sequences well, or knows when to let the cinematography by John Toll, or musical score by Thomas Newman do the storytelling, but he also never strays far from proper structure, tone, and pace.The movie moves quickly, the conversations are interesting, and the ensemble cast, specifically that of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's perfect chemistry, is terrific. It is worth noting that certain elements of the film can get confusing, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but I'd be lying to myself if I said I wasn't enthralled by those 100 minutes. Plus, I have to give praise to Kasia Walicka-Maimone for the film's inventive costumes.It may not be perfect, but I'm very satisfied to have kicked off 2011 with The Adjustment Bureau.I give it *** out of ****",8,2,4,8 March 2011
Friends with Benefits," It's like No Strings Attached, but it's much better.
","A couple days ago, I was lucky enough to attend an early screening of the new romantic comedy, Friends With Benefits.In the film, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis play Dylan and Jamie. Dylan is a businessman in LA recruited to work for GQ magazine in New York, and Jamie is a co-worker who shows him the ropes or New York. They're both just getting out of shaky relationships, and have become fed up with the concept of true love. While mocking the typical rom-com clich√©s of a movie they watch one night. They decide to make a plan to add sex to their friendship, with the intention that it doesn't lead to complications. But, as clich√© would have it, adding sex to friendship does lead to complications between Dylan and Jamie.The movie has kind of the same idea as No Strings Attached, a movie released earlier in the year, and even though we did not need two of these movies, I will say Friends With Benefits is a better movie. It's not great, it's just that I found No Strings Attached to be so dull, Friends With Benefits just gets more things right.The screenplay is pretty straightforward, but I liked how it would poke fun at the clich√©s of romantic comedies, and then would use those for its comedic advantage later on. The movie is predictable, and it goes on a little longer than it needs to, but that was something I could overlook, because the film had me laughing the whole way through.At the very least, the cast is right. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are hilarious in the movie, and they share great, and sometimes steamy chemistry. They both have a bit to be desired, but their charm, especially that of Kunis, makes that forgivable. There are also some laugh out loud supporting roles by Patricia Clarkson and Woody Harrelson, and a brief, but awesome cameo by Emma Stone in the film's first few minutes.But the movie does still tend to shake in tone, and every so often, there's a rare joke that doesn't work.Friends With Benefits is ALMOST a good movie, but it'll sadly have to settle at **1/2 out of ****, subject to change upon possible rewatch.",7,2,7,22 July 2011
Puss in Boots," The slick feline manages to carry his own movie in high fashion.
","Arguably the most popular character of the long running Shrek franchise, it was inevitable that Puss in Boots would receive a movie of his own. To the wrong hands, this could have been a monetary gain, but qualified loss, but the slick feline makes every second of his movie count.While still staying true to the storybook characters and ideologies of the earlier Shrek films, Puss in Boots is actually a very inspired deviation, being that it plays out more like a spaghetti western rather than a fairy tale. It may not be as wacky or surreal as Rango, but it has an undeniable charm, and one that's honestly a little more easy to digest. Antonio Banderas, as always, is smooth, witty, and charismatic as our nine lived lead hero, but also conveying an honest emotion beneath, especially when the attention is turned onto the old friendship between Puss and Humpty Dumpty.About 20 minutes through the film, it takes a slow turn from the quick paced, action packed side of things, and builds up a fascinating back story between the two (This sequence takes up about ten whole minutes, but man, it's so good). This friendship is where the movie's emotional core lies, and Humpty Dumpty (Excellently voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is one great character.But not everything in the movie works. The character of Kitty Softpaws (Voiced by Salma Hayek) is a rather flat one, and I never really bought her romance with Puss. There's also a twist near the end of the film which feels kinda obvious. But at the very least, this is a well done and constructed movie, with beautifully composed animation and camera-work, thrilling action scenes, and to add to all this, Henry Jackman (Whose musical score is surprisingly pretty awesome) clearly channels the great Ennio Morricone, complete with gorgeous Latin Salsa rhythms, and sweeping choirs.*** out of ****",8,3,4,3 February 2012
The Artist," Thoroughly enjoyable, and mightily ambitious, it's worthy of the applause.
","When The Artist premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, it opened to an enthusiastic reception that continued to spread over to the U.S. Now hat I see it, it isn't hard for me to see why it's been bringing audiences to their feet, and claiming Best Picture awards left and right.The Artist was a passion project for director Michel Hazanavicius. He'd long wanted to make a film inspired by the black & white silent movies of the 1920's and early 30's. There's barely any audible dialogue or sound effects in the whole film besides music. The movie's first ambient sound effects aren't heard until half an hour through the film, and they aren't followed by any more until a full hour later. This is where Hazanavicius specifically lets his writing and direction take center stage.Some may call it incredibly flashy, but I actually find the direction to be quite subtle. Co-working as both a director and film editor, Hazanavicius paces the movie at the exact rate it always needs. He pieces together his excellent cast's performances with style, and knows when to make a quick cut, whether it be to another person or an inter-title. But he also knows when to slow things down, to let the audience absorb the detail of the film, such as the pleasant cinematography and lovely costumes, and to let a shot go uninterrupted and let Ludovic Bource's elegant, if not always so subtle, musical score do the storytelling. This is a thematically and technically excellent score, as Bource relishes in the lightly romanticized and melodramatic orchestrations inspired by those from the golden age of Hollywood.What Hazanavicius ultimately excels at best is his terrific cast. There's a whole slew of outstanding performances in this picture that perform perfectly, and manage to tell us almost a whole story without saying a single word: including great supporting roles by John Goodman, James Cromwell, and Penelope Ann Miller. Standout notices go to Jean Dujardin, whose natural charisma, sincerity, and incredible array of emotion in the role of George Valentin is enough to carry the whole film on its own. Berenice Bejo, on top of being so utterly beautiful, gives a masterstroke portrayal as the enthusiastic Peppy Miller, never uttering a single line, but charming us and placing us under an irresistible spell. As if that weren't enough, Uggie the dog, who plays Valentin's faithful pet, is the most adorable thing I've seen all year. Applause is most richly deserved.**** out of ****",10,11,18,3 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Enjoyably over the top. Just prepare to be insulted by the foulest of cop outs.
","Over Thanksgiving, I'm sure everybody had something to be thankful for. 'For what' you may ask? The final chapter of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2, that's what.Fans of the series - the films, and the books by Stephanie Meyer that they were based on - will be thankful that it ends in a way that will satisfy them, although they'll also be saddened that the series is now over. Those who hate the franchise will be thankful that it's all finally over. Bottom line: If you love the franchise, you're not going to be disappointed. If you can't stand it, this will not change your mind.Taking place immediately after Breaking Dawn Part 1 concluded, Bella Swan, after giving birth to her daughter Reneesme, has completed her transformation from human to vampire. She adjusts to her new life with her husband Edward and his family fairly quickly, but has trouble with the fact that her friend Jacob (a werewolf) has imprinted on Reneesme... it's creepy. Soap opera struggles have to wait, though. The Volturi, the high council of vampire law, is planning an attack against the child, fearing that it may pose a threat to their kind, and their secrecy. To protect Reneesme, the Cullens assemble allies to serve as witnesses in their defense.Like each of the other Twilight movies, the movie is ridiculous. The acting, action, and even the dialogue have tendencies to go over the top, and produce unintentional laughs. If you enjoy that sort of thing, this will suit you just fine. Still, this is the best looking film thus far. The photography is great, and considering Guillermo Navarro shot it, how could it not be?In addition to all of this, the acting is inconsistent between the stars, many of which seem to gradually accept just how ridiculous these movies really are. The fact still remains that there are so many characters to keep track of, that they can't, and it goes without saying that the supporting actors, three in particular, are more interesting than the three leads.Ashley Greene hits all the right notes as Alice, my absolute favorite character from the books. Billy Burke earns his place as series MVP, as Charlie Swan is the one character that every movie got exactly right. Still, Michael Sheen is the clear standout as Volturi leader Aro. You can see, plain on his face, he does not take this at all seriously, and he camps it up to levels of Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. What a delight he is.In Conclusion, I want to talk about one thing in this movie that rubbed me the wrong way. And here's where we get into major spoiler territory. If you don't care that the movie will be spoiled for you, feel free to read. If you haven't seen it, but you want to, I suggest you stop reading now. I would rarely go into such detail, but this one thing made me furious.So, before the climax of this movie begins, Alice (who has the power to see visions of the future) brings evidence that Reneesme will not be harmful to their species to Aro (who has the ability to read an individual's memories). It turns out that no evidence will sway Aro, so an epic battle of the Cullen vampires and the wolves against the Volturi begins. This is easily the best sequence the Twilight saga has ever given us. Epic, beautifully staged, and honestly very intense, this ten minute sequence alone was making this the best movie yet.And so, just as Aro is about to be killed, we cut back to him and Alice, with the two sides still standing off. It turns out that the whole battle was just a vision that Alice had, one that will happen should Aro attack. In short, this resolution is the most ridiculous, most frustrating, and most insulting cop out that you can imagine. How did these people think that could possibly work? Did they think no one would question it? That we'd just accept it? Well, newsflash! There is no way to accept it. There is no way to defend it, either.With all of that in mind, if you're just in the mood for a simple guilty pleasure, this one's not too bad. At least, for the most part it's not that bad. For me, everything was going good until that foolish twist.*** / *****",6,0,6,2 December 2012
Super 8," Reawakens the nostalgia of classic Spielberg.
","This movie's got my heartbeat running away. Beating like a drum, and it's coming your way. Can't you hear that. Boom ba-doom-boom. Boom ba-doom-boom, baby. Super 8. Boom ba-doom-boom. Boom ba-doom-boom, baby. Super 8.Now that that little tick is out of my system, let's get to the review.Super 8, writer/director J.J. Abrams' nostalgic love letter to vintage Spielberg, centers on a young boy named Joe (Played by Joel Courtney), who has recently lost his dear mother, and has a rocky relationship with his father, the local police deputy (Played by Kyle Chandler). He's part of a group of kids filming a home zombie movie to enter into a local contest. But their plans go awry when a mysterious train crash occurs, and the local government is sent in to keep things quiet. Eventually, disappearances happen across town, the culprit being a creature that barely anyone knows about.Abrams is very gleeful in the way he integrates these old styles of storytelling. And while the format is basic, he makes up for that with how he uses those elements. He likes to sprinkle in bits of humor and action, but the one thing I praise him for most is that he doesn't lose his focus. He makes sure there's a strong, beating heart beneath the surface. It's also worth noting that the movie's ending is the best ending I've seen all year, so far.What about the cast? They are exceptional. The teen actors and adult actors are quite good. Joel Courtney gives a very nuanced, quietly emotional performance as Joe, especially when acting alongside Joe's love interest, Alice, played gently, and terrifically by Elle Fanning. The chemistry between these two put the adorable rating off the charts.Technically, the film is also very well designed. The editing by Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon is right on the nose, and the VFX of Industrial Light ad Magic are quite lively. I have even higher praise for the sound. I was quite thrilled by the work of my two absolute favorite sound designers, the legendary Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom, and Michael Giacchino's John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith influenced score is enough to make one's heart soar.All in all, Super 8 is a wonderful experience, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,11 August 2011
Rio," A funny, hearty movie. The music is especially worthy of notice.
","What is it that drives audiences to a movie? Word of mouth? Arguably, yes. Box office intake? Rarely. Awards Buzz? Sometimes. But advertising is the main thing that drives audiences to a new movie. I must confess that Rio, today's film I'm reviewing, suffers from the same problem as the earlier released Paul, advertising that makes it look like crap. And even though it wasn't as good as Paul, Rio is a solid movie with heart and humor.It centers on the last male of his kind, a spix's macaw named Blu (Voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), currently in the ownership of a book shop keeper in Minnesota, who's brought by a Brazilian scientist to Rio De Jeneiro on the eve of Carnivale to mate with the fierce Jewel (Voiced by Anne Hathaway), the last female of the species. But they are kidnapped by smugglers who seek to sell them for countless amounts of money, but they escape into the jungle to make it back to their homes, and avoid the clutches of the smugglers' malicious cockatoo, Nigel (Voiced by cast standout, Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement).As far as plot goes, the movie's not that special. The film has a certain romantic adventure quality to it, blended with the signature humorous touches of Blue Sky Studios, the film's producers. Is it predictable? Yes, and it's a bit kiddy at times, but Rio makes up for that with it's emotional touch, impressive voiceovers, and wit. The film, with it's clever one-liners and droll sight and sound gags, quite often got a good chuckle from myself.I must also give praise to the crew who designed the film with the utmost technical quality possible. The movie looked and sounded great. The Blue Sky animators delivered a gorgeous multicolored palette, while Randy Thom did well with the film's sound effects and mix. But what ultimately sticks with me the most about Rio is the songs and score.The music makes great use of percussive beats, guitars and maracas that are are incredibly catchy, something that's apparent right when the movie begins. The film's composer is John Powell, fresh off an Oscar nomination for what I consider to be 2010's best movie score, and one of my new top ten favorite scores, How to Train Your Dragon, and Rio is yet another outstanding job, so don't be surprised if he makes my year end top five score lineup yet again.I may have some minor problems with it, but Rio's admirable story telling and movie making methods are enough reason for me to recommend it.I give it *** out of ****",7,5,8,25 April 2011
Limitless," Though not perfect, it dazzles thanks to Cooper, and a stylish visual tone.
","Truth be told, as I was writing this review, I was kind of drawing a blank of what to open with. Such may also be the case of an early dilemma of the lead character from my latest viewing, Limitless.Bradley Cooper plays Edward Morra, a New York writer who has hit a road block. Upon a chance meeting with an ex family member, he's given a mysterious pill (NZT, as it's called) that allows its user the brain activity of a super computer. Coming across a secret stash of the drug, Edward uses it to climb a long rope line of international business, placing him in the spotlight, both a good and a bad thing. Good, because it ensures him a huge fortune, celebrity, and his relationship with his girlfriend (Played by Abbie Cornish), but bad because it places him in the sight of criminals who seek to use the drug for their own foul purposes.To say that Limitless is perfect would be untrue, but it never claims to be. For what it is, it succeeds. It establishes a tone, is able to thrill and charm despite a sometimes uneven narrative, and really makes a lot from its ideas. Not everything in the screenplay is fully fleshed out, but the ambition behind the premise helps it rise above that.And as someone who's normally not a big fan of Bradley Cooper, I couldn't imagine him not doing this role. He's able to utilize a distinctive sense of charisma when need be, but also able to tone it down when dealing with stronger moments within the film. He's surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including co-stars Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro, and he blends with them nicely, making the most out of every situation.I also must make note of director Neil Burger's visual style. It kind of struck me like Michael Mann if he'd adopted the visual approach of Terry Gilliam. The editing really puts a lively pace into the film, and the special effects add a clever sense of atmosphere. Special mention has to go out to DP Jo Willems. Aside from the trippy, kinetic zoom-throughs of local environments, he shoots scenes where Edward isn't under the effects of the drug with a dark tint, but films scenes where Edward IS under the effects with a broad, bright color spectrum, adding an effective visual depth to a solid piece of popcorn entertainment......and if that's what you're looking for, then I give Limitless my recommendation with *** out of ****",8,1,1,30 August 2011
Les Mis√©rables," Both flawed and beautiful like the musical, the film adaptation of Les Mis is every bit as good as can be hoped for.
","27 years ago, Les Miserables began running performances in London and Broadway to significant acclaim and massive staying power. Written by Claude Michel-Schonberg, Alain Boublil, and Herbert Kretzmer, and based on Victor Hugo's classic novel, it is often considered to be the greatest musical of all time. You can see why adapting it to the screen would be a challenge of unheard expectations, and director Tom Hooper was who would eventually lead it there. In many ways, it's considerably different from the stage show itself, but is it for worse or for better?Les Miserables chronicles the life of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a man released on parole after nineteen years of imprisonment. After being taken in by a kindly priest, and treated with kindness that he'd never known before, he vows to change his ways by creating an honest life for himself. He has not gone by the name of Valjean for eight years. This does not go unnoticed, as he is relentlessly pursued by his former warden, Javert (Russell Crowe). It isn't until later, after Valjean makes a vow to the dying Fantine (Anne Hathaway), that Javert is on to Valjean, swearing to send him back to prison.Fantine is the epitome of all the heartbreak that is to follow within Les Miserables. Some would argue that her only massively great moment is her rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream', but there's more to it than that. This is such an emotional and moving portrayal, unselfish, and unflinching. She may not be in it for very long, but she leaves a lasting impression, and even if it did all come down to that one scene, so what? That one scene is enough. I thought I knew the song pretty well, but listening to Hathaway sing, I suddenly heard it in a brand new light. All the devastation and the sorrow come out in such a big way that I can't picture the person watching it without being moved. Hathaway's just that good.After Fantine succumbs to her illness, Valjean fulfills his vow to care for her daughter Cosette, taking her from the custody of the greedy town Innkeepers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). Nine years later, a student rebellion against the oppressive law of Paris is beginning. One of the fighters is Marius (Eddie Redmayne). By chance, Valjean is in town at that time, along with the grown Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). When Marius sees Cosette, it's love at first sight, but what Marius doesn't see is that his friend Eponine (Samantha Barks), is deeply in love with him, and is saddened that Marius does not return those feelings.For a story with as many complicated subplots as Les Miserables, it's a miracle that this movie turned out to be as coherent as it is. Since the film is a musical, the songs allow the film to get across more information than conventional dialogue. As for the singing, I applaud the decision to go for all live singing. By allowing the actors to perform the songs live for every take, the film adds much more realism to the situation, allowing the actors to focus more on their performance rather than keeping match with pre-recorded music. Unlike the musical, it doesn't necessarily sound 'pretty'. The singing here is much more gritty than what you'd hear out of the Broadway show, and that's what makes the songs so effective to the grim tone.As for the rest of the talent, I must mention Hugh Jackman, finally given the role that he deserves. Blending his strong physique with his incredible singing voice, he's finally putting all his acting chops front and center, letting emotion pour from this character in a career best performance. Amanda Seyfried is serviceable as Cosette. Eddie Redmayne elevates Marius above the rushed standards of the stage version, and Samantha Barks hits hard in her rendition of 'On My Own'. Cohen and Carter provide much of the riotous comic relief amidst the bleak nature of the rest of the film. Even Colm Wilkinson, who originated the role of Valjean in 1985, gets to make an appearance. As for Russell Crowe, his voice may not be great, but no one's voice here sounds 'pretty', so that's fine. Pretty monotone, but Javert has always called for a bit of monotone. I won't criticize him for his singing voice, but I will criticize his performance for bordering too close to robotic.As for Hooper's direction, I think criticism of his direction is blown considerably out of proportion, but none of it is without reason. He chooses some very odd and distracting aesthetic and pacing choices, and the close ups of the actors don't do the fabulous sets and costumes much favors, but I think the close ups do their job wonderfully. He may not have a unique visual voice, but his direction of the actors is strong. By using his close ups, he captures every ache and every passion. Hooper's direction is successful in that one regard.Les Miserables is about as good a film adaptation of a classic musical as possible. Even if you don't like the movie, you can see that everyone involved were proud of what they were doing, and that they so wanted this to be good. It's flawed, but beautiful, much like the musical it was based on. The musical took so many elements and wove them all together into one of the rare products that deserves to be labeled with the word 'masterpiece'. The movie doesn't quite reach that same level of excellence, but for something so sweeping and beautiful, it's as good a movie as anyone can hope for it to be.****1/2 / *****",9,3,5,11 January 2013
Thor," One of the most inspired superhero movies to come out in recent years.
","Since the Summer movie season is officially upon us, I'm very glad that it has started off with a bang with the release of the latest superhero movie Thor. Forgive me if I sound somewhat geeky during my review, because I just happened to really, really like this movie.It stars Chris Hemsworth as the powerful, but arrogant god of thunder Thor, a man who resides in the fantastic realm of Asgard ruled by his father, Odin (Played by Anthony Hopkins), who always seems to favor Thor over his more subdued brother Loki (Played with wry subtlety by Tom Hiddleston). After going against his father's wishes and unleashing a brief attack on an enemy colony (Including a virtually unrecognizable Colm Feore in fantastic makeup), he is banished from Asgard and sent to earth, where he's discovered by a team of scientists lead by the persistent Jane Foster (Played convincingly by Natalie Portman), and with her help seeks to reclaim his sacred hammer which holds his power, and return to his home.If you're familiar with his previous directorial pedigree, you'd swear that an action film based on a Marvel comic centered on Norse mythology would be the last project Shakespearean thespian Kenneth Branagh would be attached to, but thank God for this man. This movie is every bit as much a breath of fresh air as 2008's Iron Man.As you would expect, the film is exciting and quite funny, but what I find most fascinating is how Branagh establishes his own take on the superhero genre through his pacing and the direction of his cast. It's a bit hammy to be certain, but in a rather delightful way, because you can detect the doses of Shakespearean undertones that he infuses into the film. His cast is terrific, they're fully fleshed out, and they never take the film more seriously than it needs to be.The movie is also impeccably designed, boasting fantastic sets and costumes, marvelous visual effects, and inventive sound design by Richard King, fresh off an Oscar win for Inception, and hopefully on his way to another nomination.It is worth noting that the romance subplot is not always great, and there's a couple lines that unnecessarily provide further levity than need be, but I must commend Branagh for committing to this project, and for creating a movie that is entirely sure of itself, and entirely entertaining. Just be sure to stay for a special scene at the very end of the credits if seeing Jeremy Renner in a brief cameo as Hawkeye isn't enough to brace you for the upcoming Avengers feature in 2012.I give Thor *** out of ****",8,1,4,9 May 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Kathryn Bigelow's stellar direction, Jessica Chastain's superb performance, and wonderful technical design = The best of 2012.
","It's been three years since Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to ever win a Best Director Oscar for 2009's much acclaimed The Hurt Locker. While I really liked that film, I was never a huge fan of it. I preferred Inglourious Basterds and Avatar, so sue me. So when it was announced that Zero Dark Thirty would be her follow up, I wasn't too excited... up until these last few months, where I was suddenly becoming hyped for it. Not only did it meet my expectations, it exceeded them. It's taken me almost a year of searching and about seventy movies to get to this point. Unless I find a movie from the very few I have left to see that overtakes this one, we're probably looking at the very best 2012 has to offer.The film chronicles the decade spanning manhunt for Osama Bin Laden, the vicious mastermind behind the bombings of 9/11, and the leader of the Al Qaeda organization, until he finally met his end at the hands of SEAL Team Six on May 1st, 2011. In the middle of all that, the audience observes the procedural happenings from the view of the task force charged with finding him. One of which is Maya (Jessica Chastain), a dedicated but also obsessive CIA officer.What I love about Zero Dark Thirty is that it fine tunes and perfects every stumble that The Hurt Locker suffered from. Screenwriter Mark Boal's episodic presentation is much more smooth and flowing, and is given more humanity than its predecessor. The movie not only holds our attention, it refuses to let go. It opens up fascinating views of morality, and it gives us a very interesting bunch of characters who never feel boring, all of which go well along with the looming suspense the film builds up.The biggest strength of The Hurt Locker was Kathryn Bigelow's ability to build tension and unpredictability to any given individual moment, and here, she proves just as capable. A simple look over the shoulder, a sudden movement, and even a change in vocal pitch can do wonders in the way she directs her actors. She rallies together impressive actors like Joel Edgerton, Mark Strong, and Jennifer Ehle. Of every one of them, Jessica Chastain is the unquestionable queen of the castle. After a banner year in 2011, she delivers a stunning lead performance, tough and steely when need be, but also fragile and conflicted at other times to keep Maya from feeling one note, and make her a believable character. She commands every scene with a fiery intensity, but also adds in a charisma that wasn't called for, but was most welcome. I feel pretty confident in calling it the performance of the year.As for Bigelow's crafts people, these guys all bring their A game, and they know well how to enhance the tension throughout. Whether it happen on the visual side, or even on the aural side; from the shaky and involving camera work by Greig Fraser, to the claustrophobic settings of Jeremy Hindle's production design, or from the startling booms and unsettling silence of Paul Ottosson's sound design, to the brooding pulse rhythms of Alexandre Desplat's musical score. Ultimately, the editing is the technical star. William Goldenberg, already having struck a home run with Argo this same exact year, is just as on the nose alongside Dylan Tichenor here. These two, as well as Bigelow, set the proper, but not always fast pace to this movie. It takes its time to set things up, but as a result, that entire final hour is a masterful example of film making. The raid on the compound, in particular, is a suspenseful sequence where every element comes together in the best way, where each moment had me biting my nails in anticipation. Bigelow's direction is brilliant. Recently, the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, but none of those belonged to Bigelow herself for her direction. For them to drop the ball like this is an embarrassment, and nothing short of the snub of the year.As enthusiastic as I may be, not everyone will like this movie nearly as much, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't see why. Regardless of that fact, I'd still recommend this movie to anyone. Something as fascinating as this movie deserves to be seen at least once. I know I've given multiple movies this year my highest possible rating, but many of those films do have noticeable faults, and they'd be closer to 9.5 out of ten on a numerical scale. Zero Dark Thirty is the only 2012 movie to earn a well deserved perfect rating of 10/10 from me. Bring on the rewatches!***** / *****",10,16,38,11 January 2013
Burlesque," Struggles to find a consistent tone and pace, but has great musical sequences, and a likable cast.
","It's not a perfect musical, but for it's momentary time, it proves to be a fun diversion.The film centers on an Iowa girl named Ali (Played by Christina Aguilera), who ditches her old life to chase stardom in L.A. Whilst there, she stumbles across a worn down Burlesque club run by a retired dancer named Tess (Played with relish by Cher). Ali, the headstrong career chaser she is, eventually gets a job at the club, and proves to be a dynamite singer, often getting on the wrong side of one of the club's main dancers, Nikki (Played by Kristen Bell), but the club is currently in danger of being closed down due to Tess's struggles to pay the bills for the club.The film takes obvious influence from it's more mature cousins, Chicago and Moulin Rouge (Right down to the bling-bling costumes, saucy choreography, and fast beat music), but the film's first half is more than sublime enough for fans of those two movies, if only the second half had done a little better. The film has a tendency to drag, and to feel contrived, but it's cast is enough reason to keep watching. Aguilera is clearly cast more for her voice than her acting chops (Which are actually better than expected), and it must be intimidating for any of the cast members to have to hold their ground against standout, Cher, a cast that also includes Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming.Oh, and as for the musical numbers, they're right up to par. They're decorated with shining, and lovely costumes and sets, and the accompanying lyrics and music, meshed together with the fast choreography should be enough to satisfy the fan of the musical genre. The movie specifically comes equipped with a beautiful ballad performed by Cher, and written by Diane Warren, that is by far and away one of the year's very best original songs. It's just such a shame that the film can't find a consistent tone.Burlesque is certainly not a good movie, but I enjoyed it enough to give it ** out of ****",5,0,0,20 January 2011
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Don't bother, even if you liked the previous movies.
","Having enjoyed the previous Ice Age movies, I found little to like about this movie. First of all, it looks great, as always. Problem is, the movie fails to generate the laughs of the previous films. Even Scrat has become hit and miss. The movie has a lot of energy, so much that it becomes annoying. It's not just obnoxious, it's boring. The movie is far too content to recycle ideas from the earlier movies. There seems to be no story, and yet too much story. There are way too many characters, and distractingly obvious voice overs without much passion (only Peter Dinklage sounds like he's having any fun). Thankfully, the movie is at least over quickly. Oh, and John Powell arranges the single most schizophrenic version of Beetovhen's 'Ode to Joy' in existence.** out of *****",4,1,2,23 October 2012
Dark Shadows," Even Burton can't make the most of this movie.
","Grim and wacky auteur Tim Burton, a director who you may remember best for terrific movies like Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and Ed Wood, gives us the first of his two 2012 directed features. Dark Shadows, based on the long running TV series created by Dan Curtis, features Burton's undeniably quirky stamp, but it also turns out to be his least entertaining movie since Planet of the Apes.Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, a man from the 18th century who is cursed to be a vampire after toying with the heart of a woman who turns out to be a witch. For this, the Collins family is historically cursed, and Barnabas, locked in a coffin for nearly 200 years, awakens in 1972. The Collins family business, led by matriarch Elizabeth, is flailing. Overpowered by the business led by a rival company, the brains of which belong to Angelique, the woman who cursed Barnabas. Barnabas seeks to restore the Collins business it to its original grandeur, win the heart of a young woman, and figure out what sorcery powers a television.The biggest problem with the movie lies with writer Seth Grahame-Smith. The screenplay is seriously awful. The back stories of the characters are interesting, but somewhere in the writing, something just rings untrue. These characters have so much potential, but the emotional involvement is unsatisfying, the development falls flat and inconsistent, and the structure just feels off. The movie itself also lacks rhythm. It struggles to find a consistent tone, thrown off course by irritating pacing shifts, and the kind of quirky humor that normally works for Burton's films, but feels wildly uneven here.As for the cast, there's plenty of talent, but not enough chemistry. Oddly enough, the cast do succeed in bringing something out of nothing roles, except perhaps Chloe Moretz and Johnny Miller. Eva Green, delightfully wicked and menacingly funny as Angelique, is one worth mentioning. Johnny Depp, as well, remains just as deliriously enjoyable as ever. Even if the fish out of water humor feels a bit much, he still manages to leave one in fits of laughter, especially in the hysterical floor-wall-ceiling love scene in Angelique's office.And since it's a Burton movie, it looks just as good. Definitely his most beautifully designed movie since Sleepy Hollow, and arguably his most beautifully designed movie ever. Rick Heinrichs' production design, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography, Joel Harlow and Paul Gooch's makeup, and especially Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes are properly elegant. Burton's composer of choice, Danny Elfman, brings on yet another great musical score as well. However, it takes more to make a good movie than pretty imagery. A good movie requires true heart, which Dark Shadows unfortunately lacks.***/ *****",6,2,4,29 May 2012
Inception," Christopher Nolan's Inception is one of his very best films.
","With the exception of the incredible Toy Story 3, the Summer movie season has been looking good, but not particularly great. All I can say is, thank God for Christopher Nolan, who has upped the season with a film that ranks among his very best work.Inception takes place in a world where technology exists to enter the mind. Dom Cobb (Played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor, and the best at what he does: stealing ideas from people's heads. He is asked by a businessman named Saito (Played by Ken Watanabe), to perform Inception, to PLACE an idea in the mind of a rival company's heir, Robert Fischer (Played by Cillian Murphy). To do this, he assembles a team, such as team point man Arthur (Played by Jospeh Gordon-Levitt), forger Eames (Tom Hardy), and new team architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page). But once the mission is finally under way, they all soon find out that the stakes are higher than they thought, and Cobb must also deal with demons from his past not only tormenting his mind, but threatening to compromise the operation, and plunge the team into limbo.Nolan has set up a reputation for himself over the years as an ambitious auteur, and Inception is a masterstroke of storytelling. He takes a while setting things up, and challenges the audience to keep up, but the pay off is a thrilling two and a half hours that flies right by. One terrific sequence worth mentioning is a dazzling hallway fight sequence where gravity goes haywire, and the film's teasing final short has you itching to revisit after only seconds.Another thing that makes Inception great, is it's performances. The Inception team of DiCaprio, Gordon-Levitt, Page, Hardy, Dileep Rao, as well as 'tourist' Ken Watanabe, are all wonderful. Marion Cotillard (who I won't go into detail about) is just great, though not quite the standout. That would be Cillian Murphy, in a subtle, but fantastic performance.I also want to commend the tech crew who made this movie look, and sound to the highest level of craftsmanship you can get. The tech crew includes people who Nolan previously worked with on The Dark Knight (another great movie), such as DP Wally Pfister, Film editor Lee Smith (Especially!), Composer Hans Zimmer, Sound designer Richard King, and respective special & visual effects supervisors Chris Corbould, and Paul Franklin. They did their job wonderfully, making inconceivable, and unbelievable worlds conceivable, and believable.The world of dreams is a complex, but unique thing as your mind creates the places, while you experience them. It could be of small, or gargantuan proportions, and Nolan has brilliantly executed this. It was my most anticipated film of the year, and it fully met (or even exceeded) my expectations.However, as enthusiastic as I am about this movie, maybe to the point of too much enthusiasm, I must stress that Inception may not be a movie for everyone. If you're a fan of Nolan's previous work, you'll really like this one. If you're not, results may vary. It is, like I said, a very challenging film to fully take in. It's a film that demands strict attention, and could require multiple viewings to fully grasp, and understand. Never the less, I highly recommend seeing it.Inception is a knockout Summer film that must not be missed. It's a thoroughly compelling, and challenging Sci-Fi, as well as a thoroughly entertaining, and thrilling heist movie.In my opinion, one of the year's best films. I give it a very well earned **** out of ****",10,1,3,16 July 2010
Rango," Rango is a creative, dazzling, and funny tribute to classic spaghetti westerns, but it's definitely not a kid's movie.
","A couple days ago, I started 2011 off on a solid note with The Adjustment Bureau, but that solid note has now risen to a brilliant note with the release of Gore Verbinski's Rango.Johnny Deep provides the voice of the title character, a chameleon house pet who gets lost in the middle of the Mojave Desert, and through a series of effective fibs, as well as killing a lethal hawk by accident, winds up the sheriff of the town he wandered into known as Dirt, a town low on water supplies, and on the brink of total drought and dehydration. Rango decides to investigate the mystery surrounding the low supplies, and quite often bites off more than he can chew.The direction by Gore Verbinski, who garners enthusiastic and terrific performances from his voice cast, is wonderful, and the screenplay by John Logan pays tribute to the classic spaghetti westerns of yesteryear, right down to pre gunfight stand offs, important events happening at high noon, and the decision to have a Mariachi band narrate, and make comment on the film's events. Sure, a couple scenes seem to overstay their welcome, but in spite of that one flaw, the film is fresh, and funny, and the film quite often got a good laugh from myself. I also loved visual references to characters played by Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.I must also praise the technical crew. This is the first animated feature designed by the legendary special effects company Industrial Light & Magic, and John Knoll does a good job at supervising the film's many grand, colorful and photo realistic images. I have just as much praise for the audio crew. Sound editor Addison Teague does a good job at handling classic western sound effects such as gunfire and galloping hooves, and Hans Zimmer (whose music score pays delightful homage to the scores of Ennio Morricone) does a great job at heightening the excitement and wit.Before I sign off, I must make a final point. I'm normally not too vocal about censorship, but take the facts that the film is animated, and rated PG with a huge grain of salt, because Rango is NOT a kid's movie. The images are quite quirky, and sometimes even trippy, some of the subject material is rather violent and foul mouthed, and some of the jokes may fly way over kids' heads, but that's exactly why I think the film's so special. The film makers stuck to their guns, and didn't wimp out in order to get a bigger audience of children. It's a movie almost strictly for older viewers, and should be treated as such.Needless to say, I loved Rango. I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9,86,122,11 March 2011
Prometheus," Ambitious, but misleading.
","Ridley Scott. Does the name ring a bell? It should. Scott is the cinematic mastermind behind classic movies like Alien, Blade Runner, and Gladiator. He's also the unfortunate creator of recent clunkers like A Good Year, Body of Lies, and Robin Hood. Which category does his latest movie Prometheus - an ambitious indirect prequel to the Alien franchise he started 33 years ago - belong to? Hard to say, simply because the movie is just that divisive. This really is one of those love it/hate it movies, and I can certainly see the points of both sides of the argument. Despite well intentions and big visual style, I just cannot get nearly as enthusiastic about this movie as many fellow movie-goers.Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) find what they believe to be clues to mankind's creation all over Earth, and lead a team of space soldiers, along with the secretive Captain Vickers (Charlize Theron), to a small planet that they believe will answer questions of theirs. If you've ever seen an Alien movie, you know this is a bad idea. Even though the team finds the answers they're looking for, they've also indirectly started a chain of events that could affect the world as we know it.Allow me to break out of my usual review format and split my thoughts on the film into what worked, and didn't work for me.WHAT WORKS: Without a doubt, Prometheus is a seriously impressive example of spectacle. Dariusz Wolski's claustrophobic cinematography, Arthur Max's chilling production design, the epic visual effects by supervisor Robert Stammers, and the surrounding sound mix and design are all vital to enhancing the ambiance and atmosphere of this strange planet, making it feel completely believable. Also impressive, for the most part, is the talent. Noomi Rapace makes for a strong, emotionally involving, and compelling hero, making Shaw a worthy successor to Ellen Ripley. The most fascinating aspect of Prometheus, oddly enough, is the perplexing and curious android David, played with calm nuance by Michael Fassbender. Sprinkling David with a Peter O'Toole vibe, delightful comic details, and subtly captivating mannerisms, Fassbender adds another powerful performance to his r√©sum√©.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The screenplay by John Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (the latter a former writer of LOST) plays a big job in the mysterious nature of Prometheus, but it also turns out to be a downside to the film. You can definitely detect the subtext of creation and religion that the writers were going for, and the film poses some very mind provoking questions, but it also fails to answer many of them, and the writers just can't bring the themes together properly. The movie just adds up to a confusing whole with numerous loose ends, made worse by mixing in horror techniques that worked for Alien, but doesn't quite fit here. Early on, it's easy to tell that many of the characters are merely here as human bowling pins waiting to get knocked down, so nothing ever really comes as a surprise. Also, despite an even first half, the second half's rhythm is off, undone by serious pacing and length issues.But maybe there's something more to it. Maybe it'll get better with a re watch. Maybe it'll get better with a sequel, which the film not so subtly hints that there will be. However, as of right now, it's just not up to par as an overall, singular product.**1/2 / *****",5,32,60,22 June 2012
Despicable Me," Witty, and cute, even if forgettable.
","Despicable Me centers on a mediocre super villain named Gru (Voiced by Steve Carrell's best imitation of Bela Lugosi), a man with minions, a mad scientist to invent weapons for him, and a pet dog/fraggle. He plots to use a shrink ray so he can steal the moon, but that plan is thwarted when the shrink ray is stolen by a rival super villain, the film's overly obnoxious antagonist Vector (Voiced by Jason Segel). But hope is not lost for Gru. He adopts three orphan girls (Voiced by the alright Dana Gaier, the simply adorable Elsie Fisher, and the somewhat effective Miranda Cosgrove of iCarly fame), to sell Vector cookies, so that he can steal back the shrink ray, and complete his objective. But soon the girls start to warm Gru's cold heart, and make him realize he's a better good guy than bad.The film's premise is solid, and it tries its best to do good with the material, and I say 'tries' because it's only half-successful. It takes a lot of influence from things like Pixar films, and Looney Tunes, and at times quite trivially. Some characters feel too rushed in screen time, and are inconsistently written, changing from sympathetic, to sarcastic in the blink of an eye.The film has a large cast that, besides Carrell and Segel, include comedic talents like Will Arnett, Russell Brand, and Kristen Wiig. Some of these characters feel annoying, and some feel like they're there just to be there, such as Gru's impossible-to-please mother, voiced by screen and stage legend Julie Andrews, who speaks in an inconsistent Hungarian accent.The only thing that really keeps the movie on its feet is the humor, with some fine one-liners, and often delightful sight gags, none the least of which are Gru's hilarious yellow followers who steal each and every scene they're in. But not all of the humor is successful, and even if the voice cast had some strong passion for their roles, it didn't translate too well onto screen.As far as both kids and adults go, I can't quite recommend Despicable Me because it is a good movie, and would be much MUCH quicker to suggest films like How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3. In the end, it's probably best to skip it.** out of ****",5,1,5,14 November 2010
The Woman in Black," The year is off to an inauspicious start.
","The cinematic year is off to an inauspicious start. Case in point: The Woman in Black. The whole first hour of the film is a mess, with a story that never reaches its full potential, and actors who feel like they're sleepwalking. Daniel Radcliffe feels miscast, especially since he feels so young to be playing a widowed father. Ciaran Hinds feels flat, and Janet McTeer gives the best performance in the film, but only has two scenes to her credit. On top of that, the first hour is overwrought with cheap 'Boo' scares. Things are never really that scary. Startling, maybe, but since it's a human reflex to jump at loud noises like the ones that accompany the sudden images in the film, it just feels cheap.And you also know that a movie is boring when the audience you're watching it with are a lot more entertaining. There were a bunch of people in the theater who would constantly scream at the silliest things. An image of the title ghost walking up to a window in a mansion had a bunch of young girls shouting bloody murder. One guy even dropped his phone and it set the audience on edge. It even got to the point that, when a few people were saying 'No! Don't open that door.' during one scene, a guy literally shouted at the top of his lungs 'Shut the *beep* up!' The screams themselves still didn't stop there, but I was surprisingly having fun with my audience. Unfortunately, the dull moments don't stop there either......the last 30 minutes aren't too much of an improvement. The movie at least finally limits the boo scares to only a very few spare moments, suspense builds up, and things legitimately begin to feel creepy, and even haunting. However, the disappointing ending does take a turn for the absolute worse, indeed, making me regret the experience. Never watch this unless you're watching it with the right audience.* out of *****",2,4,8,17 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," A slick origin story. Stylish and gripping.
","I guess the way to start this review is to tell you what I thought of the other films. I thought the first two films were great. Then came the dreaded downgrade in quality that was The Last Stand. I thought the Wolverine film was enjoyable, but flawed overall. This new entry is now a pleasant return to form.Rebooting the time line of the series to the days of the Cold War, the film follows the early days of the founding X-Men, Charles Xavier (Played by James McAvoy), a highly intelligent telepath, and Erik Lensherr (Played by Michael Fassbender), a man with the powerful ability to control metal. Once they meet, they form a team of others like them, those with extraordinary abilities (otherwise known as mutants). But danger starts to arise when an enemy team of mutants, led by the powerful Sebastian Shaw (Played by Kevin Bacon), begins to initiate a chain of events that would begin World War 3 unless the X-Men can stop them.First Class not only excels as an action movie, but also manages to feel fleshed out, and three dimensional, instead of feeling like a monotonous back to back action set piece. Director Matthew Vaughn and the film's powerful cast give the film an unusual heart, specifically between the complicated friendship between Xavier and Lensherr (McAvoy and Fassbender are a perfectly matched duo). But let's not forget the film's attention to other themes, such as prejudice and conformity. The narrative is not always perfect, and Fassbender has brief habits of slipping in and out of accent, but everything manages to be solid.As far as action goes, this a fun ride to sit through. Each action sequence is impeccably paced by Lee Smith (The marvelous editor of Inception), including the film's epic and enrapturing third act. There's also a stylistic attention to visual detail, whether it be the elegant production design, the well done visual effects, and fantastic makeup and sound design. Oh, and I also got a kick out of a brief cameo by Hugh Jackman.First Class is the best of the comic book summer, and I give it *** out of ****",8,2,4,24 October 2011
Win Win," Win Win is, for the most part, a win.
","I recently lent my attention to Win Win, Tom McCarthy's directorial follow up to his 2008 film The Visitor.The movie features some interesting themes, a lot of funny jokes, a great sense of drama, and interesting characters. Paul Giamatti is particularly great in his lead performance, caring, witty, and believable. The rest of the cast is quite good, too. Even Melanie Lynskey and Jeffrey Tambor make something out of under written characters. The movie may not always be perfect, and not all the sub plots are as neatly handled as need be, but Win Win is mostly a win.*** out of ****",8,1,1,18 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," An understandably divisive movie, and not everyone will like it. But as far as spectacle goes, it's king of the Summer.
","NOTE: Remember to take this review with a grain of salt, because this is just my opinion, which may not necessarily be yours.Christopher Nolan is one of the most interesting directors currently working. Despite a rabid fanbase, Nolan is often regarded for his portfolio of creative movies which improve with multiple viewings (Memento, The Prestige, Inception, etc.). In 2005, he recreated the origin of one of the most iconic superheroes of all time with the hyper realistic Batman Begins, and even bested himself with its sequel The Dark Knight, the pinnacle of the superhero genre, highlighted by Heath Ledger's already iconic performance as the Joker. Now Nolan brings his Batman saga to a satisfying close with The Dark Knight Rises, a movie that somehow manages to meet its high expectations.Eight years after taking the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes and murder, we find a Bruce Wayne living in near seclusion, damaged by his experiences as Batman. Organized Crime in Gotham City has become a rarity, criminals like the feisty thief Selina Kyle aside. However, Anarchy is about to come back to haunt Gotham in the form of Bane, a terrorist of mysterious motives. Some people just want to watch the world burn, and Bane has come to pull the pin on the grenade, unleashing Hell upon all of Gotham, forcing Bruce to come out of hiding, and don the cowl once more as the caped crusader.It's honestly pretty hard to pick a standout aspect of the movie, but it's worth pointing out each of their strong points.One could say it's writer/director Chris Nolan. One of the things I love about the script is that it ties up all the themes of the first two films, but continues to explore them in deeper ways. The ideas of anarchy, morality, and even the issues of identity crisis are explored very often. He even uses real life events to broaden the sense of chaos, such as the New York stock exchange crash, the 99% vs. the 1%, and Occupy Wall Street. The direction continues to amplify this, building layers upon layers of intensity and emotion that all culminate beautifully in the movie's epic climax. I especially loved Nolan's staging and pacing of the action sequences, which showcase his preference to mostly practical effects and only rely on computer imagery when necessary. It's unquestionably the work of an auteur.One could also call the cast the standout aspect. Christian Bale further manages to put us inside the complicated workings of Bruce Wayne's mind. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman also add a level of heart and focus to the emotion. As for new cast members, Tom Hardy terrifies as Bane, using every bit of the intensity in his eyes at his disposal. The stunning Marion Cotillard gives a subtle performance as Miranda Tate, but not one that's too extraordinary. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake is a welcome ray of light to the darker nature of Gotham. But none are quite as gripping as Anne Hathaway, who exceeds any and all expectations as Selina Kyle, nailing both her alluring and intimidating characteristics.One could also call the technical aspects the best part. Wally Pfister delivers with kinetic, Oscar-worthy cinematography. Nathan Crowley's production design practically immerses the viewer inside this world. The effects supervised by Paul Franklin and Chris Corbould are jaw dropping, especially Batman's newest and best toy yet, The Bat. Richard King provides intense, organic sound design, which plays very well with the huge (occasionally, but forgivably overbearing) sound mix. And Lee Smith, even taking his time at 164 minutes, tackles the film editing with such clockwork precision that the staggering runtime is ultimately trivial. I don't think I ever once checked my watch.But is this all going overboard? If anyone thinks I'm TOO enthusiastic, allow me some time to sober up. The Dark Knight Rises is a polarizing movie, and that's saying something if your movie is more polarizing than even Inception. I have seen many reviews that criticize the movie as being convoluted, overlong, and overwhelmed by clunky action. I would have to disagree with said points, but such complaints are not without reason, and I can appreciate that not everyone will like the movie.Nolan is something of an acquired taste (well, maybe not acquired, but he is a taste), and whether or not you're a fan may vary on how much you enjoy this movie. You may be divided even if you are a Nolan fan. The length does take a toll, and it really makes you have to pay attention. Some have even taken issues with the real life events the film mirrors, and even criticize Bane's dialogue as difficult to understand (although I understood every one of his lines perfectly). This all brings me to my last point, which is also true for other Nolan films: Multiple viewings will be required. A lot of you may be thinking 'I don't need to see it twice. I pretty much got everything...' no, I don't think seeing it once is enough to judge it properly. First impressions can be deceiving. Whether or not it holds up on a second viewing remains to be seen, but I do hope it will be even more rewarding.Follow up: Turns out, it isn't as rewarding the second time out. Though it still remains exciting and powerful, the film does feel a bit too cluttered, and proves to be a little too ambitious, and slightly underwritten, for its own good. Still, it is a great movie, and a proper way to send Batman off.****1/2 / *****",9,5,12,10 August 2012
Toy Story 3," No one but Pixar can consistently make films this amazing.
","Pixar is my favorite animation studio ever, and they've NEVER let me down. Even their WORST film in my opinion Cars, was still a great movie). BUT, even with Toy Story 3's wide array of universal acclaim, I was still having doubts. Because third films usually turn out to be the worst, and I was having fear it wouldn't be that good...Aww, who the hell am I kidding?! This was my favorite of the trilogy, and only FURTHER adds to Pixar's long line of fantastic family films.11 years after the second Toy Story, Andy is now about to depart to college. He decides to leave some of his toys like Buzz Lightyear (Voiced by Tim Allen), and Jessie (Joan Cusack), in the attic where they'll be safe, and take Woody (Voiced by Tom Hanks) to college with him. However, the toys to be placed in the attic are mistaken for trash, and placed on the curb. Feeling betrayed and unwanted, the toys, along with Woody trying to convince the toys it was all a mistake, all climb into a box to be donated to Sunny Side day care. They meet up with the head toy Lotso-Huggin Bear (Voiced by Ned Beatty), who sets them up in the 'caterpillar' room for toddlers. Woody breaks out to find Andy, but gets picked up by the daughter of a woman who works there, while the rest of the toys decide to stay. But, things get a little out of hand, and Woody must travel back to help the other toys break out.Now, the film isn't EXACTLY the same kind of feel as the first two. The film is directed by Lee Unkrich, taking over the helm from John Lasseter. Unkrich though, keeps the story going at a wonderful pace, and the film still features the same fantastic type of humor, action, and emotional heart to it. Be sure to bring plenty of Kleenexes for the third act.The voiceovers, as always, are brilliant. Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, and John Ratzenberger are all fantastic in their returning roles. And there are also fantastic newcomers such as Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, and Jeff Garlin, as well as others. I also want to give major kudos to Ned Beatty for his standout performance.The animation as always, FANTASTIC. It's absolutely gorgeous work, helped out by marvelous sound design from Tom Myers of Up, and Cars. The 3-D though, not that marvelous. I think I definitely could have lived without it. But, it doesn't hinder the movie whatsoever.It's a charming, hilarious, emotional, and satisfyingly worthy conclusion to a trilogy that quite literally has only gotten better with each new installment.All of these reasons are why I simply CAN'T give the movie anything less than an enthusiastic, **** out of ****",10,3,6,21 June 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson has crafted his most personal venture yet.
","One of the most acclaimed and celebrated movies of the year, Moonrise Kingdom might very well be Wes Anderson's best movie to date. It's probably his most accessible movie yet, but that doesn't mean he tones down his usual quirky style and humor. His personal stamp is ever so present throughout, his directorial choices a delight, and his cast (including Bruce Willis, Edrward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Bill freakin' Murray) are an absolute riot.Most enchanting, however, is Anderson's delicate, layered script. The movie's charm never seems to fade, but he still manages to confront issues of first love, bullying, emotional damage, and social isolation without missing a beat. It may be a funny movie, but it still resonates deeply as a study of childhood. Moonrise Kingdom serves as a project lovingly perfected by Anderson, and what he crafts - complete with gorgeous photography and music - is one of the very best films of the year.****1/2 / *****",9,1,4,23 October 2012
RED," Mindless is exactly the point of this action-packed, star-studded extravaganza. John Malkovich, in particular, is hilarious.
","Recently, I got out to see the new madcap, action/comedy Red, based on the graphic novel by Warren Ellis, and Cully Hammer.My advice: Don't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, but do expect to have a great time.In the film Bruce Willis plays Frank Moses, a man who is RED (Retired and Extremely Dangerous). Over a long period, he's had an over the phone relationship with a Kansas City receptionist named Sarah (Played by Mary Louise-Parker). After a rather intense invasion of his home by mysterious gunmen, he travels to Kansas City, and kidnaps Sarah, fearing that the people who want him dead, may also want to kill her, and also tries to always keep one foot ahead of a CIA agent named William Cooper (Played by Karl Urban). He seeks help from old, and equally dangerous friends such as Cancer-stricken, but intelligent Joe Matheson (Played by the legendary Morgan Freeman), excessively paranoid stealth-man Marvin Boggs (Played by John Malkovich), and caring, but fiery assassin Victoria (Played by Helen Mirren).This film really is, in every way, a mindlessly fun popcorn flick, filled to the brim with laughs, and reckless action sequences, kind of in the same category as Roland Emmerich's Independence Day, minus the aliens, and on a considerably smaller scale. The movie may present a bit of elements that has been seen in a number of films, but its stylistic approach, and clever wit is what makes it better than most of those.Aside from a great cast I've mentioned earlier, it also includes appearances by other legends like Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox, and Richard Dreyfuss. The main cast is really what makes it so great, such as Bruce Willis, who's definitely still got what it takes as an action star. Mary Louise-Parker could have been great, but as it goes, she's rather good. Helen Mirren is very effective in somewhat short screen time, as is Morgan Freeman, albeit to a fairly lesser extent. But the true standout is John Malkovich, whose character is so fun, so bizarre, and utterly, and hilariously paranoid (Often for nothing but good reasons).It's oh-so enjoyable, reckless, witty, and brimming with action. The cast specifically get a lot of laughs......enough for me to give Red *** out of ****",8,4,8,16 October 2010
Flight," Lifted almost singlehandedly by Denzel Washington's strong performance.
","Robert Zemeckis has got to have one of the oddest careers in Hollywood. Known for his much respected live action films like Forrest Gump and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, he's spent the last twelve years specializing in films entirely made through motion capture. He makes his return to live action with Flight, a movie that centers on an airplane pilot under investigation after a drastic plane accident, where he saved the lives of 96 people on board, but was discovered to have alcohol in his system at the time of the flight. This guy's got to be the best drunk driver ever...Flight is the kind of movie that doesn't get to be made often, and Zemeckis intends to treat it in the best way he can. This is certainly his most stylistically restrained film yet, as he wants to place more focus on the writing. Screenwriter John Gatins was inspired to write this film due to his own history of addiction, and he confronts these issues head on. He also takes time to examine the balance between what happens as a result of the hands of God, and what happens as a result of man's hand, but not always very well. The narrative and pacing still have their uneven tendencies......but when you get down to it, this is an actor's showcase. The main role is perfect for Denzel Washington, who has unfortunately spent the last few years in sub-par action films. Here, he's allowed to release his full talents. His character can be sympathized with just as much as he can be detested. Washington never overplays or underplays one or the other. Both elements work hand in hand to excellent effect. Credit should also go to co-star Kelly Reilly, wonderful in a sympathetic role that works well with Washington's more unpredictable nature, and that's what really makes this movie take flight.***1/2 / *****",7,2,3,11 January 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," As an overall product, it's glorious. As a finale to a great series, what more can be asked for?
","After months of waiting patiently, I have finally seen the second half of the final installment of the Harry Potter film franchise, The Deathly Hallows.In the film, Harry, Ron, and Hermionie are still on their search and destroy mission for the final four horcruxes, items in which the deadly Lord Voldemort has laced with fragments of his soul. Only problem is, Voldemort is now fully aware of their mission, and intends to stop them at any cost. Soon, the three are back at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but the overwhelming influence of the Death Eaters has now left it totally bleak. As the dark armies prepare to strike Hogwarts down, Harry comes closer to his final showdown with Voldemort, a battle that will determine the fate of the wizarding world.Splitting the last book of the series by J.K Rowling in half was found to be a divisive decision. Most thought that it was a wise choice, so that it would give the characters more development, while others saw it as a greedy chance to milk the cash cow. After seeing Part 2, my verdict is this: Totally. Justified. Decision.This is easily one of the best entries in the Harry Potter film series. It establishes a very grim tone, but finds an even blend of action sequences, and the occasional humorous sprinkles. The movie takes a little time to get into, but as a result, the final hour of the movie had me tuning everything else out. The climax of the film is a huge rush of adrenaline, and the film's ending is a delightful return to the light spirit of the first film that has me itching to watch the series all over again, even as I speak.Also, the film's cast and characters must not have been easy to keep properly developed. Not much of the adult cast are over utilized, but they serve the purpose that they're given. Daniel Radcliffe is at his best, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson perform admirably, Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman stand out amongst the cast (And one scene involving Rickman is a serious tearjerker), while new entries to the cast, Kelly MacDonald and Ciaran Hinds, make effective use of their small roles.And to the many technical crew involved with the film, I tip my hat to you. The visual effects, cinematography, and makeup are most impressive. The sound design is exceptional. The excitement of watching the movie in IMAX 3D is gripping. Alexandre Desplat writes the only score of the series that is successfully able to duplicate the same thrilling, and whimsical sound John Williams brought to the earlier films. But most to thank is Stuart Craig, whose years of service as production designer, coupled with the fact that this feature might very well be his crowning achievement of the series, leads to me to say that the man, plain and simple, deserves this year's Oscar for Best Art-Direction. Case Closed.But like many Harry Potter fans, I stand thinking, 'Now what?' I'm very sad to see the series end, but happy that the filmmakers have given it a worthy finale. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 must not be missed on the big screen. If you loved the previous films, you will adore this one.I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,2,22 July 2011
Looper," It's hard to find movies as original as this one. You've never seen one like this before.
","'This time travel crap just fries your brain like an egg', quips Jeff Daniels in Looper, the latest movie from modern film-noir favorite Rian Johnson. This marks the third movie for Johnson, director of the 2005 cult classic Brick, and the forgotten The Brothers Bloom from 2008. Looper had a lot of hype leading up to its release. It was the opening film of the Toronto International Film Festival, received enthusiastic word of mouth, and the three main stars even hailed it as the best movie they've ever done. If you want to talk about ORIGINAL screenplays, then Looper's well worth your time. It's hard to find movies as original as this one.The year is 2044. Time Travel will be invented, and outlawed in 30 years, used only in secret by mob bosses. It is very difficult to kill a person in that day due to such advanced tracking technologies. To work around this, the mob sends these targets back in time (in a way faintly reminiscent of The Terminator) to be murdered and disposed of by trained assassins known as Loopers. One of these assassins is Joe (Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). An ace at his job, he collects his payments of silver bars for a job well done, stocking it up to move out of the country. When the Looper's services are no longer needed, their future selves are sent back to be eliminated by their past selves, a process called 'closing the loop'. However, a moment's hesitation causes Joe to fail killing his older self (Played by Bruce Willis), who is dead set on exterminating a mob boss as a child to stop a tragedy in his own life from happening.Johnson clearly takes influences and methods of various legendary Science-Fiction's (Similar to the style of Quentin Tarantino), but weaves them all into a fantastic whole that totally feels its own. Aside from just sci-fi, Johnson also mixes in his usual neo-noir flair, and the scope of spaghetti westerns. All of his characters are nothing short of brilliant, and especially through his directorial style (with outstanding editing by Bob Ducsay), the movie shines bright.Johnson particularly does well to showcase the various themes, one in particular of mankind's common quest, and even futile efforts to 'change the future'. It really places an emphasis on the importance of choice, and the long term consequences of it. In the rift between times, one bad decision could be doomed to repeat itself in a vicious, never ending cycle. That's one of several heavy ideas, and Johnson relishes in provoking the mind with them all in a way that almost makes Inception look like child's play in the process.Of course, the characters would probably be nothing without the complete dedication they deserved, and the kind of dedication their actors delivered, and then some. Bruce Willis hasn't been this good in years, feeling less like his usual John McClain, and more akin to his emotional performance in the underrated Unbreakable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (fresh off The Dark Knight Rises) is the perfect match and adversary for Willis, and not merely because his appearance is so uncanny for a younger version of him. Part of what sells the illusion of this movie is how much the two are alike in their mannerisms, but feel like polar opposites in their personal motivations.If you want a real standout, look no further than Emily Blunt, whose character, Sara, is a single mother living on a farm, and totally prepared to protect her family. Willis and Levitt did their roles well, but Blunt deserves extra credit for how hard it must have been to properly play this character. Sara is a stern and tough soul, and a loving and understanding one at that. At the same time, there's this vulnerability in her, like an uncertainty and terror welling up inside, despite how committed she is to her duties. Blunt may not be the flashiest aspect of Looper, but she is without doubt the best.Overall, Looper is impressive, a must see for any fan of science-fiction. Still, I want to avoid giving it my highest rating until seeing it again. It's a hard movie to really nail down. In fact, in trying to formulate my thoughts, this one review took me nearly two hours to finish. Looper is a movie that needs time and contemplation for one to let it soak in. The food for thought it leaves you with can be overwhelming to think over, but that's what makes it such a rewarding experience. If you want something that'll challenge the mind, and may even have more in store on multiple viewings, this is a perfect choice for you. You've never seen one like this before.****1/2 / *****",9,0,2,23 October 2012
Footloose," Not particularly perfect, but humorous, toe tapping, and decently told for what it is.
","I got a chance to attend an advanced screening of Footloose, the remake of the 1984 original film.Boston born teenager, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), leaves behind a troubled past in his old town, moving to Bomont, Tennessee, where dancing was outlawed through a notion by the local Reverend (Dennis Quaid) after a tragic car crash three years earlier. Ren decides to challenge the ban on dancing, and falls for the Reverend's daughter (Julianne Hough).Footloose is not that special of a story. Character arcs are formulaic, several actions in the film are reckless, but at least they have a decent cast to lift them above that. Dennis Quaid is great, Kenny Wormald is decent enough, and Miles Teller is a riot of hilarity as Willard (Ren's clueless friend). I also really enjoyed the dance sequences, which featured some really slick choreography.But not everything in the film works, including Julianne Hough. Her acting never really impressed me, she seems a bit too old for the role, and her character is under written.All in all, Footloose is just fine for some light entertainment.**1/2 out of ****",7,4,13,7 October 2011
50_50," It isn't every day you see something this deep still make you laugh on occasion.
","The movie is something of a wonder. A touching, perfectly balanced dramatic comedy with few missteps. It's also something of a personal story for screenwriter Will Reiser. In fact, the script is actually a sort of autobiographical story. He was diagnosed with cancer in his 20's before recovering, and this lead him to write the script to this movie.And this turns out to be the absolute highlight of 50/50. All of Reiser's characters are believably fleshed out, his pacing is completely confidant, and the movie is occasionally quite funny. But just because you see Seth Rogen's name in the credits, don't assume you'll see something completely hysterical. Reiser establishes a very deep, solemn tone that sometimes borders on depressing, but also knows when to pull back with some most welcome lightheartedness without undermining the serious issues the movie is trying to develop.And as for the cast, there's not a bad performance to be found. I can do nothing but sing their praises all day. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a tremendous, emotionally devastating performance that reveals an ever growing sadness as layers are peeled back. Seth Rogen provides the film with appropriate doses of comic relief while still keeping to the consistency of the film's dramatic tone. Bryce Dallas Howard and Angelica Huston shine wonderfully in their supporting roles. And then we get down to Anna Kendrick. I think that the film kind of played up her naivety in the film's first half a bit much, but I still couldn't help but be charmed by her sincere presence.I'm also really glad to see this one getting some awards traction. An Oscar nod for Original Screenplay had better be coming.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,21 December 2011
Cloud Atlas," It must be applauded for merely having the audacity to tell such a story.
","I confess that I was never the biggest fan of Andy or Lana Wachowski, best known for their genre smash hit The Matrix, perhaps the only film they'd ever directed that I actually like. However, what they cook up along with co-director Tom Tykwer is a beautiful mystery of a movie that I'm confidant will be talked about many years from now. There is no one definitive story to Cloud Atlas (Based on the 2004 novel of the same name), instead, it's a collection of stories set in different time lines ranging from 1849 to 106 years after apocalyptic events, utilizing an all star cast to wonderful effect.Despite a very lengthy runtime of close to three hours, Cloud Atlas is surprisingly easy to watch all in one sitting. It's a clever movie that mixes in a little bit of everything. Dark humor, moral dilemmas, romance, action, conspiracy, heartbreak, sweeping imagery, it's got something for everyone. How these individual segments connect to each other is a very provoking thematic detail that Tykwer and the Wachowski's love examining. It's not always done to uniformly astonishing effect, but it is ambitious in how it raises enough questions and answers, but still leaves plenty to the imagination.One element that I applaud is the decision to go in a sort of Angels In America route by having actors play multiple roles. A talented ensemble cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and many others are consistently excellent, some more entertaining than others in segments. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the special makeup effects for the players. Not all the creations are excellent, but much of the work is so impressive that it renders an actor completely unrecognizable.It's a shame that it didn't get much of an audience at the box office, though, because it is one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences you could hope for. A lot of it is uneven, I'm not gonna lie, but these three directors, and their unique voices, should be applauded merely for having the audacity to adapt such an 'unfilmable' novel to the screen. With repeat viewings, and staying power, this could become a beloved classic years from now.**** / *****",8,13,20,11 January 2013
Easy A," The previous teen movie influence is obvious, but Emma Stone's performance is impeccable.
","MYeah is havin' an okay day. Saw Easy A, and got a coke zero at the gas station. Raise the roof! Olive Penderghast is a social outsider in her high school, but when a rumor starts floating around that she slept with a college student, she decides to use this to heighten her financial, and social placement by pretending to have sex with fellow students of hers. This works out fairly well at the start, but as the escalator of attention rises, she finds herself unhappy with herself, trying to save face, as well as dealing with a struggle between her, and the school's group of Christian enthusiasts.The film takes a lot of obvious influence from the filmography of John Hughes, as well as the recent Mean Girls, to move its story along, but only rarely is such a thing so trivial. The movie is neatly told, it moves quickly, and the humor actually works, thanks to the combined efforts of director Will Gluck, and screenwriter Bert Royal. Their work is smooth, although a montage of clips from John Hughes' filmography, as well as other little references to his films can become distracting, but the story really isn't the main reason to see the movie.The REAL reason to see the movie is the impressive star turn by the oh-so charming Emma Stone, who carries the film with a superb performance. Every witty one-liner, or subtle facial expression of hers is destined for a laugh. But her humor never overstays its welcome, her emotional timing works brilliantly, so she's more than enough reason to check the movie out. In addition to Stone, the cast includes Lisa Kudrow, Amanda Bynes, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden Church, and Stanley Tucci who all have a gift of natural comedy.It may not be the best teen movie ever made, but it does feature one of the year's best leading performances.And that's enough reason for me to give it an easy *** out of ****",8,0,0,27 November 2010
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," This beast has grown real old, real fast.
","As someone who really liked the first two Madagascar movies, this one was just flat out stale. While not without merits, the movie suffers from an overabundance of characters, both old and new. Some of these characters are more entertaining than others, but it just makes it hard to stay focused on any one of them. On top of that, the movie is rushed, and the humor is inconsistent. King Julien, a comedic gem in the previous movies, is played up to be such an irritating idiot. Even the penguins have grown old. It's still occasionally entertaining, and it looks great as always, but this beast needs to make way for the next franchise.**1/2/ *****",5,0,4,7 September 2012
The Social Network," This movie is nothing if not worthy of a watch thanks to strong direction, dazzling performances, and a smart script.
","The brilliant, brilliant new film The Social Network (based on the book 'The Accidental Billionaires' by Ben Mezrich) shows that sometimes it's best to resist temptation with all your might. It's an experience I won't soon forget, and one I hope to take again in the near future.The film stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, the man who started it all, and as a result became the world's youngest billionaire. After a messy breakup with his girlfriend, Erica Albright (Played with effective comedic, and emotional timing by Rooney 'Scene-Stealer' Mara), he goes on an all out blogging marathon, even launching a small site that within only a couple of hours, receives over 20'000 hits, and crashes the Harvard system. He is asked by the Winklevoss twins (Played by Armie Hammer and... Armie Hammer) to help create a new 'friending' site for Harvard, but instead takes the idea, and 'Perfects' it. Thus, Facebook is born. But as his list of friends grows, he slowly loses his only true friend, Eduardo Saverin (Played by Andrew Garfield). On top of nasty temptation from rather paranoid Napster founder, Sean Parker (Played by the surprisingly capable Justin Timberlake), he faces nasty lawsuits from not only the Winklevoss twins, but from his best friend as well.Who knew that director David Fincher could extract such strong, and solid performances from a cast that could have missed the target with improper direction, like Eisenberg, Garfield, Timberlake, Hammer, Rooney Mara, Rashida Jones, and Brenda Song (whose screen time is relatively short, but one scene of hers is simply unforgettable)? Eisenberg gives a subtle, and authentic performance as Zuckerberg, making the character his own instead of an imitation. Making him intelligent, humorous, but not always likable, sometimes even dreadful. It will go down as one of the best performances of the year. But no one is quite as strong as the standout of the cast, Garfield. No actor can match his line delivery, no actor can out best his emotional display. I'll be quite disappointed if he doesn't get some major awards recognition.David Fincher's direction is subtle, but strong and effective. It doesn't contain the same auteurial feel he's well known for, but it's still the best film he's directed. The tech crew he surrounds himself with is also great. Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall's editing and pacing is fantastic (It does feel slow at times, specifically in the second act, but I literally could have watched it all day), Jeff Cronenworth's cinematography adds to the movie's feel greatly, and the techno score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a perfect match for the film.But the movie REALLY belongs to screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, who has officially become a candidate for the Shakespeare of this modern age. I imagine fans of his will be more than just delighted by his script's drama, intelligent dialogue, hilarious moments of satire, strong emotional punches, and thought provoking questions it raises towards the state of mankind as a networking community, and the violent freedom of insulting someone on the internet (For all to see), from the safety of your own home. And they'll probably know better than anyone else how quickly they'll need to keep up. In a lot of scenes, characters use line delivery so rapid in succession, it would make a 1940's film noir look like a Terrence Malick film.Still, such a thing is needed to establish the tone of the film, which is nailed right on the head, and delivers what is simply the year's finest film. If Sorkin wins a screen writing Academy Award, I'll be completely unshocked.With an as of now completely obvious, and enthusiastic final rating of **** out of ****, I have nothing left to say except, 'Go see The Social Network... NOW!'",10,1,2,10 October 2010
The Proposal," MYeah's review: The Proposal
","While the movie does make for an interesting premise, it's only moderately successful.The film stars Bullock and Reynolds respectively as Margaret Tate, a very pushy boss, and Andrew Paxton, her tortured assistant. After discovering that she is about to be deported back to Canada, Margaret hatches a plan to stay in the country, she decides to marry Andrew so she may keep her citizenship. Andrew agrees to this only if Margaret gives him a promotion. To further keep up the facade, they both travel to Alaska to meet Andrew's family, and announce the news. This includes Andrew's pushy father (Played by Craig T. Nelson), his very loving mother (Played by Mary Steenburgen), and his all around peculiar grandmother (Played by Betty White).The film relies on a lot of formula. Two leads who hate each other at the start, one hatches a plan to obtain something they want, The two begin to understand that they do love one another, and I'll let you figure out the rest. It's not a very original story, but it's better than most formula movies, and at the very least fast paced.The movie at least gets it performances right. Bullock and Reynolds are not only good in their roles, but have such great chemistry together. The rest of the cast such as Nelson, Steenburgen, and others aren't really as good. Even Betty White, who while good in the film, lacks a great deal of her always brilliant comedic presence.So while it suffers from a predictable story, it benefits from two good lead performances.I give The Proposal **1/2 out of ****",6,0,2,24 June 2010
The Fighter," Predictable, occasionally slow, and a bit ill structured from a screen writing perspective, but it benefits from an outstanding ensemble cast.
","Recently I saw The Fighter, a film that stars Mark Wahlberg as Mickey Ward, a boxer who's been suffering from a string of severe losses due to the influence of his family. He's coached by his unreliable, crack addicted half brother, Dicky Eklund (Played by Christian Bale), and managed by his control obsessed mother, Alice (Played by Melissa Leo). This isn't even mentioning Mickey's many sisters who just won't shut up. But his new girlfriend Charlene (Played by Amy Adams) spells out how his family has been more of a hindrance than a help, and that he needs to find balance between his own life, and his family's.I liked this movie, but I didn't like it as much as I wanted to. One of the main problems is the screenplay, which seems a bit ill structured at times, and doesn't give the character of Mickey Ward as much attention as he needs, sometimes focusing more on his family. His family are a fascinating bunch of characters, but because of his lack of focus, I just couldn't get anymore than tepid for Mickey's story arc. The film also feels slow at points.But it's certainly not bad by any means. Director David O'Russel earns some strong performances out of his cast, such as Mark Wahlberg trying to do his best with the title character, Amy Adams surprisingly doing better than I had expected, as well as standouts Melissa Leo, and especially Christian Bale, who gives an impeccable, and utterly enthralling portrayal of addiction, and failed ambition. I also found the boxing sequences, shot in the style of HBO broadcasts, to be enjoyable, and the final fight is a triumphant scene.I give The Fighter *** out of ****",8,1,1,3 January 2011
