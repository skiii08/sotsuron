The Avengers," It's almost Illigal to Not watch this movie !!!
","like allot of people in the world, and i mean allot, Disney\Marvel did a great prequel for this movie, with the movies, 'hulk', 'Thor', 'iron man', 'iron man 2', 'Captain America' so off cures everyone wanted to see them all in one movie, even it thoughts characters would just stand in 1 frame holding carrots it would be an awesome movie, but this movie doesn't stay there it really is an amazing movie by itself. loki, Thor brother is leading an army of really bad alien creature thingys .. i don't know exactly who are they o.k ? .. against earth and then all of earth mightiest heroes suppose to work together to fight them . OK so it's not the best story they could think of, i'll give them that. but i mean , each and every charechter in this movie is interesting enough to hold a movie by itself, and seeing them all together is brilliant, the soundtrack is fantastic, it's not just another soundtrack but a real afford was put into it to be focused for this movie. if it wasn't clear by now, the acting is really cool, i personally think Thor is really convincing as .. well as Thor from the comics, but really they're all great there was allot of Acton as expected from this movie, maybe i would take the movie a bit more seriously i mean doing more epic things in it but really it's just a tiny thing in a great movie by far the best movie i saw in 2012... (yea even better then batman...) i could talk about it for days but really if you still didn't watch it then run to the cinema and see it it's a must !",10,1,6,10 March 2013
Argo," decent thriller not much more
","i saw this movie last week and what can i tell you. it's really great. really not much to say about it, off-cures you need to be an American or someone who knows history or a Ben Aflec fan to love this movie, but most of the people are. this movie really revolves around the events of the 'Canadian Caper', in which a CIA Agent rescued and extracted 6 Americans from the 80 or so who stayed 2 years in captivity. really to be short it's just a Ben Aflec action movie, it's about an historical events and it is a really sensitive subjects especially for Americans, so off-cures it got nominated for the Oscars, but if your not a Ben Aflec fan nothing really is going to help you love this movie, the Suspense is not really felt as in other movies this year that came out, the acting is .. well it's good it's really good, probably the best thing about this movie, it's not amazing but it is good. and then there is clinging to the History which they are doing that, i just, didn't know the real story, so there was allot more action missing from this movie, and it did felt a bit like an average thriller movie with tiny bits of action put into it, what can i say it simply didn't racked my bubble.. i just couldn't get into this movie so much, there was nothing amazing in it, the soundtrack is average at best, Ben aflec is well.. Ben aflec ... all hies charchters look the same for me, the other hostage's where true to the source but really not interesting enough to keep me watching more of this... i watched it until the end and although it's the best thriller i saw in months it's certainly not one i would remember for the apparent future.i know allot of people get super excited about the amazing acting in this movie and on how touching it is, i simply didn't saw it like that...",7,1,2,10 March 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," yea this movie has problems but really its our fault
","Usually I don't write reviews because there are so much out there, but the bad reviews this movie is getting is really annoying me. I'm not going to repeat all the things people are saying, they say zack snyder has ruined the movie, the luthor is a wired joker version of what lex is suppose to be about, that it takes 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to hit the first punch, and then it's over after 3 minutes, and that the movie is inserting 5 story's in one movie.yea i get everyone. just a few things.Zack snyder is not responsible for it, if anyone it would be the writers for writing this story, then the studious for inserting all this things in it.but what really irritates me, is that who is reading this review now ? you , me, all of us, all of us who have seen this trailers, and analysing every little thing in them, and comes to the movie knowing how the movie is looking and feels, how wonder woman will look, and how ben aflek is chosen for batman, all this creates expectations that a movie can never fur fill. i mean the movie is starting out from this high place in our mind and we have already seen everything and heard and read everything so it can only go down from there.then we do something much more devastating and we analyse every little thing in the movie in unreal standards, we must have every actor play perfectly, every fold in every cloth be perfect, and that the effects and music be flawless..then off cures we find defects and argue on how they ruined the movie .. and we must hate it.we forget the base of what movies are for, the fact that we go to the movies not to judge and review but simply to see a show on a screen...we go and see a story happen before our eyes, enjoying every little aspect of it, the story, the lights, no need to judge everything, imagine we would judge..lets take an old classic, gone with the wind, today we straight forward would say it's too long like unbelievable long,the the 2 main actors acting is way over the line, that the effects are horrible, and that the story doesn't make sense and have many loop holes...but maybe because of it's time and maybe because of toughs defects it became that classic that we know and love today, like i don't believe batman vs superman ever will.let's take a little child for example, that seats in a theatre in 1980 and that red fabric comes up for the first time, and it's the original star wars film, all you need to see is that space... a few bearded man, and then everything is possible, that kid in that second can believe he is a jedi fighting the rebel alliances with a light sabre on hies hand, or cry when he suddenly finds out Luke and leya are brothers,, no one really cared that the background panels were looking plastic, that dearth vader is played by 3 unrelated people, and that half the charterers are over acting. it didn't matter what meter was that it was there and it was enough.for me movies is a dream, movies is enjoying every little aspect of it.. and you know what ? batman v superman was an amazing movie! the special effects were amazing, among the best in theatres today ! the batman was the best one I've seen ever, and wonder woman gave me the creeps..seeing that shot with superman, wonder woman, and batman standing next to each other. made me so happy ... it made me sit in a small theatre among hundred of people, and dream i'm out there with them , in the stars, fighting doomsday, defeating him.. and for me ?for me that's enoughso i say .. thank you Zack Snyder for allowing me this dream...thank you for showing this epic shot.. and epic movie.. i know i'm just one person in this world... but for me you did a great job.. you allow people to dream... please just keep doing it. thnx.",7,0,0,30 March 2016
