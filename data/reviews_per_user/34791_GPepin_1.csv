The Blair Witch Project," Truely ingenius for budget.
","This film was a truely ingenius way to make a feature length film on such a small budget(US $40,000).Not only was it ingenius, but the way the film progressed with no formal scripting was amazing.  As the days passed in the film, the hysteria and tension grew between the characters, the fear instilled by the unknown in the darkness grew .  Amazing.I loved the themes that came out and the the open-endedness of the film. What makes it scary is the ideas you get of what could really be out there.I do recommend seeing this film in a theater with a good sound setup though. The second time I saw it, A lot of the dialogue and faint noises where practically inaudable because the sound wasn't all that hot in the theatre.I can't wait for the DVD!!!",10,1,2,2 August 1999
