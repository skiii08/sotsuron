Lucky Number Slevin," The Dialogue, Freeman, & Sir Ben
","This film's cast and it's dialogue are the 2 best things going for this film. The 2 great thespians and it's rapid-fire dialogue are great. This film was definitely a superior film to the standard gangster, crime thriller offered. However, the humor, for me detracts from the overall enjoyment. The humor, for me, makes this an inferior film to Layer Cake. But this film is good, well written and competently directed. While I have never been a fan of Josh Hartnett, and still am not, his presence in the film was adequately played, especially when placed in scenes with Freeman & Sir Ben. Willis, seems to be playing the same character from The Jackal, nothing special there. The director definitely has a future in this business as do the writers, very well done. Grade A production for a Grade A cast.",Null,0,2,21 September 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Explain please. Why this is a great film?
","Why? Is it because the film is made by Ang Lee, the heralded director of that masterpiece known as 'The Hulk'? Or is it because the movie wraps itself up in the flag of San Franciso values. I have a European co-worker that laughs and said that he will never quite look at a Clint Eastwood 'spaghetti' western the same way. And I wonder if that is it to some degree. I wonder if Mr. Lee's average film would have been so warmly received if it had been about Taiwanese cultural icons. I doubt it. I doubt it strongly. The fact that this film was so hyped like it was the greatest love story, since , well....Love Story, made me doubt the validity of those claims. It sounded like, and time has proved this to be true, that this is an 'Agenda Film'. They are cowboys! They are homosexuals! Isn't this great! Yea whatever, an ideological film it is, a great piece of cinematic work this is not. Again, time has proved this to be true now that the liberal hype machine has gone on to something else, like.....saving wood elves for instance. Look, I understand that the reactionary response to anyone who does not immediately announce Brokeback as the 'Greatest film ever made' that they immediately get labeled as close-minded at best, homophobic at worst. But that is not it. I don't have any gay friends, but I have plenty of black friends and do not think that Crash was a great film. I just don't believe that if a film's topic is homosexuality or racism it automatically qualifies a film as great.",Null,2,20,15 November 2006
