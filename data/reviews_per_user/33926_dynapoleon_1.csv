United 93," Life-Changing
","Probably the best movie of the year! This movie handles the many different emotions it brings to the surface in a professional and technically proficient way - it is one of the most well-crafted 'docu-dramas' I have ever seen. We sit in the plane with the heroes of that day, we watch it unfold from the perspectives of the flight controllers and NORAD, we feel the confusion, the torment, and ultimately, the victory in the end. It is a great commentary on the human spirit and a great achievement in cinematography and editing. Paul Greengrass has opened up a dialogue that hopefully will never stop - a positive dialogue about that horrible day.",9,51,103,20 April 2006
