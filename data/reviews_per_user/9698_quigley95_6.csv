50 First Dates," Adam Sandler versus Ben Stiller
",Does anyone else think that Sandler and Stiller are very similar when it comes to acting?  Maybe they both went to the same comedy acting school.Watching Adam Sandler in this movie made me think that Ben Stiller and Sandler are very similar actors who star in very similar films.  I think if Ben Stiller had done this movie it would have been a very similar film and he would have acted exactly as Sandler did.The only thing I can say for Sandler in relation to this movie he has shown that he has some other creative talents besides acting which he put to good use in the making of this movie.,6,0,0,18 April 2004
United 93," true to life
","Make no mistake about it this film is hard to watch, bringing out many painful, heart wrenching emotions, sadness, anger, discomfort but it is a film that had to be made and I am glad that the film makers had the courage to go ahead with this project. This is something we should never forget. This is history and a defining moment in the history of humanity on this planet. Neither the event or our sense of fear and outrage should be forgotten or brushed under the carpet.This film tells it as it happened in real time. Outlining what the main points that are known about the day in as much as can possibly known. So many 'true Stories' take artistic license to make the film more entertaining but this film does not try to be entertaining or exciting it tries to show us what happened and to make it as real as possible for the viewer. I really felt like I was there and that is partly because this was a really well made movie and because most of us that watch this movie where there in a sense back sept 11 2001. We all watched CNN and saw with horror and disbelief the plane crashes and the devastation they caused and we still deep inside ourselves feel the pain and hurt.",10,4,7,9 June 2006
Lost in Translation," This film struck a chord with me
","This film is so real and true to so many stories of friendship and love that it must be losely based on a true story.   What did Mr Harris say to Charlotte at the end 'Don't worry you will have a great life and things will work out fine, thanks for making this week  really special for me'",10,1,2,14 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A big disappointment
",This movie was a big disappointment and is'nt much better than the Phantom Menace which was very boring and childish.This film is much the same as the Phantom Menace with lots of new toys to be merchandised.   Every scene has a different type of space ship or Alien race.  Even the good actors in this film are as wooden as Liam Neeson was in the Phantom Menace.  Samuel L. Jackson has nothing to do but sit in the lotus position looking serious with Yoda.  Christopher Lee was the only one that made any effort in the acting front.  The acting is really irrelevant as it is all sets and special effects which are very realistic and could have made this film a joy if it was'nt for the boring and predictable story line.  The 3 original Star Wars Movies are fun and have quite a bit of humour and action but the new films are taking themselves too serious and at the same time being a film for kids trying to be a merchandising platform for more computer games and toy spinoffs.A big disappointment,3,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great Movie not long enough
","I have never read the Lord of the Rings but have read lots of other fantasy books and now see where they all got their ideas from, the great J.R.R.Tolkien.  He has inspired a whole half a century of fantasy books and computer games.The film could definetly been longer it was so good, great special effects and story line.  I will have to go to see it again soon.",10,0,0,29 December 2001
Signs," sells out at the end
",This was a very enjoyable movie full of suspense and in the begining you really are interested in what is going to happen next and the film does begin to give you a sense of fear and forboding and you wonder exactly what is going on.  But unfortunately the film for me sold out big time in the end.  The Sixth Sense and The Others work because they keep you wondering all the way through the film and the Mothman Prophecy also worked for me because you leave the cinema still wondering who or what is the Mothman.   In Signs as in Jeepers Creepers you are eventually shown an unbelievable alien creature and the storyline just loses the plot completely.  For a film to work it has to be believable.  But I think an intelligent Alien race that can travel across the galaxy but can't open doors and are afraid of water just dose'nt make sense to me.I think if Signs had left us wondering just exactly who did make the crop circles and what exactly where they and what did they want then it would have made for a much more interesting film also if the storyline had remained a local phenomonon and not gone to world wide one it would have been more believable.  I think leaving a piece of the supernatural in this movie would have added to its suspense.,6,0,1,28 September 2002
