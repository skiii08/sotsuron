Skyfall," Uncritical admiration
","The image that a typical Bond Movie evokes is one of glitz with hot women, sexy cars and cool gadgets.. how many times have we seen that and wanted more of the same...who wants to grow up? And if that is what you are looking for...Skyfall may not be your poison. I went with an open mind wanting to see what Mendes wanted to convey .. the new genre of 007 movies with Daniel Craig have a different feel ...personally I love them....but Skyfall is in a different league. Casino Royale was an apt beginning..portraying young vulnerable Bond at the start of his career Quantum of Solace fell slightly short of expectations.but Skyfall has a new dimension . It's time for both Bond and Bond fans to mature and introspect... which I suspect is the reason why it did not curry favor with many. Sam Mendes has lent a depth to Skyfall, either not perceived or not to the taste of those who criticize. The opening scene has the usual high impact drama in Istanbul and Daniel Craig with his oozing machismo so very well fits the role despite an older looking Bond, the appeal is immense..A breathtaking train fight, an inadvertent shot by his own accomplice under the orders of M (who has her own desperate compulsions as the Spy Chief ) and the plummeting of an injured Bond far below ...predictably into deep waters... Of course 007 has to survive...and Skyfall then is the journey and survival of a not so perfect Bond in a real world It is the tale of mind winning over matter.. of will, wit and grit over wear and tear.Problem is that when it comes to Bond, most rather prefer exciting fantasy to sombre introspection..The frustration of failed tests and the pain is well conveyed by Craig with his haunting eyes and expression... don't we all know that feeling?.. honestly the breezy nonchalance of the Roger Moore Bond used to be annoying to me. Today's Bond though is in a real world with its despairing uncertainty and danger yet 'made weak by time and fate' ( how brilliant to make M quote these lines of Tennyson) and in a catch 22 situation...and how does he deal with it? Bond's foray is a lesson unto us. What appeals is that he is a doer, an action man, not one after power , but dispelling his duties , however difficult or absurd that may be , unquestioningly with a passion and will power that overcome his disabilities. He says he knows everything to be known of fear, that at once dispels doubts of the foolhardiness and cloaks his daring in admirable light and Craig is so convincing.His devotion to M hint at the emotional side to him Although portrayed as a substance addict and womanizer, what is contrary is that he loves each woman with a passion and sincerity that leaves the woman happier than she was.. and no false promises qualities that do not conform to the dictionary definition of the same. The villain is played to perfection by Javier Bardem  he steals the limelight at times...his resentment against M has a pathos to it.. you cannot entirely dislike him . M on the other hand has a darker aspect .. the ruthlessness with her agents, but her softness for Bond also manifests. Skyfall has characters with shades of gray but Bond steps out from the shadows and stands tall ..making the choice of facing death every day, yet enjoying Life with a passion and energy, at times reaching the doorstep of death, yet choosing resurrection and duty... a modern Sisyphus..Bond lives life full without looking backBond lives in the present moment...and so is alive every minute....if only we all could do so Seen from this viewpoint, I don't think Skyfall can disappoint,it touches somewhere deep and restores faith....",9,2,18,4 November 2012
Life of Pi," A visual and spiritual treat
","Yann Martel's Life of Pi, a Man Booker Prize winner is no doubt an enchanting read..I would never have imagined it coming to life on screen, but Director Ang Lee achieves the unachievable. If you thought Crouching tiger..was exceptional, Life of Pi is even more so...the story of sixteen year old Pi who survives a shipwreck and his unending adventure in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat  with a Royal Bengal tiger for companyfor 227 days before he reaches the shores of Mexico. No.the tiger is not a speaking one like the benevolent lion Aslan in Chronicles of Narniait is wild and ferocious  also a survivor in the shipwreck ..while being transported from India to the Americasso then what happenssee it in the Life of Pi  an immensely watchableactually a must watch film in recent timesof an exceptional quality as was Avatar. What's so great about thisanother fantasy?....yes and no.Life of Pi is a story intended to make you believe in God and his marvelous plan.with layers and layers of revelationsthe script is unbeatable and together with Ang lee's vivid imagery , cinematography and sensitivity .a spiritual and visual masterpiece. Cynics would like to dismiss it as a naive quest for spiritual fulfillment, but understanding Life of Pi necessitates a certain kind of awareness and sensitivity. The movie opens to the tunes of a soulful lullaby sung in Tamil while the camera in slow motion scans the zoo ... owned by Pi's family  the start of a vivid narration of Pi's childhood captured so lovingly bringing a magical quality to the mundane. The unpretentiousness of the cast and characters is heartening. Ang Lee's brief but unprejudiced and accurate portrayal of a foreign cultureis laudable The amazing part of the movie though begins after the shipwreckhow Pi survives the journey, while taking care of the needs of a full grown royal Bengal tiger while needing to save himselfthe revelations that he has, his resourcefulness , courage and spirit Ang Lee's direction and Suraj Sharma's ( young Pi's) earnestness bring conviction to Yann Martel's absurdly magical story as perfectly plausible.the unbelievably real looking tiger ( named Richard Parker! ) is actually digital the oceanic scenes are unadulterated pleasure to behold. The script is designed to make you take stock of your own life, while Pi stumbles on major revelations when Pi decides not to be scared of Richard Parker, but to learn to communicate with him as he decides to train him while battling and surviving in the stormy Pacific. Particularly poignant when he utters the words.. ' Oh God I give myself to you. I am your vesselWhatever comes I want to knowshow me' Ultimately beyond our skepticism and smartness, we need to have faith and let gowith that comes a new found courage and confidence that ferries us beyond the shores of uncertainty and the unknown. Irfan Khan as the adult Pi and Tabu as the mother of young Pi are effortless actors, the young Pi played by Ayush Tandon is marked by heart tugging earnestness, and Suraj Sharma the lead Pi, chosen for his personality and 'soulful eyes' ( Ang Lee in his interview) , does mesmerize you with his performance. So even without any fancy hallowed Hollywood actors, Ang Lee churns out an unexpected treat... the sort that churns you deep within. The last lament of Pi is that Richard Parker , the tiger leaves him at the shores of Mexico without a proper goodbye( maybe too much to expect of a tiger) but it is to remind us of the importance of proper goodbyes in our lives and maybe not to expect when we do not receive them.",9,1,4,9 December 2012
