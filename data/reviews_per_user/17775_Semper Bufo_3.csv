Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," satisfaction...
","I was SO worried about the new 'Star Wars' installment.  For nearly a year, my brother and I discussed it, sure that with all the new 'gimmicks' Lucas was putting in, he would forget to really make it what 'Star Wars' is all about in the first place.  I even wrote a song about it!  (The chorus says: 'I'm a little worried about Star Wars/Episode One...' and gets even more disparaging from there.  Catchy song though.) The truth was, though, that in the long run I'm just a ten-year-old trapped in an adult's body, and I REALLY wanted this movie to blow me away and make me unstoppably-grinningly, eyes-wide, breath-gone happy.  So despite all my complaints to friends and family, when I got out of rehearsal that fateful Tuesday night, I got home, hopped in the car, and drove to a little theater in my hometown that I knew NOBODY even was aware they were playing Episode One.  The whole way I hoped and prayed I'd like the movie.  I was one of five people in the theater (I called my brother but he had to work the next day!) for the one o'clock showing....and it was magic.  Honestly, from someone who was thoroughly expecting it to be horrible (but hoping it would be wonderful), I was REALLY happy with the movie.  The special effects I'm sure you can all judge for yourselves (fantastic).  The only problem I had there was some of the movement of computer-generated characters was a little unnatural (though the same was fortunately not true of any other computer-generated stuff).  The critics' idea of the acting being wooden is ridiculous - the only 'wooden' acting I saw was some scenes with Natalie Portman, in which it was *appropriate* for her to be so low-key (watch royalty in the presence of peons sometime, right?).  And Jar Jar Binks - well, at first I thought he was cute, then I got a *little* irritated by him, and by the time they got to Tatooine, I just didn't mind anymore, he was just himself and I dealt with it, no problem. Then there's the complaint that most people have...this movie doesn't seem to stand up well on it's own.  But, come on, people, that's the whole POINT! If anyone recalls, Episode Five ('The Empire Strikes Back') was applauded for the guts it took to leave it so open-ended, which Lucas was able to do because he knew he was going to make another sequel.  With 'The Phantom Menace,' he knows he's going to make TWO more movies in this storyline. So of course he can leave it open-ended.  And personally, the only thing that bothers me about this is that I won't be able to see the other two movies for another three and six years respectively! Conclusion: loved it, saw it the next night, then saw it again two days later, and I'd love to see it again.  Can't wait for the next ones. However, it looks like my brother and I will have even more sleepless nights before the next two: thanks to the ABHORRENT rumor that Leonardo DiCaprio has been approached by Lucas (presumably for the role of Anakin).  Please, whatever powers that be, do NOT let Lucas make such a horrible mistake.",Null,0,0,27 May 1999
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Love and Hate at the Same Time
","This film perfectly portrays the simultaneous love and hate you feel at the end of a relationship.Anyone who has loved and lost will be able to understand this movie perfectly.All of the actors did a wonderful job, and Jim Carrey didn't do ANY 'Jim Carrey-isms' that didn't fit in with the movie.  (Thankfully.)  Charlie Kaufman, as usual, came up with an original and moving idea.  Kate Winslet did a FANTASTIC job - even when I hated Clementine, I was in love with her, just as Joel felt.  Kirsten Dunst's plot twist was handled expertly, and just added more feeling to the movie.It was a great film.",Null,0,1,20 March 2004
The Matrix," One-trick pony
","Of course I had to *see* _The Matrix_ (since I couldn't be told what it is?), but I'm wondering if I would have had a different perspective on the movie had I *not* seen/read so much 'behind-the-scenes' info on it.  From the behind-the-scenes stuff (especially the HBO 'First Look'), I knew that it was a couple of guys trying to do in 'real life' what the Japanese do with animation - and in that, they succeeded...but that's not, as it turns out, a good thing.  Japanimation (anime) always has fantastic visuals, cool characters, brilliant action sequences, and a lot of fun high-tech gadgetry...but is usually weak on a coherent plot and any sort of help for a plot-confused audience that is blinded by all the flashy effects.  _The Matrix_ managed to get (unfortunately) *all* of those elements into a live-action film.  While the plot coherency was certainly a notch above films such as _Mission: Impossible_, it clearly took second priority to the brothers Wachowski - they just wanted to create the amazing look of Japanimation in live-action.  Sure, they succeeded...but I was sorely disappointed in the movie, and wondered if - had I not seen the behind-the-scenes - I would have realized *why* it was so convoluted and left me feeling as hungry as a huge Chinese meal two hours later.  _The Matrix_ would've been much better if it *had* been a cartoon, but understandably wouldn't have received as much public attention (since most of the viewing public has yet to show any respect to even *good* animation).",Null,0,0,18 April 1999
