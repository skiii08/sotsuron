Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overall, it was a good movie but considering how long Lucas had this in his head I wasn't too impressed
","Overall, it was a good movie but considering how long Lucas had this in his head I wasn't too impressed. I know he has an amazing mind (see his first movie...THX 1138) but I feel like he was trying to satisfy too many categories of moviegoers all at once. As a result the movie detracted from itself.The effects were very well done but aren't they always now days. As a computer animator, I feel the CG characters stuck out. They were animated, modeled and composited well but they had way too much expression in their voices and motion and contrasted with the live actors.The acting was very mediocre. I didn't have any emotional attachment to the characters due to poor character development and have come to realize that Lucas isn't very good at directing drama. There was too much success based on faith (the force) and not enough human ingenuity.",Null,0,1,15 June 1999
Life Is Beautiful," I personally don't view it as a comedy but a drama about a funny and very powerful human being who wound up at one of the camps
","This was an amazing movie and can't believe the controversy. It wasn't intended to be a documentary on the holocaust and think too many of the negative comments completely look through the point of the movie. I personally don't view it as a comedy but a drama about a funny and very powerful human being who wound up at one of the camps. In order for the movie to work at it's fullest, it did slide a little in terms of how accurately it depicted a concentration camp but the slide did not, by any means, give the wrong impression of the overall seriousness of the holocaust. Consider the fact that practically all the positive comments made on this movie mention how the viewers cried at the end. It would take a pretty soulless individual to walk out of the theater laughing hysterically.Character development was awesome. The first part of the movie was all about absorbing the viewer into the genuine and strong nature of the characters and the tight bond they had between themselves. By the time they make it into the concentration camp, your heart completely sinks.",Null,1,2,16 June 1999
