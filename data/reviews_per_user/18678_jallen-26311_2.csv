The Lobster," Save your money
","I have read reviews on this waste of time that call it a comedy. Okay if you have a very sick sense of humor. I will admit there were very few scenes that were a little bit funny, depending on what one finds funny. However, I spent most of the time wondering why I was still watching this. The idea of the film is interesting, the acting is acceptable, other than that give this a pass until it is out of the theaters. Oh, that is unless you think it will make you 'cool' to say that you wasted that money and the time watching this film. My thought is that it won those awards because people were paid to do so. Film students will see an example of what NOT to do. This could have been a good film had the approach to the characters been better done.",2,25,41,12 May 2016
Mother!," Why did I watch this?
","What just took 2 hours of my life that I want back. What did that mess have to do with a mother? I would get rid my agent if he put me in this mess. These actors should be ashamed of this garbage. I cannot imagine that they thought this would be liked by anyone. Those that have given it more than 1 star have to be family members of those involved. WOW, if I bank rolled this I would want my money back!",Null,0,1,28 August 2018
