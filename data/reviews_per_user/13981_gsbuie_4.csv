Hereditary," Not too bad until
","This was going along fairly well, albeit a touch slow, until it hung a sharp left onto WTF Avenue. The lead up is pretty interesting but the end was very anticlimactic.
I was left with a few questions.
Did these people not have cell phones?
Did Gabriel Byrne even need to be in the movie?
Why were the people naked at the end?
My favorite part of the movie were the dioramas the mom made.",4,2,6,14 September 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Really not anyone's finest work
","I like the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns and know that he tends to be a slow paced director. With that said, this was beyond painful. My attention started to drift around 20 minutes in. Next thing I know I'm doing laundry and not missing a whole lot of nothing. So at 1.25 I pulled the pulg.
So watch Goodfellas and The Godfather and you'll see the same movie as Once Upon a Time in America wants to be and you'll have spent approximately the same amount of time but you won't be bored to numbness. Side note, James Woods is a poor man's Robert Deniro and when cast against him or becomes so obvious.",2,3,9,28 August 2019
Inside Man," Everything a heist movie should be!
","I saw this movie soon after it came out, loved it and rated, it on IMBD, an 8. I recently watched it again and had to come back up my rating to 10 and leave a brief review. The sole reason was the last 10 or so minutes raise the movie from great to unbelievably incredible. Denzel Washington is at his finest and the movie proves anyone who has thought Spike Lee to be a bad or biased director wrong.",10,0,1,7 September 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Decaprio good, Scorseses bad
","Wolf of Wall Street was far longer than it should have been. Yes it's a Scorseses but this story did not warrant 2.59 minutes to establish itself. Jordan Belfort and company were obviously out of control, drug abusing, power and money mad characters did Scorseses have to keep reinforcing that with useless scenes? There were at least 2 instances where, fully aware of Jordan's personality, that needs to be reinforced? Did Jordan really need to be shown with the dominatrix? And with Aunt Emma? I contrast this with Casino, 2.58 hrs, every bit of that time has purpose. But Deniro, the focus of the movie, had Pesci to support him. DeCaprio was brilliant as the focus of the movie but had no one to support him. Jonah Hill?!? No. He was good but not good enough. The SEC, sure. But an expanded FBI plot line would have given Decaprio some help.
Overall not Scorseses best",6,0,1,19 August 2019
