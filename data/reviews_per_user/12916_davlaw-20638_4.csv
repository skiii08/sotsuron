Hereditary," Really quite scary
","No high faluting analysis needed here. It's a ghost story pure and simple, with some really well done and scary scenes, especially one in the last twenty minutes. Don't watch if you're easily scared and don't like the dark corner of your bedroom! Gory scene near the beginning which is REALLY scary! Toni Collette is superb and her performance is rather scary too. I don't mean in a cynical way. She's brilliant. Oscar standard. Gabriel Byrne is ok too. The movie is about bereavement, ghosts, and a demon and his worshipers. I think it's the best supernatural movie I've seen in fact.",9,3,4,17 July 2019
Match Point," Great, just great!
",This movie is somewhat formulaic for the first hour and a half. Menage a trois and all that. But the last half hour! You won't expect it I promise! Superb acting by everyone.,10,0,1,9 September 2019
A Quiet Place," Just plain silly
","Yeah, there's the toddler left to bring up the rear of the group. Daft! Then there's the mom telling her boy that he's alright to go with dad as dad will protect him! Daft! Yeah, and mom's going to have a (noisy) baby! Daft! And our brave family could never be quiet enough to avoid creatures dependant so much on sound for their survival! Why all the high scores?",1,5,9,13 March 2020
Sully," A great movie
","This movie brings to life what was a very dramatic but quite short event (208 seconds airborne to 'landing'?). Tom Hanks is superb and well supported by the other cast members. It really makes one think how frightening it must have been for the passengers but also for the crew. The flight attendants are portrayed properly as professionals, not as I must say is done in some air disaster movies, terrified and panicky! Dramatic licence is probably necessary even in a movie with this subject but you can't really tell! One slight criticism if you don't mind. The NTSB are portrayed as out to get Sully or it seems that way. Not being American though, I don't know how these hearings are conducted.",9,0,0,31 May 2019
