The Blair Witch Project," An original piece of filmmaking
","i saw this film at the Cannes Film festival and thought it to be probably one of the most original films I've seen. While i didn't think it was as scary as others, it was a completely original premise that was done in a unique style. You'll enjoy it because there's nothing out there like it. Raw documetary-style at its best.",8,1,2,2 June 1999
