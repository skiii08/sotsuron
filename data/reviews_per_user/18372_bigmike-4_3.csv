Deja Vu," Could have been so much more...
","With the time travel scenario, this could have been so much more. The writers could have introduced overlapping scenarios that could have created a paradox. They could have written this so the 'bad guy' scenario was more complex. Unfortunately, they dumbed this down to avoid confusing the average idiot.There were moments where this film could have gotten more interesting and just fell flat.'Out of Time' was a far better thriller. This was like 'Out of Time' with less energy and more fancy cinematography. Rent this one. Buy Denzel's previous thriller 'Out of Time' instead.",7,0,0,27 April 2007
John Wick," Those who gave it a negative review were right on the money
","John Wick is some super assassin who left the biz and got married. His wife dies of cancer, he runs into some Russian punks we decide to beat him up, steal his car, and kill his dog. John decides he's going to get revenge and spends the next 90 minutes killing everyone in his path. The action is decent, but we've seen it in Jason Statham's movies already, so nothing terribly new here.The film hints at some secret underground society of assassins, but totally drops the ball by failing to flesh any of this out. Ahh, what could have been.Not the worst movie I've seen, but it's still pretty weak.",4,4,11,7 February 2015
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Ferrell's weakest yet..
","Sure this movie will make millions due to Ferrell's popularity, not to mention the fantastic trailers.. but I must say I was rather disappointed at how lame this movie is. So many moments felt like they were taken right off an Elementary School playground; the scene where Christina Applegate tells Ron Burgundy that he has bad hair is a perfect example. It just wasn't that funny. Much of the humor was so lame that I found myself doing a 'half-chuckle' because lines were so often not really funny, but mildly amusing at best. Make no mistake, there are few belly laugh's in this one.Even if you're a die-hard Ferrell fan I would suggest you go see it as a matinee or wait for the DVD to rent. If you can't stand Ferrell, do yourself a favor and stay home.4/10",7,3,4,10 July 2004
