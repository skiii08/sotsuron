The Ring," about the ring
","I watched in fear and cold horror of a bizarre movie that now has me unable to even use the toilet for fear of something coming up and grabbing me. After 20 minutes I am unable to leave the presumed safety of my third floor to let my dog out because it will mean leaving this room. There are not enough lights in my house because I remember that bad things happened with all the lights on. I know full well that this movie was made to scare people like me who may have an overactive imagination and through writing out this comment I am hoping to feel better.The idea that she killed the daughter she wanted so badly to have vilifies me. I am trying to make sense of this movie, with all its images, somewhat ingrained on my mind. I am fearful of my sleep tonight and what dreams I may have. This was a superb movie but I can't give it an excellent vote because I am still petrified and being petrified is not something that makes a movie excellent to me.",8,1,2,9 January 2005
