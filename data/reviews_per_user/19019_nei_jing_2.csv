Ali," Entertaining but empty
","I think Will Smith is a bit vacant in the role of Muhammad Ali, not so much because of his acting ability, but there seemed to me not to be that much acting in the script. Most of the time he is either womanizing or staring vacantly into the air. This is supposed to show his look on the world, how it affects him, but it doesn't come across very well in my opinion. Not a bad movie though, the fighting scenes are very well made.",6,0,0,24 March 2003
We Were Soldiers," Trouble sleeping
","I find that people describing Mel Gibson as the 'hero' in this one, in the mold of John Wayne is just wrong. This movie in my eyes had no heroes and it made me sick to the stomach, which I haven't felt in a long long time. Both sides are depicted as men fighting in a war that in itself only meant something to one side, the Vietnamese, but where everyone fights because they have to, to survive. In a normal warmovie, say Germany vs. US in WWII, we don't see the face of the enemy, but only the Hurrah!!! Brave, Brave American soldierrrrr. This movie shows that both sides in a war have families, and that they are all human. Wars are fought because 'clever men' covet one thing or another, be it land, oil or in a current case to get a war named after him because someone stole his fathers thunder.I have just watched this movie, and am now going home to meditate to rid my mind of the gore which seemed all to realistic to me. I hope none of us will ever have to be in the same situation as any of these people.Sweet dreams, peace be with you.",Null,2,3,16 March 2003
