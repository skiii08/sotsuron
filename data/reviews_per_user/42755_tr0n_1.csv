Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I think I have fallen in love with this movie
","I really do.The way everything is told, the contrast compared to the fist one, the originally, the recycling of old TV / movie styles into a new form. And the hidden 'movie fan' stuff. Many people will not see it, but it's there. It just works and it works very, very well.I really loved the first one, but I have totally fallen in love with the second. Hard to explain why, it just made a big impact on me.And the soundtrack. Brilliant. It's not just that the music rocks, it's also how and when it's used in the movie. For example Ennio Morricone - L Arena or Malcolm Mclaren - About Her.Sweet, lovely, brutal, smart and just plain cool. Mr. Quentin, you've got a winner!",10,1,3,22 April 2004
