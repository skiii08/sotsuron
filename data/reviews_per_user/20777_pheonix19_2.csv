Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Genius
","I need not explain why Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is perhaps the most well-known movie of 1999.  The Star Wars saga that has taken the world by storm for over 20 years finally continues with an all-new storyline, and seeks to explain some of the mysteries of the original trilogies.Granted, not everyone will like it.  When as much hype as the Phantom Menace had surrounds a movie, there are bound to be some letdowns.   Even some fans of the original trilogy found that without their favorite characters the story was not as compelling.  However, what people tend to overlook is the real genius at work here.  George Lucas has succeeded in creating a story full of classic archetypes set in space--something never before attempted.Star Wars (and more noticibly in The Phantom Menace) goes beyond science fiction.  It goes beyond fantasy.  Lucas' story is fun, nostalgic, spiritual, creative, and a breakthrough in movie technology.  Ultimately, it is about humanity and it's constant fight to find balance.  It cannot be rightfully compared to the stories of Star Trek, 2001: A Space Odessey, or The Matrix (which, for some reason, people have a tendency to compare to The Phantom Menace more than anything else).  It's  not perfect, but there again, few works are.  To miss The Phantom Menace (or any Star Wars film) is to miss out on one of the most unique and innovative film experiences available.  Don't miss it!",Null,0,0,27 March 2000
The Exorcist," Unmatched brilliance
","There is a reason for the hysteria and mystique surrounding THE EXORCIST. And it's called genius.Never have I seen a film matched in shock, terror, writing, or performances. This isn't a horror movie.  The film itself is both a moving and terrifying drama that takes a realistic look at what would actually happen if a young girl were possessed in modern America.  William Peter Blatty's script is amazing, bringing depth to the characters, and presenting the mystery of faith that they all deal with.  Is Regan possessed?  Is she insane?  And most importantly, Is there a God?  In the course of two hours, we see a sweet and innocent young girl become a cross masturbating, head spinning, murderous, creature.  We see a successful actress overcome skepticism to save her daughter, and we see a brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion to God as a priest.Friedkin's direction is marvelous, with wonderful uses of light, dark, and color throughout the film.  Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) is beautifully subtle in his first film acting role.  Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb provide engaging supporting performances as the experienced priest who senses his impending doom, and a detective who senses something sinister is at work. Ellen Burstyn gives a brutally honest performance as a grief stricken woman trying to save her daughter.  And most of all, a 12-year-old Linda Blair gives one of the most terrifying, convincing, and beautiful performances ever shown on film.  Her range of emotion and connection to Regan are astonishing.  She deserved that Oscar!THE EXORCIST presents to us the mystery of faith in it's most raw form--the battle of good and evil.  It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects.  It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work.  In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there.",10,277,337,28 March 2000
