Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the greatest, but still amazing
","After seeing it I could understand why some critics didn't like it.  The first half of the movie is rather jumbled, and you never really get a feel for some of the characters.  The Gungan accents are usually irritating and indecipherable (though the Trade Federation aliens and Watto's accents are cool and entertaining).  Worse, Anakin Skywalker is a really annoying kid (except when he's hitting on Natalie Portman).But on the whole, this is ONE amazing movie.  The scenes will constantly leave your jaw hanging, and some of the action will just make you go 'woah'. Should be the definition of 'computer effects' for a while.  And luckily, all the pieces finally come together in the final half of the movie, and the finale is spectacular.  There are also many hilarious/ironic details and moments.Overall, this is a fantastic movie; not great, but certainly NOT shabby. Maybe one notch beneath Return of the Jedi, which is probably the least greatest of The Three.  Episode I also bears a lot of similarity to A New Hope in many ways, except it doesn't have as strong a 'soul' as that movie did.  But anyway, go see this movie a few times!  You won't be able to resist not doing so, and plus the second time around it's much better.",8,0,0,23 May 1999
