Angels & Demons," A pile of steaming jobbies
","I've had this video hanging around for a while, as I wanted to forget the book I'd read in order to have some suspense. Boy, was I disappointed! The Dan Brown novel (which was a bit shite) at least explained the tourist trip from one execution place to the other, whereas the movie had some mumbling, and despite rewinds, I still didn't know what they were on about. I tried to remember the plot from the book, but -- you know -- it was instantly forgettable. The movie, more so.If I had seen this film without having read the book, I would have had no idea what was fricking happening. Having read the book and kinda forgotten it, I still had little idea.A pile of steaming jobbies, but not the worst movie I have ever seen, marginally.",3,0,1,23 September 2016
