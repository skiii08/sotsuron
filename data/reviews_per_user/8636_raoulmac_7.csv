The special effects and sound design are fantastic.
The story and tone are highly engaging, and leave room for further additions to the franchise without leaving messy loose ends.I would definitely recommend this movie.",8,0,10,26 December 2019
Come and See," No One Wins
","This tremendous dive into human misery is carried by an absolutely staggering performance by young lead actor Aleksey Kravchenko.Once the slow start of this film has carefully wound you along, its steadily increasing pace methodically cuts away at your spirit, chasing and wearing you down along with its damaged protagonist.As a fan of horror movies and a connoisseur of extreme cinema, I can confidently state that there are few rivals to the horror of this film, due to its skilfully frightening reproduction of real human history, and an array of impeccable performances from across the entire cast.I found that I was having to remind myself I was watching a movie three quarters of the way through, and I breathed somewhat of a relieved sigh after the final sequence ended - the final sequence, by the way, is brilliant.If you like films that are tough to watch, sit yourself down and add this one to the list.",9,0,0,19 March 2020
The Mist," The final 5 minutes make it worthwile
