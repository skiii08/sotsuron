The Ring," Scariest PG-13 movie ever!
","This is the scariest PG-13 movie I've ever seen, and quite disturbing. Beautiful to look at, with a horrifying twist ending that is unusual for Hollywood. My only two complaints ***SPOILERS*** are 1) that the annoying psychic kid didn't mention that he knew what his mom and dad were supposed to do, so of course, they screwed up and (understandably) did the wrong thing, making you think it was a typical 'lay your bones to rest' type ghost story, when in fact it was infinitely more sinister; and 2) that the real reason everyone hated and feared the ghost girl was never really explained. Otherwise, this is a perfect movie. Parents should avoid taking young children to see this (2 such families got up and walked out halfway through when I saw it, LOL), because the kids will have nightmares for weeks or months after seeing this film! I'm an adult and a horror movie junkie, but even I got a little nervous around bedtime, because I couldn't get some of those sick images from the movie out of my head and was afraid I'd have a bad dream! THE RING is one of the most successful chiller-thrillers ever committed to celluloid, but don't give Dreamworks all the credit---it was originally a 1998 Japanese movie mega-hit that SKG remade for American audiences. I have not seen the Japanese version, but am going to track it down (especially if I can find a copy with English subtitles). If you want to be scared, go see THE RING!!!",9,0,0,20 October 2002
Divergent," A boring, sanitized version with no chemistry between the leads
","I read the trilogy (which was nothing special and kept getting more annoying each sequel), but at least the first book had some kind of * something * to it. The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a 'save the cat' moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed. Not once did I feel anyone's life was in danger. Not once did I perceive any credible romantic chemistry between Tris and Four. Not once did I laugh, cry, or feel anything but bored. And it goes on for two and a half hours! Ugh. Sure, the production values are high, but who cares if I can't relate to any of the characters or the story? It's just a dumb waste of time. I didn't hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.However, I'm glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job. The reason all the recent YA adaptations tanked at the box office is because they sucked (Vampire Academy, Beautiful Creatures, City of Bones). The only decent one I can remember was Warm Bodies.",3,95,148,24 March 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Another groan-inducing pathetic money-grab typical of Hollywood
","This was a terrible, boring movie with all the awful comic relief, one-liners, and cartoonish, over-the-top retarded action typical of brain-dead Hollywood blockbuster garbage. The magic of the original trilogy is gone, replaced by Phantom Menace stupidity. This is a movie not even worth watching once, except for the only highlight, which is the riddling contest between Bilbo and Gollum--the rest of the movie is pointless drivel. I almost fell asleep so many times only to open my eyes to yet another groan-inducing action scene or musical number. The Goblin King looks like Jar-Jar Binks on acid with a skin condition and goiter and about as much intelligence and personality. The three trolls behave like the Three Stooges. You only see Smaug the dragon for a few seconds and the Necromancer for less than that. Radagast the Brown is a crazy magic mushroom-tripping wizard with bird-poop running down his face and crusted to his beard who drives a magic sled pulled by giant bunny rabbits. Retarded!!! Hated all the new annoying characters except the main dwarfs (Thorin, Balin, and Dwalin, IIRC). Bilbo didn't get to do much. Other characters (Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo) have pointless cameos and add zero to the story, just drag the unendurable running time out even further. There's some lame attempt to connect this story to the Lord of the Rings, but that amounts to a couple lines in a boring round-table conversation between the cameo cast. Despite all the stupid action, nobody on the team ever dies or is in any real danger as they get saved at the last minute by Gandalf every time things don't go their way. So there's zero suspense. The action is so impossible to believe at times that it makes most cartoons look realistic by comparison. I suppose it's better than the god-awful Phantom Menace (which also only had one cool scene with Darth Maul's fight), but not by much. It feels like a parody of the original LotR trilogy. Shame on everyone involved for drinking the Kool Aid and signing off on this pathetic money-grab.",1,86,184,17 December 2012
