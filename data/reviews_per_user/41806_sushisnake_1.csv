Blade Runner 2049," Religious mythology wrecked it for me
","Three stars for the visuals, which were spectacular but somehow didn't give me the sense of horrified awe the original film did. As for the film itself, why did they put religious mythology in it? WHY?I'll stick with 'All those moments lost in time, like tears in the rain' sans souls, thanks. Deeply disappointing sequel.",3,7,15,15 October 2017
