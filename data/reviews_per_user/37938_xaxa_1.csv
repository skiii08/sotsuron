Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A bad movie for kids
","No plot. No humor. No beautiful landscapes. Poor dialogues. Ridiculous creatures (jar jar). This is a bad movie for kids. I really enjoyed the trilogy, because it contained all the elements of a good sci-fi movie : hi-tech (not too much), space and stars, imaginary, poetry, dream, aestheticism, a quest for the good against the evil, a reflection on the consequences of an excessive technology... all that is not present in the Phantom Menace. It's just a way to show the talents of some engineers (they are talented, actually), and to make money, of course.",3,0,1,6 June 1999
