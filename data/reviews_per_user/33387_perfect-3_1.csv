Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is crap.
","There are at least 1000 movies in this database that are better than this one, but are rated lower, haven't been seen, haven't been voted on.There are at least 100 BAD movies in this database that have better stories, better characters, or better acting.This is the work of a cult.  You folks that worship Stars Wars so much that you will watch anything Lucas does and swoon over it, you are in a cult. Get help.Now having said that, there were some good scenes.
