Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A masterpiece and a fitting first chapter in the saga...
","I'm not a doctor, so I'd be the last to give someone medical advice. Nor am I a lawyer, so I wouldn't be the guy to instruct a person on matters of the law. Unfortunately, when it comes to movies, everyone feels they're experts. The net result of such assumptions are negative reviews about certain movies, such as some of those that were written for Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace. It is, was, and shall remain a movie for fans. True fans that have enough sense to realize that Phantom is the first chapter of a three-part trilogy, which is, in turn part of a six-part whole. To criticize Phantom for having under-developed characters like Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) or Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) only demonstrates ignorance of this fact. And guess what? If you're not a Star Wars fan, you're not going to dig it anyway.Phantom Menace is a stunning achievement technically and visually, and that is a fact. However, what a person thinks about the movie -- and indeed about any art form, any movie -- is truly subjective, and it's folly to try to bend someone to your personal opinions (mind-tricks aside).
As a true fan, I'm confident in saying Phantom Menace is mind-blowing -- a masterpiece and a fitting first chapter in the saga. I've seen it nine times in the theater and have shared my opinions about it to Lucas and company personally.For those who call themselves Star Wars fans and claim to be disappointed with the film, I recommend highly seeing it more, and you may think differently about it.",Null,2,10,11 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," A masterpiece
","This latest cinematic retelling of the Washington Irving classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a moody, brilliant work, but fans of director Tim Burton have come to expect nothing less from the filmmaker.As with all great films, Sleepy Hollow is anchored by a great screenplay, and this film features yet another dazzling effort by former Tower Records-clerk-turned-Seven writing phenom Andrew Kevin Walker. (Walker also shares a 'story-by' credit with Sleepy Hollow's co-producer, and special effects artist Kevin Yagher.)Walker's script changes to Irving's tale are minor, but clever and incredibly effective. No longer a schoolteacher, Walker's vision of Ichabod Crane - perfectly played by Johnny Depp - is that of a skittish, eccentric police constable from New York City.On the eve of a new century (1799, that is), Crane is sent by his superiors to a quaint Northern New York town known as Sleepy Hollow, so he can use 'the latest in scientific techniques' to apprehend a head-severing perp known to the locals as The Headless Horseman. Indeed, much of the humor of Depp's character stems from his use of his own nascent version of forensic pathology, and Crane's unconventional investigative techniques - in a time of witchcraft and superstition - cause immediate friction with the locals.
Once in town, Crane learns about the Horseman's legend, which purports he was once a bloodthirsty soldier sent to hell after his own head was taken by his enemies. And the awkward young constable also meets the daughter of a prominent town figure, the beautiful Katrina Van Tassell (Christina Ricci), and she and Crane immediately gravitate toward one another. However, the Headless Horseman's affinity for lopping off the noggins of townspeople puts their budding romance on hold.Crane soon realizes that - science be damned - there's no debunking to be done in Sleepy Hollow, and the Horseman is terribly real. Burton's vision of the Headless Horseman is truly frightening - an adversary possessing unspeakable power and unbelievable fighting prowess. Played for most of the film by Ray Park - the multitalented martial artist behind the tatooed face and double-bladed lightsaber of Phantom Menace's Darth Maul, the Horseman is more than a match for Crane, or any of the townspeople - except for the one who summoned the dark rider from hell.The movie also stars Christopher Walken, veteran character actor Jeffrey Jones, as well as legendary British thesp (and another Phantom Menace alum) Ian McDiarmid. Miranda Richardson is also brilliant, as is the bevy of lauded British stage actors, including Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee (soon to appear in Lord of the Rings) and Michael Gough.Tim Burton's latest achievement was a dream project for many of the film's principles, and it shows. Sleepy Hollow is a masterpiece, securing the director's place among cinema's greatest storytellers.",Null,0,0,4 January 2000
Being John Malkovich," Bloody brilliant.
","A real masterpiece. BJM is an unapologetically bizarre, well crafted, well written and well-acted film -- a true original and an instant classic. For every would-be screenwriter out there who feels he/she must write the next giant asteroid flick or sequel to Wild, Wild West just to sell a script, this movie should provide the adequate glimmer of hope.",Null,1,1,7 October 1999

Gladiator," Absolutely stunning; an instant classic.
","Gladiator is a film that will be remembered for a long time. A four-star masterpiece and an instant classic, the film will not only solidify Russell Crowe as one of the best actors of his generation, it should also reacquaint the world with the sometimes unfortunately forgotten genius of Ridley Scott.The film follows Crowe as a Roman general named Maximus; a man feared by his enemies and revered by his men. Gladiator opens with a crawl reminding the audience of the might of ancient Rome, and the breadth of its power -- at one time, 'one quarter of the world lived and died' under the rule of the Caesars. The picture begins with the last battle between Rome and the 'barbarians' in then-Germania -- a stunning sequence which not only sets the tone for the dazzling spectacle the movie becomes, but also shows the viewer how exactly skilled the Romans were in the art of war. Without revealing too much of the plot, a new emperor (an amazing Joaquin Phoenix) takes power, and Maximus is sent into slavery. As a slave he soon becomes a gladiator -- as was the practice under some of the Caesars, and his skill on the battlefield translates well to the arena. Soon thousands flock to the Coliseum -- flawlessly created with the help of              computer-generated shots -- to see Maximus fight. By winning the crowd, Maxiumus hopes to get a chance to seek his revenge on Commodus, the unjust ruler who ruined his life. The film is stunning in every respect -- from acting, to action, to direction, to set design, and should become an instant classic.",Null,0,0,1 May 2000
