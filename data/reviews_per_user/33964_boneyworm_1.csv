Skyfall," Oh so good to be back Mr. Bond!
","Wow...I couldn't believe just how good this film was! I went not really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.It's good to have you back Mr. Bond!! I really felt thrilled and on the edge of my seat watching this film and it had some really great moments. It took me back to some of the original films and was witty and clever.I think Sam Mendes did a good job and the characters came to life, the story was well thought out and the music was great. I reckon this is one of the best. There wasn't one moment when I felt bored or fed up, and the time flew even though we were in there for two and a half hours.A must see for any Bond fans, or even if you just like a really good thriller.10/10. Excellent entertaining stuff!",10,5,15,11 November 2012
