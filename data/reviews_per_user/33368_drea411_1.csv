Requiem for a Dream," A movie that will haunt you forever!
","Every time I close my eyes since watching this movie I suffer flashbacks to it. It is haunting, honest, brutal and hopeless. I have never had such a violent, physical reaction to any movie I have ever seen. I gagged, cried, laughed and felt like I was joining the characters in their lunacy. A must see movie - but prepare to be haunted.",10,0,0,28 August 2001
