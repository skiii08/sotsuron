Blade Runner 2049," Style over substance
","Being a fan of the first movie, I was looking forward to watching this one, and I was left very disappointed. The first movie surpasses this one by a mile in about every department. The problem with 2049 is that it seems like it doesn't have any good ideas at all, it's not daring, it's just bland. The production is top notch but that's about it. First the characters, the most important part of the movie. There aren't any interesting or memorable characters in 2049. Only Niander Wallace was slightly interesting but he's so much outside the main story that you kind of forget about him, he appears at the beginning and towards the end. All the replicants in the original movie had a sort of psycho edge to them, they had emotions, they caught your attention. Here they're just like a bunch of dull androids literally, including the main character 'K'. And even the minor characters in the original were all memorable, Tyrell, Sebastian, Hannibal, they were all unique and interesting. In this one there is nothing of that. Second the story and the situations. In the first movie things were happening, slow moody scenes were followed by action sequences and they kind of completed each other seamlessly. You would marvel at the style and then marvel at the action. In this one, it looks like just endless stylish slow scenes that drag on and on. And since they don't get anywhere they become sort of pointless. It all feels incredibly slow. The story itself had some potential but it's not developed properly, where are all the ideas? The 'love story' if we can call it that between 'k' and 'Joy' is just completely forgettable. I don't blame the director, he did all he could with what he had I suppose. When compared to the original masterpiece, 2049 is a complete disappointment on all fronts. As a standalone movie is okish but I wouldn't want to watch it again.",6,6,12,17 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Great movie, except for Diego Luna
","Loved the movie, I think by far the best star wars movie after the original trilogy. Didn't like 'the force awakens' at all. In fact, if they could erase the other 4 star wars movie and just leave this one and the original 3 and that would be perfect. Rogue One is a great movie, no doubt about it. The only thing I didn't really like is the choice to use Diego Luna as one of the main characters. I've never seen him before but I wasn't impressed. He seemed like a one-dimensional character throughout the whole movie and was not up to the standard of everybody else in my opinion. He just had this annoying grumpy face in every scene and weird accent which was a bit annoying and monotone. But apart from that, I'm very happy that we finally get to see a great star wars movie after all these years. Well done to everybody, especially the director. Bravo.",9,2,4,21 March 2017
Passengers," Great Movie
","I enjoyed this movie. Never a boring moment, it kept me interested the whole time. Great story , good acting, amazing visuals. I was impressed by Lawrence's acting, I usually don't like her very much, but I have to say that she does a good job in this movie, even better then the male actor I can't remember his name now. Well done.",8,1,2,25 June 2017
Terminator Salvation," Ewwww
","There are about 3 minutes in terminator 2 'the judgement day' at the beginning of the movie that show the battle against the machines. Probably about 5 minutes in the first one. If you combine those two 'flash forward scenes' you'll get in less than 10 minutes a better movie than this disaster. That alone can tell you my opinion of this movie. You can see that efforts have been made but there's no involvement in the movie, it's dull, unoriginal and uninspiring. The third was already a step down but this is worse in my opinion. Don't watch it, there's no point, it just ruins a series that was already compromised by the 'rise of the machines'.",2,1,4,20 February 2010
Bird Box," Good movie but the premise doesn't hold up
","Watching the Bird Box reminded me of 'A quite place', another recent apocalyptic movie I watched recently. When I finished watching 'A quite place' I was left satisfied and that was not the case with Bird Box. Both movie are very well done, have great productions and great acting. The difference is that the premise of Bird Box is not explained very well throughout the movie and without a strong premise everything else is affected in the end. Throughout the movie you're kind of left waiting to see what is driving people crazy and suicidal and hoping for god's sake that they will show you but it never happens. There's an invisible evil force and we basically don't know anything about it. It behaves differently in different kinds of situations. Just one example, why did Malorie and the kids hear the voices in their heads only when they are outside? The same goes for moving objects, the car was being moved outside but nothing ever moved when they were indoor. I mean, is that thing not capable of going inside?
So all in all , this could have been much better movie if they had focused on re-enforcing the initial premise of the movie and provide more details to the audience. I can almost picture in my head what those who came up with this idea were thinking. 'Let's make a horror movie where people can't keep their eyes open!'. Well that's a very good idea but unfortunately it was not developed to its full potential. 'A quite place' on the other hand didn't leave any stones unturned. All in all Bird Box is a solid movie but it leaves you hanging and I hope they make a sequel where they explain what the heck this evil thing is and what it looks like. And that somehow would retroactively make the first movie better, just like a show series with unexplained situations, that becomes better as a whole, when they explain things later on.",7,0,4,27 December 2018
28 Days Later...," good horror movie
","Wow! This was a really good movie. As a horror movie fan I can say that I needed this movie.  The first half is just perfect , it blew me away. I mean it is much more realistic than many other movies (not all of them of course) dealing with zombies, the end of mankind or whatever. In the second part there is a good twist in the story but then the movie gets stucked somewhere and I didn't really like the ending. It's still very entertaining though thanks to the good acting ,the camera action and a creepy atmosphere. I will see it again soon and I hope they'll make a sequel to this. Anyway, I'll cut this short, see this movie!   First half: 9/10 Second Half: 6/10. Overall 8/10.",8,0,0,12 September 2003
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What a bore fest!
","If this move hadn't been made by Tarantino the score would be cut in half.
But since he's the director all his fans are trying to find some geniality in the movie that just isn't there. It's just sooo boring.Brad Pitt has one facial expression in the whole movie, and that's ok if he has a small side role, but not ok if he's on screen half of the movie. Margot Robbie side story is completely forgettable and disjointed from the rest of the movie, in fact you could cut all her scenes and nothing would change, except you would have to endure the flick for half hour less. DiCaprio stuttering sounds really forced and fake.There's some over the top action and acting in the end which is mildly entertaining but not enough to save the movie. It's completely unrealistic. The days of raw realistic acting of Reservoir Dogs are gone.A couple of things I liked: When Rick Dolton is struggling to deliver a good performance and then he's angry, talks to himself, comes back and then delivers a great performance. That was good, it showed some emotions and him overcoming his fears. Also the Bruce Lee bit was pretty good, Mike Moh was incredible.But all in all 'Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood' is a boring disordered mish mash that I wish I hadn't seen .",4,5,8,15 February 2020
I Am Legend," CGI Disaster!
","Add another one to the list of movies ruined by the computer. Actually I think this one deserves spot number 1 because there was no need at all of CGI. Imagine if 'Dawn of the dead' or '28 days later' had some plastic computer generated puppets instead of realistic zombie characters. That can give you an idea of how bad this film looks as soon as CGI pops up! What in the world were the producer thinking?? I really wanted to like this movie having read the book and I also don't mind the changes they made in the story. The actors did a good job , the adaptation is alright, and everything else is well done. So that's it, this is officially the ultimate cgi disaster movie. And don't expect some King Kong like computer animations, no these ones actually look like rubbish.",7,2,5,25 December 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," stylish and entertaining movie with flaws (7/10)
","I totally agree with the guy who says that Kill Bill vol. 1 is a movie with both good and bad scenes. Some parts of the movie are very well done, with class, and style like only Tarantino can do.  He makes the goriest scenes look like an art form. There's good japanese music that creates the perfect atmosphere and a lot of blood. However you won't find really interesting dialogues between the characters and when k.b. turns into a sensless kung-fu action movie , it's a little disappointing.  15 minutes of swordplay and wired stunts are boring, and spoil in part the rest of the movie. I would still recommend it because it's highly entertaining but if you are not into martial arts go with low expectations. Kill Bill v.1 is much better than Jackie Brown  but doesn't even come close to Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.",10,0,1,21 October 2003
The Dark Knight," The 'Dull' Knight
","It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy.The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere. The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change. Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids.The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version. Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression.",1,83,196,30 August 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," good, not great
","I felt a bit disappointed with mixed feelings. I really wanted to like it but I didn't.  It was confusing and predictable. Some special effects were really good some looked just fake. The ghost army sucked. It appeared for 30 seconds and then the battle was over.  The ending was endless. There are also a lot of good points: spectacular shots, great acting, lot of emotions, the spider scene , psycho gollum. Overall pretty good but if your not into fantasy mood go see something else like the last samurai.",6,0,2,21 December 2003
Looper," Boring and disappointing
","On my way home I was thinking about what was wrong with this movie and why I didn't like it. It wanted to be too many things at once, and didn't deliver any of those. If you expect good action , you won't find it here. If you expect a good story, you won't find it either. If you expect drama , there is a little . Special effects, some really good , some really bad. The first 30-40 minutes are the best , the time travel is not a plausible reality but it is cool to imagine and with suspension of disbelief i was really into it and it was quite original too. Then it started falling apart. It turned into a drama of some kind that seemed to be the slo-motion version of what just preceded it. And it made you wonder, 'where are they going with this?'. Then three quarters into the movie everything is revealed to the audience with the most absurd and un-original idea that they could possibly come out with. Let's just say that if a wizard had come into the middle of this movie and had started doing some magic tricks it would have made as much sense as the actual story plot of looper. (As a side note the special effect in this revealing scene is very good and I think it makes people forget how bad the whole movie has just become.)Think about Minority Report. Not among my favorites movies because of the implausible premise but it's a good solid sci-fi and it's everything that Looper isn't. It has action, drama, great special effects, plot twists, all mixed together seamlessly with class and style in a story plot that keeps you entertained and involved until the end, without never losing its tracks. Too bad because looper could have been great.",4,7,18,7 October 2012
John Wick: Chapter 2," unrealistic
","I liked the first John Wick because it had some realistic elements to it and you could relate to John and his suffering, and his will for revenge against those russians thugs. This one it just not plausible, they tried to make it bigger but it just gets ridiculous in my opinion. It's still mildly entertaining so I'll give it a 6 out of 10 but no more than that.",6,10,22,15 April 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Horror? No. Horror parody? Yes
","The cabin in the woods was a total disappointment. It's more like a horror parody than a horror movie. Does it scare? Nope. Does it entertain? A little. And that little comes only from not knowing the reason why everything is happening and from waiting to find out. Is it original? Yes, but it's boring anyway. That's because even if the idea behind it is good, the way it's developed is just silly. It doesn't take itself seriously and has a very cheap teen slasher feel to it. In the end you get some sort of big mess that is a mix between Evil Dead, the Truman Show and Scary Movie. It just doesn't work. Some of the visuals and effects are pretty good, and that's why I gave it 3 instead of 1. Probably the fact that the stoner in the movie has such a big part is not a coincidence. I think the only way you can enjoy this is if you are stoned off your head and your brain is not able to do much reasoning.Best to avoid.",3,2,4,2 January 2013
