Spartacus," A 60s epic done correctly
","The late 50s and the early 60s was the heyday of the big screen epic film. many were spectacular, while a few missed the mark.Spartacus was a spectacularly successful epic film in every way. The cinematography is rich and gorgeous. The cast and acting are superb. The story is sweeping and engaging.Spartacus tells, in broad strokes, the true story of a slave uprising against ancient Rome. Of course, the history is so far back that the real details have to be obscured by time, but in general the rebellion went on for a considerable time as the escaped slaves roved around the peninsula making trouble and dealing successfully with the smaller Roman forces sent to take care of things. Once the Romans got really annoyed, however, they got serious and defeated Spartacus' forces.Kirk Douglas gives his average outstanding performance in this movie, bringing the slave/gladiator to life right before your eyes. The deciding battle near the end is truly spectacular.Spartaus is a must see film for true fans of film.",10,3,6,22 June 2009
The Big Lebowski," Brilliant laugh out loud comedy
","There have been a few movies over time which have portrayed private eye characters that are quirky, or losers, or both ... but this one takes that concept out into left field and then keeps going into some completely unexplored area way beyond left field.Jeff Bridges ('the Dude') and John Goodman are particularly brilliant in their roles of bowling buddies setting out to unsnarl a kidnapping fiasco. Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in 'The Big Lebowski' than I have in a long time during a movie.There are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the 'punch line' in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh! Warning, after this movie you may experience strange sub-conscious desires to drink white russians and go bowling.",9,1,3,1 October 2010
Star Trek," They nailed it
","*** Note: Thousands have rated this movie, and it stands at an impressive 8.6 stars. However, just about every positive review of the movie has been hammered by No's. This means only one thing: A few petty little losers are going around down-rating everyone who liked the movie. What sad, sad little lives these pathetic people must lead. PS It must especially chaffe them that this movie is currently rated #94 on IMDb's toop 250, and will soon move into the top 40 or so in all time box office. LOL ***I've seen a few comments on here from people who didn't like this as Star Trek.Those people don't know or understand Star Trek ... at all.Having watched and been an enthusiastic fan of Star Trek since I saw the very first 'sneak preview' episode in 1966, this movie nails it.The actors took great pains to make sure that fans of 'TOS' felt at home with the new faces, although a couple of the new faces are so close it was scary (Spock and Bones to be sure).Chris Pine grew into Kirk over the course of the movie the way Kirk very well might have grown into Kirk if this was real life instead of fiction.Another complaint of the yo-yo's was plot holes. If you are an idiot or don't pay attention, then you might not understand the plot. If you are an intelligent person who listens to the dialog, you will understand the plot.The entire theater in the afternoon showing I was in today broke into applause as soon as the closing credits started to roll. That doesn't happen much anymore. I'm not sure if I have personally been in a theater where that happened since Star Wars original run.I'm not going to rehash the plot, and you shouldn't read any who do if you are planning to see the movie.Suffice it to stay that this movie grabs you for a tense ride from the first scene and barely gives you a chance to catch your breath for two hours. I was exhausted at the end of it, and as a 43 year Star Trek fan, had my eyes water up a time or two, especially when the Alexander Courage theme broke out at the end and the Star Trek voice over began.This is the first movie in many years I will go to see again in the theater, maybe more than once again. We're already anxiously awaiting the Blu-ray release!!! Go and enjoy. You won't get a chance to relax, and you'll love that.Star Trek lite fans who don't get this, just shut up and go watch the TOS DVDs until you know enough to be allowed in.",10,3,12,10 May 2009
Elf," A holiday holiday
","'Elf' was yet another Will Ferrel film that I thought from previews was just going to be silly and stupid.I've learned by now to get over my prejudices going into 'Silly and Stupid' Will Ferrel films. They almost all are that. But somehow they are also funny, and tell stories with more depth than I would ever have imagined. By the way, the same phenomena happens with me regarding Adam Sandler movies. I always think they sound horrible, and I always have far more than my average share of laughs for a comedy.In elf, its unimaginable that an actor of Ferrel's age can bring off the complete naivety required for a human raised at the North Pole who enters American society as an adult. Yet he brings it off the same way be brings off all of his unlikely sounding roles.Of course, in the process the people he interacts with learn that a little naivety and purity of heart can be a good thing. Yes, there is both slapstick and (mild) gross out comedy, but overall this is a quite entertaining movie, and a suitable Christmas comedy for kids and parent to watch together.",8,0,1,18 June 2009
Watchmen," Love it or Hate it, maybe
","For those expecting the normal comic book 'super-hero vs. super-villain' heroics and stunts, this movie is going to be quite a surprise.Most of the movie is very character oriented. Possibly more of the movie involves flashbacks into the characters' history than it show 'current time' action. Pretty much all of these flashbacks are tied to character exposition rather than striking events.The movie is very dark, and in the end, there are only a couple of characters that you have some feel you can safely like ... maybe.This is most especially NOT a movie for the kiddies to watch. Not close, no how, don't do it. It has very mature themes involving vigilantism, rape, murder, mass murder, graphic violence, nudity (male and female), strong language ... you get the drift.If I'd been sold on going to see a normal super-hero film, I'd have come out of the theater very disappointed. I knew going in that this was't the normal fare of the genre though, and I enjoyed the differences in what I saw. As long as you can keep that kind of open mind, you might, and I stress 'might', enjoy this film.",7,0,3,31 March 2009
Man of Steel," I really thought I was going to like this film ... I just didn't
","Superman was one of the very early comic books I enjoyed as a young kid, and I've read those comics for decades. I haven't always liked the changes they've put the character through, but nothing I had reservations about in his comic book portrayals disappointed me in the manner this movie did.First, very little about this movie and virtually nothing about the character spoke out to me as being Superman. Henry Cavill's portrayal of our single favorite super strong, super fast, invulnerable hero was almost devoid of emotion. Even his brief and infrequent outbursts of anguish seemed forced, and that was virtually the only emotion the writers or director allowed him to show. I just didn't get 'I'm Superman' out of this performance in any way. Yes, he was brave. Big deal.Amy Adams as Lois Lane was OK, but brought little life and only a dab of the spunk to the role that we've watched over and over again from Margo Kidder's performance. It's as if the direction was afraid to 'go big' with the acting in a genre that demands its characters be very, very big.And that's just the acting ... when I start discussing the story decisions thing go downhill in a hurry: 1. As a Superman 'traditionalist' I didn't get having Lois Lane track the mysterious super-alien back to his roots with an over-simplistic and hardly detailed investigation that took her directly to the Kent farm. This is not a spoiler, as this happens early in the film and you can see it coming a mile away.2. The entire sub-plot about her desire to have an expose on an alien presence in the form of a super being on Earth had some interesting potential but in the end was just a throw away story element. More on that later.3. These writers decided to follow the course of many on having Jonathan Kent die. The manner of his death, especially vis a vis Kal-El as his adopted son, was a complete disconnect for me from the possibility of this character being Superman. It was supposed to provide some deeper psychological underpinning for this Superman story, but it was merely ill thought and useless.4. Having Superman's relationship with 'Earth' transition from moving from a suspected alien threat to a friend and savior was horribly bungled. It was an idea. It just wasn't an idea these writers could competently plot.5. Turning the end of the movie into an extended battle pretty much resulting in the destruction of Metropolis (sorry if that's a spoiler) was a decision made for the purpose of having a special effects spectacular with what the writers/director hoped would be shock value. Sorry, that's been done. And in this context it made little sense and by logic hampers the story. At the time this happens, 'Superman' is completely unknown to the public Even with General Zod's public announcement, this is not a character known, trusted, or beloved by the public. The virtual destruction of Metropolis, in which he participated even as he tried to stop it, would leave pretty much everyone resentful and suspicious of this being. From either the standpoint of logic OR emotion, it just doesn't work.6. As I promised, back to Lois' expose: That could have been a really interesting element of a Superman introduction if handled with any subtlety or intelligence at all. If it had been the main theme of the movie and been well written, it could (and probably should) have carried the film. Yet the moment Zod shows up with his announcement, ALL of the effort put into that sub-plot became completely wasted. It is obvious that the creators of this story had many ideas, didn't have the skill or talent to boil them down to a few that would work well together, and just jumbled everything they thought might be 'cool' into one extended, illogical mess that had little to do with a satisfying 'Superman Origin' story.7. Then at the end, we have Clark Kent merrily showing up for work as a reporter at the Daily Planet (where of course Lois already knows his secret!). But how? When? With the damage and evident loss of at least tens of thousands of lives, Metropolis would have had to be essentially abandoned as a toxic environmental nightmare, not to mention graveyard ... and that included extensive damage to the Daily Planet Building itself that likely would have taken years of repair, if it was even deemed structurally to be salvageable! It's like this film was written by clueless 20-somethings with no idea of even the most simple practical results of the events they were so proud of. These writers seem like the kind of people you'd see Jay Leno quizzing on the street and finding incapable of locating Canada on a map of North America. LOL There is more but this review is long enough.Suffice it to say that if this movie is at some point in the future playing on one channel, and Christopher Reeve's Superman of 1978 happens to be playing on another at the same time, I'll be watching the 1978 version. This film simply has none of the charm, humor or life of the first series. In fact, the much lambasted 'Superman Returns' had a far more convincing and embraceable story than this film. I was often annoyed by the decisions to go with a 'pushed' look for most of the film (especially the flashbacks) that often left scenes looking grainy and washed out. It was a stylistic choice that didn't work for me as a viewer.Whether you enjoy the CGI effects and scenes or not, nothing about the excellent technical presentation can make up for the ineptitude of the plotting or writing.",2,3,7,22 November 2013
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Bring on the parody
","And if there is a musical genre out there short of orchestral symphony, it gets sent up by this wonderful comedy.Not a movie for the kiddies by a long shot, but if you are familiar with music artists from the 50s on, and especially if you lived through those periods of time, the parody of styles and stars will leave you with sore sides from laughing.Make sure to listen closely to every lyric. They don't miss a chance to make jokes subtle or broad, and they don't take it easy on anyone.Songs in the credits are just as funny as songs through the body of the movie, so make sure to wait around for those rather than switching off after the story itself fades to black.A personal favorite of mine are the scenes where Dewey discovers new drugs. Although I've never taken drugs, even smoked marijuana, these scenes were just too funny to be offensive, especially the first discussion of the weed just named.Be in the mood to watch a comedy, especially for a parody of this type. If you can't really pay attention, you won't get everything, and will just think the movie crude. Also, if you're really stuck up about what's in your comedy, then you may not like this movie.If you're up for it, you'll die laughing.",9,24,28,8 June 2009
Tropic Thunder," A smart comedy that makes fun of everything
","I've read a good number of the negative reviews of this movie, and it didn't surprise me at all that a lot of people didn't get it. There are a LOT of people who don't understand or get parody, at all, and everything truly funny in this movie was parody.Even the cheap gags (such as the fart trailer) were parody of movie that use nothing but cheap gags for laughs. The 'gory parts' were parody of movies that thrive on violence and gore.They made fun of several types of themed movies, plus actors, plus agents, plus directors, plus producers, plus fanatic fans, plus big stunts ... it goes on and on.Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely brilliant as a serious Austrailian actor playing a hard bitten black soldier so thoroughly that he couldn't ever force himself out of character. ('I don't drop character until after the DVD commentary'. LOL) His masquerade as a local ... speaking a Chinese dialect with a black accent is just classic comedy.I haven't seen this much parody packed into a movie since 'Dewey Cox', another deeply funny parody.If you just wanted to stare slack jawed at a screen while the director spells EVERYTHING out for you until a movie is done, you won't like this movie at all.If you don't object to being challenged to LISTEN to the dialog, and mentally make the connections between each element of this movie, what its making fun of, and how, then you'll hurt your sides laughing. I'm going to have to watch it a second time, at least, to get all the references, because I'm sure that I missed many follow up lines while I was laughing at the one before it.A good litmus test for this movie was my wife, who will not laugh at a movie filled merely with potty humor ... at all. She didn't know what to expect, and was frowning at me that I still had this playing after the faux trailers at the beginning, and especially after the gratuitous gore in the opening filming sequence. THEN some dialog caught her attention, and she started paying attention. Before long we were both howling, frequently. After the movie, she looked at me and said, 'I did NOT expect to be laughing at that movie so much!'The sequence where Robert Downey chides Ben Stiller for an earlier role where he went 'full retard' is, honestly, some of the best comedy repartee since some newsroom scenes in 'His Girl Friday'.Crude at times? Check. Violent at times? Check. Funny ALL the time? Check.",8,0,2,8 June 2009
No Country for Old Men," Not for us
","I've got to agree that this movie did absolutely nothing for me.There was nothing special about the acting. The story was predictable and ultimately dissatisfying.I only watched this movie AFTER it had won best picture. I kept waiting for the 'good part', and then it was over. The 'good part' never arrived.I wasn't alone ... my wife liked it even less than I did, which I wouldn't have thought possible. As soon as it ended, she immediately asked 'Why did we waste our time on that?' I had no answer.Maybe we're just old enough that we've seen everything in this movie before, in fact over and over and over again. And since we watched movies and TV drama thru the 70s, we've seen plenty of movies where 'no one won'. If you are young enough that all you've ever seen are sugar coated and deus ex machina endings, then maybe the 'no one wins' ending is a surprise. To us it just invalidated the struggle of the characters we had watched throughout.",1,2,6,25 February 2009
The Incredibles," Dee dee deet dah dee!
","A truly enjoyable movie for anyone who ever enjoyed comic books.I think this is without a doubt the best animated film to take on the task of taking the comic book hero genre into a movie. Numerous touches, small and large, bring back the atmosphere we always imagined as kids.Additionally, this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy together. The scary scenes are tolerable for young kids and don't last overly long. There is plenty of comedy for adults, and enough 'cool factor' for everyone.The animation is beautiful to behold.I just watched it again on the Disney channel tonight, and enjoyed it every bit as much as when I first watched it when it came out.",9,1,1,3 April 2009
Ghostbusters," Brilliant
","Ghostbusters is one of the definitive comedies of the 80s, and probably the best effort put together by or for ex-SNL cast members. (some may argue that honor goes to the Blues Brothers, and those of you who argue that may be right).The movie is funny, smart, a little sexy, a little scary, and has great special effects for the time.There is no quibble with any performance in the film. Everyone is on target.Ghostbusters has one of my favorite lines from a comedy ... the non-sequitir 'I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.' Brilliant. LOL",9,0,0,8 June 2009
Jurassic World," Lots of fun and scares
","If you were one of the people who went to see 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and wound up in 'Jurassic World' by mistake, I feel sorry for you. Everyone else had a great time in this movie. It is what it was supposed to be ... a great looking thrill ride with believable CGI dinosaurs making everyone nervous. :-)This was one of the rare films I've seen where the audience in my showing broke into applause as the credits rolled.So if you hated it, be smart enough to not go to the next one, and there IS going to be a next one. With a budget of 150 million and closing in on a half billion in domestic gross, there will be another one, and the producers, director, and actors you are all criticizing are laughing at you as their bank accounts go KA-CHING.",10,51,118,23 June 2015
For Love of the Game," Interesting framework
","It took a while for me in watching this movie to realize the all the baseball scenes were actually from the same game, and not parts of many games. I had not read or heard of the movie before, and I wasn't actually paying close attention at the beginning.Once I realized that the entire movie was flashbacks Kevin Costner's character was having during the course of one game that suddenly becomes a real candidate to end up as a 'perfect game', I got more interested. Not that the baseball result drew me in, the entire idea for the movie happening in flashbacks during a game intrigued me.The movie is indeed sappy, and contains every cliché, but it works anyway. Romantic dramas are going to have a lot of clichés, there's no way to avoid it. Sports movies are going to have a lot of clichés. So when you put the two together, its a cliché-fest! LOL Still, the performances are engaging and mostly come off as real. The drama at the end of the game has a body of its own. The catcher's promise near the end is something that SHOULD happen in sports, and probably doesn't very often.Only the last couple of scenes, which happen AFTER the game, break out of the framework of the rest of the movie.So if you don't like romances or sappy sports movies, stay away from this, you won't like it. Otherwise, its a nice film with some good lessons and a satisfying set of conclusions.",7,2,3,19 June 2009
The Dark Knight," Big achievement, but exhausting experience
","I'd love to give this movie a 10. It cries out for it. The only problem is that I was so exhausted after watching it the first time, I may never watch it again. The Dark Knight desperately needed more in the way of tension breaks, much like the original 'Batman' movie had, but they just weren't there. The movie got more and more dark, and more and more tense, and even the ending couldn't leave you with a positive feeling about what had happened and what might follow.All the performances were top notch. Action sequences: big. Special effects: dazzling. Its a must see movie.However, its going to be an endurance contest for many viewers. I felt the same way about Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Both are top movies, must see, and after viewing them once I was done with them because the stories were just so exhausting. It may just be a personal viewpoint. I run two businesses, and my days are more often than not eight hours of unrelenting tension. That doesn't leave me with a desire for more of the same in my evening or weekend entertainment.So watch it the first time, and then you can make your own decision about surviving it in subsequent viewings! LOL",8,0,2,18 June 2009
Avatar," The best experience I've ever had in a theater, bar none
","The only reason I gave this movie a 10 is that IMDb hasn't implemented 15's as a score yet. It is simply incredible.There are a few naysayers who have complained about the plot of the movie. My only explanation is that they are just too stupid to appreciate what they just saw. The plot has everything you could ask for, and is very different from anything you've ever seen in a major motion picture. This movie could play without the soundtrack and the story would still be compelling.However, the home run hit by this movie is unquestionably the special effects. Again, maybe some kids that have grown up in the 'great special effects generation' aren't able to to really watch what is going on and truly appreciate the achievement. In the car driving home, I commented that I was surprised I was actually getting us home ... the entire time images from the movie were still racing thru my head. This movie is just truly a feast in every way. From the opening shot to the last the visuals are the most incredible I've ever seen in any media. To hearken back to the famous 'Superman' advertising ... You WILL believe a 10 foot alien man can fly on a wyvern-like alien beast!'It all looks real, from the stunning alien world to the action scenes to the acting on the faces of the aliens.Don't try to analyze this movie. Just go to see it, sit back, relax (when you can), and be amazed at this stunning achievement!I highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D. Once it is out of the theaters, it may be a long time before you will see anything like this again, and you will NEVER again see this movie like the experience you will have in the theater. Many movies are as good (or better) at home on Blu-ray. That will not be the case with this film.",10,11,20,3 January 2010
Die Hard," Willis Tour de Force
","Bruce Willis first big screen staring role was quite a jolt to fans considering its very different tone from his star making vehicle, the TV series 'Moonlighting'.In Moonlighting, Willis was perfect romantic comedy material, but his ability to perform deeds of heroism was very much in doubt.The cocky attitude came thru from the TV role, but added to it was a capacity to direct action and violence that was entirely lacking his previous performance.Often actors take a while to find the vehicle that best defines their movie career. Willis was lucky (or unlucky) to hit the mark on his very first try. Although he has branched into other types of roles in the decades since Die Hard, his subsequent roles are always measured against this one.The movie itself is an action delight. It was very unique when made, but spawned the myriad 'heros who never give up and defy all pain and obstacles' movies that have been made since. It has been copied so many times and by so many major stars that the list is too long to even begin.Die Hard also gave us the most profane 'best remembered line' in the history of movies. LOL",9,1,1,22 June 2009
Hancock," Sideways super heroes
","Hancock is a VERY different take on the super hero concept. Hancock is a mysterious and unhappy man with super powers. When he gets involved in apprehending criminals, he often causes more damage and problems than he solves.A PR man, whose life he saves, takes Hancock under his wing to help him become a responsible hero, but there are more surprises on the way.This is a thoughtful and very unique superhero film, and also in most respects very cool. It goes in directions you'll never expect, but not at the expense of leaving glaring plot holes. Will Smith gives his normal top notch performance, and the supporting cast is great.Laughs, thrills, surprises, and an interesting story. What more do you want from a movie?",8,1,2,20 June 2009
WALL·E," Journeyman effort
","Wall-e is definitely worth a watch, but doesn't match some previous Pixar efforts in a few categories: strength of plot, interesting characters, or amusing asides. Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles were MUCH stronger movies in virtually all areas. Arguably Monster, Inc., Cars, and Ratatouille were as well.Still, you can't make those movies every time, nor re-watch them endlessly, so there is no harm in watching this movie, which is at times visually depressing but at other times a visual feast.It succeeds in being interesting even though very little about either the story or its backdrop makes any sense at all. (Why would a culture with hyper-space travel sit in the middle of space for hundreds of years instead of exploring for a new planet to live on? Why would a robot tasked with finding evidence of life on the former home world of its makers blast anything that moved or made a noise without first investigating for actual danger? Why would it immediately go into a shutdown mode after finding one small sample, instead of continuing its exploration to draw as complete a picture as possible, since its purpose was to invite a possible return to the planet? I could go on and one, but I'm not going to.) Even though the story had very little real thought put into it, it is a typical Pixar technical animation feast, and is worth watching for the images no matter how much you have to grind your teeth at the story.",3,3,9,8 June 2009
Casino Royale," Discovering bond all over again
","If the James Bond franchise had to be rebooted, this was the way to do it.Daniel Craig gives the character a sense of deadliness not sensed since the Timothy Dalton days. As much as I liked Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, and all delivered good performances, none of them seemed like sudden death with a bad attitude. For a government assassin, such an attitude would be helpful.Daniel Craig sells that attitude convincingly. From the very start where he coolly terminates a traitor, to the very end where shoots a foe through the leg when it is clear he didn't have to, you know this Bond is cool about the job of dealing death.The movie itself? I think of it as three movies in one. It starts as an action flick, segues into a cool spy mode with a very relaxed and long lasting poker tournament, and then gets back to the action again.Although this movie does have scenes that remind you of the book, it is not a close cover of the book in the way the first few Connery movies were.Althogether quite enjoyable, and closer to the way I perceived Bond as I read the books than most of the other Bond actors managed.",9,3,6,8 June 2009
