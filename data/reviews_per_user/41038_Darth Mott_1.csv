Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No dissapointment, but a better picture than most people think
","I know many people think of this picture as the biggest dissapointment in movie history, but that's simply wrong.There are some great new characters (Qui-Gon, Queen Amidala), good actors (i'm not joking!), e.g. Liam Neeson, Ian McDiarmid, Pernilla August, an interesting, traditional (Spacebattle at the end) but alsoinnovative (The Trade-Federation, come on Fans another Galactic Empire wouldn't be so clever) story and the BEST SOUND(FX), BEST COSTUMES and BEST VISUAL EFFECTS ever seen in a movie untill its release!So honor EPISODES IV-VI, but give EPISODE I a chance.Buy the DVD watch the spectecular movie and find out that GEORGE LUCAS IS A GREAT DIRECTOR, no matter what the critics are saying.See YOU in STARWARS EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES!",10,0,1,1 February 2002
