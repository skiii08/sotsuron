The Monuments Men," Not a good movie Disjointed and Flat
","I write short and sweet reviews because I am tired of people giving high ratings to terrible movies. This movie won't have that problem. It should have been good. It had a good cast and a great historical event. BUT.... The first half of the movie was terrible, with scenes that did not flow well into one story and seemed disjointed. The end of the movie was somewhat better, tied together properly at least. The acting was mostly very flat. While I have seen both Clooney and Daemon give good performances, these performances had no nuances. It was as if they were hanging out in their every day lives. Neither played a character that seemed very different from the persona that they project as themselves. And While Cate Blanchett actually DID give her character nuances, she was so unpleasant that I didn't care to watch her. I love history, and I don't mind when a movie takes some liberties with it in order to tell present a good drama. However, I learned little about this event, and also was not entertained.",5,3,4,12 May 2014
Shakespeare in Love," Romance and Comedy for educated people
","I love the movie Shakespeare in Love on more levels than i can explain. That said, this movie is not for everyone. I happen to like Shakespeare, history, romance, love, tragedy, and theater. The movie twines all of the old Shakespearean themes together, yet takes the characters on such original and surprising journeys. I love most that the ending is not clich√©, but in some ways bitter, looking towards the reality of life for these characters. It is playful, clever, and most likely to work for those who know Shakespeare's writings fairly well. If you don't, you will have a romantic period drama, which is original and different but you will miss the 'in' jokes. More accessible than Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are dead, smarter than any of the ROM-COMS being produced out there today.",9,0,0,12 May 2014
