Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," spirituality in pirates?
","The first Pirates was entertaining, fun, and offered something for children and adult viewers. The following two sequels went off the deep end, confusing adults and boring children with an unclear plot and no clear hero to root for. I entered the theater to watch Pirates 4 with various expectations and presuppositions. Gone are the boring and at times unwatchable Will Turned, Elizabeth Swan, and Davey Jones. Back, of course, is Jack Sparrow and the incredible Barbosa (Gregory Rush). Welcome Blackbeard and Angelica to the franchise. The story is far superior than the last two installments. The plot is understandable yet still contains multiple layers. Various parties are racing to find the fountain of youth. Of course the audience is aware that each character cannot be trusted and deception will used for personal gain. Perhaps the most intriguing character is Philip the priest who is somewhat a prisoner upon Blackbeard's ship. Throughout the movie we discover Philip is the only one who looks for the good in everyone. Philip believes that every life is valuable and that none is beyond the hopes of salvation, although Blackbeard greatly tests this theology. Are there people we feel are beyond salvation? Do we consider the blackbeards in our lives as valuable people with worth and value? How far can one go before we write them off? This tension is wonderfully explored with Philip. Another profound issue raised is when the Spanish destroyed the fountain of youth since eternity only comes from God. What is the role of a Christ follower when others are seeking eternity from a source other than God? Is destroying those false hopes (from their perspective) commendable or classless? Does God need defending? Is love allowing one to attempt to quench their thirst from a false source or is it destroying the false source? Perhaps the answer is neither but within conversation and relationship. Near the end of the film Blackbeard and his daughter are faced with a choice. One can receive eternal life but the other must sacrifice their life. How can this decision be made? Blackbeard selfishly attempted to take eternal life at the cost of his daughter's life. Jack Sparrow predictably tricked him and Blackbeard received death. Here Blackbeard served as an anti-Christ type of figure. Eternal life cannot be stolen, it must be granted. One receives eternal life only when they give up their life willingly. Overall fun movie again and would have been a better part 2 sequel than the last 2.",7,1,2,23 May 2011
