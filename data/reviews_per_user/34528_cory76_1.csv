The Blair Witch Project," this movie scared the living sh*t out of me
","i don't know what other people are talking about when they say it was stupid or bad or have other negative things to say... i thought it served it's purpose very well, and though the ending didn't scare me at all, some of those scenes at night in the woods did... the real fear in the actors and the first-person camera angles (and the raw look of the footage) just made it all seem very real... anyone who has camped in a remote rural area like that can probably sympathize more with the characters and feel like they're experiencing everything right along with them... of course, i was in college at the time, and as i recall, we smoked a big J right before show time, so maybe that had something to do with my movie-going experience that night... what can i say? it was college...",Null,1,3,28 December 2006
