The Lobster," Weird, yes, but not a comedy
","This is easily the weirdest film of the year 2015 but not for everybody. It is different. Spooky sometimes. Pretending to be deep, but actually it is very shallow. It is definitely not a comedy. It has a very good acting cast, deliberately acting without emotions, without soul. Felt like I wasted two hours of my life watching it. Filmed on some beautify locations in Ireland all portrayed through a very dark atmosphere. Lot of cruelty throughout the film involving animals and people. It is too slow most of the time, and the ending leaves much to be desired. Good camera work is probably one of the redeeming features of this film.",2,18,28,13 February 2016
