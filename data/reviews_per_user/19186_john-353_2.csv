Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg ticking over
","What a pleasant ride this film was; based on a true story, it follows the life of the character portrayed brilliantly by Leo, through his latter years at home with parents with crumbling marriage intact (this is the norm these days), to his various misguided efforts to not only please his father and step into his shoes, but to actually put himself into a position where he thinks he can actually restore the family business and get Mommy n Daddy back together again (ahhh bless).Use of interesting camera angles, a good soundtrack, and subtle sprinklings of comic relief make this an interesting if slightly unremarkable film to watch, especially from the genius that is Steven Spielberg. So I'd have to vote this one a good 7 out of ten, although I must admit that I'm stumped on how they could have made it any better to watch, anymore entertaining, anymore accurate in terms of characterisation and period detail.In summary, a family film you'll watch at xmas, but I can't see myself going out and buying this one on DVD. Next time, stick to the Epics, Stevie!",Null,0,1,13 February 2003
Blade," A sympathetic Horror Movie
","This is one of those movies that I've watched again, and again. It doesn't fit the traditional Vampire mould, working within the genre it aims to contribute to. For example, you find yourself feeling genuinely sorry for the Blade character who has been damned from birth to fulfill this righteous role, but circumstance has him trapped between humanity he is defending, and the evil nosferatu within.One of the most horrific scenes is the opening sequence set in a nightclub, where, unbeknown to us the gentle viewer, the place is packed with vampires who get their feed at the appointed time. When this happens, the sprinkler system activates and drenches the lot of them in blood. Very nice. And the carnage at the end of this scene is breathtaking in its ordacity, yet jarring in its originality.The sequence where Blade takes sympathy on the freshly bitten love interest, and sees his mother's fate so closely matched to hers in well-staged flashbacks, will always bring a lump to the throat. But of course, Mumsie comes back for more...Other parts of the story are well executed, where Steven Dorf's portrayal of Deacon brings the term 'evil so-and-so' to new, dizzy heights. Where they discover one amongst the aristocracy that isn't of noble, pure blood, so they take him outside by Dawn's early light and give him a sun tan. mmmmm crispy. Watch the film, I don't wanna spoil it. The part where Deacon toys with the policeman, who wants ever so much to turn to the darkside, is also a classic. I watched my cat play with a ball of string, and instantly observed more than a passing similarity between the two!Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, a more-than-worthy addition to the already swelling Vampire genre, and a much prized member of my DVD collection. And, as usual, it's several million miles better than the inferior sequel, which favours muscle and guns over pure, honest, good old fashioned blood and gore! Buy it NOW",Null,0,1,13 February 2003
