The Blair Witch Project," It Holds Up Just Enough
","Ever since its release 20 years ago, The Blair Witch Project has made history as a cultural horror phenomenon, mainly for how it utilized the found footage genre without showing much of what the real horror is. While it did divide audiences back in the day, the intrigue of the film lies a lot more in what we hear rather than what is actually causing hysteria. It's a testament to how divisive the film is when even though what was videotaped did actually happen in real life, just the thought of what lies out in the middle of nowhere is enough to make one feel at ease.Now understandably, the film has a very simplistic plot, in which three young filmmakers named Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard seek out the local legend called the Blair Witch infamously located at the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994, but they all disappear and the film plays out as a feature length collection of raw footage based on what they experienced. Admittedly, the film doesn't have a great start, as the leads come off as more annoying and obnoxious than likable and charming, and not much happens besides them goofing off for the first twenty minutes. However, as the film progresses, strange oddities start to occur and slowly heighten the stakes with every passing day. The very idea of being lost in the deep woods can really affect someone mentally, so even without the supernatural aspects, the movie works well in playing with the viewer's expectations with suspenseful tension.One major problem with most found footage movies is that the creatures feared by the cast are either always seen or are in a typical environment we're all familiar with. The better way to create paranoia within your horror narrative is by placing your characters somewhere they've never been before. Also, the decision to have many of the night scenes be pitch black and out of focus really helps the soundtrack, as all the crazy sounds coming from the area feel all the more terrifying without knowing where they are coming from. What people hear is more reactionary than what they see, and the filmmakers react so well to what they hear that the audience could be in their shoes as well. Even then, as the film goes on, Heather, Mike and Josh become much more relatable with their ever-growing impatience and frustrations with the whole legend itself, whether it's fake or not, and even towards each other with anger and fear. The more away from civilization you are, the less human you become.So while it may be slow paced and the idea of not seeing the real terror can be a turnoff to some viewers, I definitely think The Blair Witch Project stands well on its own after its original release. Regardless if this whole movie is complete fiction, crafting a whole narrative around the supernatural in a place as unknown as a forest at night can work if you center it around the idea of implication rather than flat out showing the creature. All you need is a shoestring budget, a cast of people you know personally as opposed to famous celebrities, and an environment you're familiar with enough to let your small camera create practically everything. In spite of the found footage genre being somewhat of a joke nowadays, there is nothing stopping you from taking on the challenge of forming a film around raw recorded material.",6,1,1,10 June 2019
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," My All Time Favorite Flick
","Over the span of 30 years, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been lauded for its technical innovations, admirable tongue-in-cheek tribute to cartoons from the Golden Age of American Animation and classic film noir, and just being a fantastic film in every regard. What was originally a book by the name of Who Censored Roger Rabbit went through roughly seven years of development before finally reaching the big screen in the summer of 1988. Since then, the movie would become arguably one of the most influential films of all time, and would also help launch the animation renaissance of the 1990s next to The Little Mermaid and Ren & Stimpy. As for me, considering that this is my all time favorite movie, you can bet I have much to say about it.Set in Hollywood around 1947, where cartoon characters exist in the real world, cartoon star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering owner of Toontown, Marvin Acme. This was the result of alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant getting hired by cartoon producer R.K. Maroon to investigate adultery involving Roger's wife Jessica and Acme. Now Roger tries to get Eddie to clear his name from the villainous Judge Doom who vows to destroy him and all other toons. While that plot does sound wacky in concept, it nonetheless adds in to the film's tone, as the whole film is a passionate love letter to the style and humor of cartoons from the 1940s. The very first scene is a Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman cartoon entitled Somethin's Cookin', which is a rapidly paced homage to the zany cartoons of Tex Avery and Hanna-Barbera. Of course the other pairing of toons themselves are memorably hilarious, especially that famous Daffy Duck and Donald Duck piano duel, but the film always keeps on its toes to make sure the main story doesn't get out of focus.In terms of the film noir aspect, the general story is executed as one big crime case that has much more hidden underneath it as Eddie unravels more clues. Admittedly, the plot can be a little complicated to follow at times, mainly due to the immense amount of details once everything is revealed, although it does make much more sense upon repeat viewings. Nonetheless, the buildup further creates the necessary suspense and thrills to figure out who exactly is behind the cartoon murder case. It's with all of these elements that help recreate the original book's mystery angle while condensing it a bit to play around with the cartoony antics and fast paced comedy. It's debatable whether or not the filmmakers studied any particular film noir classics, but the film's point of view as a thriller is so well put together that it's hard to believe that wasn't the case.As for the characters, Eddie Valiant may start off grouchy, but it's through his backstory that explains his inner struggles with toons, and Bob Hoskins portrays his down-to-earth persona up to the point where one could also relate to something they love ruining their life. Charles Fleischer pulls off Roger's voice, and while some could find it annoying, he manages to carry Roger's emotions in context to the human actors astonishingly while making him delightfully amusing. Jessica Rabbit could pretty much be called the spiritual successor to Tex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood, mainly from her bombshell design and scarlet attire, but she's also a very devoted wife to Roger, showing how sometimes a human and a rabbit being married ain't so bad after all. Lastly, Judge Doom may seem like a subdued psychopath at first, but his plan to wipe out all toons is so diabolical that his reveal sums up his whole character. While there are other fun characters like the weasels, Dolores, Benny the cab and Baby Herman, they're not quite as developed as the rest, but they do their jobs well as supporting characters. What's interesting to mention is a subtle social commentary on how the toons are depicted. Similar to the book, the toons are depicted as minorities, since real people don't really interact much with them outside of working in Hollywood, unlike that of Eddie and friends or Judge Doom and his weasels. Not to mention, the scene where Roger tells Eddie how laughter can be a very powerful thing while standing on a soap box is rather symbolic of African Americans standing up for their own rights. In fact, ToonTown is essentially a ghetto since only toons live there far off from the people of the real world. Hell, Roger stated in the film, 'there's no justice for toons anymore,' as if that statement was similar to how little justice there were for people of different races back then. It's when Judge Doom reveals his plans to turn ToonTown into a freeway where viewers may see the lovable toons in a completely different light. While these metaphors are more subtly played out, this really makes that legendary happy ending with all our favorite animated characters celebrating Marvin Acme's will surfacing their free rights a blessing in a way.I think Richard Williams was the perfect choice to direct the film's animation, as he and his crew managed to set up distinct rules in combining the toons with the real world. For example, when Roger crashes through R. K. Maroon's office, the hole he leaves behind looks just like him, and one scene shows Roger spitting out realistic water, not water drawn on paper. This is not only thanks to the highly talented animators, but also ILM who helped create a wonderful method of compositing the traditional animated characters into the same environments as the live actors without using advanced computers. The processes ranged from prop manipulation, to superimposing the frames on photostatic blowups, to multiple matte layers, and especially constant camera motion, showing just how painstaking the process must have been for the crew. In addition, Williams designed Roger based on features of characters born out of Warner Bros, MGM, and Disney. Considering how hard it is to make real people interacting with characters of another realm look convincing, the techniques worked so well that one could imagine the film's world being real.Of all the films that have combined live-action and animation, as well as being tributes to classic cartoons and crime thrillers, there may never be one that will even come close to topping this one. Who Framed Roger Rabbit still stands the test of time for its fantastic technical achievements, intriguing story with some hidden albeit smart depth and satire, lovable characters and charming imagination. At this point, there's no reason not to see this film again, as anybody who loves cartoons, film noir, or even highly creative movies in general will get a kick out of this now as much as the audiences of back then. And now, to end this off, time to quote the movie itself: 'Things are never black as they are painted, time for you and joy to get acquainted. So make life worthwhile; come on and smile, darn ya, smile.'",10,3,3,22 June 2018
Se7en," A Brutal Albeit Endlessly Intriguing Crime Thriller
","Although Alien 3 was filmmaker David Fincher's directorial debut, I think he'd prefer to call this film his real debut any day of the week. Released in 1995, Seven (or Se7en) went on to gain critical acclaim, huge box-office revenue, and helped kickstart new beginnings for the director. To this very day, it remains by many as a highly graphic and disturbing neo-noir flick with a highly engaging premise and finale. After seeing the film in its entirety myself, I could not agree more.The film tells the story of two New York detectives named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) who track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins in his murders. What really holds the movie together are the two leads, as Pitt and Freeman display excellent chemistry with each other. Both of their characters have their own desires in life, with Somerset on the brink of retirement and Mills just starting at his position. Their performances are so sharp and realistic that it's hard to see the actors rather than the actual characters. Considering how disgusting their murder case is, it's only fitting that they do the necessary reacting and analyzing.In addition to strong leads, some of the supporting cast are quite memorable in their own regard. Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), faces certain struggles upon moving to a new city and certain complications about her personal life. Whenever she's with Somerset, you can just feel her devastation, making her arguably the most sympathetic character in the whole feature. However, the serial killer himself, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), is one who could really send shivers down anyone's spine. Alongside all of his murders being horrific yet well thought out, he's actually smarter than one might assume, and he practically wrote the third act he's so clever albeit evil (no spoilers).I'm not too familiar with David Fincher's directing style, but this film really displays New York in a graphic setting. Even when it's a calm rainy day or even sunny, there's always a sense of danger lurking about. The editing is also very well paced, especially during a particularly suspenseful chase scene of Mills and John Doe through an apartment complex which must've went through lots of trial and error to get right. The grim tone helps give the viewers a glimpse of the horrors in the world, so when we know more about John Doe, you'd only wish you could never meet someone like that again.Isn't it great how a filmmaker's career can really get off the ground when they make an original film of their liking as opposed to some lame Hollywoodized sequel? After 23 years, Seven stills holds up as a modern classic that dares to tackle life's harsh realities, the depiction of two detectives investigation solving a horrific case, and the darkest realms that the human soul offers. If you're in to very gothic, psychological thrillers that talk about themes like the aforementioned, definitely give this a watch when you can. Fincher has since gone on to make more worthwhile films that still inspire many to this day, so it looks like I've got quite a gold mine ahead of me.",9,0,0,17 August 2018
Akira," The Film that Kicked Western Audience's Butts
","In 1988, a very unique animated action sci-fi feature came out known as Akira, based on the manga series of the same name by Katsuhiro Otomo (who also made the movie). What made it so unique is how it revolutionized western audience's perception of Japanese anime. While anime had been seen before in America, a film of this magnitude had never been shown directly before, and you can bet it left one hell of an impact. Any fan of anime nowadays pretty much owes their debt to this feature. As for what I think, lets just say it happens to be a favorite of mine.Set in the dystopian year of 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, Kaneda and his biker gang lose their friend Tetsuo to the government to be tested. While that happens, Tetsuo develops mutant powers and causes chaos throughout the city, soon to become the next 'Akira'. From that premise alone, there is a clear social commentary on how our leaders abuse technology and power, which can lead to murderous rampaging monsters. The mythos behind what led to the original Akira is very intriguing, and the film does not shy away from going into detail about how such horrific events could have even happened, or what they even do to those in the long run.In addition, the characters really make the film worthwhile, as all the events cause huge problems for each of them. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo is that of pure friends and you can really feel Kaneda's desperation in wanting to save his best friend whilst unfortunately having to hunt him down. With Tetsuo, his powers end up having conflicting results on him, whether it'd be making him stronger or making him diabolically insane. The others mainly consist of special investigators, corrupt politicians and the biker gang themselves. While their subplots can be a bit sporadic, they still tie in together with the overall narrative, whether it'd be trying to stop Tetsuo or getting axed by him.But of course, there's no excuse in not talking about the animation of the film, which is gorgeously crafted. The world of Neo-Tokyo provides a heavy usage of vibrant lighting and futuristic special effects, yet it still has its own identity by showing the contrasting depiction of gritty urban slums. The more stakes and action that occur in the film, the more grand the visuals become, and even at their most grotesque, the amount of effort, detail and artistry put into them is enough to marvel at. Also, given that this was the first Japanese animated film to have the voice-acting done before the animation, it makes the lip synching, expressions and character acting much more accurate than most Japanese animated films before its time.I think we can all agree that Akira is an animated feature with a kick, and what a kick it is. With striking visuals, creative storytelling and a cast of rough albeit sympathetic characters comes a film that became one of the staples for intellectual dystopian science fiction features of the 1990s and onward. If you're a fan of anime, science-fiction, action, dystopian films or all of the above, then this is a mandatory watch. Even if it might confuse you at first due to how complicated it is by concept alone, you might not get as big of an experience like it anywhere else. As it's the animated film that changed everything, maybe it'll change you too.",9,0,0,28 October 2018
Memento," Confusing and Complicated? Yes. Thought Provoking and Unique? Absolutely.
","Before his days of Batman, Inception and Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan started off making low budget independent neo-noir crime dramas. The one that kickstarted his acclaimed career however is a movie based on a short story from his brother Jonathan called Memento. Praised by critics and audiences upon its release, this movie became so beloved across the world that Nolan himself even got an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (as well as Best Editing for Dody Dorn), and watching the movie recently, it really holds up as a complex unconventional crime story.The movie focuses on a man with short term memory loss named Leonard. Some criminals made him amnesic by knocking him out, but they also killed his wife which causes Leonard to search endlessly for who they were by using Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track down information he soon forgets. Basic enough narrative, yet the movie is presented in two different ways. One is a conventional series of black-and-white flashbacks where the other is an unconventional series of color sequences shown in reverse chronological order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist), while still completing a cohesive albeit complex narrative. While it can turn off some viewers, the innovative structure is bound to really capture ones interest in the story to see what led to Leonard's conclusion on the person who murdered his wife and ruined his life. The puzzle pieces connect together well and there's never one moment where the viewer is not curious to wonder what's the cause of each individual moment. Thus, the narrative is confusing, but it makes sense because we are living in the mind set of Leonard, and considering how forgetful he is while trying to solve the case, it fits the complicated albeit gripping path Leonard goes through that lets the audience relate and sympathize with him.Along with a story that will constantly have viewers guessing, the characters also keep on track. Even though he is stuck in his own mind, Leonard has no choice since the few decent memories he has left are what lead him to finding the cause of the murderer, thus making him worth rooting for and feel sorry for. You want him to succeed in his task, but you also wish he could just seek the proper help to make him function better in the world. Along with a tightly stellar performance by Guy Pierce, Leonard embodies both the intellectual anti hero and the troublesome victim in his endless search to avenge his late loved one.The rest of the characters are all obstacles for Leonard in his search, whether it be helping him, being supportive from flashbacks, or being straight up offenders. The supporters like Natalie and Teddy are good supporting characters, but they also have their own dilemmas of their own which either shape Leonard or conflict with him. The offenders like Dodd and Jimmy have their tendencies to get rid of Leonard for trying to seek his revenge, but their presence one further brings Leonard to wonder if they killed his wife or not. Add on great performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Larry Holden and you've got a cast that you won't want to forget about anytime soon.Personally, I think this could be Nolan's best work alongside The Prestige. When you work independently on a low budget, you tend to be more creative and improvisational with your work since you can only work with so much, and Memento is the perfect mesh of a thrilling script that will always keep the viewer guessing and relying more on brisk cinematography and psychological momentum than big budget practical effects and a grim style. Christopher Nolan kept me guessing throughout the feature without going overboard with the story, and he'll keep you guessing the more times you watch it. Check out Memento on Netflix and get ready for a nonstop thrill ride that will cause you to think the whole way through.",9,1,2,20 December 2017
Coraline," Laika's Wonderful Debut
","While there aren't really that many mainstream animation studios that specialize in stop-motion today, the one notable standout besides Aardman is Laika inc. This studio constantly keeps pushing the limits of what stop-motion is capable of while also telling powerful gripping stories with dark themes and intriguing characters. So when their first feature film came out in 2009, it was inevitable that it would get an Oscar nomination. Coraline, based off the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman, was directed by Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, and what a bang up job he pulled off. The story itself focuses on a little girl named Coraline Jones who moves into a new home with her family. Once in it, she discovers a parallel world hidden behind a secret door. While the world seems bright and cheery at first glance, it actually contains a dark and sinister secret that Coraline must face to get back to the real world. With a premise like that, there are bound to be some dark obstacles on the way, and the film never shies away from showing the true horrors from the alternate world. From Coraline's other mom and dad, to the buttoned eyes on everyone, to the neighborhood cat who might know more than meets the eye, this film creates a prefect contrast between the real world and the sinisterly dark surreal world. As for the characters, Coraline herself does start off kinda moody like any child, but she still remains likable enough to sympathize with, and her encounter with the supernatural makes her become very brave and worth rooting for. Her real parents may seem rather moody and slobbish, but they're only looking out for what's best for her, and it's hard not to feel sorry for them given how hard they work to support themselves. Also, Coraline's other mother is one of the creepiest villains in cinema history, as she seems trusting at first, but then becomes one of the freakiest creatures ever conjured up in cinema. Other characters like Wybie, Mr. Bobinsky, April & Miriam and the cat support Coraline to help confront her fears in the alternate world (especially compared to their heinous alternate forms), and they're memorable enough to leave an impression from their eccentricities alone.Even for a first time feature by a then brand new studio, the animation is very impressive. It's able to create a unique contrast between the gloomy real world and the alternate world. While the alternate world looks somewhat colorful, bright and creative at first, its true colors shine with many neutralized and grim backgrounds and colors that really help bring out the dark atmosphere to all new heights. The characters themselves look somewhat grotesque yet still look appealing, the character animation is very smooth and lively, and the sets look fantastically well crafted. Even the effects (which were either done by hand or on computers) stand out from how vibrantly sketchy and twisted they look.When I think of a dark fantasy film for the whole family, this is what I think up of. A film where its creativity in visual imagery starts off sweet and charming, but then takes the huge risk of showing a whole new world with disturbing creatures to show kids the meaning of fear. And what really helps are the fantastic surreal imagery, the spooky voices, the spot-on music score and the film's message to appreciate what you have because the grass is always greener on the other side. This frightening yet well executed message can stick to any person for how simple yet effective it is, and for it's mature honesty, that is why this film remains one of my favorite movies of all time.",9,1,2,18 February 2018
Green Room," Unapologetic for All the Right Reasons
","Because the horror movie genre has a wide array of themes to tackle, be it supernatural or psychological, it only makes sense that some filmmakers choose to tell down to earth stories with it based on the horrors of our world. In the case of Green Room, it delves into a more realistic tone to reveal just how horrid some parts of the American society can truly be. After it premiered at Cannes in 2015, it got a wider release in 2016 to rave reviews. Even though it didn't perform well financially, it's definitely a flick worth being deemed as a classic in the future just for how little it holds back just to give its own two cents on certain individuals.The film centers on a punk rock band who get attacked by neo-Nazi skinheads after witnessing a murder performed at a remote club in the Pacific Northwest. The film cleverly lets the uneasiness transition in smoothly, as the band are already aware they're performing for this infamous group. It isn't until the aforementioned murder happens when the stakes really get intense, as the band are all held hostage at the hands of these psychopaths. As for the plot itself, it mainly focuses on both the band members trying to figure a way out of the place and the skin heads figuring out ways to kill them quicker. While the pacing can drag on at points, it still works in service to the unpredictable tension that plagues the fear all around the member's escape tactics. The only legitimate critique on the story's front is that the ending feels somewhat anti climatic, although I imagine it's how most would seek vengeance on others.As long as you have good characters, they should be worth rooting for in such dire situations, and the film features a successful cast. In terms of the band members, Pat, Sam, Reece and Tiger all have their own disagreements with one another but still do their best as a team to solve any given dilemma that hits them. By thinking ahead around the obstacles in their path, these people are examples as to why logic is necessary for escaping sociopathic slime. Arguably the most sympathetic character in the film is one of the murder witnesses Amber, given that she only became part of the nazi cult as a way of escaping a hellish life, only to go out of her way to get rid of such a past. While most of the skin heads are downright evil, the most sophisticated of them all is the leader Darcy. In addition to Patrick Stewart selling charisma on top of masochism, this guy is a brilliant mastermind to the point of always being on guard to stop any witnesses who may get in his sadistic ways. With a mix of moral and immoral views, all the characters remain memorable for different reasons.Now while the film was made on a low budget, it made good use of its limitations with fast paced editing, frightening lighting and the overall atmosphere. Given that there isn't a lot of music outside of some rock ballads and a quiet score, the scenes appropriately grate on the nerves with a subtle flow from the relatively calm moments to the inevitable massacring. It's necessary to let the scares come at a natural ease before suckering the viewers with them. Given the film's title, the actual green room area creates a very claustrophobic environment where you can never expect what will come at you, especially with the shadowy spaces where you can't make out anything. The usage of cutting the shots every five to ten seconds helps to heighten up the paranoia of being held hostage by fascist supremacists, as if it's all a reflection of the viewers being in such a psychotic situation. Without cheesy jump scares or obnoxious music, a setting can do all the work to freak people out.If there could ever be a horror film that can best be described as eye opening, this one would be that. By delivering unapologetic thrills with a surprising amount of intelligence, Green Room is the type of thriller that really opens up people to the real horror of the world: reality. While hate-filled groups have existed in America for centuries (let alone the whole world), we tend to forget just how badly they can affect the lives of others who are unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. Be it fiction or non-fiction, we need media to remind us of how ruthlessly savage certain groups like neo-nazis truly are, because if left unchecked, the more damaged democracy's reputation would become. Unless you can't stand to witness the brutal truth of the world, this film is a must watch for any horror fan or cinephile who wants to experience something out of the ordinary for the genre's typical standards. It may not hold back, but it will still make you think long and hard about our society.",9,2,3,20 June 2019
Ed Wood," Ed Wood if He Could....and He Did
","As someone who has watched movies ever since he was a little kid, I've seen my fair share of good ones, bad ones, and mediocre ones. However, no matter how the movie turns out, I never forget that at the end of the day, almost if not all film directors put their best foot forward on movies trying to make ends meet with art. The exact same thing can be said about Edward D. Wood Jr., the man infamously known as the Worst Director in history, as he made movies cheap and fast resulting in films in laughably dubious quality like Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and of course, Plan 9 from Outer Space...but as incompetent as he was, he made these films out of earnest intention because he had such a passion for filmmaking, and who better to tackle the project of an eccentric weirdo who had such a passion for film than another eccentric weirdo who made his own weird albeit earnest and passionate films than Tim Burton.What could have easily been a straight up mockery of the filmmaker ends up being a love letter to the man, as Burton clearly understands how hard it is to get a film made, thus sympathizing with the director through trial and error. What gives Wood a spark of light in the feature is that he is so optimistic and positive about the filmmaking experience and his own movies that he did whatever it took, from hiring his friends as actors, to getting washed up star Bela Lugosi in his films, to stealing props, to getting funding from a Baptist church. Sure a lot of this seems nuts, but keep in mind many other filmmakers have done crazy things to get their films made too (look up how Apocalypse Now and Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs were made), and while Wood may have been in the wrong, his unbelievably passionate drive to making the greatest films ever made really is worth the price of viewing.As for other technicalities, the acting is phenomenal, from Johnny Depp capturing Mr. Wood's upbeat and eccentric mannerisms, to Sarah Jessica Parker presenting his former girlfriend Dolores Fuller as motivating at first and then embarrassed by Ed's transvestism (the inspiration for Glen or Glenda), to Patricia Arquette as Ed's second girlfriend Kathy O'Hara presenting as sweet and accepting to Wood's transvestism, to Jeffrey Jones bringing the weird albeit earnest psychic Criswell to life, to Lisa Marie as the stern fatale Vampire, and even George Steele as the bulky unintelligible albeit sweet wrestler Tor Johnson. But the real scene stealer is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, who rightfully earned his Oscar for bringing to life this iconic horror movie actor to screen with his erratic behavior, heartbroken nature, and gentleness to Ed Wood that gives him a soft spot making one sympathize with the poor old man. Oh, and Bill Murray as the lovable homosexual Bunny Breckinridge? GENIUS!The film made the right decision in not only shooting it in black & white, but by also on occasion using real stock music to create the right mood for the 1950s, almost like a time capsule. Admittedly, the movie is not 100% accurate to Ed Wood's life, but it still elevates Wood's goal to keep pushing forward through all hardships. Tim Burton even explained, 'In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it.' Besides, its a movie first, and a biopic second (like Amadeus), don't except everything to click authentically. In conclusion, Ed Wood is not only my favorite film from Tim Burton, but one of my all time favorites for its wonderful intent that filmmakers always try to make the greatest films ever (even if studios may disagree with their visions), the fantastic cinematography and editing, the marvelous acting, the witty humor, and just about everything else. There is a reason I never judge a movie until I see it, and that's because I don't know something unless I actually view it. Sure I may assume it could be bad, but I don't know it is until I give it the time of day to fully analyze it. If I didn't, then I would not have seen movies I love with all my heart like La La Land, The Lego Movie, Zootopia, and especially this film. That, and even if their films end up poor, filmmakers will always put their best foot forward and I respect them for that every time they try to make a motion picture. As Orson Welles in this film said it best, 'Visions are worth fighting for, why spend your life making someone else's dreams?'",10,1,2,3 December 2017
Chicken Run," One of my Childhood Favorites
","When I was a kid, I practically ate this movie up as a kid, and watching now as a teenager, it still holds up very well. I've always admired stop-motion, and Aardman has always been quite gifted in crafting delightful characters, worlds and stories through the media. In the case with this film (which is their first feature-length film funny enough), it centers around a pack of chickens in a farm trying to escape said farm and live a peaceful life away from the cruel farmers who want to cook them to earn bigger profits. Along the way, a rooster accidentally lands in the farm, and he teaches them how to fly to escape said farmers. The result is a funny, charming, beautiful and at times emotional POW story that does great service to the likes of The Great Escape.What's well contrasted about the chicken coup is that it also feels like a prison, creating a sense of terror and suspense for the chickens. Adding on to a well layered story, the jokes are very witty and add some spunk and charm to the characters. However, the film is also not afraid of getting dark, as whenever the farmers are near the chickens, you can only pray that those hens will get out of there alive. The attempts at sentimentality hit very well as we feel for the main hen Ginger and her goal to leave her horrid life and to get out and find a new home, something that many people stuck in horrible lives wish to fulfill.Most if not all the characters are just delightful. Ginger is the smartest of all the chickens, is always thinking up each plan, and while she does have her disagreements with Rocky the rooster, they do grow more fond of each other and it's very sweet whenever they bond. Speaking of Rocky, while his arch is the typical liar revealed story line you'd find in other films, he does grow a soft side for the hens and his snarky attitude only fits in to how charming he is. As for the other hens, they range from amusing and smart witted like Gabs and Mac to more stubborn like Bunty and Fowler, but that fits in to the contrasting views of what they can do to escape. Oh yeah, and the rats Nick and Fletcher are madly amusing and do help the chickens out, so they're good in my book.And then there's Mrs. Tweedy, the co-owner of the chicken farm and wife of the absent-minded albeit occasionally demanding Mr. Tweedy. She is so threatening from her appearance that whenever she's on screen, she gives me goosebumps. Add on her ferocious dogs and you've got a villain who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, and in this case, to turn all her chickens into pies to gain higher salaries...seriously, don't mess with Tweedy.Technical wise, this movie is marvelous. The sets look well detailed, the characters are in the usual simple yet amusing Aardman style, the effects are superb, and the flying scenes are just...stellar. Even though this was Aardman's first feature film, they went all out in crafting a great setting for where the film's core is, and they never hold back in giving the characters such unique and layered body expressions. Oh, and the gravy machine....pure masterpiece.And last but certainly not least, the music score. Harry-Gregson Williams and John Powell tangle with an upbeat lively score and a more suspenseful heist score that really add to the tension of each scene. There are many solid works in England when it comes to animation, and Chicken Run is no exception. While the liar revealed story and the occasional dodgy character play afloat, the film's solid animation, lovable cast of characters, well layered story, and charming score really make it a solid flick worth watching. If you have a kid of your own, pass this film on to them, and maybe then they'll have a favorite of theirs from their childhood that they'll stay forever attached to.",8,0,0,16 November 2017
Aquaman," Hysterical Popcorn Entertainment for All
","One of the most infamous films to come out of the DC Extended Universe in definitely Justice League due to its messy structure and clear behind the scenes meddling. That being said, what followed up could very well be their most creative endeavor yet, and that is the cinematic stand alone flick centered around Aquaman. It also happens to be the only addition to this franchise that grossed over a billion dollars worldwide. After finally having watched it, I must say that it is arguably their most epic and rad flick they have made thus far.The main storyline revolves around Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry, who is the heir to the underwater kingdom called Atlantis. However, he is destined to step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world. From that premise alone, the film has a very predictable narrative, and its not hard to figure out what happens throughout the runtime. In addition, the film has a rather pointless subplot centering on Black Manta seeking revenge towards Aquaman, and it barely has much connection to the progression of the film as a whole. Also, many of the other characters are two-dimensional at best, Arthur's relationship with Meta lacks the proper chemistry needed for a romantic arch, and the film may really didn't need to be nearly 2.5 hours.However, where the film may lack in originality, it more than ever makes up with a huge epic scale and some amazing action. It really feels as if director James Wan was having a field day with all the different set pieces the film displays. From the underwater regions, to the vast Sahara desert, to the coastal villages of Italy and more, the overall scope of the film really creates the feeling that were are viewing an epic globetrotting adventure. Not to mention, the CGI is highly imaginative and the vast amount of creature designs are enough to inspire plenty of animators and visual effects artists. All these different areas and monsters the film plays around with make me feel like I'm experiencing something out of this world, something that even some of the best superhero movies don't offer.Now admittedly, the film does feature unnecessary slow mo angles like the former DC films, but at least they don't rely on it. Also, most of the acting is relatively good, even down to Jason Mamoa seemingly having fun with his character. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman are serviceable enough, whereas the likes of Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren seem like they're underacting, and even the younger actors playing past forms of Aquaman come off as laughably bad. More often than not, trying to act bold and stoic doesn't really lead to an appropriately convincing performance, but then again, this movie isn't even about Oscar worthy performances. If anything, that Oscar goes to the catchy and upbeat rendition of Africa by Pitbull.Never in my life would I think I'd be enjoying a movie from this franchise solely out of its production values and creativity than the actual story. Despite its cliched storyline and hit or miss characters, Aquaman might be the most entertaining DCEU venture next to Shazam, although this one is more entertaining from how nutty it all is. Where Shazam was amusing and fun intentionally, this film creates such a crazy world of its own that it might as well be in the history books of biggest blockbuster superhero hits. Even if you're not a DC fan, I would actually recommend this movie due to the epic scope and highly imaginative visual aesthetic. It may be more brawn than brains, but as pure campy popcorn delight, you won't be disappointed at all.",6,0,1,31 May 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Everyone's Favorite Ghibli Creature
","We all love My Neighbor Totoro, and there's many reasons why. It's an adorable children's film with a lot of heart and soul, it's the first film people conjure up when they think of Studio Ghibli, and it's one of the most recognizable Japanese animated films of all time. Out of all the films by Hayao Miyazaki, this one just might be his most popular, even more than his greatest accomplishments like that of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. I mean, Totoro is Ghibli's mascot after all. But what does make this film special and worth this much praise for over 30 years?When one gets down to it, this film doesn't really have much of a concrete narrative. The whole film centers around two girls named Satsuki and Mei who move with their father to the countryside to be close to their ill mother, and the rest of the feature is about them embracing the wonders of the forest around them, as well as befriending a giant bunny only they can see. Now from that concept alone, this film could have easily failed, as there's no full on narrative to gravitate towards and we mainly watch the children run around in their home, go to school and hang out with Totoro. However, in execution, it actually works as a visual showcase of childhood wonderment.Apparently, Miyazaki based this film off his own life growing up in post WWI Japan around the ever growing urban development near big cities. Similar to Satsuki and Mei's mother, Miyazaki's mother suffered from tuberculosis, so the depictions of the children's astonishment and activities around their country house feel very much like how any given child would act. In addition, the dynamic between Satsuki and Mei feels very genuine, as even during their biggest arguments, they're no less different than any sibling rivalry that we've all faced growing up. For a film entitled My Neighbor Totoro, the film really is about these two girls' mundane lives, and there's a lot to appreciate about just how peaceful yet alluring their fantasies play out in contrast to their daily lives.That being said, the closest element of the film that resembles a plot is during the third act when Mei runs away to the hospital after hearing that the mother has to stay a little longer. A real sense off drama comes through and yet despite it feeling very emotional, we all know things will be just fine with Totoro around. In fact, this act alone pretty much wrapped up the arch of the girls worrying about their mother, and one can tell Miyazaki really felt proud about this addition given his autobiographical influence that led to this conclusion.There are many different mythological beasts of Japanese folklore, and I think Miyazaki has created a new one for the ages. One of the best scenes in the whole film is centered around our two protagonists waiting for their dad at the bus stop while Totoro waits for a cat bus. Setting aside just how luxurious that cat bus is by both design and motion, there's a real sense of fantastical mystery that comes from seeing such a strange albeit friendly creature that children can gravitate to in becoming one with their surroundings. Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is a genuinely sweet, optimistic and downright admirable family film that reminds us how friendliness can triumph over grimness.",8,0,0,10 November 2018
The Jungle Book," Walt Disney's Flawed yet Memorable Swan Song
","If there's any film that truly marked the end of an era, it would have to be Walt Disney's film adaptation of The Jungle Book, as it was the last feature made under his involvement before he passed away almost a year before it was released. When it did come out, not only was it a critical and commercial success, but it helped spark the company to move forward in animated features, and more than 50 years later, it's gone through ups and downs to become the animation powerhouse we remember it as. But as for the movie itself, while its legacy remains as strong as ever, I wouldn't place it among the studio's strongest efforts.Now the film's main storyline involving the little human boy Mowgli being forced to go back to the man-village is well remembered, not because of Mowgli himself, but because of the bizarre characters he encounters along the way. From the snooty cynical panther Bagheera trying to do what's best for Mowgli in spite of their differences, to the upbeat slacker bear Baloo showing him the fun of living carefree in the jungle, to the crazed scat-singing King Louie, so on and so forth. What's funny is that these characters have been cherished by audiences for decades for their exuberant personalities and specified voice actors whom the crew based off to form them, from the hip Phil Harris, to the stuffy Sebastian Cabot, to the energetic Louis Prima, to even the pompous George Sanders. However, the one that people care about the least is Mowgli himself, as he's the most forgettable and annoying character in the whole feature due to his whiny demeanor and obnoxious personality. Similar to Walt's Alice in Wonderland from the 50s, the main protagonist is so bland that everyone else around them sticks out way better.Another strong quality of the feature are the musical numbers by the Sherman Brothers, as even the ones that don't carry the story forward are entertaining enough on their own. Some are utilized as character exposition like Colonel Haiti's March, I Wanna Be Like You, and My Own Home, whereas others show both the positive and negative sides of the jungle like Trust in Me and the Oscar-nominated Bare Necessities. Speaking of Bare Necessities, it was the only song written by Terry Gilkyson, as it spawned from an previous version of the movie that wasn't produced. That leads into how distinctive the movie was from the original Rudyard Kipling novel, down to where Walt told the head story writer on the film Larry Clemmons to not even read the book. Whether or not the original draft of the movie would have been better is certainly debatable, but Disney's reputation with their animated films has often consisted of going in altered directions from literature with their own twist, and considering this film was uncle Walt's swan song, none can deny the charm it displays with what it offers differently.As for the overall visuals, some of Walt's finest animators really put their 'all' into each character. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston once stated that presenting emotions onto the fun loving Baloo proved to be difficult after Walt had died, and yet they managed to pull it off very well through subtle gestures. However, as fun and expressive as the animals are in the movie (seriously, Milt Kahl really hammed up Shere Kahn), Mowgli's more realistic animation is somewhat of a weird contrast, although that may be due to inconsistent rotoscoping and minimal facial variation. On the other hand, the backgrounds are gorgeously painted and composited within each shot, as they feel like 18th century British literature images brought to animation. In addition to some scratchy looking effect work that blend well with the environments, the Xerox-handled characters stick out distinctly from the backgrounds to give better contrast to their flat albeit bold features. Even though Walt himself never cared for the Xerox process, it certainly gave the animated movies for the next decade a unique style to say the least.So is The Jungle Book the greatest Disney film of all time? At least in my eyes, not exactly. However, even with its straight forward narrative, uninteresting main protagonist and deviations from its original source material, what the movie does offer on its own is very entertaining in its own right. Even for the next century, there's high doubt we'll forget about the charming animal characters and timeless songs that left an impact after a legend's death. Of course the Rudyard Kipling novel will go down in history as a classic too, but this feature will always remind the world why Walt Disney's passing meant so much to it.",6,0,0,8 May 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," The Most Disturbing Fairy Tale I've Ever Seen
","This is the first film I've seen from dark fantasy film director Guillermo del Toro, and I don't think I've seen a movie that changed my perception of fantasy films as much as this. I am not kidding when I say that this movie is disturbing beyond reason, as it centers around a girl named Ofelia who moves in with her stepfather, the tyrannical Captain Vidal, while also living in her own imagination. Once she's at the residence of her stepfather, Ofelia discovers a mysterious labyrinth and meets a fan who sets her on a path to save herself as well as her severely ill mother. As time goes on though, there is a blur in the lines between fantasy and reality, and Ofelia soon encounters a horrific battle between Good and Evil.Right off the bat, the world building of the fantasy elements this film offers is incredible. The film has a very gritty and dark setting in the real world given the civil war happening, and as such the world Ofelia imagines is so grim yet imaginative that you wanna see more of it. The creatures in design are beyond words, whether it be the creature Pan (performed extraordinarily well by Doug Jones), to the fairies, to even a Pale Man, and considering that the film mixes animatronics and CGI along with makeup and costumes really brings the effects to new heights. It's no wonder the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Best Production Design, because this is like no other world I've ever seen in a fantasy film.As for the content, I did think that the arch of Captain Vidal got in the way of Ofelia's story a lot, and because of this it almost feels like two different movies are contrasting each other. However, it all fits with the dark world that Ofelia would go into, and since it's hard for her to witness such heinous acts in the real world, her imagination seems to take note and it creates a beautiful Gothic nightmare within itself. I could never stop rooting for Ofelia to just get away from such a horrid man or even life, and even though the trials she gets into in her own world are fake, the film succeeds in creating suspense between her relation with her mother and stepfather and what she can do to save herself.To quote film critic Jim Emerson, Pan's Labyrinth is 'a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children' As fantasy oriented as they are, fairy tales have never shied away from letting out their inner horrors, and those horrors have shaped kids into adults for the better. Pan's Labyrinth brings fantasy into such a grim underworld for a little girl's imagination that it fits beautifully with the contrast of reality and fantasy that can bring adults into this spellbinding fable. If you watch this film, you may never look at fantasy the same way again, but it will bring you back to a time when you cherished imaginary worlds as much as the next child.",9,1,1,24 November 2017
Taxi Driver," The Story of Loneliness Through the Perspective of an Isolated Man
","The 1970s was one of the most revolutionary decades in motion picture history. Because of the creative freedom given to filmmakers in Hollywood like never before, the world began to witness gems from the up and coming talents all around, such as Coppola, Spielberg, de Palma, Bogdanovich, Lucas, Friedkin and many more. One notable filmmaker who really made it big with a knock out psychological drama during this time was Martin Scorsese. Even though he had made other films before, Taxi Driver is the one flick that changed his career forever due to its worldwide acclaim from critics and audiences. To this day, it remains an incredibly fascinating insight on loneliness and isolation.The main storyline revolves around a disturbed loner of a New York taxi driver named Travis Bickle, who roams around the violent streets while losing his general sight of reality. Upon meeting a campaign worker Betsy and a child prostitute named Iris, Travis becomes hellbent on saving the world his way, even if it means to take the controversial step. At its core, this film is a representation of how feeling isolated from the world can mess people up. Travis, especially being a Vietnam veteran, bases his inner negativity on the general bleak vibe of New York City itself, as it's a place filled with people who he just can't be with. In addition to the psychos and women who don't have much respect for him, there's also plenty of disgusting creeps and losers who somehow manage to approach women without much effort. It isn't until he discovers Iris and hears the plotting of a crazy New Yorker bent on killing his wife for cheating on him that Travis feels he has a reason to take down the sleaze bags in the corrupt city once and for all; a rebel is born out of his shell.What's really interesting about Travis is how the film intentionally leaves out certain details about his overall character in order to present who he is now. There are many moments in the film, particularly at some of the political rallies, where he mostly looks around smiling strangely, yet they convey so much by showing an intriguingly chilling side to the guy worth questioning. Evocative characterization works best when a certain figure is shown to be who they are through emotional resonance, and Travis could be one of the most interesting characters worth dissecting through anyone's point of view. In addition, the acting is fantastic, especially with Robert De Niro giving the perfect contrast between Travis' softer side and psychopathic persona. Cybill Shepherd gives the most amount of humanity in Betsy, Albert Brooks creates the perfect amount of awkwardness in Tom, and a then young Jodie Foster comes off very genuine as a child under the influence who may have the brighter picture than Travis might regarding what could become of her, all with the right amount of spunk and pathos.When it comes to technical aspects worth admiring, one notable scene that sticks out is where Travis is rejected by Betsy on the phone as the camera pans away to a hallway. Scorsese has stated that the purpose of this shot is to peer away from the pain inflicted on Travis at said moment. Even if we're not seeing the man himself, the context of the scene is enough to make one feel the same amount of suffering the guy is holding within. In contrast, the more gritty and violent scenes can get slowed down to display the horror Travis inflicts upon the criminals, making them appropriately shocking. The cinematography by Michael Chapman provides a good mixture of mundane daytime events and hauntingly grim nights in such a tumultuous city filled with crime and lowlives. Bernard Hermann's score also succeeds in creating subtle paranoia through his famously chilling scores that elevate the already grieve stricken emotions that plague both Travis and his outlook on where he lives.Is there any reason not to call this a timeless masterpiece? Taxi Driver is, has and always will be remembered as one of the most psychologically traumatic films ever made, both in style and in substance. Two of the most recurring themes/tropes in many of Scorsese's films is modernized crime and conflict within crooks, so this film could be his crowning achievement in that department. I don't think I can say this is a must watch enough; it's a flick worth seeing at least once just to gain the experience from a ruined character. It may mess with you, but it will make you think long and hard about what you stand for, whether you're lonely or not.",10,1,1,16 February 2019
Full Metal Jacket," The War Genre Doesn't Get Better than This
","Stanley Kubrick was one of the several filmmakers out there who was able to make multiple movies in different genres and succeed in flying colors. Whether it'd be science fiction in 2001, horror in The Shining, comedy in Dr. Strangelove and dystopian crime thrillers in Clockwork Orange. So it wouldn't be a surprise for him to create an epic war film, and Full Metal Jacket was that. Based on the autobiographical novel The Short Timers by Gustav Hasford, who also co-wrote the script, this film went on to gain massive critical acclaim and is often seen as one of Kubrick's best, and I definitely agree on that.The general storyline revolves around the training of U.S. Marines, primarily on privates Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through boot camp under the abusive drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and Joker's later experiences in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. Many have criticized the film's odd method of storytelling, where the first act is structured well enough as a raw visceral depiction of army training camps, and the last two feel disjointed and all over the place. However, I think that actually works in favor of the feature, because all the casualties that come about during the war battles are just as sporadic as any given military combat. This movie stares straight at the ugliness of war and how violent mankind can get without being preachy or heavily metaphorical.The film does have plenty of humorous moments, such as during the combat training and the witty banter amongst Joker and the other marines, but they're no more in contrast to the harsh tones shown throughout. The scenes of private Pyle struggling throughout camp training may seem bitterly comedic at times, yet the horrific abuse given to the poor guy ends up creating a monster rather than a 'killer'. In addition, Vincent D'Onofrio did a great job displaying Pyle as sympathetic, both when he's miserable in combat practice, and when he starts going insane. That being said, the actor who really steals the show is R. Lee Ermey as Hartman himself, especially given that he was a Marine corps instructor prior to this film. His rapid fire insults are worthy of being cherished and he excels at being so brutally hard on all the corps that you don't want to cross his path.Lastly, the cinematography, fighting scenes and scope of the whole film are beyond admirable. Kubrick was always a sucker for letting the emotions come through in the visuals, and this film is no exception just for how tragically violent the war scenes really are. Whenever private Joker is in actual combat, the stakes get ramped up to 11, and it's never easy to figure out what will happen to the corps next. The usage of lighting throughout scenes where the characters are in burnt out facilities is beautifully crafted, showcasing how hazardous yet surprisingly gorgeous fires and smoke can truly be. Also, I have to give credit to Kubrick for having this entire movie shot in England as opposed to Vietnam himself. Often that suspension of disbelief would be thrown out the window, but everything is so accurate that it becomes hard to realize that we're not actually in Southeast Asia.I think James Rolfe put it best when he said that this is the kind of movie you only need to see once then you'll never forget it. Overall, despite being really brutal and tragic, Full Metal Jacket trumps through its depictions of dehumanization, its exuberant craftsmanship and stellar acting. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely give it a watch, for it's right up there with the greatest anti-war films of all time. It may leave you horrified, but it will still leave a massive impact on how terrifying war can really be. We never get a war film like this ever again, and that's what makes it one hell of a shoot out.",9,0,1,24 November 2018
Corpse Bride," Beautiful Albeit Simple Gothic Tale
","Despite Tim Burton being mistaken for making The Nightmare Before Christmas, it was actually his friend Henry Selick who directed the whole movie during its entire production. In reality, Burton has only directed two stop-motion animated films as of late, and one of which is Corpse Bride, based on a 19th century Russian folklore. Given it's critical praise and decent box office revenue, I think Burton managed to pull together a quite unique and gothic movie that holds up for the most part. For starters, the actual story is pretty simple and even kind of predictable, as it centers around the nervous Victor Van Dort who is soon to be married to Victoria Everglot through an arranged family marriage. While practicing his lines for the wedding, he accidentally puts the ring on a branch that drags him to the land of the dead. The branch is really the hand of a corpse named Emily, who was murdered after eloping with her love. Now Victor must set things right before Victoria marries the villainous Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant). While the story line is pretty routine and easy to follow, the heart of the movie is what makes it shine, as the emotions drive the movie by showing and even answering what it means to marry the dead. There are even some neat concepts about entering the land of the living that showcase the film's occasional creativity. While not high in substance, the story's dark atmosphere and harmonious tone make it a breath of fresh air for anyone into mysterious romance.Character-wise, most of them are rather one-dimensional but by no means horrible. Although Victor doesn't have much personality outside of his gawkiness, the things he goes through by ending up with a risen corpse of a bride does make him somewhat endearing and it makes one feel sorry for him as he just wants to make things right with his fake and real fiance. As for Emily, she has a rather tragic yet beautiful story-arc that anyone can find touching and heart-breaking, and whenever she sings about her remorseful state, she really gives the movie some much needed heart. Even Victor's fiance, Victoria, is worth giving some sympathy for considering the financial crisis her family is in. The rest of the cast range from bland like Victor's family, to weak and petty like the antagonistic Barkis Bittern, to even rather annoying like the comical reliefs. Next, the animation is just beautiful, as it goes for a very gothic and Burtonesque visual style that perfectly emulates the macabre setting of 19th century Victorian London. Although not quite as expressive as the characters in Nightmare, or even the Aardman and Laika films, the characters stay true to their simple albeit exaggerated graphic designs and faces. One notable highlight of visual splendor has to be the Land of the Living, as it features the most imaginative looking creatures and most amount of sickly colors to bring the world to life, complete with numerous somber and enticing effects.As for the songs, Remains of the Day is quite entertaining and upbeat while serving as a backstory to how Emily became the way she is. Otherwise, despite serving the story, none of the songs really stand out to much. They are well thought out and perfectly timed, but they don't have that certain pizazz that makes them memorable enough like Nightmare. Although Danny Elfman's music score is appropriately haunting and poetic, fully embracing the bleak and lovely setting of the film.Overall, despite being rather straight forward in its story and not being perfect in terms of character or even songs, Corpse Bride works well enough as an touching and haunting macabre tale that will make any fan of gothic stories, Tim Burton, or even animation go nuts over. I recommend this movie enough to say that it's worth a watch, even if it's not quite up there with other stop-motion films in terms of story or character, but at least the visuals are gorgeous. Not sure if Tim Burton is still planning on making more stop-motion animated films, but here's to a bright future if he's still interested in doing so.",6,0,1,6 June 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not as Exuberant as the Iconic Song
","Queen remains as one of the most iconic rock bands of all time, so making a biopic about them was a no-brainer. This film in particular was actually in development since 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play Freddie Mercury himself. However, after several disagreements with Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor, the project never went into full swing until a few years later, with Rami Malek of Mr. Robot to star as Mercury. In the end, what we got is a beautiful albeit standard tribute to the band. While it has its moments of inspiration, the product doesn't really rise above being passible and highly flawed.Right off the bat, the biggest problem with Bohemian Rhapsody lies within its depiction of Freddie Mercury through his personal life. Mercury was a highly fascinating albeit eccentric man who spent much of his life coping with his personal stigmas, yet the movie ends up rushing past plot point after plot point so much that the most we gain out of him was that he was bisexual, he liked cats and he died from AIDS. It doesn't help that the rest of Queen aren't given much development either, as each member comes off as two dimensional with little to know about them. What could have been a unique take on the musician biopic genre ends up being as cliche as the next, complete with disapproving parents, the shoddy romantic life, the greedy manager, the band break-up and the drug addiction. Even if some of these elements are appropriately dramatic, they still come off as routine and tiresome.On the plus side though, Rami Malek is fantastic as Freddie Mercury, as one can tell he truly analyzed his concert performances and videos in capturing enough charm, charisma and skill in recreating the iconic figure. In fact, the actors in general are wonderful in inhabiting their roles, especially those playing the other members of Queen. As formulaic as their relationship can be, they do manage to display a lot of witty banter and humorous rebuttals in managing their group. Even though Mary Austin is written as the typical concerned girlfriend, Lucy Boynton tries her best in making her sympathetic and she pulls it off well enough to create a decent amount of heart in the film. I can't say any of the characters are given enough dimension to be looked upon with greatness, but at least the cast knew how to deliver their performances with a lot of delightful zest.Bryan Singer's direction on the film can be a mixed bag at times. There are wonderfully crafted moments like the actors recreating the famous opening of the Bohemian Rhapsody music video, with negative quotes from critics being shown in contrast, and pretty much every performance and music video recreation, especially the Live Aid concert. However, other times the editing can get a little jarring and flashy up to the point where some of the performances can get a little sickening to watch. There might also be a few too many quick cuts even during scenes where characters just discuss specific details for their own good. On the other hand, the timing to the music, post production special effects and near flawless singing make up for what would otherwise be distracting choices in mashing scenes together in an exuberantly stylized manner.There has been a lot of respect for Freddie Mercury and what he did for modern music displayed in the film, but Bohemian Rhapsody could have been so much better than what it became. While the production design, acting and scenes of putting together the band's famous songs are worth praising, the rushed plot and simplified depiction of Mercury's personal and romantic relationships keep the film from being anything special. I suppose if you're simply a die hard Queen fanatic and you just want to see a decent albeit imperfect tribute to the famous band, then you might have a good time. On the other hand, if you're not a fan of them or you're very passionate about the real life of Mercury, it's best to give this one a skip. Maybe someday we'll get a truly marvelous and correct bio on one of Britain's greatest bands, but right now, this will simply remain as one of Rami Malek's best performances on his resume, because that man knew how to bring the bisexual super star to life better than this flick did.",6,1,1,4 November 2018
Baby Driver," That is One Fine Baby
","I'm not a huge fan of the work Edgar Wright, but I do admire his comedic and often fast paced style of filmmaking that can really grope a viewer into his work. So when I heard about Baby Driver, I didn't know what to expect from it, and let me just say, this could very well be Wright's finest achievement in filmmaking that I've seen thus far. This is in every sense of the word an amazing thrill ride that must be seen by all.As a die hard fan of action movies, Wright really captures the style, the suspense, the fast pace, and even the dark grittiness and humor that you'd find in a modern day action flick, and boy did this movie come with a kick. The action is always on full throttle, the fact that this was all filmed with little to no special effects is just mind boggling, the editing goes nuts without getting choppy or all over the place, the timing is excellent, and it really got me on the edge of my seat.Since this is a movie about a young man who was a victim of childhood trauma and must drown his sorrows out with music, that's where the movie shines phenomenally. Not only does each song play in accordance to the plot, but the timing, the choreography, and especially the pacing really elevate this film to new heights creating a sense of fun along the ride.Story wise, it's not that great in concept, since the titular character works for a kingpin but must get out of there after falling for a waitress. However, the romance, the character's charm, the stellar performance from Ansel Elgort, and earning to get out somewhere far really makes the titular character all the more worth rooting for. As for the other characters, they range from delightful like Debora and Joseph, to subtly maniacal like Kevin Spacey's Doc, to sinister yet witty like Darling and Jamie Foxx's Bats, to charming albeit disturbing like....well, I would say his name, but you just have to see the movie to find out.To sum it all up, Edgar Wright successfully packed raw and upbeat music into an already kick ass action flick complete with cute romance, a lovable main protagonist, high stakes, subtle emotion, breathtaking cinematography and stunts, and even a few laughs here and there. There is not a single moment in this film where Wright's passion can not be seen on screen, he put that much heart and soul into this given his admiration for action films. One of if not THE best movie of summer 2017, and here's to more delightful flicks like it in the future.",9,0,4,23 November 2017
The Shining," One of the Horror Genre's Crowning Achievements
","Out of all the film adaptations of Stephen King novels out there, this one might be the most beloved. Although not a critical hit on its original release, it did gain more positive attention in the following years, and now it is hailed as one of the greatest horror movies of all time. As for me personally, I very much agree with the cultural impact this film has left on society, yet I think it holds up even more now as a young adult. As someone who tends to work mostly within the indoors, the paranoia created in the film really hits home to me.The film centers around Jack Torrance, who becomes the caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado during the winter in hopes to continue his writing. Upon settling in with his wife Wendy and psychic son Danny, they gain visions of the hotel's dark pasts. As Jack discovers the hotel's spooky secrets, he grows into a homicidal maniac intent on murdering his family. With that said, the shear horror in the film comes from the isolation of Jack living in this hotel whilst coping with his inner sanity. Unlike the book where Jack started off as well intentioned before slowly turning insane on account of his former alcoholism, this version of the character is implied to be insane from the start, and Jack Nicholson brilliantly showcases the pure turmoils caused by cabin fever.Some particular scenes that convey Jack's sanity breaking are his bonds with Danny, as it's speculated that they both have the so called 'shining' yet in different viewpoints. Where Danny sees them as omens, Jack cannot help but to be lured in by their strange appearances. Even if many of these oddities are more ambiguous, the execution of them is handled in a way that lets the audience figure them out themselves, which has led to wonderful theories that make the viewing experience all the more interesting. The only weak link in the film for me is actually Wendy herself, as she comes off as so timid that she becomes shrill and whiney. She does surprisingly look after the hotel more than Jack, but Shelley Duvall ends up giving Nicholson a run for his money in hamminess, and she's not really written as a very bright character either.As for the technical aspects, director Stanley Kubrick always knew how to say so much by showing rather than telling. Every psychedelic illusion comes off as intimidating albeit distinct given their unique designs, and they're on screen long enough to sink in within the subconscious of the audience. In addition, this was one of the first films to utilize Steadicam cinematography, and it helps add in to the extravagant scale and scope of the Overlook Hotel. One of my favorite scenes is where Danny is riding on his big wheel through the halls whilst the camera follows him, as it recreates the point of view of a child in a brand new environment. No matter what scene you watch in this film, including that WTF moment of the bear, they all serve their purpose in either showcasing the hotel's many haunting illusions or just serving as gothic art.Sure, King himself may not have liked it, but that didn't stop this film from aging like fine wine. Overall, while a loose adaptation of its source material, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining works as a great horror movie on its own for its commentary on isolation and insanity, psychedelic nature, haunting cinematography, and storytelling ideologies left to be talked about. Whether you're a fan of King, Kubrick or horror movies in general, this is a definite watch for how much it displays paranoia in a slow albeit mesmerizing way. I'm sure you'll relate to the claustrophobic aesthetic of being stuck inside for so long, especially during this time of year where staying inside is wiser than going out.",9,1,4,24 October 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Best Spiderman Venture in Years
","If there's one notable superhero with a very hit or miss track record when it comes to their film adaptations, it has to be Marvel's iconic Spider-Man. Whether they be the right blend of goofiness and emotional drama with Sam Raimi's trilogy, or the embarrassingly lackluster Amazing Spider-Man series, the web slinging hero has been through as many duds as successes. However, there has never really been an animated feature with this hero or any incarnations....until now. Ever since the first trailer dropped last year, the buzz for this particular film blew up, mainly due to it focusing on a new Spider-Man, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales. After finally seeing it, I can officially confirm that the wait was beyond worth it.The main storyline revolves around Miles Morales becoming the next Spiderman after getting bitten by a radioactive spider. However, the evil Kingpin creates a portal to other universes that goes haywire and ends up pulling distinct versions of Spider-Man into Miles' world. Upon meeting Peter Parker, Miles now has to take Kingpin down and bring those incarnations back. With all that said, the film rests on Miles' shoulders to lead, and he is one hell of a protagonist. Alongside being very likable, the film does a great job of establishing his relationships, personality and even emotions. I also like how he only grows accustomed to his powers after many trials and tribulations with all the craziness going around. Even his interactions with Peter Parker feel like that of an apprentice learning from a master, they're so much fun to watch.In addition, the film happens to be a great blend of self referential humor and emotional drama. Screenwriters Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman cram in plenty of in-jokes for hardcore Spider-Man fans in a subtle manner without losing newcomers, making them feel connected within the narrative. As for the emotional weight, it stems from Miles' different bonds between his father and uncle Aaron, and both are well woven into the plot. There are even scenes with the two around Miles that one would never expect from a film like this. For a film with several villains, they all have just enough screen time to be memorable, especially Kingpin, mainly because his reasons behind making the portal are more elaborate than first assumed. Never has a superhero film managed to squeeze in the right amount of humor and pathos to work well as a part comedy and part drama since The Incredibles and The Lego Batman Movie.As for the other characters, Peter Parker is established as the pessimistic hero turned failure, yet his relation with Miles gains him more confidence to get back into the swing of things (no pun intended). Throughout the film, we really feel for the guy and want him to succeed as much as Miles, making him come off as a sympathetic albeit charismatic mentor. Gwen Stacy is also appropriately placed within the film's narrative, as rather than being a Mary Sue, she plays as a voice of reason to Miles and hopes the best for him, like a real partner should do. As for the multiple dimensions featured, there's the 1930s serious dramatic Spider-Noir, the goofy and comical Spider-Ham, and the bubbly anime girl Peni Parker. While not given as much attention as Miles and Peter, they still end up stealing the show with their distinct quirks and charm, and their voice actors, especially Nic Cage, bring them to life as much as the script and animators do. It's rare when a film is able to squeeze in so many characters yet still manages to give them enough presence to leave an impact.Lastly, the animation is incredibly versatile, vivid, colorful and even grim, really emulating the feel of a graphic comic book. The characters are all uniquely designed based on their appearance and personality, especially the Spider-Man incarnations looking distinct based on their physical appearance. Spider-Noir is black & white with shadows all around, Spider-Ham is very cartoony and bouncy, and Peni Parker is every anime girl ever made cranked up to 11. Not to mention, the action scenes are fantastically well directed, as the stakes really rise up with a lot of well choreographed fighting moves and a briskly paced flow. It's also worth praising how the film conveys its emotions through the color scheme depending on the scene, saying way more than any amount of dialogue ever could. My only issue with the animation is that it can look a little blurry at times, but that's more of a nitpick as it's intentionally built that way.Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has got to be my absolute favorite addition in the Spiderman film franchise. It also might be the most imaginative and innovative comic book film on screen in years thanks to its wonderful stylistic choices, humorous antics, well woven drama, and characters you will never forget. If you are yet to see this, please give this film as much support as you can, it's definitely a blast to sit through. We rarely get superhero films like this nowadays, so giving it the attention it deserves will mean more sequels and huge cult status for years to come. Sony Pictures Animation has only scratched the surface with what Miles Morales can do, so here's to more great adventures with the new up and coming Spider-Man in the future.",9,8,18,16 December 2018
Ratatouille," 10 Years Later....and I Still Love It
","When people mention their favorite Pixar movie, the usual answer is either Toy Story, Finding Neo, The Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, or even Inside Out. And while I definitely admire those films for what they are and for the impact they've led on animation in general, my personal favorite of the company's filmography is none other than Ratatouille. I don't know what my deal is with this movie, it just gives me the most enjoyment and satisfaction out of all the Pixar films on the block. Watching it now 10 years since it came out, it still resonates with me on a personal level.The main character Remi is unfortunate to be a rat who has the dream of cooking, and it's through his passion that we see just how lovable, intelligent and gifted he really is. Alongside knowing some really good recipes, the way he was able to befriend Alfredo Linguini but also control him with his hair just adds into how knowledgeable he is in terms of cooking. Speaking of cooking, that's where the movie truly shines in, as it shows many different techniques of how to prepare different types of delicacies, from soup, to a special order, to even the actual meal ratatouille itself. I myself love the very concept of cooking as a food lover, so it was fantastic to see Pixar really go outside the box to explore just how fun and intriguing cooking truly is. Adding into how experimental the ideas of cooking in the movie are, the animation is just sublime. The usage of colors, types of food, atmospheric scape of Paris, and 1960s style setting really gives the movie a sense of French delight and makes the movie look appealing as much as the food it presents. Also, the character designs are very well done, as they look like 2D character first and computer-generated characters second. They cross between the line of realistic and simplistic while also moving at a brisk pace, especially the rats. And another added bonus is how well shot the movie is, not just how beautiful it looks, but also by how a scene plays out almost like it's own mini segment that still fits into the story.As for the characters besides Remi, most of them are memorable, funny, and quite intriguing. Linguini is kind of uninteresting at first, but as he becomes more famous and starts running Gusteau's Restaurant, he becomes more relatable since he shows just how hard it is to run a restaurant while being a friend with a rat. Collette starts off more as a tough cookie, but as she teaches Linguini more about the staff and kitchen production, she does grow a soft spot for him and becomes a great mentor for cooking. Although, she and Linguini really didn't need to be a couple, they could have just been friends. Remi's dad is a bit crabby, but he's just a leader of a rat family looking out for what's best for him, his sons, and the rest. Oh, and Emile is so charming. Skinner is menacing at times but is also kind of a second rate chef, and the other cooks have their moments but aren't as explored as much as they could be.And then there's the movie's antagonist, Anton Ego, played extraordinarily by Peter O'Toole. As a snobby critic who really takes cooking seriously, he had always loathed the idea from Jean Gusteau (Remi's idol and former owner of Gusteau's restaurant) that anyone can cook, but by the end of the film, not only does the meal he's given prove just how delicious the average piece of junk may be, but the review he writes is beyond words. I'm not kidding when I say that the review he gives is one of my favorite reviews, and it basically states that as much as it's fun to be cynical, we mustn't always let our bias get the best of us, because there's a good chance that something we may not care for is probably more meaningful than we think.Overall, Ratatouille to this day remains my personal favorite Pixar movie. Sure not all of the characters are fully explored and it's not without it's clichés, but the phenomenal animation, expansive knowledge of cooking, lovable main leads and antagonist, humor, tribute to Paris, and review really make this movie a special treat for me. If you love Pixar, please give this movie another look. It may seem like a silly idea, but just like trying exotic French food, it's always fun to be adventurous, especially when wanting to be a great artist like a rat who loves to cook.",9,0,0,14 November 2017
Captain America: Civil War," One of the MCU's Better Flicks
","In 2011, the Marvel Cinematic Universe unleashed their first feature starring Captain America during their first phase. In 2014, they brought back the avenger during their second phase with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Both movies have gotten praise from critics, audiences, and Marvel fans alike for their brisk pacing, highly coordinated action, and fun performances. So back in 2016, they presented another story with Steve Rogers and some more avengers, Civil War. As this was the first installment in the Cinematic Universe's third phase of their supposed story arch, I can say that they succeeded more than the previous endeavors.In terms of the plot, the film has a rather straight-forward albeit complex narrative with enough dark moments to keep it from getting stale. While the film does have a pretty weak start, it does pick up by the second act by showing off multiple twists and plot points that never overstay their welcome, and a nice continuation of the heroes viewing how they are seen. Considering this is about the team being divided based on control from the government, it really creates a valid point of view from each side, and the audience will definitely feel for both instead of one or the other.The funny thing to note about this movie is that although it has Captain America in the title, it surprisingly feels more like a Captain America and Iron Man movie, but an interesting one at that. The different points of view they have on protecting people by political standards really tangle their team up and it really creates a sense of dramatic tension between the two. While Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) give the audience a good enough reason to root for them, the other supers (like Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, and Hawkeye) contribute to the plot wonderfully by aiding their individual fellow mates. Add a nice balance of drama and comedy along with some tense action and dark material and the characters make the experience worthwhile.As for the introduction of the then new characters, the movie handles them pretty well for the most part. Even though they were used to get the fanboys in, the MCU'S take on Spiderman, the Winter Soldier, and Black Panther are well thought out and they give each super their own distinct personalities that play off each other well. You got Peter Parker being the dorky average new-comer to the team, the Winter Soldier as the one with the once murderous mindset now helping the Capt., and Black Panther being the one with a reasonable and tragic backstory which gives him the opportunity to let his warrior side shine through. That being said, Vision and Ant-Man end up contributing less to the group and don't even show up as much as you'd hope for. The villains themselves do have their motivations in tact though, which makes for some powerful chemistry between the realms of patriotism and government.One thing that many people look forward to in Marvel movies are how well the crew can showcase their effects, and this is no exception. Not only are the effects well crafted, but they never last too long so it can let the audience metabolize them enough. Even though CGI and motion-capture have been used poorly in the past, they have been used very well for these movies, especially considering that the crew members always have plenty to work with. Even the cinematography helps by adding suspense to each action paced shot, and it also takes its time to rest at the more serious moments. The one minor complaintI have is that they could've made some of the fights look a little less goofy and cartoony for their own good.But lastly, what this film succeeds at most is being a great Captain American movie. Despite the shove-ins from the Avengers and new-comers, it continues the storyline of Steve Rogers without rushing too much. After the horrible events that led to the brainwashing of his war partner Bucky that turned him into an assassin, Rogers now has to face two major dilemmas: freedom from government take down and the betrayal of his fellow comrades. The determination the man has just to help civilians in need without much rule from others is very commendable, even if his teammates disagree and try to solve it the old fashioned way: battling each other. What's even more shocking is how the character Bucky, or the Winter Soldier, is played out in this by showing how he did his most deadly mission known to man. When the continuity kicks in, it really shines thru to keep the characters in tact, even when it means learning something new about the past.After the fun first film and the disappointing second film (to me at least), this is definitely the best out of the Captain America films. Thanks to the brisk action, gorgeous action, well constructed story, and decent mix of humor and drama, Civil War might just be one of the MCU and the superhero genre's best. If you're a fan of Marvel, this is a definite recommendation, if you haven't seen it already. It's funny how before Infinity War, this was arguably the division's more serious and dark flick yet, and I couldn't be happier to remember it for the next decade.",8,0,0,7 December 2018
Spirited Away," Hayao Miyazaki's Magnum Opus
","Like many people, I adore the work of Hayao Miyazaki, let alone Studio Ghibli. Not only are the worlds he creates through animation highly imaginative and gorgeous, but his characters and stories really make one think, especially with such themes like finding yourself, dangers towards the environment, survival, courage, over consumption, etc. So with that said, I not only deem his 2001 feature Spirited Away his best work, but also one of my personal favorite films of all time (and no Academy Award will ever be the reason why).The story is that after getting lost on the drive to their new home, a couple and their 10 year old girl named Chihiro enter a tunnel passage that leads them into some spirit world. After eating a bunch of the spirit's food, the parents are transformed into pigs by the witch Yubaba, the head of a bathhouse that many of the spirits work at. In order to save herself and her family, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse in order to get back to the human world, while also building up her courage and rediscovering memories she lost long ago. I think this is the perfect set up for a great fantasy film, and the film does not fail in its execution. While the film focuses more on the plot, there are just enough fantasy moments to keep one's interest. Whether they be dark like the parents turning into pigs or Yubaba taking center stage, disgusting like the famous bath scene or the spirit No-Face hurling excruciatingly, or amusing like Chihiro working in the bathhouse, the film never holds back in letting its imagination run wild.That being said, what really makes this film for me are the characters themselves. Chihiro could have easily been annoying, but the film managed to balance her anxious fear and emotions to where you relate to her in situations like....well, having to save your parents and overcome your biggest fears. The spirit Haku, while sometimes thieving, only does so to find his way home and remember who he is, considering how much he despises working under Yubaba's wing. Speaking of Yubaba, while she can be very threatening and rather bossy, she also tries her darnedest to keep her workforce stable, so one can relate to such pandemonium (even if one could resent her). As for the other cast, No-Face is essentially a spirit who wants to get into the hearts of others, but simply doesn't know how. This is what causes him to go somewhat insane in the bathhouse and start consuming everything uncontrollably; good thing Chihiro came along to snap him out of reality. Sometimes, we can fly off the handle and only those who care for us can really make us feel better. In terms of supporting players, Lin can be saucy but does have a big heart and also has dreams of her own, Kamaji has a bit of a temper but also cares much for the support of Chihiro, Yubaba's baby goes from being a whiner to a kind soul through a spell that turns him into a mouse in order to teach him some manners, and the other spirits can range from weird to rather rude. Spirits sure are prejudice to humans, aren't they?Given that this is a Studio Ghibli flick, it's no surprise that the animation is splendid beyond reason. The designs of the spirits are highly imaginative and strange, Chihiro's movements look very much like that of a little girl, the backgrounds are breathtaking, the effects are lavish, the CGI blends very well with the 2D environments, and the world building really makes one wish the film showed more. Each scene (whether comedic, dramatic or frightening) are all played up with just the right amount of tension to detail. I think the train scene with Chihiro, No-Face and the baby is one of the greatest scenes in all of cinema if only for how quiet and atmospheric it is, just letting the scenery do the talking for the audience rather than dialogue. Lastly, the music score by Joe Hisaishi is a melodious treat. Like the animation, each track fits perfectly with whichever scene comes afloat, especially the train scene where it's more somber and mellow. The flying scenes have a lot of emotional appeal from the highly enchanting score that define just how gorgeous they look. Not to mention, the ending song might be stuck in your head for quite some time as it's heartwarming and symphonic enough to hit the right emotional spot for viewers.To quote Rotten Tomatoes, Spirited Away is a 'gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by our world'. There's a reason this film still remains one of the greatest accomplishments in all of animation, let alone film. Not only does it embrace the world of fantasy to such an emotional and thought provoking degree, but it makes one think how they themselves would overcome moments of losing loved ones, or having to work to save themselves, or remembering who they are. Of all the wonderful features that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have cranked out, none of them will ever leave the same impact on me as this masterpiece did. If you are yet to see this film, track it down as soon as you can. You yourself might be inspired by your own personal struggles that would fit in the world of fantasy, just like what Miyazaki did with this gem.",10,1,2,4 February 2018
Yesterday," Lighthearted Fun with an Underdeveloped Premise
","Some of my favorite types of films are those that take a struggling individual and put them in a surreal fantasy-like situation unlike anything on Earth. In the case of this film, it follows a struggling musician who, after an accident, becomes the only person to remember the Beatles, and then becomes famous for taking credit on their songs. That premise alone could create one of the greatest films of all time, and with screenwriter Richard Curtis (Four Weddings & a Funeral) and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) on board, this would seem like a sure fire hit. However, while it was by no means bad, it could have used less familiarity and more substance.Now admittedly, the best aspect of the film has to be the main character, Jack Malick, goes through as the only person to not only know the Fab Four's work, but also debatably carrying on their legacy by singing their songs. While he does have a predictable outcome with his manager/friend Ellie whom both have feelings for each other, it does give him growth in deciding between living either a ginormous lie or a simple life of happiness and solitude. In addition, Himesh Patel does a fantastic job lending his acting talents and surprisingly good singing range as Jack, and his performance alone practically carries the film on its shoulders. Everyone else does a really good job, including Lily James as the sweet albeit concerned Ellie, Joel Fry as the juvenile slacker friend Rocky, Kate McKinnon as the hysterical and overbearing manager Deborah, and both Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal as Jack's carefree and passive parents. Even Ed Sheeran displays some notable sincerity and subtle emotions through his performance alone.However, the one major flaw with the film is that it underdeveloped its incredible concept to focus more on Jack's stressful career and feelings for Ellie. Aside from Jack, there are two other people in the film who still remember The Beatles, and they alone should have had much more screen time. Later on, it's revealed that John Lennon didn't die and instead lived a simple obscure life with his spouse. In all honesty, the film would have been a lot more unique if it explored the idea of being in a world where the band did not exist and Jack starts over with their work, with the other two helping him discover what went wrong. Instead, the film seems to sideline that potentially grand storyline for a standard rom-com scenario. However, in spite of all that, the film still has a very charming feel to it all, much of which is captivated by the acting and live singing. The lighthearted nature of it all is definitely enough to put a lot of smiles on Beatles fans and general audiences.In terms of notable production values, the editing can be fast paced whenever it's being timed to the songs. The vibrant usage of colors help elevate the effects in the music video-like scenes as well as the quick cuts, long pans, dutch angles, wide shots and other cinematography tricks to keep the film on a leisurely pace. Interestingly enough, often when the film plays a song, it can go up to a very loud rate, but then it all stops and even quiets down in any scene right afterwards to give some closure and let the viewers rest. It's a nice little bonus when the sound mixing compliments the musical accompaniment with striking vitality and smooth transitions. It's a nice little touch that some movies have forgotten to do nowadays. Also, it's somewhat cliched how the film depicts England as either mundane or urban, but it does create a nice contrast between the much more bright and wild Los Angeles and how overly commercialized it is, fitting with the film's theme of turning into something you're not.It is a tad disappointing that such a premise was not explored in its execution further, but the film at least has it heart in the right place. Overall, while Yesterday does sell its concept short for a routine rom-com storyline and some questionable narrative flaws, the charming acting, lighthearted tone and splendid singing performances to make the film enjoyable enough to watch. If you're looking for a film that delves into such an oddball premise like this flick has, then you might want to find something else. However, if you're just in for some harmless and goofy fun that still pays tribute to the legacy of the Fab Four, then you'll have a pleasant experience. Maybe in the future we'll experience a movie that explores this concept further, but until then, we can all let it be.",7,0,1,22 July 2019
The Princess Bride," A Storybook Chick Flick for Everyone
","In the mid to late 80s, screenwriter and author William Goldman managed to get a book of his published called The Princess Bride, with Rob Reiner on board as director. Alongside obtaining critical acclaim and becoming a cult classic, it introduced the likes of Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Andre the Giant and more into the mainstream crowd. In addition, it is one of the few chick flicks that is not only beloved by guys, but pretty much everyone as it has enough romance, action, adventure, and witty banter to keep all invested. No wonder this became one of the most quotable movies of all time.The film is essentially a story within a story, as a sick boy is being told the story in book form by his grandfather. The actual story itself centers around a farmhand named Westley, who along with several befriended companions as the story progresses, must rescue his true love Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck after being lost for five years. While the story itself is simple in concept, the execution is what makes the movie stand out. There is more emphasis on dialogue than action, but the banter and conversations with the characters are not only humorous, but make them all delightful and memorable in their own right. There's a reason many of the movie's lines are still quoted to this day, not only because they're well delivered, but also because of the multitude of lovable personalities and character arches.In terms of the individuals, Westley is the courageous and charismatic poor farm boy turned pirate who shows more amounts of stealth than one might assume, Inigo Montoya is as sympathetic as his backstory which drove him to vengeance despite caring immensely for those around him, and Fezzik the giant is the oafish albeit kind spirited brute with a heart of gold. Each character has their moment to shine and their interactions with pretty much everyone make them a riot to watch, so it's pretty easy to get caught up in their arches. Even though Buttercup doesn't have much personality herself, the torment she goes through between Westley and the repugnant albeit cowardly Humperdinck does make one passionate feel for her and to see her obtain true love once again. The rest are either antagonistic albeit cynically amusing such as Count Rugen and Vizzini, or just straight up hysterical like Miracle Max and the grandfather.Needless to say, I still think The Princess Bride stands as one of the most delightfully amusing and enchanting rom com fantasies ever created with enough tongue-in-cheek humor, lovable characters and sweet passion to draw anybody in. Similar to the boy whom the grandfather tells the story to, it may seem cheesy and schmaltzy at first, but sticking with it long enough will make you forget you're even listening to a story, it's just that entertaining. So, if you're still yet to see this flick, either read the book or pick a dvd/bluray copy up at your local store or website and give it a watch. There may be a chance that you'll reconsider calling fantasy books simply 'childish'.",9,1,1,3 June 2018
It Follows," I'm Sorry, But This Movie is Stupid
","You sometimes come across a horror movie that is so ridiculous by concept that one wonders why it was even made in the first place. It Follows is one of them. While I kind of get the critical acclaim and cult status behind the film, it left me so befuddled from its execution that I ended up laughing at it more than feeling genuinely scared. The general storyline revolves around a teenage girl named Jay, who is constantly chased around by a supernatural spirit after having sexual intercourse. I can see where the premise could've worked, but having a curse brought up from mating makes the film come off as more stupid than creepy. Maybe if it were a blood oath that started it, I'd be more intrigued, but that ain't what we got. In addition, the pacing is rather monotonous, as we spend roughly half the movie on Jay and her friends running away, while also trying to stop the creature. I think half of that time should've been spent on learning about the mythos of the curse itself.Where the story is too bizarre for a horror film, the characters range from bland, to annoying to even dumb. The actors are certainly trying their best, but we don't know much about Jay's friends outside of them having feelings for her and one or two quirks. Even Jay herself becomes so anxious about where the entity comes from that....well, let's just say she makes too many stupid decisions for her own good. BTW, when I say some of Jay's friends have feelings towards her, I ain't kidding. Without giving anything away, given that the curse comes from an STD, Jay at the very least feels bad for what she has to do to save herself, so I'll give credit and say that there is some genuine sympathy in her.Another annoying factoid of the film is the soundtrack. I understand that it's supposed to make the audience feel as tense as Jay, and sometimes it pays off well. However, there are several moments where music is unneeded, and silence would've been more than enough. Also, some moments play scores that are way too loud and over the top, making the scenes feel too pretentious for their own good. Lastly, probably the film's worst offender is that it doesn't really end, it just sort of stops. I'm not saying all stories need to end off on a bang, but it was nonetheless very anticlimactic. Maybe it's a setup for a sequel, but it's still frustrating nonetheless.Overall, It Follows had the makings of a decent horror flick, but its ludicrous concept makes it too laughable to be taken seriously, and the characters don't offer much in terms of substance. If you're into original films that at least offer intriguing ideas that stand out from the typical horror fare, then by all means check this out. However, if you can't take the concept with sincerity, then don't even bother. I do respect the filmmakers behind this for bringing their unique visions to life, but just because something is unique doesn't mean it'll work out in the end.",3,1,3,31 August 2018
The Little Mermaid," The Disney Movie that Remains Part of Our World
","30 years ago, the Walt Disney Company released their feature-film adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Little Mermaid. Made at a time when the animation studio was in a huge rut, this along with Roger Rabbit and the boost of morale brought them back to their glory days with a whole decade known as their Renaissance era. To this day, it remains one of their most recognizable commodities, spawning a TV series, a sequel, a prequel and even a live-action remake currently in development. But one question remains...does it still hold any water now?The story follows a young mermaid named Ariel, who wants to become part of the human world after falling in love with a prince named Eric, but learns the tough challenges of steering away from her own undersea life. While this story sounds weak on paper, the execution more than makes up for it. Due to the film being told in the style of a Broadway musical, its emotional core feels incredibly strong and personal with its characters. The musical numbers by the great Howard Ashman and Alan Menken come in all shapes and sizes, from Part of Your World telling us everything we need to know about Ariel's inner desires, to Under the Sea providing us with enough proof as to why the grass is always greener on one side, to Poor Unfortunate Souls being a cautionary reminder of the consequences to your actions, and Kiss the Girl being a harmonious love song on getting with your partner. These songs, along with the wonderful performances from Jodi Benson, Samuel E. Wright and Pat Carroll, help give the story an identity that no Disney film prior had in years: musical narrative.In addition, this film is a tour de force of luscious animation and sound design. The characters have the usual Disney style but with a more cartoony flair that utilizes a good amount of squash and stretch. The special effects are a nice touch too, with a lot of magic, water, electricity, fire and even smoke practically popping out of the screen with striking detail and horrific imagery (helps too that airbrushes, CGI and superimposing were used to great effect). The backgrounds as well display the necessary depth needed for a film set both under water and on the land, with only a few locations needed to make the story feel contained without going all over the place. As for the sound work, this had at the time way more sound effects than any other Disney film, and it shows considering all the mixing and editing needing to be done. Of course there are quiet moments, but the scenes with a lot of suspense feel all the more thrilling with the overwhelming noise flooding (no pun intended) the screens. It's almost as if the film wouldn't have sounded quite as epic without the foley work.But now it's time to comment on what people to this day criticize the film for: its moral. Many have argued that Ariel gets what she wants at the end without learning much of anything and just runs of with a man she barely knows. While I do find those critiques valid in their own right, the one thing many of us have forgot about is that the point of the film is to let your children grow up in their own way. King Triton wants what's best for his daughter without truly understanding, which in turn led Ariel to do whatever it took to be on the land she wanted to explore from the beginning. This resulted in her having to form a connection with Eric voiceless, and even when the tables turned against her, Eric still selflessly fought back against the villainous Ursula to be with the one who he felt was made for her. And that's the key element to remember: the one made for you. Ariel still could have become a human through magic just to be on the surface, but it was the man she fell in love with that gave her journey a true purpose, and from then on, her real story had only just begun.With highly memorable songs, magical animation and a message on finding your purpose that anyone can relate to, Disney's The Little Mermaid holds up just as well as its big splash in 1989. There are many films that changed cinema forever, and this was one of them for putting the House of Mouse back in the spotlight that they've kept since then. Even if it's not their real crowning achievement in filmmaking and storytelling, it set the bar that most of their movies since then would keep trying to get up to for over three decades, and we have the magic of Broadway and emotional resonance to thank for that.",8,2,2,17 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Modern Fairy Tale Tribute to Classic Hollywood's Departure
","Over the years, we've had numerous tributes to Hollywood's Golden age, but never to the extent of that era's tail end. Well, for his ninth film no less, Quentin Tarantino did just that, with an ensemble cast and his trademark love to his generation's culture. Taking place in 1969 during the rise of the hippie cult movement and the rapid changes the film industry went through, the film chronicles multiple storylines involving a fictional aging television actor named Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double/longtime friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as they experience all the changes going on in Hollywood, including that of a gripping cult spread around the place, as well as actress/model Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).What the film succeeds at the most in paying tribute to Hollywood during the late 60s is the look and aesthetic, down to the settings, landscapes and even how the movies and TV shows were shot back then. Many of the scenes displaying the shows and movies Rick Dalton and other actors appear in look and sound exactly like how they did back in the 60s, and given that the movie was shot on traditional film, it only adds in to the charming graininess and flair to it all. In addition, the performances are very strong, from Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt practically embodying their characters, and their chemistry with each other really feels like something of a natural bond between friends. The remaining cast range from eccentric and fascinating characters in their own right, such as Margaret Qualley, Julia Butters, Al Pacino and Kurt Russell, to spot on impersonations of real people, like Mike Joh as Bruce Lee, Timothy Olyphant as James Stacey, Emile Hirsch as Jay Sebring and Bruce Dern as George Spahn. The only actor who didn't seem to leave much of an impression was Margot Robbie, as her character was never given much material to truly shine, especially given that she was an Oscar nominated actress.Now with all that said, its time we talked about the actual cult hidden in the film, and that is the one and only Manson family. They are introduced when Cliff Booth drops off one of their members at their ranch, and the scene in particular just builds up the creepy factor with suspenseful albeit quiet tension and chilling atmosphere. Some of the members do show up towards the third act, and that's when all hell breaks lose. What's funny is that Tarantino announced this film as his own take on the Manson family murders, so the fact that he mixed it within a tale of actors coming to grips with Hollywood is shocking to say the least. I personally think they could have spent a little more time developing the Manson family arch as opposed to Rick Dalton's dangling career, because Sharon Tate was who they ended up murdering in real life, and Tate barely has enough screen time to serve much of a purpose to the feature anyway. Without giving away the climax, the film kind of pulls a historical 180 on the murderers themselves, meaning that there weren't many consequences to Tate as a character. But to its credit, the film still highlighted how ruthlessly sick the family was, so it gets some credibility for rewriting history in its own weird way.In terms of any other negatives though, the film is really slow in its pacing. Granted, for this film it kind of works due to the relatively serious subject matter of Hollywood actors working around the industry's standards, but there are times when it just meanders without going anywhere. In addition, one scene featuring Rick Dalton acting in one of his roles didn't commit to the style of 1960s tv quality, making it feel like a missed opportunity that looked confusing more than anything else. Also, for die hard Tarantino fans, you may be disappointed to find that his unique dialogue isn't as strong as the likes of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, not that the dialogue in this film was bad, but it seemed to lack a bit of that punch to make it worth remembering amongst other flicks he's made. On a more positive note though, being a Tarantino film, the choices of soundtrack fit the time period appropriately without ever feeling out of place, and they help elevate the tone well enough to make people feel nostalgic for the time period. Lastly, while I won't talk about the actual ending, it seemed to feel too fast paced compared to the film's generally patient flow, and the actual resolution, although satisfying, may have come at the expense of sacrificing the character's down to earth nature.So even though this is somewhat of a departure from the usual stuff we expect from Tarantino such as more upbeat pacing and liveliness and his punchy dialogue, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood still works as a glorifying tribute to the departure of American Cinema's golden age and a reminder of how messed up the Mansons truly were. Maybe it will turn off exuberant Tarantino fanatics, but for those who enjoy uniquely crafted narratives centered around a classic time period worth remembering, I think you'll be satisfied enough. And besides, this makes the 50th anniversary of 1969 and the Manson family murders that took place during said year, so it might stand the test of time after all.",8,15,23,5 August 2019
Hellboy," An Entertaining Comic Book Adaptation Worth your Time
","In the early to mid 90s, comic artist Mike Mignola created the character Hellboy for Dark Horse comics, and the series became a favorite amongst the comic community, mainly for its dark atmosphere, gritty design and sardonic humor. Fast forward roughly 10 years later, when the director of Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro, helmed a film adaptation. Despite it being more of his own interpretation of the series than Mignola's, it went on to become a cult favorite. But does this film truly stand as a worthy adaptation, or is the upcoming reboot more of a blessing in disguise?The plot itself is rather simple and straight forward, as it centers around a devilish creature named Hellboy, an agent in the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, where he, the psychic merman Abe Sapien, and the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman protect America against dark forces. However, these beings called the Sammael are resurrected by Nazis in an attempt to not only open a portal to a paranormal dimension, but to also summon Hellboy in his true form. Simple enough, and most of the first half of the movie does sort of drag on at points with Hellboy trying to stop the Sammael creatures. That being said, what does keep the film going is the entertainment value, the relation between Hellboy and Liz, as well as his father, and the mythos behind the nazis plan.In a way, the film is very much like a graphic novel turned into a movie, and the grim atmosphere aided by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and the production design by Stephen Scott bring out a very spooky presence to an already unsettling and suspenseful feature. Not to mention, the action scenes are very well choreographed and it shows how much hard work the stunt team put into the film (although sometimes they can be hard to make out due to the dark shadows). In addition, the makeup for Hellboy provided by the phenomenal Rick Baker is so fantastic that it's hard to only see Ron Perlman playing the character. Admittedly, the computer animation of the Sammaels and other things does look dated, although that mainly comes from the moderate budget the film had to work with, but they still look cool nonetheless.The characters themselves are more of a mix; some are worth rooting for, while others feel somewhat shallow and underdeveloped. Hellboy is the tough and sarcastic albeit subtly emotional demon who knows how to pack a punch but also has more layers underneath him based on his origins, Liz is the emotionless fire starter who has to keep her powers from getting unleashed after a traumatic past, and Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy's adoptive father, is the most knowledgable head of the BPRD who carries a strong emotional bond with his adoptive son. Abe Sapien also has strong knowledge through being psychic, aided by a wonderful physical performance by Doug Jones. These are the characters that keep the viewer intrigued enough to follow their mission, especially to take down the notorious Rasputin who will not stop in any way to fulfill his plans of world domination.However, the characters that don't stick out as much are just sort of two dimensional. John Myers is the somewhat neurotic FBI agent who tries to help out when needed, but he isn't developed enough to really warrant much stakes when he's in danger, but at least he gets brave by the third act. Tom Manning is the stuff-shirted bureaucrat who tries so stubbornly hard to do things his way over anything paranormal that he gets too annoying and selfish for his own good. Also, many of the antagonists like Kroenen and Haupstein are the typical power hungry nazis who will stand in nobody's way to get what they want. To put in bluntly, the film has its share of underdeveloped and inflexible characters as much as it has its share of highly determined, charismatic, and emotive characters.Overall, while it may not pick up much until the second half and some characters are more interesting than others, Hellboy packs enough raw action and stakes, mythos of the titular character, well detailed set pieces and makeup, and even some occasional snarky humor. I think fans of the comics will get a big kick out of the film, even if it does kind of stray away from the source material, as it represents the iconic rough and sardonic agent they've come to know and love. Heck, even if you haven't read the comics, this film will be a welcome introduction to newcomers who want to get sucked into something exciting and macabre. While I'm not sure how the reboot will play out, we still have this entertaining thrill ride to get sucked into.",8,2,2,7 April 2018
The Incredibles," One of My Favorite Superhero Movies
","After nearly fifteen years, this movie is still one of Pixar's most outstanding works (in my opinion at least). With numerous superhero films coming out in the 21st century, The Incredibles has stood as one of the most unique superhero movies in history, mainly for how it focuses on a family of superheroes (a real family btw, not a figurative one like Fantastic Four). I personally can't even count the amount of times I've watched this movie I love it so much, but let's see why.Set in a world where superheroes have been outlawed, former supers Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr) and Elastigirl (Helen Parr) have kept their powers and lives hidden away in suburbia for roughly fifteen years while raising their children, Violet, Dash and Jack Jack who also have super powers. One day, Mr. Incredible gets a call to an island to fight a giant robot, only to discover that it was all a trap planned by Syndrome (formerly Mr. Incredible's biggest fan Buddy Pine) in order to kill Mr. Incredible and all the supers with his killer robot and intelligence. With the help of his family, Mr. Incredible must now stop Syndrome from fulfilling his plans of world domination. Right off the bat, arguably the best aspect of the entire movie is the relationship between Bob and Helen, as we really see just how living away from public consciousness for so many years has put a toll on them. While Helen tries to adapt, Bob simply can't and wishes he could showcase his true potential once again. As someone who wishes to showcase his true talent to the world one day, I can relate to feeling neglected by society's conformist outlook that celebrates mediocrity. Not to mention, the opening scenes which transition from Bob and Helen playfully flirting to them getting married really does highlight their affectionate bond for one another, which makes their future relation all the more devastating and mature when all hell breaks lose. Given that each member of the Parr family has realistic flaws, like Dash also wanting to let his potential of running kick in, to Violet mostly being a social outcast before having to face the world, there are as many grievances in the family as there is tenderness, which really does make the Parr family one incredible family.However, another notable accomplishment in the film's own right is the villain Syndrome. Originally an obsessive fan of Mr. Incredible who turned to the dark side once he discovered just how little your idols might actually care for their true believers, Syndrome just might be one of the most ruthless and down right sadistic villains in animation. Ignoring the fact that he wiped out nearly all the superheroes to pretend to be one so people could worship him, the fact that he loathes Mr. Incredible enough to not only want him dead, but that he shows no remorse for what he has done is truly heart wrenching. He does have the occasional fanboy moment (that famous 'Got Busy' line still cracks me up), but his callous motivation shows just how much he could care less for anyone, even his own assistant Mirage. Considering we live in an age where die hard fans will go ballistic if their idols do something even slightly off-putting, Syndrome is a brilliant representation of just how blind people can be in their sickening schemes.This was Pixar's first film to feature an entire human cast, and the way the animators at Pixar pulled them off is truly remarkable. Along with smooth and accurate movements, the characters look like they were designed for traditional animation rather than 3D (makes sense since the director Brad Bird is a CalArts Graduate). Not to mention, the effects animation like water, fire, ice, electricity and explosions, the backgrounds such as the modern looking houses and buildings and the volcanic island Nominisan, and the robot itself known as the Omnidroid are truly stunning to look at, as even the slightest details are worth praising. The actions scenes are also well choreographed, and it's fun to see how creative the animators got in pulling off ways for the Incredibles to use their powers when needed. CG animation back then was still not quite up to snuff as it is today, making the visuals all the more astonishing while also proving just how many tiresome work hours were spent on crafting and rendering the film. Also, the music score by Michael Giacchino is a delightful and snappy mix of intense 60s style action music and suspenseful dramatic scores, depending on the scene, and it's no wonder Giacchino is still a highly respected film composer today.Admittedly, the movie does have a few issues, but none that truly detract from the overall quality. For one, the first half of the film spends a little too much time on Mr. Incredible, and then the second half focuses on his family as much as him. While not jarring, it does feel like the film should have spent at least some more time on Dash and Violet to make them a little more memorable. Also, Syndrome's assistant Mirage is responsible for luring Mr. Incredible to the island so he can get killed (let alone the other superheroes), and while she does have a change of heart later on, we never see her again, making her arch feel unfinished (BTW, don't use the comics as an excuse for her appearing later on because that's an adaptation, not the original source). I just think she got off a little too easy, and even though she does help out the main heroes, she still leaves some questions about her past and her presence after the film unresolved. Nonetheless, The Incredibles still holds up as a well written, fantastically animated, and action-packed superhero movie that puts a unique twist on the genre with a family trying to get back in the swing and a menacing albeit hysterical villain. With a sequel coming in the next two months, it only shows just how passionate Brad Bird was about this film, and it will forever be remembered for years as one of my favorite superhero films of all time.",9,0,0,30 March 2018
The Elephant Man," A Disabled Being with Humble Value
","When it comes to biopics on the disabled, they can more often than not be used to display sympathetic narratives to make one feel guilty for their subject at hand. Sometimes they can be overly sentimental, but in the case of The Elephant Man, it's more than just that. This film is not only sincere in how it tackles its subject's life of prejudice and deformity, but also in terms of how any act of good will can overcome the harshest obstacles in life.The film follows the tale of John Merrick, a 19th century English man who was struck with a severe body deformity at birth, thus living as a circus freak and being bombarded with cruelty from people. Soon, a medic named Frederick Treves rescues John from his inhumane conditions to make him more accustomed to a better life, in spite of other people's prejudice. What makes John Merrick such a charming character is that underneath his rotten outer shell is a benevolent intellect who only wishes to share the same amount of respect as any other being on Earth. In addition, Anthony Hopkins effecting presents Treves as cautious in regards to whether or not he is really helping out Merrick or not and John Hurt does a phenomenal job emoting through the deformed face in order to believably present his character as tortured yet delighted by his fascinations in life, no matter how small they may be.As this film was directed by the abstract horror legend David Lynch, the film looks appropriately gloomy and dry given the classic Victorian environment. The choice to shoot the movie in black & white not only makes Christopher Tucker's frightening makeup look remarkably appealing, but it also recreates an almost German expressionist approach with subtle grays and cast shadows, though with less bluntness in the more calm moments. Some sequences are also told strictly through the visuals and sound design, and they manage to communicate the purpose and effectiveness in the narrative without coming off as distorted. Also, despite being more well known for his collaborations with Mel Brooks, composer John Morris lets his broken lullaby score practically paints the insecurities of the unfortunately morbid victim who has no real desire in life other than living as a human being, not as an animal.To some, The Elephant Man is a depressing cautionary tale about how hard it is for humans to accept others. To others though, it is a harmonious and inspiring story of a remarkable individual whose one wish is to live among the people normally. It's the heartfelt tenderness from those who care that can really make a difference to those of unfortunate circumstances, making this film a timeless venture through tragedy and emotional resonance.",8,1,1,25 January 2020
Amadeus," A Biopic Unlike Any Other
","If you were to ask me what are my favorite biopics on well known musicians or composers, one immediate answer would be Amadeus. Based on the play of the same name by Peter Shaffer (who also wrote the film's screenplay), this film won multiple oscars in 1985, one of which being best picture. But what exactly makes this film so special to not only me, but to so many film buffs and critics alike? Well, given that the film is a fictionalized depiction of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it doesn't actually focus on his whole life. Instead, the central focus is told from a lesser known composer who knew the lad, Antonio Salieri.The main storyline revolves around Salieri loving Mozart's incredible work but resenting the man's obscene and repugnant behavior. Due to not being as good as Wolfgang, Salieri becomes jealous to the point of taking vengeance on the young composer. What makes Salieri so intriguing as a lead is how spiritual he is, as he fell in love with music after getting close to the lord. So upon seeing that the lord bestowed such miraculous talents to a raunchy individual, his bitter perspective of Amadeus makes for great rivalry. However, the film also showcases Mozart's own struggles regarding his personal life with a concerned wife and father and getting his visions out with the emperor's approval. This contrast proves how even though Salieri wishes he was in Mozart's shoes, it wouldn't do him any good since the rival's life was no better than his.Then there's the actors, who really help convey the right emotions and charisma to each given character. F. Murray Abraham represents Salieri as a very down to earth and respectful admirer of music, but he also captures his stubborn animosity towards Mozart through subtle emoting and expressions. Tom Hulce clearly had a lot of fun playing Amadeus whenever he would act goofy and immature, but he's also able to sell the character's inner worries and passion in a very relatable way. Elizabeth Berridge is able to bring a good mix of heart and pathos to Mozart's wife Constanze, which again, proves how Mozart's life was not as grand as Salieri thought. The other actors are either appropriately subdued or lively in their own regard, but the main actors are the glue that resonate with viewers the most.While the film may not be completely accurate to the real story of Mozart, it is highly detailed in terms of getting the 18th century time period down. The costumes by Theodor Pistek look very fashionable for their day, and one can tell how much creativity was put into them. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography recreates the film to resemble the aforementioned century, from the color scheme to the establishing sets and shots. It's almost as if we're viewing what that century looked like back then. In fact, some of the operas performed in the film were even shot on location at the original Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague. Not to mention, musical professors and scholars have said that not one note in this film is misplayed, so this flick might be the right choice for a music class.Needless to say, Amadeus is not only well crafted in nearly every way, but it also succeeds in telling us how stubborn some people are. No matter how much you envy someone whose better than you, that should never be a reason to let it consume your well being. Sometimes, you just have to accept the fact that you might not be as accomplished in your passion as someone else, and then you can move on with your life smoothly and rationally. So if you haven't seen this flick yet, definitely give it a watch any time. Remember, it's not called Amadeus because it focuses specifically on Mozart. It's called Amadeus because it focuses on another composer's view on Mozart; think about that.",9,0,0,10 January 2019
Coco," Beautiful Mexican Story about Family
","People complain that Pixar has stuck making sequels for the rest of the decade, but to those still upset about that, check out this delightful motion picture on the holiday of Dia de los Muertos, Coco. Is it the companies' latest crowning achievement? No, but it's still a solid flick worth watching with beautiful music, charming characters, gorgeous animation and a well rounded message about family.The way the movie establishes the heart of Mexican music is brilliant, and directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina drive Mexican iconography and music to new heights. The small town our main hero Miguel and the Rivera family resides in feels genuine, complete with several possible in-jokes and cultural nods Mexican natives may find amusing. As for the Rivera family, their history is set up well as the story's central conflict. This is what makes the main protagonist Miguel worth rooting for as we understand his dreams in spite of what his family thinks and wish for him to succeed.On top of that, the animation is the usual Pixar glory, as it looks vibrant, bright, and crystal clear. Alongside the familiar Pixar character designs, the Land of the Dead that Miguel ends up in contains so much detail and whimsy that even the smallest details are worth praising. And then there are the musical numbers, which range from upbeat to downright heart wrenching. Not only do the songs give the characters a chance to shine, along with some neat choreography, but most if not all of them serve the stories' main theme of never forgetting those you once loved. The best contributor is Remember Me, which I hope is at least nominated for an Oscar.As for the other characters, the best out of all of them is the skeleton Hector who accompanies Miguel on his journey. While the team up trope has been done in Pixar many times, the filmmakers add some more layers to the skeleton than his bones. Not to mention, the way he walks and moves is nothing short of accurate and cute with how his bones jangle. Most of the other characters aren't worth talking about, as they can range from obstacles for Miguel to just background characters.In terms of negatives, Coco does follow a rather predictable storyline and it's not hard to figure out what might happen, but on the other hand the film does add some unique elements here and there to keep the audience invested. To quote Stefan Ellison of the Scene Magaizine, 'The climax also seems to create multiple conclusions, stretching it out with one obvious trick after another.' Also, there is a Deus ex Machina in this film...then again, any movie has that, so why am I surprised?Overall, while it has its predictable story tropes, Coco is still a well done entry into Pixar's catalogue with its lavish animation, breathtaking songs, fun characters, and great message about family. Even if you have your fair share of family members you don't like, you shouldn't forget them entirely because there's a good chance they may have shaped your life for the better. Remember that, and enjoy this movie for its musical wonder and sense of adventure with that message mixed in.",8,2,12,26 November 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Sorry, but This Hasn't Aged Well
","Back in 2009 when Sony Pictures Animation released their animated film adaptation of the children's book of the same name, I loved it at the age of ten. Watching in recently however, I find it pretty mediocre. That's not to say I hate it or anything, this is just a case of a form of media from childhood that didn't really age well...for me at least.In terms of what works, the real highlight of the film is the animation on the food, from the quantity, to the size, to especially the colors. I always found food to look a million times better in animation than in real life, and this movie is no exception. Not to mention, the animators found a lot of creative methods to build the food as either houses or amusement rides. Adding on to that, some of the jokes are pretty funny, although others are rather juvenile. The fathers Earl and Tim are the most likable and charming characters in the whole film, especially since they want what's best for their children in spite of their oddball antics. Lastly, I admire the different inventions the filmmakers created that definitely fit with the movie's imaginative touch. Unfortunately, what doesn't work is the story, as it comes off as too cliche and predictable for it's own good using the same old underdog story we've seen before. I was able to predict everything that was going to happen, and the main character Flint Lockwood is way too dorky and obnoxious for his own good. The rest of the cast are either forgettable, annoying, just there to get a laugh, or are just pointless entirely (although Sam Sparks is enjoyably quirky in her own right). Also, I get that they wanted to make the characters cartoony to fit with the movie's oddball nature, but their designs are so simplistic and so over the top that it looks both ridiculous and awkward, and the animators were trying way too hard with the wackiness. Not to mention, while the subplot with Flint's father-son relation is heartwarming enough, it feels overshadowed by juvenile humor, pointless moments with Flint and other residents, and I was left much to be desired. Once again, I don't hate this movie by any means, I just don't like it as much as I used to. While I admire the food visuals, the occasional likable and silly character, some of the jokes, and message to never give up on your dreams, the predictable story, majority pos obnoxious characters, and annoying character animation keep me from enjoying it all the way through. If you love the book more than you're better off with that, but if you do have a soft spot for this movie than definitely have fun with it. You'll certainly gain a bigger appetite that I did.",5,1,3,9 January 2018
The Nightmare Before Christmas," An Entertaining Tribute to Two Distinct Holidays
","I don't think I need to describe this film, since everyone knows that this was the brain child of Tim Burton while he was working at Disney. Sure, Henry Selick ended up directing it and not Burton himself due to his busy schedule, but there's a reason everyone calls it a Burtonesque masterpiece. Only someone as strange as him could've thought up an idea for a film where both Halloween and Christmas come together to tell a story. Now with all of that said, I totally get why people love this movie, but I personally deem it as just enjoyable more than anything else.Right off the bat, the animation really makes this movie come to life. The numerous creatures of Halloween Town look like they came right out of the mind of an imaginative soul obsessed with the macabre, and they translate very well to stop-motion. In addition, the character animation is quite fluent and lively, as each distinct spook acts differently from one another depending on their physical appearance. The contrasting sets consisting of the creepy and dark looking Halloween Town and the bright and colorful Christmas Town also deserves much praise for the usage of strong lighting and cinematography. Also, the moments of composited hand-drawn animated ghouls add a variety of styles to the film without going overboard.That being said though, as beautiful as the film looks, the story itself is not as strong. The film centers around the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, who wants something new besides celebrating Halloween. Once he discovers Christmas, he wants to embrace the holiday but then ends up realizing the grass is always greener on the other side. This kind of story is really weak in concept, and the plot itself is rather practicable. However, the execution is what elevates the feature, as it's told through musical numbers and just exploring the fantasies of each holiday. The film manages to blend holiday cheer and grim humor together to build off the conflicting views of the two dreamlike lands through creative visual artistry and gags.As for the characters themselves, Jack is well meaning in his desire for something new, but his ambitions make him too naive for his own good. It's funny how Disney tells us that we can do whatever we dream when this film's moral proves that isn't always the case. Sally works well as the film's pure voice of reason by desiring excitement while being concerned for Jack's well being. The other characters range from demanding yet too self obsessed like Dr. Finklestein and the Mayor, to malicious and annoying like Lock, Shock and Barrel, to bland yet wise like Santa Claus. The only other memorable character in the film has to be Oogie Boogie, mainly due to his delightfully charismatic performance reminiscent to that of a Cab Calloway performance in a Betty Book cartoon, although his motives don't seem to be fully touched upon.Lastly, the songs by Danny Elfman work as both storytelling devices and entertaining melodies on their own. Some set the mood of the individual fantasy world like This Is Halloween or What's This, while others establish the characters and their inner feelings like Jack's Lament, Sally's Song and Poor Jack (yeah, the titles suck, but what can you do?). But without a doubt, the song that steals the show is Oogie Boogie's Song, as it displays the coolest and most creative visuals in the entire film whilst being highly entertaining and camp in its own regard. No matter how you feel about any of the songs, nothing else could have elevated the paper thin story as much as them, for they add all the necessary momentum and entertainment value needed for a film like this.So overall, while I wouldn't put The Nightmare Before Christmas on as high of a pedestal as others would, I still find it to be an entertaining experience to watch during two different times of the year. Even if the story is relatively simple and the characters are hit or miss, the originality expressed through the visuals, comedy, music and mix of the aforementioned holidays makes the whole feature worth a watch. I hope whoever loves this film has the time of their life rewatching it again during this month...or in the next two months, give or take. As for me, while I have seen better animated films in the horror fantasy genre, this still reflects the fun side of Halloween and Christmas like never before.",7,0,0,20 October 2018
Big Hero 6," Delightful Adaptation of an Obscure Comic
","In 2014, Disney released their 54th animated feature Big Hero 6, a film adaptation of a relatively unpopular comic book series by the same name. Alongside being critically acclaimed, scoring big at the box office, and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, what people took away from the film was how Disney did something different, adapting a superhero comic into an animated feature. I myself loved this film back when it came out and even called it one of Disney's best....now I personally just find it good but a little overrated.As usual for Disney, the animation is simply breathtaking. The film is set in the fictional city San Fransokyo, a blend of San Francisco and Tokyo, and the very design of it just spills imaginative. I'm sure anyone obsessed with modern Japanese art and central Californian life will go nuts over the amount of details and buildings created for the somewhat futuristic city. Along with a city that could only be made for a comic, the characters themselves look like they were made for a comic too given their stylized and exaggerated designs. However, the true highlight of the animation are the multiple representations of robots, technology and special effects, and the animators certainly let their creative juices go to great use in crafting the multiple mechanics and graphics used for the film.That being said, the story itself is nothing all that special. It centers on robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada, who lost his brother, Tadashi, only leaving behind Tadashi's robot made with the sole purpose to aid people in need. After some shocking events catch on, Hiro transforms Baymax and his other friends, Go Go Tamago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred into a band of high-tech heroes. It's not hard to figure out the outcome, and most of the characters aren't all that memorable. Gogo is the tough athletic girl who's into speed, Honey Lemon is the bubbly chemist, Wasabi is the wise albeit neurotic laser enthusiast, and Fred is every stoner comic relief in the book....but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find him funny. Also, without giving much away, the reveal of the main villain is pretty obvious, although his motivations are built on vengeance from a horrible tragedy, so at least he has a decent reason for wreaking havoc.However, I will say that the relationship between Hero and Baymax is the most heartwarming aspect of the entire feature. Considering that Baymax is built to help people, it makes sense that he would help Hiro in need. Even when Hiro wants him to fight back, deep down inside Baymax knows that murder will never bring Hiro's former sibling back. It truly is touching to see the only remains of Tadashi left simply want to make Hiro move on from a horrible tragedy, as I'm sure anybody dealing with the loss of somebody could relate. Not to mention, Baymax is absolutely adorable, from his squishy design, to his subtle robot movements, to even his caring charm that would make one wish to be his patient.So in conclusion, while I don't think Big Hero 6 is quite as good as most people have made it out to be, I still deem it an entertaining and at times emotional superhero movie that's fun for the whole family. Even with a predictable plot and some two dimensional characters, there's enough fun action, humor, heart and eye popping animation that make it worth a view. Since Disney bought Marvel in 2012, people have been wondering if this film will get an installment in the MCU...well, here's their chance to do so. With a potential TV series soon to have more episodes (it's just being delayed, it hasn't been cancelled) and a rumored sequel, there's always potential for further development of this world and its characters in the future.",7,1,1,25 March 2018
Grave of the Fireflies," Tragic in Tone Yet Poetic in Substance
","Whenever people talk about some of the most tragic anti war films out there, this film in particular comes to mind a lot, and for good reason. Being one of Studio Ghibli's first features, this film was released at the wrong time as a double feature with My Neighbor Totoro (quite the mood whiplash, I know). However, while it might not have won audiences over then due to the heavy subject matter, it did go on to be seen as a landmark in both Japanese cinema and filmmaking all together. I must admit, while I myself do find this film to be as horrifically sad as others, there's no denying that it's also told through beauty and grace at the same time.Set in Japan during the near end of WWII, the film centers on two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, and their struggle to survive on their own. What's interesting to note is that it's revealed in the very beginning that the kids have already died (as shown in red), and while that might come off as anticlimactic to some, I think it works in favor of the film's plot. Throughout the film, we see the kids desperately trying to live off little food and shelter outside of the common lands, and there is no attempt to shy away from the brutalities and consequences that could happen from that. So seeing the more tranquil points of view from the characters in the afterlife reflecting upon their tragic past helps convey that the suffering they went through is long gone, and they have made peace together. At its core, the story of Grave is emotionally tied in to its ending. Even though we know they have died, what they go through is so grim that you can only hope they'll turn out fine.As this is an anti war film, there is a raw honesty displayed throughout the feature. Rather than glorifying any of the violence, its anti-war message is conveyed through subtlety and even the more gory moments are played out shortly. For a film about what the tragedies of war can do to people, Fireflies is much more poetic in tone than brutal. A good example of the contrast between shear beauty and graphic horror is when Seita and Setsuko are in the more urban settings, which showcase pleasant backdrops whilst displaying plenty of subtly upbeat moments. Then, once Seita and Setsuko are residing in the more rural nature areas of the country, the real horror of living in such treacherous environments show just how poorly they messed up. Grave may not be all about violence, but it sure knows how to portray the turmoils of running away from home.As for the characters themselves, Seita is rather stuck up with his smug and rebellious attitude towards the war, but even he doesn't know what he's entirely doing, making his actions come off as naive. However, he still shows off compassion towards Setsuko, even when he makes horrible mistakes such as running away from his aunt. Speaking of Setsuko, she is one of the most emotional four year olds in film history, as while she can be a handful to take care of, she doesn't know any better and many of the circumstances that happen to her and Seita are poignantly displayed. No matter how hard Seita tries to watch over her, there's always an uncomfortable feel to how his doings affect her for the worse. Then there's the aunt, who may seem rather snobby towards the two, but she has a very fair point in how Seita should be doing better to do his part for the war. With everything that happens to Seita and Setsuko, one only wishes they would take her advice, but alas.In addition to how beautiful the film is story wise, the animation is absolutely marvelous. The characters have a more pseudo realistic approach to their designs, along with having relatively accurate movements and features. Also, most of their outlines happen to be brown instead of traditional black, which was done to give a softer aesthetic to the feature according to color coordinator Michiyo Yasuda. I think that fits given how dark albeit poetic the film is by nature, so having a more subdued line quality creates a slicker contrast. Not to mention, the effects animation is wonderful, whether it'd be the appropriately treacherous fire and smoke coming from attacker planes or the melodious fireflies buzzing around. Along with the color scheme that can change depending on the mood of the scene (especially during the nighttime), these effects give the right amount of depth needed for an emotional rollercoaster like this.Needless to say, Grave of the Fireflies is a beautifully tragic film that highlights what can happen to those who try to survive on their own during the war without shoving its message down the audience's throat. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely feel free to do so. It may be hard to sit through, but it will definitely give you an intriguing point of view on the innocence of childhood gone wrong. It's so rare that we see the medium of animation tackle subjects like this, because it proves how you can tell a story of this caliber through an art form that requires all the imagination in the world. So the next time you want to see a war film that really challenges your perception on war and survival, this one will have you covered.",8,1,1,13 December 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Very Unique and Surreal Take on the Rom-Com Genre
","Out of all the films made by beloved experimental French filmmaker Michel Gondry, none have ever gotten as much acclaim and recognition as this film. As this was a collaboration with modern screenwriting legend Charlie Kaufman, it has been regarded as one of the most original, touching, and downright unique movies of the 21st century. It is a film that explores both the mind and heart in a much deeper and thought provoking manner than most other films out there. 'How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned.' - Alexander Pope. This is the quote that the film stands by the most, and for good reason.The plot revolves around two former lovers named Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) who erase each other from their memories, but begin dating again soon afterwards. What really sells the film are these two main leads, even though they have different personalities. Joel is basically a nowhere man; he has no clue where he's going to but has trouble breaking out of his niche. In contrast, Clementine is much more free spirited, as she often does what she wants over what others say. When Joel tries to erase his memories of Clementine, he realizes that he'd rather have a relationship with flaws than no memory of her at all. Eternal Sunshine is mainly about the struggle to search for hidden feelings, and Joel's struggle to maintain them is enough to make one cry.In addition to great leads, the acting is simply marvelous. Jim Carrey proves here how he can act outside of his usual screwball antics, as he manages to create a sympathetic and earnest portrayal of an isolated man. Kate Winslet displays Clementine as an attention seeking wild one while also showing how lonely she truly is as well. Thanks to their believable performances, it's understandable to see why these two broke up yet still loved each other. The supporting cast is also quite fun, mainly with Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, and Mark Ruffalo as the eccentric team who run Lacuna, the facility that erases memories. Each character ends up having their own opinions about the process, and we learn more about some of them through the flaws of the facility itself, which helps to make their subplot relevant.Lastly, Michel Gondry's direction, Ellen Kuras' cinematography, and Valdís Óskarsdóttir's editing craft the movie phenomenally. As a good chunk of the film takes inside Joel's head through the disappearance of his memories, plenty of visual effects flow on screen at a rapid pace, and they look astounding. Whenever Joel enters a memory of his past, the usage of placing him in the environment may showcase the occasional cinematic trick like forced perspective and compositing. I don't think the stylistic choices for the movie get nearly enough credit as the screenplay, for they help present the film with its own distinct identity from a visual standpoint. The way the film is shot should also be noted, as Kuras manages to display the grim nature of the real world and the surrealistic presence of one's inner workings wonderfully.Overall, Eternal Sunshine is not only a funny albeit realistic sci-fi dramedy in its own right, but it's also a very honest exploration of the mind when conflicting with love itself. The feeling may be painful when it comes to a relationship, but it can also be beautiful when reflecting upon oneself. Even if this film will make you reconsider your opinions about life, love and general memories, it will still hit home for the right reasons. Love is a very complicated word, as there has never been a relationship where there aren't as many downsides as there are upsides. So this is why I can say that this film may be one of the most believable love stories ever told, and nothing that it states is any half-assed effort.",9,0,1,22 August 2018
La La Land," Here's to the Fools Who Dream
","In 2016, writer/director of Whiplash, Damien Chazelle, scored big at film festivals and theaters during the holiday season with one of the biggest hits of 2016, La La Land. Regarded as a luscious tribute to musicals of the 40s and 50s, this film has become a critical darling and audiences have warmed up to it ever since it played theatrically in December 2016. Not only that, but it broke a new record at the Golden Globes by winning almost if not all the categories, from best motion picture in the comedy or music section, to best actor and best actress, to best director, to best screenplay, etc. While the movie is still a phenomenal piece of art, it's also the perfect movie to watch on valentine's day. How is it better to watch it on that said holiday as opposed to just any other day? Well, it's quite simple really. The movie is a romantic-dramedy about two struggling artists, Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and Mia Dolan (Emma Stone). The former is someone trying to bring traditional jazz back to the modern day crowd whereas the latter is an aspiring actress who comes close to giving up from failed audition after failed audition. After several dates and discussions about the magic of motion pictures, music, and acting, Mia is convinced to make her own play and even do more auditions, where Sebastian gets a gig with a hip-hop/jazz group that soon become a hit. The perseverance from these two can really make one root for them as their dreams are quite common to several artists who just want to entertain and do what they love. Even with countless struggles and failures, it's best to not give up, for you will still rise like Maya Angelou even when you feel like there's no point. While their relationship does have its troubles, it's meant to be a more realistic yet intriguing approach to two artists learning about each other. Their passions are what really give the movie its heart and soul, both in style and in substance. The aspiring musician and aspiring actress may have different views of entertainment, but they're still artists who care about making a difference nonetheless.  Mia and Sebastian have a lot of chemistry together; while Mia is more into theater and acting than music or jazz, Sebastian shows her how jazz musicians speak thru their instruments whether it be from their practice or improvised performances. When Mia gives Sebastian a tour of Hollywood movie sets, that's where they begin to express their passions to each other and begin to warm up as a couple. Sebastian advises Mia to make her own play, but that doesn't mean he can be there with his fame and music gigs. The real emotional side of the film lies in the conflicts between their passions. Due to their passions being different, their moments of glory sadly intertwine their relationship and it even toggles their hopes for getting their own careers in the first place. As my 12th grade creative writing teacher once said, 'As old fantasy Hollywood musical as it seems, it's also realistic in it's portrayal; it doesn't always work out'. That's why the emotions of the movie really pay off, it deals with something many people may go through. Just because one has a decent career going for them doesn't mean they can always be with their loved ones, and that's where the realism in the romance angle pays off. Love is not like a Disney picture as it's more complicated to sustain for some, but the heart from both characters are still there, and caring is what got them their dreams in the first place. And then there's the film's tribute to classic jazz, theater drama and Broadway, and musicals of the 40s and 50s. The musical numbers were composed by the film's composer, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics written by musical theater composing team, Pasek and Paul, and they really understand the beauty and amazement of Broadway and motion picture musicals. The musical numbers from Another Day of Sun, to Someone in the Crowd, to the Oscar winning City of Stars bring out the movie its upbeat, whimsical, and timeless feel that will make this film worth being up there with classics like Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story that would really make people dance in their seats. The Fools Who Dream really creates an emotional and character driven arch for Mia as well. The singing from Gosling and Stone is nothing fantastic at first, especially with the song A Lovely Night, but it warms up as the film goes on, and it fits as they build up to persevere in their dreams and to support one another. The Planetarium segment is pure visual delight and is 'pretty referential by trying hard to refer back to those old Hollywood films' stated creative writing teacher. But the one musical number that really shines throughout the continuation of the film is Mia and Sebastian's Theme, as it progresses the optimistic tone of the film while giving Ryan Gosling a real showcase of his piano talents. Don't be surprised if you find a lot to enjoy in terms of the musical numbers, let alone dancing to them. But I think the main reason this film is the perfect film to watch on valentine's day is not only because it's a love story, but it's a more optimistic and hopeful one. Since this film is about two rising entertainers who despite constant struggles and dilemmas still make it big one way or another, it ends up being quite relatable to anyone who started off struggling at the bottom before making it to the top. The determination and bravery Mia and Sebastian have really sells the movie, and the theme of never giving up and always finding support really pays off. Support is the best thing anybody can use when trying to make a name for themselves, and that's why it's best to not look down upon your closest friends when they help you make it somewhere, everything happens for a reason. And that's why the film feels like such a love letter, it says that you can still make a living out of whatever passion you have just as long as you don't forget about the ones that helped you get there. Complete with a special ending of realization and wonderment at the end that won't be spoiled, take it upon yourself to view this optimistic and bright feature with your soul mate anytime you choose.",10,5,6,13 February 2018
Woman in Gold," Solid Dramatic Biopic Worth your Time
","'When people see the famous portrait, they see a masterpiece by one of Austria's finest artists. But I see a picture of my aunt, a woman who talked to me about life while I brushed her hair in her bedroom.' Truer and more earnest words could not have been spoken better than that of Austrian- Jewish holocaust survivor, Maria Altmann, known for successfully reclaiming some of her family paintings from the Austrian Government that were abducted by the Nazis. Today's film tackles that subject, and upon viewing it for the first time, it managed to speak above higher levels of sincerity and personal attachment that I don't see often in cinema.The first notable element that the film portrays beautifully is the character of Maria Altmann herself. Growing up as a child in the mid-20s, she saw her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer being used to create the grim yet beauteous woman in the portrait known as Woman in Gold. Adele had a few portraits made of her by Austrian symbolist painter Gustav Klimt at age 25 through negotiations by her husband. Considering how much the portrait of her aunt meant to Maria personally, it makes sense that she would feel disgusted to see how this painting was used in later years. In fact, throughout the film, we see flashbacks of Maria's childhood that perfectly immolates her lifespan from childhood to young adulthood. Given how close Maria felt to her aunt as elegantly displayed in these flashbacks, this makes the symbolism of the gold painting all the more powerful. Klimt's intention was to showcase a 'swirling gown within a blaze of gold rectangles, spirals and Egyptian symbols', creating her aunt as the personification of Vienna's Golden Age. After her aunt died, the family would look upon the paintings through divineness, leaving Maria only with memories of the paintings, before they were taken away. This is what presents the 'Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I' as a symbol of all that her family had lost.One aspect that the film never shies away from is the horrible treatment of European Jews. As mentioned before, the film often depicts flashbacks of Maria's struggles in Austria. Not just the treatment of 'inferior' people, but by also demonstrating Nazis taking family possessions away from their original owners and would never have them restored. Maria's story compliments this unfortunate event, but the idea that it's best to let go of the past plays a notable contrast, despite how unjustified the act was. Sure, those who may not have been affected by it could still feel sorry for such a tragedy, but the ones who had a piece of them taken away by their foes just adds into how much of a double-edged sword the justice behind this act really is.Adding on to the well personified protagonist, the acting is also spot on. Helen Mirren is able to showcase the guilt hidden in Maria from how she abandoned her family to live a safer life, and is excellent at presenting her conflicted soul. She perfectly understood how Maria was tangled up between the past and the need to move on, elevated with tough emotions. Ryan Reynolds may be praised for Deadpool nowadays, but he is able to personify lawyer Randy Schoenburg (grandson of composer Arnold Schoeburg) as a young persistent lawyer extraordinarily. As a struggling family man with strong conviction for his roots, Reynolds leaps his persona to whole new heights as a determined lawyer in getting justice back to the right person.Similar to Big Eyes, the supporting cast either come off as obstacles or supporters in the protagonist's determination to gain their rightfully owned possessions back. Some like Hubertnus Czernin and Pam Schoenburg do support the duo in their court cases and battles against false copyright claims as well as giving some insight on their own pasts. Others, on the other hand, like Dr. Dreimann, Rudolph Wran, and those in favor of the Austrian government are highly intelligent and guarded civilians who have to deal with someone wanting back a possession which is also a legendary piece of their motherland. Not to mention, the court room scenes are at their most complex, especially in how Randy exercises in ownership loopholes and fighting against claims of the 1976 copyright act.Now the story itself does fall a little derivative with the two main leads conflicting with one another throughout before officially teaming up. Yet as overused as it seems, it actually helps give Randy a clear purpose to aid Maria given how much he cares about the identity of his own people as much as hers. Along with the gut-wrenching drama, the film occasionally sneaks in some subtle humor for good measure. Even if this was to keep the horrid trauma from what it truly was in real life, it gives off a more relatable vibe with the story and characters for the audience. Finally, the use of grim cinematography during the flashbacks fits perfectly with the time period to create the right sense of depression in contrast to the brighter cinematography of Altmann's court cases in '99.With sharp acting, well defined characters, and perfect contrast between the past and future, Woman in Gold is such remarkable insight on a fascinating woman who fought the law to gain her rightfully owned possessions back. The film actually ends with a quote that states, 'It has been estimated that over 100'000 works of art taken by the Nazis have not been returned to their rightful owners'. That quote only makes Maria's success all the more unique seeing as how much that piece meant to her, even if it meant taking a historic piece of art away from Austria. While some may not know of the actual history, this motion picture manages to stay true to the facts, and would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to see an underdog story about gaining one's memories back.",8,1,2,1 November 2017
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Magnum Opus
","Quentin Tarantino remains as one of the most unique modern filmmakers. The films he's directed are known for their nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, overabundance of violence, punchy dialogue, pop culture references and songs from the 60s to the 80s. So in order to find the one that embraces it all, look no further than his most beloved feature, Pulp Fiction. Made as a tribute to film-noir comics and pulp magazines, the film won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival the same year it was released. With that said, many consider this to be Tarantino's magnum opus, and I definitely agree.The plot itself is divided into thee different segments that are told in non chronological order. The first one details mob hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), whom share their own philosophical discussions with one another. Their story is intertwined with their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman). The second one details struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and his loved one Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros). And the third one details Vince and Jules fixing a murder problem with master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and encountering an anxious robber couple, 'Pumpkin' (Tim Roth) and 'Honey Bunny' (Amanda Plummer). With all of these storylines around, the film works based on what happens to each character. The mystery angle is played as each narrative comes afloat, making the viewing experience shockingly suspenseful.Since this film is well known for the character interactions, it's no brainer that the dialogue is extensive, charismatic, snappy and heavily intriguing. Each character has their own personal views on life and other subjects that make one ponder a lot, especially Jules, as his arch becomes quite theoretical to the point of wanting him to make ease with himself. I think my personal favorite storyline revolves around Butch, since the macguffin behind his tough guy persona is what ends up driving his arch forward the most. In addition to having such a bittersweet life waiting for him, all the crap that happens to the guy always has me worried about his well being. The funny thing is, we don't know what will ever happen to most of the characters. Many of their arches just sort of conclude without a resolution, which appropriately displays the uncertainty of what will become of them to keep the audience wondering.There's no denying how much this film makes use of its relatively small budget, and it looks amazing. The usage of camera angles, fast paced editing, lighting and panning really help elevate the already unpredictable flow that the movie set in stone. The cinematography by Andrzej Sekula successfully recreates the gritty underground homage to the hardboiled crime novels that inspired the feature. Not to mention, while there is no original score, the film makes heavy usage of the rock & roll and pop soundtrack that Tarantino loves to showcase in his work. Depending on the situation, any of the recordings are very crucial to the postmodern pizazz that the film established. Several films have been built around already existing songs like The Blues Brothers and Yellow Submarine, and this film is no exception; it utilized them wonderfully through style and substance.Even though Reservoir Dogs was Tarantino's directorial debut, I think this film took what was good and bad about that feature and kicked it up to eleven. Pulp Fiction is a fantastically well crafted crime flick that took the genre to new heights that were never before achieved back then. Many filmmakers have tried and failed to recreate the magic of this film's versatility, but of course, you can never truly recapture lighting in a bottle like that again. Given that this year makes the feature's 25th anniversary, I think you should do yourself a favor and give it a watch if you're yet to see it yourself. It might surprise you for better or worse, but the shear experience of it will never leave your mind.",10,0,1,6 January 2019
Castle in the Sky," Studio Ghibli's First Venture
","1985 was the year Studio Ghibli was formed by legends Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. A year later, they released their first ever feature length film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky (or just Castle in the Sky internationally). The film went on to garnish critical acclaim and a huge cult following amongst fans of Miyazaki's work. Needless to say, based on my love and appreciation for this man's work, I deem it as one of his best.The general story follows the adventures of a young boy named Pazu and a girl named Sheeta who possesses a mysterious stone with the ability of levitation. In addition to keeping the crystal away from military agents, they embark on a quest to search for a legendary floating castle called Laputa. With that said, Pazu and Sheeta make an adorable couple of friends, as their chemistry with each other is very sweet but also heart wrenching given what circumstances come about to them. Both are determined to find this lost castle to rediscover its lost beauty, and it's really nice how they develop within the pirates they meet.Speaking of said pirates, Dola's gang may seem antagonistic at first, but they're actually a genuinely entertaining and bittersweet gang, as they mold into one of the funniest family duos ever displayed in film. As for the real antagonist Colonel Muska, he is extremely hellbent on recovering Laputa for his own selfish and diabolical reasons, and therein lies possibly the film's biggest theme of all. You can use whatever weapons and machinery to get your way, but no matter what, love and nature are what matter most and taking them for granted does more harm than good.In addition, the setting that emulates 19th century Europe really gives the film a strange albeit wonderful contrast between the prosperous town Pazu is from to the much more spectacular castle altogether. Even for their first ever feature, the animation really is astonishing, especially the usage of aircraft and clouds breaking up. The moments where the characters are in the air make one feel the sense of high open space, and the atmosphere around really makes one's jaw drop. It's great when the world building can sometimes steal the show from the actual cast.If there are criticisms I do have, it's that while Dola's sons are entertaining in their own regard, the whole sub arch with them falling in love with Sheeta is rather pointless. It doesn't show up again after a couple of scenes and it actually gives a somewhat creepy feel to the movie. Also, while the Disney English dub is by no means bad, there is a little too much dialogue sprinkled throughout. It doesn't help that there are points that should be silent that are filled with annoying banter and out of place comedy. I'm yet to see the original dub, but I hope it's much better.Overall, Castle in the Sky remains as the kickstarter to what would eventually become the most beloved Japanese animation studio of all time. The characters are extremely lovable and worth rooting for, the animation is nothing short of gorgeous, and the themes of prospering through nature over political action and violence are just as relevant today as they were back then. If you are yet to see this film, definitely give it a watch to see where the studio that brought us Totoro, Spirited Away and Princess Kaguya originally blossomed. It's an experience for the whole family, and one that I'm happy to rewatch after so many years.",8,1,1,3 November 2018
The Disaster Artist," Absolutely Worth the Anticipation
","As an ironic fan of The Room and a legitimate fan of the book based on the making of the movie and the friendship of Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero, The Disaster Artist, I had been waiting months in anticipation for James Franco's film adaptation of said book. To say it did not disappoint would be a gross understatement, it was an amazing thrill ride. The general storyline focuses on two aspiring actors, Greg Sestero and Tommy Wiseau, who decide to make their own movie while struggling to make ends meet in Los Angeles. However, not only is Tommy incompetent as both an actor and a filmmaker, but the whole film makes one wonder whether or not Greg will stick to Tommy through think and thin or if he's wasting his time with this eccentric weirdo. What makes the movie authentic is how faithful it is to the book and Tommy Wiseau. While a few things were obviously changed here to either fit the running time or to work as an adaptation, it still succeeds in capturing Sestero and Wiseau's friendship from when they first met at an acting class, to living in LA to get their acting careers off the ground, to the troublesome production of their movie, to the premiere. It makes both characters very relatable to the audience, especially whenever Greg tries to understand Tommy's view on the world while being by his side.The movie can almost be seen as the modern day Ed Wood in how it 'seems to hold a certain amount of respect for Wiseau's chutzpah, while also critically looking at what makes The Room such a disaster' (Stefan Ellison). Granted it doesn't present Wiseau in as positive of a light as Ed Wood did with its titular character, but as eccentric and oddball as Tommy seems, all he really wanted was to bring his vision to life. Same applies to Greg Sestero, because he chose to tag along in the making of The Room just to get his name out there, let alone be there for Tommy.Speaking of the making, what Franco nailed in his direction was recreating the scenes from The Room for this movie, and the resemblances are near uncanny he did such a good job. As for the behind the scenes making, the crew are just like how they were described in the book, from script supervisor Sandy Schklair and cinematographer Raphael Smadja summing up anyone trying to comprehend Tommy's method of filmmaking, or lack thereof. Like in the book, Tommy was both an incomprehensible weirdo and an asshole that really tested the crew's patience during the making from one scene to the next, and Franco does not shy away from Wiseau's sudden outbursts and egocentric attitude.As for the acting, it is simply wonderful. While Dave Franco is good as Sestero, James Franco accurately nails the role of Wiseau, really capturing his indistinguishable accent, his laughable attempts at acting, and even his emotions, whether they be soft, angry, or even sad. Anyone can imitate Tommy, but it takes a genius of an actor to capture the right emotional key of someone, and Franco hit it home. Even the many well known actors in the film are well casted, like Megan Mullally as Greg's overly anxious mother, to Judd Apatow as an obstacle of a producer towards Wiseau, to Seth Rogen as the aforementioned Schklair, to Alison Brie as Sestero's cute albeit concerned girlfriend Amber, and even Josh Hutcherson and Ari Graynor as Philip Haldiman and Juliette Danielle doing whatever it takes to follow Tommy's orders as the actors, while getting annoyed in the process.Overall, James Franco's adaptation of The Disaster Artist is a worthy tribute to the friendship of Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero and their movie. By showing the side of Hollywood with struggling artists making films most likely not seen outside of late night programs, it still shows how astonishing it was to see Wiseau complete his phenomenally terrible $6 million passion albeit vain project and have it play in a theater. What could have easily been forgotten about has become a staple of disastrous cinema around the world by thousands of people. Without the movie's growing popularity, we would not have gotten to see the hilarious and faithful book that inspired this movie. Tommy's Planet may forever be a mystery, but we have The Room and The Disaster Artist to help us theorize where this fascinating weirdo originated from, let alone where he got the money to make his movie.",9,0,4,5 February 2018
Joker," The Most Intriguing Portrayal of the Famed Vigilante Clown
","Out of all the movies that have been released this year, none have been as controversial as the newest film adaptation of the DC Comics, Joker. Based on the iconic villain from the Batman lore, the film showed both promise and doubt upon its announcement. Although acclaimed actor Joaquin Phoenix was cast as the titular character and it was set to be a psychological thriller that commented on how society can affect those who are less fortunate, it seemed quite bizarre for the director of the Hangover trilogy to be tackling such a flick. Yet now that the film is out for the whole world to see, how does it work in the end?Without a doubt, the highlight of the feature is definitely Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. For someone who is intended to be severely mentally ill, he really elevated the performance to the point where he practically became Arthur throughout the picture. Most of the cinematic Jokers beforehand were either malicious sociopaths bent on taking over Gotham city or messed up victims that got screwed over from a severe past, and while Phoenix's falls into the latter category, one could argue that this is the most profound out of them all. As this is a psychological film, there are themes of delusion, narcissism and societal interference that can corrupt an already damaged individual, and all of those make Fleck one of the most fascinating representations of the famous clown. Speaking of clowns, comedy is another noted subject that is tackled upon in the feature, but more so how humor is conveyed to the world. Dark comedy may seem funny albeit incredibly subjective, but it's never a laughing matter when you try to bring in real world trauma into the mix, something only Arthur could misinterpret in his own scattered way.Todd Phillips is the director of the feature, and despite being more well known for his goofy and raunchy comedies, he managed to pull off the job well in presenting a dark gritty thriller inspired by Taxi Driver and Serpico. The cinematography is intentionally bleak and grainy, the action scenes are realistically brutal and intense, and the dramatic elements are surpassingly depressing. As the film takes place in the early 1980s, a noteworthy time period of crime and violence in major cities, the creepy atmosphere displayed throughout is what makes this film frightening more so than juvenile jump scares and gun fire. There also seems to be some influence taken from The King of Comedy, as the way the filmmakers and Phoenix depicted Arthur's interpreted reality clashing with the real world is worthy of that film's bizarre tone. Another great addition to the scenes has to be the haunting score by Hildur Guonadottir, as it adds in the necessary tension throughout the most disturbing moments in the feature without being overbearing.However, the film is not without its shortcomings, and a lot of the issues for me have to do with some of the narrative decisions. For one thing, some of the ways they depict Arthur's insanity is a bit questionable and a bit pretentious, as in we don't need constant mood swings from his reactions to the horrors of Gotham. That, and there are some overdone cliches to the story that almost ruin the film's unique execution, like Arthur's origins and some of the ticking points that made him snap and kill certain people during the first act. Also, one of Arthur's notable symptoms is hallucination, and there's a subplot where he hits it off well with his neighbor, and the way they revealed it was all fake was too obvious for what's supposed to be a down to earth character study. Finally, this is supposed to be stand-alone origin story of the Joker character, yet it seems they couldn't help but to shoe horn in Bruce Wayne's story too. The attempts at that came off as unnecessary and rather clunky, as if you could have removed that element from the narrative and not much would have changed.In spite of some odd plot elements and a really pathetic attempt to connect this to the Batman mythos, Joker still works well enough on its own thanks to its gritty urban tone, Joaquin Phoenix's stellar performance and the overall chilling presentation. If you're a big fan of the Joker as a character, down to earth crime dramas or character studies in general, then you should definitely seek this one out. It may not be for everyone, but what must be made clear is that this film is not meant to sympathize with the titular character as opposed to reflecting on what caused his ultimate downfall. Whether or not you agree with the Joker's mindset, it's fascinating when a film introspects into his psyche in order to leave an impression on viewers who will feel challenged by the clown's tragic beginnings.",6,3,11,11 October 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The Story of Individuality over Conformity through Mental Illness
","Adapting a book into a film is a very tough challenge, as they're two very distinct mediums that work in completely opposite formats. One is descriptive and the other is visual, meaning that regardless of the intent behind the making of either commodity, they need to translate well enough to work both ways. In the case of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, given that it's a universally loved feature that won all of the five main Oscar categories, one can imagine that even if it may not have pleased fans of the book, it still succeeded as a flick on its own. So how does it hold up after so many years?The film centers around convict Randle Patrick McMurphy, who gets sent to a mental institution as a compromise away from prison. However, the martinet Nurse Ratched maintains her role as that of a subtly tough leader for all the patients, which causes McMurphy to rebel against such rules. One major aspect worth noting about the feature is the concept of individuality over conformity. Mac is somewhat hyperbolic in his personality, but his desire to bring a sense of reality to all the patients around him is worth admiring for how logical it is. The friendships that Mac makes with each mental patient are quite genuine and even bittersweet, down to the point where you can attach yourself to their own scenarios. Even if Mac can't realistically succeed in making their lives better, the multiple ways he has them live differently is nothing short of lovable.Another big praise to give the feature is the acting, as each performer practically becomes the character they play; once you see them, you'll never forget them. Jack Nicholson outshines as MacMurphy, as he always provides something new to his delivery, including bizarre mannerisms around the patients. Louise Fletcher is appropriately unsympathetic as Nurse Ratched, who despite being strong willed in keeping the schedule monotonous, ultimately has little care for what the patients seek emotionally, making her truly despicable. In addition, the supporting players truly make the film memorable. They range from the anxious Billy Bibbit, to the childish Charlie Cheswick, to the delusional Martini, to the paranoid Dale Harding, to the aggressive Max Taber, and so much more. And then there's the presumably mute one, Chief, who has a lot of charming qualities to him outside of that. The relationship between him and Mac is very touching, as it details how much they both care for each other in spite of their quirks and conflicting lives.Now admittedly, the film is pretty simplistic in terms of plot and character motivations, but I think that's why it works in the end. Because many of the characters live in their own small worlds, whatever happens to them is strictly concerning. So having somebody who isn't actually insane having those who are live a little outside of their 'comfort' zones can speak to anybody who loathes the status quo. Without spoiling anything, the climax of the feature is a result of what can happen when two differing views clash without forming a compromise on a situation. Ironically, when you do the same old thing over and over as a method of helping your patients out, you barely end up helping them in the long run. Neither MacMurphy or Ratched were necessarily wrong on how mental patients should be treated, it's just a pure case of logic without reason, which are two things we need if we're all to get better.Needless to say, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a modestly written albeit brilliantly acted, well directed and emotionally haunting tale of what can happen when neither tradition nor distinction are ever put together. Of course nobody will ever forget the acting, but what those phenomenal performances were built on were the concepts of mental illness needing to be treated with more care than expected. I can't say for certain how faithful the film is to the book, especially in that regard, but I'm sure it knows all about the consequences coming from institutions not understanding the patient's true necessities. I highly recommend this to anyone who is yet to check the flick out for that factor alone. Maybe you'll think longer about the individual characters, but the main protagonist will be locked in our memories forever for the light he shines on men who would have never gotten that sense of free will anywhere else.",8,0,0,13 March 2019
Jaws," The Film That Kickstarted Steven Spielberg into Stardom
","When people think of what was the film that kickstarted the summer blockbusters we've had for more than forty years, they think of Steven Spielberg's Jaws. Based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley (who also co-wrote the movie), the film suffered numerous production problems, mostly due to the fact that some of it was shot on water, and the shark was a pain to work with. Thankfully, the ends justify the means, because not only did the movie score with critics and audiences but it earned so much box office moolah that it became the first ever summer blockbuster, forever changing Hollywood and Spielberg's career. However, does it still hold up after so many years?In all honesty, the story itself is kind of silly, as it centers around a giant man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, prompting the police chief Martin Brody to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist Matt Hooper, and a professional shark hunter Quint. It doesn't help that the movie doesn't really depict sharks realistically and more like mindless killing machines that randomly attack humans out of instinct and horror. However, what elevates the story to better heights are the great dialogue, the splendid cast of characters, and the brilliant uses of thrills and music. The dialogue feels very natural to the kind of film this is intended to be, as the conversations come off as convincing and even intimidating. While it is obvious that they should get rid of the shark due to the horrible sins it committed, you also wonder how the characters feel in regards to said events, and each character motivation is built up with splendid lines delivered with raw emotions, high determination, and even some humorous banter. I doubt 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' will ever be forgotten by the public it's that suspenseful of a line.Adding into that, the characters make this film all the more worth while. Chief Brody may be frightened, but he's also heavily concerned for the safety of the Amity Island residences, and his moments of bravery bring out the tough guy we wish to be on such a daring adventure. Hooper can be a curmudgeon, but he's highly intelligent as a marine biologist and his banter between the cocky and tough albeit hysterical Quint are simply hilarious. The mayor Larry Vaughn himself really is hard to deal with given how determined he is to keep the beaches afloat, but even he has concerns over when the shark will come next at some point. The other characters like Brody's wife Ellen and kids, Deputy Hendricks, and Chrissie Watkins fit their bill well enough to progress the plot and to keep the characters motivated. Add in splendid acting from the likes of Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Gary and more, and you've got a cast of characters worth rooting for.Lastly, the suspense and tension in the film are what make it all the more timeless. During production, they could barely get the shark to work, so Spielberg chose to have the shark appear sparingly up until the end and use props and camera motions to suggest the shark was there to heighten the thrills. This was a brilliant move on his part, as it helps put the audience at the end of their seats wondering what will become of anyone swimming, aided by an appropriately stunning score by John Williams. The very idea of something dangerous trying to eat you in the ocean is horrifying enough, and I can imagine why this movie would give people phobias of going in the water. Granted, the shark does look more fake the more you look at it, but they still succeeded in making it threatening without showing too much of it.Steven Spielberg became a household name thanks to this movie, and it more than ever deserves its high recognition. From gripping suspense, to solid dialogue, to memorable characters and a soundtrack still remembered to this day, I think Jaws holds up today just as much as back then. It just goes to show that you can execute a silly idea into a gripping, fun and exciting thrill ride of a feature if you know how to bring it to life. So whenever you can, pick up a copy of Jaws and have a blast with it...just don't shoot a movie on water like Spielberg did.",9,0,1,11 February 2018
WALL·E," Possibly Pixar's Crowning Achievement
","10 years ago, Pixar released Wall-E, which started development as far back as 1995 when Toy Story was released, but was never put into full production until 2002 by Andre Stanton. What followed was a movie going experience unlike any other Pixar venture ever before crafted due to the raw emotions and intellectual philosophies it contains. While Ratatouille still remains my personal favorite Pixar film, there is no denying how brilliant Wall-E is from start to finish. Imagine what would happen if 'Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg decided to collaborate on a movie together' (Stefan Ellison).For starters, what makes Wall-E stand out from many animated films is its usage of visual storytelling. As it centers around two distinct robots, one named Wall-E from a trash ridden Earth and one named Eve from a maximum spaceship, they mainly communicate with vocal effects and bleeps. This is the perfect representation for animation, as the first ten minutes establishes Wall-E and its position on a deserted wasteland to an understandable degree to the audience. As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words, and it's fantastic how Wall-E's interests and interactions with the environments around it tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could.Speaking of vocals and lack of dialogue, most of the robot sound effects were provided by former Star Wars sfx technician Ben Burtt. Burtt doesn't simply create mechanical beeps, he creates multiple vocal ranges and sounds that define each robot depending on what they're conveying, let alone Wall-E. Another cool touch was having the Apple product MacInTalk to be the voice of Auto, as it emulates its artificial intelligent presence throughout the film. There are of course other noteworthy voice actors like Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and even Sigourney Weaver, but as good as they are, none of their contributions will ever live up to the specific sounds for each robot that make them come off as more than just interactive machines.At its core, Wall-E is a love story, and the progression of Eve feeling uncomfortable around Wall-E to soon falling in love with it transitions believably throughout the feature. This is because Wall-E never directly forces its feelings towards her and mainly wants to have a friend to no longer feel alone. Even though Eve was initially designed to be 'directive', she does develop outside her duty upon seeing the positive qualities of Wall-E and the Earth itself. Not to mention, despite Wall-E's attempts to approach her romantically not growing outside of Hello Dolly, the scenes of it taking care of her or following her around come off as charming due to its unselfish attitude. It isn't until she views footage of Wall-E taking care of her that she decides she loves him back, making her arch all the more touching.Now the one aspect of the film that has been debated ever since its release is its social commentary, mainly the environmental message depicted in the conflict between idealism and capitalism in the Axiom spaceship. The main reason the humans can't leave the ship is because of a massive government corporation taking control of the world. A plant that Wall-E and Eve discover hightens the environmental message to remind the humans to take care of the Earth, yet it does not come off as preachy and instead works as a major goal. While Wall-E initially came aboard the Axiom to save Eve, it discovers the bare necessities in how effective the plant is to humans, making it more determined than ever to save them. The main reason the humans are so infatuated with their own technology is because they've become too careless to do anything else, something unfortunately common in today's era of social media dominating people's lives. However, the film at no point ever mocks the humans and instead sympathizes with them, down to Captain McCrea giving orders all the time by his auto pilot for no other reason other than his naivety. Even two humans aboard the Axiom named John and Mary come face to face in romance thanks to Wall-E himself, showing how the unlikeliest of coincidences can be more meaningful than everyday occurrences. However, what I like most about Wall-E is how optimistic it is, as it shows a genuine love and respect towards planet Earth through the simplest of things, hence why Wall-E itself finds so much joy in stacking up cubes of trash. In addition, Captain McCrea represents the best kind of optimist, the ones that are highly determined to save their own life based off the smallest form of natural evolution, while Auto represents the pessimists who refuse to believe that anything can bring a positive change to the world. Seriously, there are plenty of people out there who only live and breath on nothing but pessimistic thoughts, and they'll also try to manipulate you into believing their ideas, regardless if you have your own feelings or not. This makes the moments of McCrea and Wall-E standing up for what's right all the more captivating, showing how positivity and hope helps one more than negativity ever will.Finally, the animation is stellar beyond belief, mainly because of how experimental it is. The acting from Wall-E and Eve is quite clever, given how the crew chose Wall-E to have binoculars for eyes, which convey all its emotions and outer thoughts beautifully. Eve's various eye expressions are also enough to sell herself as a fully realized character. The depiction of outer space is gorgeous to the eyes, and the define dancing sequence just might be one of cinema's greatest moments due to the stunning effects and crisp flying scenes. The usage of color is a notable highlight, especially the contrast between the brownish and grainy wasteland of the world and the Axiom's blueish sterile interiors, creating an identity for each area the film takes place in. The camerawork is also fun to watch, given the influence of 1970s cinematography, swooping crane shots, and even the camera going in and out of focus, all of which to help bring us into the world much more.In conclusion, after ten years of existence, Wall-E still stands the test of time as one of the most magical, touching and downright brilliant films ever made. As both a major game changer for the sci-fi genre and an adorable romance story, it succeeds in flying colors with its unique take on storytelling, characterization, and themes of fundamentalism vs cynicism. No joke, if we had more beings like Wall-E in our lives, chances are the world would be a much better place, and it all starts by shining hope around the world, let alone with plants. Thank you to not only director Andrew Stanton, but also the likes of Jim Morris, Pete Docter, Jim Reardon, Ben Burtt and all the talented animators, artists and technicians at Pixar for bringing his movie into our lives. Even after 700 years, there's a high chance that audiences will still be immersed and enchanted by its wonderful story and characters.",9,1,1,17 June 2018
The Iron Giant," A Cinematic Landmark that Stood the Test of Time
","Back in the late 90s, when most theatrical animation was trying to emulate the success of the Disney renaissance, along came a smaller albeit unique feature from Warner Bros. called The Iron Giant. Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was a box office flop on its original release due to poor marketing. However, thanks to a growing cult following on VHS and DVD, and the film's director Brad Bird creating Pixar powerhouses like The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film eventually went from an underrated gem to one of the greatest animated features ever made. After over 20 years in its existence, I think it's time to owe back its debt.Set in 1950s America during the Cold War, the film follows Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant intergalactic metal robot. In response to the U.S. military, Hogarth must fend them off from destroying the Giant. The movie's main plot is a mix of the common young child meets strange creature narrative and the old fear of beings beyond our worlds common in 1950s sci-fi films. What makes the otherwise familiar storyline fascinating though is how it develops the Giant as a legitimate character, from letting its monstrous size tell many scenes themselves and Hogarth mentoring it like a father teaching its son all the advantages in becoming good, as if a machine could actually have a soul. As for the sci-fi aesthetic, the film cleverly plays around with the themes of paranoia from nuclear war common back then with a supernatural twist, since what's beyond their world was too much for them to even comprehend. Of all the films to blend thrilling sci-fi, atomic fear and heartfelt tenderness together, this movie knocks it right out of the ballpark.As this is a character driven story, almost every figure in the movie plays an important part in some shape or form. With Hogarth being a rebellious albeit responsible kid, he also has the misfortune of his single mother working overtime, which makes his role to the giant as a teacher all the more engaging. In fact, because the Giant is often curious about the new world of Earth, he learns more from the values of friendship and life through Hogarth and the beatnik artist Dean, making their bonds all the more sincere and heartwarming. Speaking of Dean, he's more of a hip outcast to society that makes his own artwork from scrap and junk, yet that all leads to him reluctantly becoming part of the Giant's presence. Then there's the antagonist Kent Mansley, who perfectly represents how the government wanted America to think in the 50s, as he believes anything outside the U.S. and Earth is a threat and must be destroyed for the 'good' of humanity. Rarely have animated characters been this relatable and this human before, including a giant metal robot.Even for a movie that strayed away from the Disney formula in the 90s, the film is animated nearly as well as any product from the Mouse House. Brad Bird is known for his exaggerated and stylistic character designs, and this film is no exception, as every character sticks out based on their physique and personality. The character animation adds in smooth movements, realistic attributes common in human anatomy and bold gestures that sell the performances. However, the film's true highlight has to be the CG work done on the Giant itself, as the crew created it with a cel-shaded approach that helps it blend extraordinarily well with the hand-drawn characters. The lack of overly detailed lighting also helps, since it keeps the contrast of the Giant simple and easy to look at without coming off as distracting. Also, major applause must be given to the cinematography and shot composition, as every color and every single frame conveys what the scene is communicating emotionally, whether it'd be completely visual with no dialogue or an intense thrilling scene with quick cuts and frightening glares.Needless to say, The Iron Giant stands the test of time thanks to its heartfelt story, themes of acceptance over fear, lovable characters and wonderful animation. If you're yet to check this film out for yourself, then this is a must watch for anyone, not just film and animation buffs. It's not common that a feature communicates the idea that supposedly dangerous weapons could actually have a soul to them, yet this film found a way to do so through humor, pathos and ideologies that are still common today. Remember, even things we might take for granted can have more substance than we give them credit for.",9,0,1,15 January 2020
The Emperor's New Groove," Arguably Disney's Funniest Movie Ever Made
","This film remains one of Disney's biggest cult films to date, mainly for its fast paced slapstick humor, exaggerated animation, and lovable characters. Yet as celebrated as this movie is, there's also somewhat of a dark side to it, mainly due to its infamous troubled production. It was originally entitled Kingdom of the Sun, and it had an almost completely different narrative in mind. It was supposed to be an Incan retelling of The Prince & the Pauper and it even had a different crew on board, but due to countless of story problems and executive meddling, the original director Roger Allers and many others left the project and it was retooled by Mark Dindal and an almost completely new crew in less than two years. You'd think a movie out of such a nightmarish production would end up mediocre at best, but this particular movie is far from that, as it could make even the most tired person energetic and excited for how zany it is.Still set in the Incan era, an arrogant young emperor named Kuzco is transformed into a llama by his former advisor Yzma, who also gets rid of him. Upon encountering a village leader named Pacha, Kuzco trusts him to take him back to the palace and change him back into a human. From a narrative standpoint, the story is rather predictable, as it's the typical road trip buddy movie where the two main leads go through many trials and tribulations before trusting each other. However, what makes up for the weak storyline is the humor, characters and even the heart. Considering that Mark Dindal had previously directed Cats Don't Dance, the film pays a huge homage to the original Looney Tunes and the cartoons by Tex Avery. There's lots of fourth wall breaks, slapstick stunts, witty banter, fast-paced visual gags, exaggerated facial expressions, funny line deliveries, and even some jokes that will fly over kid's heads. It's no wonder you still hear people quoting lines like, 'demon llama' or 'RIIIIIIIIGHT'.In addition, the characters are also enjoyable enough to warrant a watch. While Kuzco does start off rather callous, he does gravitate more towards Pacha and the people below him upon realizing that the world is much more than his arrogant self could have ever imagined. Although even at that, his selfish attitude is so delightfully narcissistic that he's hard not to giggle at, as he's like that kind of self centered dork you just love to hate. As for Pacha, he's the kind hearted and compassionate village man who despite going through Kuzco's ego, still sees the good in him and the tender moments he shares with the young emperor really display a lot of genuine heart, making it impossible to dislike him. However, the true standouts are Yzma and her bumbling assistant Kronk, as they provide the best laughs in the whole film and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton really bring the two to life with their charisma and contrasting personalities. I won't talk about the rest as they're not as important to the narrative, aside from Pacha's subtly eccentric family, but all of the characters are humorous nonetheless.Finally, as stated before, the influence on Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry is shown right on screen, especially with the character animation. While not all the characters move in a very dynamic and magnified fashion, the ones that do could make one crack up even with the tiniest of gestures. The character designs even emulate the Disney style to more of a Tex Avery format, especially when it comes to the visual gags that move at a cheetah's pace without feeling overbearing. One particular visual joke when Yzma and Kronk are chasing after Kuzco and Pacha to the palace is so subversive that it's hard to believe such a gag could ever come from the House of Mouse. While the backgrounds are fine but nothing too noteworthy, the effects animation is quite colorful (although not overly saturated) and filled with highly creative lights and shadows that really make them pop on screen. While Aladdin and Hercules may be the two other animated Disney ventures that come closest to matching the tone and style of classic cartoons, I think this film takes the cake and swallows it whole.Needless to say, The Emperor's New Groove practically re-writes the rules of what Disney animated films should do, mainly by being a highly entertaining slapstick buddy comedy rather than a classic story being adapted into a massive musical. Around this time, the studio would end up having its fair share of hits and misses, but this is one of the hits in terms of the company leading itself into experimental directions. They say animated movies should only aim for more challenging themes and epic scopes, but that doesn't mean we can't have a zany cartoony comedy like this every now and then. It's almost been 20 years since this film came out, and while it's hard to determine whether or not Kingdom of the Sun would have been better or not, at least we got something fresh and unique out of the Disney cannon that will still be beloved for many years to come.",9,3,4,3 July 2018
Amélie," Magnificent Magic
","Sometimes, you come across a film that you can relate to through such a personal, emotional, and even relatable level that it soon becomes a favorite of yours. Amelie is one of those films, as it manages to invoke a whimsical and optimistic charm from its titular character alone. The film itself remains the highest grossing French film released in America, and it's hard not to see why. As this is a vehicle for the delightful Audrey Tautou, the film depicts contemporary Parisian life in such a poetic fashion that it could make anyone change their life.The story itself focuses on a shy waitress named Amelie who, upon reuniting a man with his lost toy box, decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, despite struggling with isolation. Later on, she begins having feelings for a man named Nino, resulting her to play some sort of set up to win his heart while fighting with her inner shyness. I think shyness is the key word to describe how relatable Amelie truly is. She means well and is looking out for those she knows, but still remains introverted and quirky, thus making it hard for her to relate to 'normal' people, making her romance with Nino all the more unconventional. In addition, the first part of the film centers around Amelie's childhood, which perfectly highlights her spending time alone to be entertained herself, further emphasizing just how relatable the film can be to any introvert.As for Audrey Tautou, she shines fantastically as Amelie, capturing her joyful albeit neurotic personality to such a lovable degree, and it's always fun to see her smiling. The other characters are charming in their own right, particularly Amelie's reclusive neighbor Raymond Dufayel with brittle bones who tries finding the key to perfecting his repainted copy of Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party. Other notable supporting characters are Amelie's co-workers, from the hypochondriacal Georgette, to the stern albeit compassionate Gina, to the tough albeit caring owner Suzanne, in addition to the repugnant Joseph and the failed writer Hipolito. Whether it'd be Nino or these aforementioned characters, all of them stand out from their own distinct quirks, like collecting discarded photos, popping bubble wrap, or even lusting over one another through sex, and it's great that Amelie sees nothing but the joy in all that.Lastly, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet crafts a marvelous visual aesthetic ranging from playful camera techniques, compositional scenes, and even occasional computer animation, mostly for the creatures in Amelie's imagination. These methods help give the film a very tongue & cheek presence by design, and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel splendidly films Jeunet's crazy vision to tremendous heights. Not to mention, although the film is very funny from its sardonic humor and characters alone, possibly the best jokes come from Amelie's childhood, which subverts the most expectations through visual storytelling. The film truly knows when to have fun with itself, even through the visuals that perfectly define the dazzling world that Amelie sees in her daily life. Needless to say, dazzling sums up Amelie perfectly well, not just because of how enchanting it is by tone and design, but also by how sympathetic it is. It's not often I've come across a film I can relate to given how introverted yet imaginative I myself am. If you yourself are an introvert or prefer to live life through the smallest and simplest of things, seek this magnificent beauty out and see whether or not it relates to you on a personal level or not. More often than not, I think it's better that we just forget about much of the world problems and just look on the simplicities of life. You never know what aspects you'll end up admiring.",9,0,1,23 May 2018
Cinderella," Fantastic for its Time, Not so Much Now
","The 1940s was not a particularly grand decade for the Walt Disney Company. With the exception of Dumbo, all their animated features were financial failures and wouldn't be regarded as timeless classics until years later. As a result, the company could only make package films due to budget cuts and WWII screwing over their studio. It wouldn't be until later on that decade when Walt not only took a risk and made another feature length animated film, an adaptation of the tale of Cinderella, but also put the studio on a gamble. If the movie succeeded, the company would prosper, if not then it would shut down...what resulted was the former. Alongside being lauded back in the day by audiences and critics alike, Cinderella is to this day seen as one of the studio's most iconic features. As for what I think....well, let's just say that I respect it more than I actually like. The biggest issue with Cinderella is the story, which suffers from overly long pacing, too many subplots, and an overall straightforward arch. While the film sets up the lives of Cinderella and her step family decently enough, it isn't until roughly 20 minutes until the plot actually happens. Beforehand, it's just Cinderella working and singing, and the mice messing around with the cat. In addition, we spend too much time on the mice that we don't get to know enough of Cinderella outside of her wishing beyond her wildest dreams for a better life. I don't mind the mice per se and they do have their moments, but less is more. Admittedly, the film does pick up a little once we get to the palace, which has the audience in awe as much as Cindy herself...too bad the prince has even less character than the one in Snow White. The less said about the infamous slipper plot hole the better.As for the other characters, while Lady Tremaine does have quite the malicious mood and evil grin, when you get down to it, there isn't all that much to her. You could argue most of her backstory being unexplained makes her more mysterious, but the fact that she does all these horrid things to Cinderella without a proper reason just makes her seem evil....because. If anything, the step sisters stand out more from how humorous they can get, and that scene where they tear off Cinderella's dress is quite a heartbreaking scene within itself. Also, while the prince is blander than paper, the king and royal duke do make a rather entertaining couple given their witty banter and arguments, and their distinct personalities create some really genuine laughs for the audience. Oh, and the fairy godmother is kind and generous in her own right, even if she's little more than a plot device.Now while the story isn't all that great and the characters are a mixed bag, the animation is fantastically well crafted. It's been stated that nearly 90% of the movie was done with rotoscoping, and it shows in the final product as the movements are very smooth and the characters are realistically designed without crossing into the uncanny valley. As for the animation that's done from scratch, the mice and other animals have a rather cartoony style that perfectly defines their look and personalities. Even if we spend too much time on the animals than we should have, at least the animators made fun usage of playing around with their colorful movements and designs. The usage of a more dark color scheme whenever Lady Tremaine is around is another added touch of depth, making the more bright and vibrant colors of the palace much more astonishing in contrast. Speaking of which, the backgrounds display a quaint European style that looks well detailed, sharp and finesse, even if the environments are only a village and a castle.Finally, the songs in this movie range from forgettable to touching, but they at least serve the plot. A Dream is a Wish does a good job summing up Cinderella's desires outside of her fantasies, the mice's work song is the film's most catchy and upbeat harmony with fun antics of the mice making Cindy's dress, and Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo still holds up for how whimsical, enchanting and downright helpful it is. After all that hard work for nothing, it's great that somebody else is generous enough to make Cindy's wish come true, and it's hard not to song along to. The rest I unfortunately barely remember, as they felt sweet but standard, like it's the typical Disney charm we know and have heard better in other songs. Those other songs aren't by any means bad, and the singing from the likes of Ilene Woods, Mike Douglass, Verna Felton and more are delightful and stunning, they just didn't leave much of an impact on me like the rest. So overall, I can definitely understand the appeal of Cinderella for its whimsical charm, lovable side characters, beautiful animation, and a charming representation of what could happen if your dreams finally came true. However, I personally just can't get into it due to the boring pacing, bland main characters, hit or miss songs and predictable plot. If you love this movie with all your heart, keep on having fun with it, there's no stopping you. Me personally though, I'd skip this film in a heartbeat over other Disney films any day....that being said, I can't wait to see Cindy in Wreck it Ralph 2, get stoked for that.",4,3,4,13 June 2018
Da 5 Bloods," PTSD from the POV of Scarred Black Lives
","PTSD comes in all wavering factors, whether from psychological abuse, or childhood trauma, or especially fighting in a deadly war between countries. In the case of the latest Spike Lee joint, Da 5 Bloods, this flick really delves into how the effects of the Vietnam War can screw up the lives of individuals, specifically African Americans. The fact that this film was released when a jingoistic arrogant prejudiced white man is still in America's office pretending to run things adds into the hypocrisies commonplace in the land of the free. Just when we think a war is over, it comes back in ways we would never expect.The story centers around a group of aging Vietnam War veterans who return to said country in search of both their late squad leader and a treasure they buried while serving there. From the getco, the movie is driven just as much by its characters as its plot, maybe a little more so, mainly due to their individual personalities. Although these veterans served in the army, they all came out differently, such as Otis (Clarke Peters) having a more lenient soft spot for the country personally, Eddie (Norm Lewis) having achieved success after his time, or Melvin (Isiah Whitlock jr.) being the sardonic jokester of the group. However, the biggest standout would have to be the aggressively ill-tempered Paul, elevated through an all-star performance by Delroy Lindo. In addition to having a rocky relationship with his son David (Jonathan Majors), who tags along on the crew's journey, the amount of anger seethed inside him from serving such an unnecessary war practically poisons him into becoming his own villain. You know a cast is intriguing when you debate whether to root for these elders or not.But what would be a solid search movie without a good amount of foes to add into the tension? In the case of Da 5 Bloods, for every trustworthy component like the group's guide Vinh (Johnny Tri Nguyen), and Otis' former flame Tien (Le Y Lan), there are the more shady opponents attempting to be in the way of them. For instance, the shady French businessman Desroche (Jean Reno), plays up the heist well in manipulating the men into their journey under false pretenses of payback (th French were also fairly ruthless in Vietnam mind you). Along the way, the group meet up with foreign experts like French woman Hedy Bouvier (Mélanie Thierry), Simon (Paul Walter Hauser) and Seppo (Jasper Pääkkönen), who all seem superfluous until the film's latter half raises up the violence and stakes to frightening results. All throughout the feature, these side characters play key factors in either playing along the main group's goals or trying to do anyway with them, emphasizing who to trust and who not to trust in an otherwise divisive traumatized pack of veterans.Throughout the feature, Lee cleverly intertwines stock footage to emphasize the tangents in the main story and the media brought during the war's period. Whether it'd be used to parallel the speeches of famous icons like Martin Luther King or Muhammad Ali between the poor Vietnamese citizens vs the poor Blacks, or to add in to how little has changed since these disgusting war years, this footage can often come at the expense of making viewers, based on their race and class, think long and hard about the effects that this period had on America. Another fascinating filmmaking choice is shooting the flashback sequences of the group and the aforementioned Norman on 16mm and without making the actors look young, possibly indicating that the Bloods never truly left Vietnam (as Vinh pointed out) due to how much it came back to haunt them all. If there is any notable flaw in the movie, it's that perhaps the 2.5 hour runtime can be rather tiresome depending on the viewer's interest, and the few moments of humor don't always mesh well with the overall serious tone.It's not often when a war film really goes into the harsh realities of American citizens who were affected by its country through a pointless battle worse than others. Da 5 Bloods stands as a bold and brutally honest feature about America's perception of Blackness that seems to have lingered on since 1619, 'whether in heroic situations or human ones,' (Odie Henderson). Whether you're a Spike Lee fan, a war-movie buff or are interested in viewing pro-black media during these crazy times, this is right up your alley. After all, what does it really mean to be a war hero at the end of the day?",8,0,0,23 June 2020
Incredibles 2," After 14 Years, it's a Worthwhile View
","After 14 years of waiting, the long awaited sequel to The Incredibles has finally hit theaters nationwide. The main reason it came out much later than expected is mainly due to director Brad Bird and the Pixar team not really knowing the proper continuing story until later on. So now that it's officially out, while I don't put it nearly on the same level as the first film, I was quite satisfied with what we ended up getting nonetheless.Set immediately after the events of its predecessor, the story of Incredibles 2 centers around two particular plots: Helen Parr (a.k.a. Elastigirl) taking on superhero action undercover while Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) watches over the family. Both plots work quite well in continuing the Parr's arches in attempting to return as superheroes. Rather than being a simple case of role reversal, the main plot further stretches the elastic heroine to gain more momentum, especially with her main goal being to catch the menacing Screenslayer. As for Bob's arch, he develops as both a father and role model by watching over the kids, while discovering more to his and their individual personalities. With baby Jack-Jack's powers going all over the place, this creates many fun sequences of his various abilities that later attribute more to the story as it progresses. Even Violet's arch consisting of boy troubles helps expand her character and to teach Mr. Incredible something new about her.The first film's thematic elements of brilliant people not to be forced to conform to societal norms continues here, especially with telecommunications tycoon Winston Deavor trying to bring supers back in the spotlight again. In addition, there's some neat commentary on Elastigirl being seen by herself as the current face of superheroes. The only main issue with the story is how some of the first film's story beats are reused, I mean does Elastigirl fighting crime to support the family remind you of anything? Also, despite being threatening, let's just say that the new villain Screenslayer isn't quite as memorable as Syndrome in The Incredibles, with a reveal that might be more predictable than assumed. Thankfully, most call-backs are very far and few in between, as Brad Bird presents new ideas that we never saw him unfold before. As for the new characters, they range from humorous enough to rather iffy. The most prominent ones featured have to be the Deavors, with the aforementioned Winston being a very competent businessman who desires returning supers to their formal glory along with his technological genius sister Evelyn who always fixes a dilemma when needed. The new supers that come by mainly stick out from their designs and distinct abilities, although Void does come off as a rather awkward fan of Elastigirl. While they don't become very intriguing until later on, which I certainly can't go into without spoiling much, the rest of the family still showcase their memorable love for each other and their individual powers.With a 14 year time span, it's no wonder the animation got a significant upgrade compared to its predecessor. For one thing, not only did the characters get a significant redesign, but there is much detail displayed on their bodies and clothes to make them look more polished. Also, the set-pieces take full advantage of the battles the Incredibles' and other supers get into, complete with much more varieties of extravagant powers. The action sequences display even more wonderful and smooth choreography, particularly when it comes to Elastigirl showcasing her rubbery limbs. The real scene stealer has to be the multiple powers that Jack-Jack creates, as they astonish the viewers as much as make them chuckle. Similar to the first film, the modernist 1960s influenced production design adds much visual flavour to Incredibles 2 to help it stand out. While many modern animated films keep moving forward, it's great that films like these go for the old-school touch.With the exception of their upgrade in computer graphics after 14 years, the Incredibles family are still back in action after so long. While it has its similarities to its predecessor and not all the characters are all that great, the spirit and thematic qualities that characterized the first film still remain present, complete with the lovely family of before growing and the animation and action scenes looking better than ever. If you're a fan of the first film or Pixar in general, I highly recommend viewing this worthy entertainment that packs enough thrills and character development for the whole family. At the end of the day, I can officially say that I am satisfied after the 14 year wait for this film, and it will definitely remain a stand out family film like its predecessor, even if I still prefer that more.",8,1,3,18 June 2018
Donnie Darko," I Can Understand the Cult Status
","In 2001, filmmaker Richard Kelly released his directorial debut, Donnie Darko. Despite underperforming on its original release, it did well enough on home video to gain a cult following, whilst also getting critically acclaimed at the same time. Unfortunately, Kelly has never made anything on the same level of cultural status as this film, and this remains his most popular project to date. As for what I think of it, while I do get the appeal of this film, I personally just find it to be ok.Probably the best aspect of Donnie Darko is the suspense, as it details the misadventures of a troubled teenaged boy who seeks the purpose behind these doomsday-related visions from a creepy looking bunny. As the film focuses on Donnie's struggles, we see just how emotionally distraught he becomes from the real world, yet it's not hard to see where he comes from through his imagination. In addition, the people around him who get affected by his unorthodox behavior, such as gym teacher Mrs. Farmer and motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, provide great contrasts in personalities and views on the world, giving some much needed pathos. The rest of the supporting cast are more of a mix. Some like Donnie's psychotherapist Dr. Thurman, friend Gretchen, teachers Dr. Monnitoff and Karen Pomeroy, and his own mother give much needed advice and logos to him whilst being unaware of Donnie's problems (besides Thurman). Others like Donnie's father and sisters, friends and rivals are mainly just there for the most part, though some don't play much importance until later on in the film. With all of this said, I would've preferred a little less of the additional character's time, as they come off as more like filler than anything else. Also, there are some weird edits here and there that make the film come off as a little wonky rather than visually pleasing, but that's just me.Truth be told, I actually don't know what else to say about Donnie Darko. While I admire it for its originality, concepts and creepiness, I also find it a little confusing for my tastes. That being said, I totally get why many people have gravitated towards this film, as it presents the point of view from an emotionally wrecked teenager with strange mental dilemmas that they can relate to. So while I was a tad underwhelmed by the film as a whole, I nevertheless recommend the film to teens who are in love with dark stories and macabre fantasies. Or maybe the director's cut is slightly better, who knows?",6,2,3,26 August 2018
