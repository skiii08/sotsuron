Casablanca," Over-hyped
","For years and years (I'm 52), I've always heard how great this movie is. I've really never gotten into old movies a whole bunch, so I've never seen Bogart much at all. SO - it was time to finally watch it.Yawn... For starters, Bogart just wasn't that good of an actor. Scream and cry all you want, but that's an unbiased fact. Secondly, the story line was about as average as you could get. Finally, I seriously had trouble staying awake in this one. Cannot for the life of me see what so many others see in it.A sad disappointment. I'll give it a 4, as I honestly would have to say it's slightly below average...",4,11,20,15 February 2017
The Caine Mutiny," Yeah - this one was good!
","Being a late boomer on old movies, I've recently started watching some of them. I saw 'Casablanca' for the first time about a month ago, and I basically thought it sucked. It was boring, and IMO, Bogart's acting in that movie just wasn't very good.I'd always heard about how this one was a great movie, though I was worried that Bogart's acting would be sub-par in it as well. In short - I feared another 'Casablanca'.Boy was I wrong!THIS was a great movie. Bogie really did deliver the goods in this one, and though it wasn't a huge part, Jose Ferrer was absolutely nails. Great acting in the rest of it as well, and it was a surprise to me to see Fred MacMurray play the part of a loser.Probably would have given it a 10 had it not been for the few strays of Keith's love life, and the toy ship in the typhoon was a little bit silly - but hey - it was 1954, so they did what they could.Great, great movie.",9,1,5,27 February 2017
