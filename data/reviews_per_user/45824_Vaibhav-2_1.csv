Requiem for a Dream," A very disturbing movie
","Darren Aronofsky puts you inside an Addict. You are thrown into the world of an addict and you find it horrible, when decency, self-control, honor - human traits, jettison and a scary and pathetic residue remains.Substance abuse, voluntary and involuntary have been depicted, not to entertain but to scare the viewer s*&#less. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connely perform excellently, but the pathos of Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb is gut-wrenching. To see this movie is experience the turmoil of an addict, all you will feel is pity.",10,0,0,27 May 2001
