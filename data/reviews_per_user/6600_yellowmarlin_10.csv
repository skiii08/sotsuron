Minority Report," Superb premise, competent execution
","The premise of Minority Report is one of the greatest of all time. Very few match it, or even come close. The execution is excellent, as you would expect from Steven Spielberg, but not perfect. There are a number of plot loopholes and leaps of faith, a couple of suspensions of disbelief required, and Tom Cruise's performance borders on scenery chewing at times, but this is still an eminently watchable and thoroughly entertaining movie. Watch it for Samantha Morton's performance alone.",8,0,0,23 June 2020
A Star Is Born," Massively disappointing
","Completely failed to live up to the hype. The acting is fine and the singing is good, although the songs are a mixed bunch, but the story itself is tired and unoriginal. 
Surely, if you're going to make a remake of a remake it will be because you're got something new to say. Perhaps there was a lofty initial notion to comment on the price of fame, or on how banal manufactured pop stars are but, if so, that voice got lost along the way; much like Ally's did. 
I quite enjoyed the start but the slow pacing, monotonous gravelly voices and hackneyed story made me grateful for the ending, when it finally arrived.",5,253,481,2 October 2018
Aquaman," Aquameh
","It's alright. Some bits were good, some bits were boring, some bits were fun, some bits were silly. I wouldn't be rushing to watch it again. I liked Mera, Orm and Black Manta.",6,2,4,16 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Astounding
","Spike Lee has achieved the improbable with this movie. It is simultaneously entertaining and powerful, of its time and contemporary, moving and very, very relevant. The references to Trump's corrupt and incompetent regime and how it has permitted white supremacists to crawl back out from under their stinking rocks again in modern day America are not subtle, but pack a punch. The final scenes are particularly hard-hitting.",9,7,13,6 September 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Send shivers down my spine
","Hugely enjoyable. It's certainly not perfect; the influence of Brian May and Roger Taylor can be felt at times when scenes start to feel a bit rose-tinted, but Rami Malek superbly portrays the lonely, conflicted, tortured genius that was Freddie Mercury. Gwylim Jones, Ben Hardy, Joe Mazzello and Lucy Boynton are all excellent too and the music, of course, rocks!",9,18,29,24 October 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Perfection!
",I couldn't have imagined a better conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga. This movie has everything and hits all the right emotional beats along the way. I can't wait to see it again!,10,1,5,26 April 2019
The Favourite," Firing blanks
","This film promised much but delivered very little. It looks great; the three central performances are all excellent, and the cinematography, costuming and locations are all superb, although the score is a little jarring at times. Sadly, the entire edifice is a house of cards, built on the shaky foundations of a vague and unfocused script. Too many scenes add little to the plot, which advances in lurches reliant on the characters of Sarah (Weisz) and Abigail (Stone) doing inexplicable and self-destructive things for no obvious purpose other than to bring about their own downfalls. Anne (Colman) is supposed to be the unpredictable and mercurial character, but hers is actually the most consistent. This movie is best summed up by the scene in which one character fires an unloaded pistol at another, describing it as a great jest that they must find a use for later. They never do.",5,2,6,2 January 2019
The Shape of Water," A Beautiful Fairy Tale
","One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Ostensibly a Cold War era science fiction monster movie set in 1960s Baltimore, it is, in actuality, an allegorical fairy tale aimed at exposing the puritanical, conservative Roy at the heart of America. The white Judeo-Christian alpha male, the hero of most movies, is the villain of the piece, intolerant of difference, domineering towards women, belittling of subordinates. The heroes are the woman with a disability, the woman of colour, the gay man, the foreigner and the (rather extreme example of the) outsider. The comparison between toxic masculinity and female sexuality is also presently beautifully.
As always on IMDb, the one and two star reviews can be ignored; the ignorant bigots of the anti-PC brigade can always be relied upon to lash out at anything that offends their blinkered views.",10,3,14,26 April 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Almost, but not quite
","This is a really enjoyable movie. The story, the characters and the actors are all great, but it unfortunately falls apart towards the end and indulges in silliness and excessive violence. Such a shame.",8,1,3,15 October 2018
Green Book," Virtuoso film making
",Best film of the awards season so far. The central performances by Mortensen and Ali are exquisite and the movie itself is a delight; a bittersweet mix of odd couple comedy and racial drama.,9,2,3,1 February 2019
