United 93," Paul and Barry, kudos.
","Another astonishing achievement by Paul Greengrass. In his unique documentary-style way, Paul leads us on a journey that we all know the outcome to, yet manages to completely submerge us in the story. I found myself at times rooting for the passengers and hoping they'd prevail even though I knew better. That's how compelling this film was for me. As a jaded film professional, I have to say that this really doesn't happen all that often.Additionally, I have to make mention of the outstanding work by my colleague (in arms) Barry Ackroyd who photographed this picture. It takes a lot of discipline and focus to create an artificial sense of reactive camera work as he did in this film. I know Paul Greengrass is known for barring camera crews from blocking and rehearsals, then bringing them in to shoot off the cuff in order to preserve a certain honesty in the camera work, and this really translates an earnestness into the camera work. As a trained professional, I have to comment on how exceedingly difficult it is to discipline yourself to allow your guys to break all the rules. Absolutely flawless, Barry. My deepest respect (I really enjoyed 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' also). Kudos all around.And finally, to the VFX guys that created the exteriors to the airplane, your work was flawless and you should be proud.All in all an outstanding achievement. You all deserve every accolade.",9,2,3,24 June 2007
Spider-Man," Raimi does it again
","Big Hype, big promises, delayed release, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker in a huge miscast...I wanted it to be good, but didn't have great expectations.Then two words like a beacon in the fog:Sam Raimi.In the best comic book adaptation to date, Raimi dispels every qualm I had about this film.  It delivers on the hype, and Tobey Maguire was absolutely perfect.  This is an amazing film in a genre that only the boldest attempt, and usually fail.  Until now, I thought X-Men was the best adaptation of a comic book.  Spidey blows it out of the water.The film is thoughtful, true to its origins in most respects (the web glands, I thought, were acceptable), action-packed, and most of all, full of the subtle humanities that only Sam Raimi can bring to his characters. Congratulations to Sam and to Don Burgess and everyone on the cast and crew on a job well done.  Your film reaches audiences on a level far more sophisticated than any other Marvel (or DC) adaptation to date.  Your accolades are well deserved.  It has been a long time since I have been to a film that ended in applause.Thank you for a wonderful evening.  I look forward eagerly to the second.",Null,0,0,5 May 2002
The Princess Bride," makes it all worthwhile
","In a world that every day becomes more mired in tragedy, from selfish acts of terror to crippling natural disasters, it becomes increasingly difficult to believe that what I do matters. How can one take any pride in making movies while people offer their lives to help others?Then, once in a while, I read comments like those about this picture. As I run down the list, I see the many ways in which this picture has touched the lives of so many of you, on so many levels. Here is a story that is truly priceless in its timelessness, a movie that really did make a difference, a movie that reaches so broadly that it embraces virtually everyone. A picture that gives so much to its audience. This picture succeeds in taking us away to another place, a place of innocence and nobility, of honour and love; a place that grows ever distant from us. For that, Rob Reiner and William Goldman, thank you. For the last eighteen years of having this picture to escape to, thank you.But most importantly, for restoring my faith in the importance of this business, thank you. I only hope I can contribute to something as meaningful somewhere along the way.",10,1,2,17 September 2005
Signs," Night Shyamalan continues to impress
","I have waited eagerly for Shyamalan's next effort, having been slightly disillusioned with 'Unbreakable' and its similarities to 'The Sixth Sense'. In 'Signs', however, Shyamalan has moved on and delivered on the promise of the depth of his talent.In trailers, the film presents itself as an invasion movie along the lines of 'Independence Day'; a farmer notices crop circles and then disbelievingly discovers that they are appearing all over the world in similar fashion. Sounds pretty run-of-the-mill.  Was Shyamalan about to succumb to the big-budget blockbuster and sacrifice the intricacy in plot that he has become known for? Not a chance.  He weaves the alien story into the background as we witness a man's struggle with his faith.  Don't get me wrong; there are moments when you can see daylight under people's seats; it's just that Shyamalan has made this film into so much more.He has rediscovered Hitchcockian suspense.  This is not a film about blatant horror; it touches you in a deeper way and fills you with dread.  This is the essence of this type of cinema.  The audience is far more capable of scaring itself; only you know your real fears and only you can truly scare yourself. Shyamalan simply pokes the fire a little, with elegant simplicity.  The result is a film that has moments of terror only dreamed of by the guys with the big effects budgets.He has managed to tell the story with characters that react the same way many of us would, and with scattered moments of very subtle humour, come to life. Here lies the strength in Shyamalan's work; his character development. He understands which aspects of his characters' humanity are important, and which are unimportant, and weaves the audience into their lives in a way few others can.I thought the aliens were well done.  Not knowing myself what an invading alien should look like, I was more than willing to accept Shyamalan and ILM'sinterpretation.  It worked for me.As for comments about black screen and nothing but sound effects and dark lighting (by Tak Fujimoto, ASC, one of the most well-respected living DPs in cinema), these things are the keys to suspense cinema.  The deprivation of information is far more effective than the proliferation of effects.  If you still have to ask, you just wouldn't get it.  Buy yourself a copy of ID4 and watch it with all the lights on.This is a remarkable piece of filmmaking by one of Hollywood's truly talented emerging directors.  Congratulations on some very good work.  You too, everyone in the cast.  Your performances deserve recognition.",10,0,1,4 August 2002
