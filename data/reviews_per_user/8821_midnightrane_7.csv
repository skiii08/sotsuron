Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Take it for what it is...
","A great, light-hearted ride that enriches the originals and features one of the wildest villains in recent history. The movie is filled with inside jokes (although that can exclude non-fans)--did anybody else get it when Obi-Wan says, 'I have a bad feeling about this.'? He's the only major character that doesn't say that in the first 3. I think everyone expected a rousing triumph like the first film, and when that wasn't delivered, some folks got disappointed. Hey, when the main character is a kid--have you ever worked with kids? (much as I love 'em) I know most of the original fan base liked it, but not everybody else...consider what's to come in the next 2...this one needed to be more farcical--quit trying to tilt it as a movie not as good as 'Star Wars' and enjoy it for the wonderful escape that it is...this is one film I think will only be appreciated in retrospect. The scenery is jaw-dropping, Maul is fabulously scary, the Jedi light-sabre battles pale the original hand-to-hand combat scenes and the pod-race is exciting (Ben-Hur or no Ben-Hur). It's a fantastic movie--it's just not 'Star Wars', but it's not supposed to be. 9/10.",9,1,2,20 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 2 out of 3 ain't bad...
","The only one of the original 3 that I consider slightly below par. Still an excellent movie and far better than most of the standard fare of today, but slightly less accomplished than New Hope or Empire. Ewoks just don't do it for me...the score is still great and it provides resolution to the world's best movie trilogy (or sextet now, I guess). I couldn't stand the new 'end theme' that the 'special edition' showcased. Stick with the originals (all best on the big screen)...has Lucas agreed to arrange for an all day/every day 'Star Wars' movies theatre in his will yet? 9/10.",9,0,0,20 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Incredible...
","My two cents: Awesome! I'll try to let that be my summary contribution to the growing list of well-deserved one-word accolades for this film. Everything has been pored over in minute detail so it's not necessary to reiterate. I won't relay the story or plot because there are so many well-written recaps already (and you need to read the books anyway). I'll just say that I have been a Tolkien fan for 20 years...and this visual interpretation was worth the wait...that should say it all. The acting was above par, the SFX nearly seamless (arguably the best ever), the music moving and appropriate and the editing (considering the mammoth source work) was superior and far better than I anticipated. The (relatively) minor changes and omissions bothered me little. The one and only thing I truly missed was the conflict and blossoming bond between Gimli and Legolas. Alas, it is small worry in comparison to the spellbinding overall effect. The film maintained it's wonder even under the scrutiny of a second (and much more analytical) viewing. Suffice it to say that my wife and brother, both of whom have never read the books, nor cared to, were fascinated and kept me up until nearly 1 AM for Tolkien Q&A. Both now desire to read the books and have begun the fantastic journey of exploring Middle-Earth.  10/10 for the most accomplished adaptation in movie history, in my opinion. Thank you Peter Jackson and ALL the hard workers (extras, wranglers, techs, carpenters, farmers, etc.) who labored long to bring to inspiring fruition the dreams of little boys the world over.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Magic carpet unravels
","This movie, based on the book of the same name, starts a wee bit too sluggish, features some nice special effects in the later half and gets downright cheesy and predictable at the end. It relays the story of a young lad who discovers he has untold abilities in the art of wizardry and builds thereon with the process of his schooling in said talent. The character development is way too slow in portions and non-existent in others--unless you've read the book, you don't have much chance of knowing who they're talking about, considering they have such weird names. It has moments of neatness ('sorting hat', 'moving stairwells', etc.), but you never feel immersed in the 'Hogwarts' world. I got the vibe they should have either totally hammed it up or made it quite a bit more gritty. Alas, it appears yet another novel couldn't be properly consolidated into a film format. Still, the kiddies will probably love it and it could have been much worse, although it is a bit too long--I kept checking my watch.",6,0,1,21 November 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," 'Welcome home George Bailey!'
","It really is a wonderful life, isn't it? How could someone not think so after watching this? One of the few movies that is guaranteed to make a grown man cry, 'Wonderful Life' is a staple of the Holiday season around my home. Truly uplifting, very nearly epic in it's message and scope and one of the few unadulterated tear-jerkers, it looks to remain a staple of every new generation. Among Jimmy Stewart's many grand performances, his every-man, uncelebrated hero in 'Wonderful Life' is probably his best loved. To describe this movie is pointless--if you haven't seen it, do--if you have, see it again. 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot...'",10,1,5,20 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not so long ago...in a movie theatre near you...
","What can you say? This is the movie the ol' 'silver screen' was made for...planet-breaking effects, incredible music, good vs. evil, the total package. I was lucky enough for it to be one of the first movies I ever saw and still enjoy watching it. You really can't understand or argue it's effects on the movie industry unless you lived through it--even if you hate it--if you like one single sci-fi, western, action, adventure, fantasy, or epic movie that has come out since it's debut, then you need to tip your helmet to 'Star Wars'. I won't argue it's validity, it's place in history, it's 'borrowing', etc., etc.--it speaks for itself in all those aspects. I just want to give it my 10/10 and say 3 things: 1) The 'special editions' are not as good as the originals (Empire is the only one that has any real improvement) 2) They are still as good as they were 20 years ago and 3) Seeing it on the 'big screen' is so different, it's almost like seeing a different movie. I'm glad they put them back in, even if it was with the new effects (which I don't hate, I just don't think are as good as the originals), so a whole new generation of kids (of all ages) could enjoy them in the way they were intended. There should be a theatre somewhere that only shows the Star Wars movies...all day...every day. May the force be with you...always...",10,0,0,20 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," AT-ATs ROCK...
","The Imperial Walkers approaching the Hoth Base is the greatest opening scene in the history of sci-fi/action/epics. Empire is nearly as good as the first and the score is equally good. It remains my 2nd 'most watched' movie and probably always will. This, in my opinion, is probably the only one of the 3 originals to benefit from the 'special editions'. The 'Wampa' scenes are much improved. Incredible on the big screen. There should be a movie house somewhere that only shows Star Wars movies...all day...every day. Maybe Lucas could put that in his will? What do you think? I give it 10/10.",10,0,0,20 November 2001
