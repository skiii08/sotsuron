The Avengers," Always disappointing.
","It seems like besides Nolan's Batman and The Punisher, I am doomed to never appreciate the dull action/super hero films that seem to sweep the film world and produce millions of misguided teen action junkies. This would be a gem for cinema experience of huge 200 inch TV's but there is a reason these films never gain academy awards genuine ground breaking respect aside from budget and ratings. The point of this review is just an opinionated rant to quarrel with the repetitive plots and average performances that people seem to just eat up and refuse to expand fantastic cinema experience because they're long and to them 'boring' I can state what's boring, A hero is at the height of their average power, suddenly they encounter an ability or change that makes them more powerful and nearly worshiped (Iron Man, Thor, Cpt America, Batman, Spiderman) Now a girl or love interest that comes along and makes them vulnerable or around the time where they become vulnerable because typically, these films have to take their powers away. (Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Batman, Spiderman, Wolverine and Superman) Now they are usually hated at this point because they can't protect the masses or their loved ones or are just in doubt if they should pick up their dusty war torn mantle. (Iron Man, Batman, Hulk and Wolverine) And the bad guy is defeated, the girl is usually saved except poor old batman. (Wolverine, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Hulk.) DO you see where I am leading too? Do people like watching the same stuff just wearing a different cape? (metaphore for the smarties out there)I am a fan of Kurbick, Tarentino, Del Toro (whoops I am a Hellboy fan), Scorsese, Finch, Mendes, Aronofsky, Eastwood and Anderson fan among others, and I know the guidelines between a film for fun and a film for what is described as 'moving art' or groundbreaking visual emotion and plot. Oh for a suggestion for some pretty slick action films that have earned respect, try Leon the Professional, Heat, Bunraku and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Black Comedy as well)",3,12,24,12 December 2013
This Is the End," Hype killed the beast.
","After being hounded by a friend to watch this movie for a couple of weeks I gave in and watched it with him last night on the heels of McGruber, a film I'll never tire of that supplements the perfect humor for its genre of comedy. This is the End was sadly, a disappointment. A stellar cast of some great funny guys, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Michael Cera. Thankfully James Franco, an actor I prefer in his dramas, was a highlight like his other comedy dishes, Pineaplle Express and Your Higness. Main casted Jonah Hill,m Seth Rogan and typically Jay Baruchel, were, in my opinion, horribly bad and should probably never go without a script as some obvious improvisation scenes dragged to the point of painful. Anyway, here's the plot. Set as themselves, the six mains are set to live it up at Francos art decor super house with the arrival of Jay, Seth's seemingly good friend and fellow Candianlite. Things go bad to worse as the party falls through, this is a pun as a giant hole from Hell appears in the ground in front of Francos home as he hosts LA's apocalypse to massively erected demons to hell hounds and an axe wielding Emma Watson. It was a shame for myself as the jokes were endless but just were too weak, generic or perhaps not to my style. Most Danny Mcbride, Craig Robinson and Emma Watson scenes were by far the highlight of the film. I also found the gags best worked when bounced around by some of the acts but nearly none really was as hyped up to be. I give This is the End a 6/10",6,0,3,3 March 2014
The Hunger Games," 17.
","The Hunger Games, both film and novel have garned massive attention and fandom, was it really worth it though? I think not. I understand movies are fun and adventurous, but they are also harrowing, emotional and riveting. What Hunger Games was supposed to be in the book, was not on the screen. The novel, also written for teens and an audience with a certain limited vocabulary, fell victim to plain and tasteless, everything. So was the Hunger Games doomed from the start? The idea, though used before, had a its own twist of use. The Hunger Games is set in the near future in the Americas, now divided into poverty stricken nations where the right hand and flamboyant aristocrats of the Citedel nation act like baying Roman crowds and demand a yearly penance for the other nations uprising. The penance? Each nation selects 2 representatives in a cruel lottery of bloodsport, called The Reaping. The 'lucky' selectees are transported to the Citedal to represent their districts to fight each other to the death where one may only win. Pretty cool idea but with poor penmanship and even worse directing the idea and the emotional drive was sapped of the film. We are offered completely useless scenes that could have only been supported by other plots and focus but were removed, forcing the film to its knees. Roo's death was useless and lacking complete emotion. The whole idea of starving, seething districts was made redundant with no screen time and the bittersweet romance between Katniss and Peta was superficial and cosmetic. I give The Hunger Games a 3/10 as it was faithless to the novel and as a film.",3,3,5,13 March 2014
Thor," The Same Boring Thing with a new cape.
","I could write this post on nearly any popular super hero page but I chose Thor because this was the film that made me want to throw in the towel with these films when I had finally lost all interest in the Marvel and DC films. I will say that I am a fan of Hell Boy, The first 'The Punisher' and 'Batman' (Christopher Nolan's) as I'm a big fan of Memento and The Dark Knight was faultless. I see these films as just huge eye candy that's only skin deep and will never submerge deeper, leaving this disappointing, rotten skin that something truly heroic could have been produced. I think some fans will say Marvel and DC comic films are 'amazing' and 'awesome' because of the brand itself, not really questioning if it really was unique or outstanding. The films I enjoy (mainly Indie and Foreign of late) may be hyped up because of the cult following. I'm a fan of a strong scipt and driven acting and can't be really pleased with a film for it's grapthics if whats really important doesn't follow through. I digress. Here are some reasons that support my claim. Wolverine, Iron Man, Spiderman, Thor, Superman and The Hulk; all are characters that have superpowers or unlimited amount of power at hand and are nearly unchallengeable to begin with. Some, they have a lot of fans, others don't, but soon when stripped of their powers, usually at the behest of a girl/love interest, exploited by a nemeses, are cast out and stripped of their powers. When this happens, we the audience can sympathize with them and not be awed by their powers that we don't posses. Now the love interest turns around and gives them strength and purpose and they gain their powers back and kick arse and save the day and are finally accepted by whoever they wanted to be accepted by. Does this sound familiar? It's just recycled story and I don't know what's more disturbing, that this is still continuing for profit or people are still enjoying such wacthing the same thing their spoon feeding themselves with. I do like a good hero tale but I prefer vigilantes, V for Vendetta- Kick Ass- Batman(sort of) and The Punisher or people with personnel grudges.",3,1,3,2 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Hammer can't break the anvil.
","I wanted to give this sequel a shot as the two attempts I tried with the first movie failed miserably to please but I had heard from a friend that this one is different, I know not how.. From the beginning we have a poor plot, like most Marvel movies. For some reasons, Dark futuristic space Elves want to wipe out the world that they failed eons ago. Taking too much out of the great battle of the Lord The Rings, the Elves are broken and exiled, promising to return with a weapon to destroy and rule all life *cough one ring* Meanwhile somewhere else in the space time spectrum, Thor and his clich√© mundane battle brethren who seem as out of place as the swords and axes with their stupid cross over space ships, grenades and guns, are waging war with other.. things not explained. Returning after certain victory with Thor on their side, our Northen hero in space gets an itch that tells him that whats her face, Jane I think, comes into danger by stupidly touching an alien and obviously evil substance. Oddly enough she isn't abducted by a secret American syndicate, something I thought was definitely going to happen with this plot but alas, it's more simple. Jane is brought to Valhalla as they are the ones to remove said evil substance where we are sadly subjected to Hokins horrible over acting( a shame), Loki being as ordinary as ever( really we have seen this character in a lot of movies, The black sheep of the ruling family intent on taking it over) Loki is in jail, Loki is suddenly not in jail, fight between siblings, more fights, more fights in more stupid sword and gun cross overs, fights on Earth and some professor without pants, obviously a Stan lee cameo ( the only laugh) and more fighting with a nice little boring love moment, all wrapped up in a foreseeable and weak excuse for a plot twist. Pretty visuals... that's really about it that's worth it. I was sad to see Chris D in it. I really just wish movies with such a huge budget put money to novels or more thought out comics with better plots and less stupid content.Thor had great visuals, Decent enough typical blockbuster action and an Australian. 3/10",3,3,4,26 April 2014
Her," Dare
","Spike Jone's 'Her' is probably my favorite movie to be released last year and the best I've watched this year aside from 'Detachement'. Finally a film to really dare to breach the gap of right and wrong and enter the murky waters of the reality that love does not solely belong to a man and a women or not attached to a physical body of another. Recent years have come to accept the more abstract circles and attachments of 'love' and 'desire' towards people that never existed. We have come to a synthetic age where we are captivated by anime and feeling drawn to strangers over the internet who may not be who they say they are. 'Her'raises the idea, is it right to love and become so intimate with someone that isn't really there? But Jones already has the conclusion from the get go. 'It doesn't even matter when we are in love.' This is the golden rule and I love how this is capitalized in 'Her' 'Her' follows Theodore(Phoenix) a closed off, introverted writer who's job is to write letters concerning touchy matters to others for them. In the near future of our modern time, Theodre is living a dismal life in the wake of his divorce with old flame Cathrine(Mara)where his only apparent friends are his work colleagues and Amy(Adems) who lives just down the hall. Fate would have it soon that by chance, Theodore passes an add for the newest artificial intelligence program, captivated by it, he takes a chance and boots it up to his computer by following some basic psych questions, typically centered around his mother.. soon Smantha,husky Johansson, 's comes through and we, the viewer are on the best third wheel time of our lives as we bask in the love and companionship between one man and the voice he falls in love with. 'Her' follows a predictable but in no way shape or form, boring story arc between the love, laugh and struggles of Theodore and Samantha, his operating system best friend and lover. The fantastic thing about this movie is that if you allow yourself to believe it, which would be easy, is that Jones's well scripted and shot film, reinforced with driving force by Phoenix and Johansson, breaks the fourth wall without even addressing the viewer as we are just come to appreciate the times that these two share. Their relationship feels so organic and so rich that the viewer would feel jealous it is so riveting to watch but as all relationships, they have struggles and once again, the film never drops the ball as the occurrences feel like something so natural, I did not at once feel like it was unbelievable and was in the realm that Jonze placed it in. Brilliant stuff. 10/10",10,0,2,24 May 2014
