Minority Report," Could it be a Screenplay Problem?
","*spoilers*Minority report was an okay movie for the first while.  The last act really bombed.  Why?  I suspect it had to do with a hasty screenplay rewrite.  I'll bet anything that in the original draft of the screenplay, the man in the hotel room (Crow) really was the man who abducted our hero's son, he is shot dead on purpose, and the movie ends darkly.  Spielberg could not allow such a dark ending, so he ordered a hasty screenplay rewrite that tacks on an absurd fourth act, complete with jarring plotholes.  Think about it. If the movie ended in the hotel room, without the lame conspiracy plot, all this movie's plotholes would be gone.  This is just another example of the way that Hollywood wrecks movies.  You couldn't possibly have a mainstream summer blockbuster if the main character was actually a murderer.  If the movie stars a criminal and has a sad ending, it would make less money.  Mom, Pop, little Billy and Spot wouldn't understand that.  They don't like criminals.  They like happy endings.  So it's worth it to ruin the story by adding a poorly thought out and overly long fourth act.  It's disgusting.  Yet another symptom of what's wrong with America.",2,6,10,14 March 2003
As Good as It Gets," This movie gives hope to ugly old men
","Well, I think this movie was pretty good. But it really got me thinking.  I know it is a favourite Hollywood trick to cast a leading man with an attractive woman half his age as the love interest.  This movie does not disappoint- Jack was 60 when this movie came out, and Helen was 34. Seeing as this movie was pretty good, and the lead male was double the love interest's age, logically, if a theoretical movie came out where the lead male's age was triple the love interest's, it would be even BETTER!  Or how about quadruple?  Or quintuple? Here's a pitch for a new movie.  It's called 'Better Than it Gets,' and it stars Bob Hope and Natalie Portman.  At first, they don't get along, because Bob keeps telling her how fat and ugly she is.  But then, as a gesture of affection, he butts his cigar out in her eye, and she falls in love with him.  How about it, Hollywood?",Null,0,0,9 October 1999
