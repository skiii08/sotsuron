Casablanca," Casablanca
","What can be said that has not already been said about this film for the ages? Allstar cast made up of the usual subjects...Bogie, Sydney, Peter (also together in 'Maltese Falcon'). Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa never looked better...she is absolutely perfect for the time and place. Sam, the Coupier, the bartender, the waiter, and of course Louie, generate the same electricity, heart, soul, in this one magical blend as we have seen in long running sitcoms like 'Taxi', 'Mash', and especially 'Cheers'. You will want to see it over and over again. A movie the entire family can watch, no censorship needed. It grabs you from the opening narration and doesn't let go...The ending is a classic. 'Casablanca' and you; The start of a beautiful friendship.",10,3,4,23 September 2006
