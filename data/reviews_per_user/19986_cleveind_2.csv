Lucky Number Slevin," may have spoilers!
","This really was an amazing movie. I've read a few other comments and I don't exactly agree with them. Yea, Hartnett didn't fit the character of what the viewer is Supposed to believe about him at first. He was putting on an act inside his acting career if you get what I'm saying. Once you understand his true identity, his previous goofy, ignorant character ties into the plot...therefore, making the whole plot ingenious. If anyone loves the classic films of the 30s through 50's of true film noir, then you will absolutely love this movie. Twists like film noir x 10...along with witty dialog. It was actually a pretty funny movie too. Hartnett plays such a smart-ass, so there's bound to be some funny stuff i guess. read some of the quotes on here if you want a preview i guess.",10,1,7,27 April 2006
Shakespeare in Love," soon to be classic
","Shakespeare in Love is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. The filming style is unique and the scenes are extremely witty which anyone could catch if they knew anything about Will Shakespeare. The role of Shakespeare could not have been cast any better. Joseph Fiennes did an excellent job. After that performance, he became my most favorite actor. Gweyneth Paltrow was also equally amazing. The story was much more of a comedy than i would have believed. As sad as this sounds, I've probably seen this movie at least 15 times. If you like Shakespeare of a good laugh/drama, then this is the perfect movie. There are very few movies i would give a ten lol but this one surely deserves it! Go watch it!",10,0,0,7 July 2005
