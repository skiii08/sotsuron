Blade Runner 2049," Fake Reviews are propping this disaster up
","This movie was just awful in so many ways. I had a very hard time staying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely slow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was watching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless scenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have been told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it would have been a lot better. The main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line took a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The story was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and meaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it was over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of their minds. Character development was next to non existent with the exception of a few scenes that pretended to develop the main character. Since I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was for the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with the horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give. My last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few movies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up wasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are fake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating this garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves looking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it. Other than that it would take a seriously unique kind of person to think this movie was decent, much less good.",1,54,114,8 October 2017
Creed," Left me feeling empty and the forced and misplaced dialogue ruined it for me
","I still have a gamut of emotions watching Rocky 1,2,3 and 4 but this one left me wondering why it was so highly rated. I was not moved emotionally at all. The dialogue felt awkward and misplaced at times and forced at others. The first four movies were so well done that it seems like those things really happened. It is forever printed on my memory. I still sing songs from those Rocky movies all these years later. I am already forgetting much of this movie and I saw it last week. I can't even remember a single song from it. It really is that bad. I never thought it would be possible to make a 'Rocky' movie worse than Rocky 5 but this one was worse. There were a few things that could have made it much better. Perhaps the relationship with young Creed's mom could have been played out more and the relationship she had with his father capitalized on. Perhaps some flashbacks of Apollo, Rocky, Adrian and Paulie could have been used. This, as others are saying, seems to be an attempt to remake the original Rocky movie with different characters and more of an African American slant. Without giving anything away, they try to imitate the scene where Rocky runs through Philly with a big crowd running behind him in support and it turns out extremely cheesy to say the least. As a huge rocky fan I was hoping for a great movie. It was not a terrible movie but a huge let down and nothing compared to the first four Rocky movies.",5,49,94,6 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," Entertainment for a mentally ill culture that is sick and demented
","I knew very little about Tarantino so I had no idea what I was getting into. After researching a little deeper, after being extremely disturbed watching this movie, I found his expertise seems to be in entertaining people who love to see humans tortured, dismembered, exploded, etc. What amazes me the most is that we live in a culture in which many love this kind of thing. This is beyond violence or even horror. It is simply a demented mind feeding other demented minds who have a thirst for the most gruesome and sick violence imaginable. This should not be rated R. It should have its own rating created for it that is much worse than R.",1,147,318,29 December 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Shockingly Terrible!
","I was shocked at how bad this movie was. My family had been anticipating its release for almost a year. My teenage daughter spent her own money buying a superman outfit just for the movie. My wife, who normally could care less about superhero movies, was more than willing to go. My youngest daughter had talked about it for hours. Then the big moment arrived and we all had a very hard time staying awake for the first hour of it. All of us had a least one short nap. Finally after an hour with almost no action, even less real character development and zero cohesive story line, we got to see a little bit of action. It woke us up on the outside but not on the inside. I kept thinking this must be a three hour movie because something cohesive is going to take place but it never did and suddenly the movie was over with an ending that was as horrible as the first hour. We all left the theater scratching our heads and wondering how it was possible to mess this movie up as bad as it was messed up. My kids felt like many of their peers could have done a better job writing and directing it and I tended to agree with them.",3,2,7,26 March 2016
