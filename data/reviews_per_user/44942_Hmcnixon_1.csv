Mission: Impossible III," Best one yet
",At first I was a little skeptic to see the movie I don't know at first I thought it was going to be an alright movie but after watching it I sort of felt bad for doubting the movie after seeing the movie I thought the movie was awesome due to the fact that It took this long to make it is understandable I can't believe Cruise fractured a few ribs while making the Bridge seen and if this is a spoiler to some people then I'm sorry but other than that the movie was awesome and if you haven't seen it then you are missing out and pay attention to the movie because I think if you get distracted by something you could miss a good part.,10,4,8,8 May 2006
