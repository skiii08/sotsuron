Scarface," Sports cars, cocaine and excess; the 80s
","'Scarface' tells the brutal story of Tony Montana who rises to become a leader in drug distribution from being a Cuban immigrant to Florida. He despises to be told what to think and owes nothing to no one. Living his life to exceed excess he lose touch with people. Or he has no from the beginning rather.Al Pacino gives his best role here, never weak, snorting blow from left to right, saying **** about 200 times... Music by Moroder captures the spirit perfectly and builds under the moods. Screenplay by Stone and direction by De Palma works very well.Maybe the best movie of the 80's and a better gangster epos than 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather'.",9,3,6,8 June 2005
My Neighbor Totoro," Good for small kids and parents alike
","The respectively 4 and 8 year old Mei and Satsuki move with their father to the countryside of Saitama while the mother is in hospital. They find out that they live nearby a giant totoro.Its so great to see that this type of anime gets recognition in the west in the flood of violent ones. This is peaceful, humane and depicts real people instead of the Disney variety of sugarcoated tales. Hayao Miyazaki has made some terrific anime for kids that would not offend a grown up either. I discovered it just a few years ago and I thoroughly enjoy 'Future Boy Conan' and 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' for instance.This is also nice, the imagination to come up with nekobus (cat-bus) and the totoro is childlike in a good way. It doesn't have a real story to tell however and that takes it a bit down.And to bathe with your children help give them a natural relationship with their bodies when they grow up and if thats offensive to you, stick with Disney.",7,0,1,27 May 2005
Match Point," People say Woody Allen is back
","But truth is he never went anywhere. Here he goes to London and makes almost a film noir with British actors. The first third establish Jonathan Rhys Meyers character as the poor, but lucky Irish who has gotten into the higher circles of society. Not unlike one Barry Lyndon he does so with a minimum of constraint and effort, growing only desire for the sultry American Scarlett Johanson on the way, that sadly for him is dating his wife's brother. Here the tone is full of rewritten clichés from the classic movies, all tongue in cheek and humorous. Like many other of Woody Allens movies the references are clever and aplenty, repeated viewings may be needed to enjoy all of them.Apart from a slow moving middle part this is an excellent movie, it really picks up the pace so by the end you're left quite satisfied. Recommended.",8,1,2,5 March 2006
Crash," Well intentioned
","'Crash' is about racism, a big cause for conflict, misunderstandings and so on, as seen here between different ethnic groups as well as the more common 'white against non-white' divide. That is important to bring up and much more important to do something with. L.A. was chosen as the backdrop quite wisely as it is one of the most segregated big cities.There is not much wrong with this movie, the trouble is more that its so easy to understand what its about that for an experienced movie-goer its not very rewarding. And Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon are respectively overacting and stone-faced.That the message of this movie is very important and needs to be widely understood is another thing.",4,7,15,5 March 2006
The Way Back," The loooong way back
","Some convicts escape from a gulag in the middle of Sibiria. One of the jail guards said that the Siberian was the real prison, so this tale is how to get out of that prison.Essentially this has a very weak story, it is about the hardships they encounter on the way and a few of them fall off, but so what? First they walk to Bajkal, then China, then Tibet, then India, then done.One reason to stay clear of Hollywood for me is that it's bound to have the standard story to appeal to all audiences and in the process not managing to tell anything, but instead pervert the whole experience. This has: evil vs good, romance between main characters, the wise, the weak that fall ... Bah.Peter Weir, you used to be so good!",4,13,28,3 April 2011
Closer," Oh this is soo real
","No its not, this is not close to life at all. At least not to mine. I never had Natalie Portman bending over my face naked. But thats not why I didn't like the movie.What kind of characters are these? Jude Law walks around being the 'clever' and 'smart' misunderstood author, Julia Roberts is the sensitive artist, King Arthur is the perverted misogynist doctor and Natalie Portman is the stripper. It begins OK, but falls totally flat when Julia meets her King in the aquarium. From then on its just one dimensioned nag nag nag shag this orgasm that. For those who think 'Million Dollar Baby' has a lot to say about life.",3,1,3,7 October 2005
Corpse Bride," The least of the Burtons
","With Burton recreating the style of 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' expectations are high. Sadly they are not delivered. It begins swell and well with the preparations for the wedding of the son of a new-rich fish mongers family and the daughter of bankrupt noblemen. He fails doing anything right in front of the parents so he runs away into the forest to practice where something most unfortunate happens. Up till now, check.Next we go to the land of the dead and the style suddenly appeals more to a 12 year old than anyone else. The corpse bride has a worm in her eye sockets and this is the most irritating 'caracter' in an expected movie since Jar Jar Binks. Blah. And the French waiter head, well..Elfman does a good job. Animation is state of the art stop motion. The rest is at worst terrible. Yes there were some spine chilling sequences, but on the whole, disappointment.",4,4,10,30 October 2005
Edward Scissorhands," A nice fairytale with good humour
","In a suburban location where all houses are alike, but in different colour, there is a scary castle on top of a hill where Edward lives all by himself. I don't know how he survived as all he touches with his scissors gets cut, but his hobby it seems is pruning fantastical creatures in the garden. A cosmetics seller finds him and adopts him, the problem is to get the community to accept him..This is a highlight of Burton, Depp and Elfman, each doing one of their most supreme achievements so far. Emotionally, touching, sad and funny this caricatured picture of suburban America is highly engaging. A film fit for family and Christmas.",8,0,0,21 April 2005
Collateral," Mann is the man!
","This was quite the surprise. A super tight film noir coming out of LA for once is not daily (or yearly) routine. I watched 'Heat' while a mere teenager and liked it, but I also liked 'The Rock' and 'Broken Arrow' so I didn't expect that Michael Mann was such a master director. He takes Tom Cruise and a comedy actor, put them in a taxi in L.A. and it turns out as 'Collateral', the best thriller/noir I have seen in a long time. Jamie Foxx is very good as the taxi driver, but Tom Cruise excels as the hit-man. I have never seen him as good as this, he could even take the almighty guv'nors job in 'Terminator' with success with this killers determination.Pictures are very beautiful also even if L.A. is not.",8,1,2,5 March 2006
The Butterfly Effect," Oh this is so bad
","What's happening here? Ashton is crazy. Ashton is not crazy, the world around him is. Don't send me a postcard with the answer, I couldn't care less. This movie is a big mess. It gives you leads in all possible directions and instead of following them up just discards them, now he went mad and then he was just dreaming the whole thing.To top this add the worst lead I can remember, Mr. Ashton Kutchner. He has no charisma, no acting skills or character whatsoever, at least in this movie.'The Butterfly Effect' does have a certain drive to it however, which I can only curse as it made me waste my time with it. I could have looked at growing bamboo instead.",1,3,15,30 March 2006
Alien vs. Predator," One star for the original design of the creatures
","Which was done years ago of people who probably would want no association with this movie whatsoever. Its remarkably how they have managed to take these so perfectly designed horror creatures that has made so many great scares before and turn it into nothing. The action scenes have no impact, the camera-work is laughable and the editing takes away the suspense. About the humans? Well the woman is good looking at least. Mr Lance Henriksen should be ashamed. And I cant understand the point of making the predator so superior to the alien. Actually I thought that the alien would be far stronger and the predator would have to outsmart it. Then again, its a long time since I saw the original movies. Best bet to get some chills and see some proper film-making would be, I guess, to make an alien vs predator night in which you see Scotts 'Alien' original from 1979 and then see the original 'Predator' from 1987 and then discuss who you think would win. Any discussions made after that would prove more interesting than this movie, but what did you expect?",1,3,7,10 April 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Does it deserve all the praise?
","Grand old man Clint Eastwood is highly respected. Its nice to see that he finds time to do unusual films (by Hollywood standards) as he is most definitely talented. But seriously, just because its slow paced, it doesn't mean that it is a masterpiece. The story is full of clichés and underwritten characters. It also has a voice-over by Morgan Freeman, that was really the only thing needed to be given credibility, the same case as with 'Shawshank Redemption'. In my opinion its annoying in the same measure.Sure, Clint, Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank are great actors, and they all do good roles of what they're given. I was quite impressed by the physical development of Swank in fact. And Clint is a capable director.The storyline absolutely had the ability to move me, but for the most of the time it dragged.Look outside of Hollywood to find real great post 2k cinema.",4,1,3,28 June 2005
Detroit Rock City," Hardrock comedy
","For laughing out loud, how silly can Kiss fans get? I am too young to be a kiss fan, but I suspect the film to be not too far from the truth here. Business man Gene Simmons is producing a film about a concert they will hold in Detroit, or more about four hardcore kiss fans that for various reasons, including one of their moms cant go to the concert. The rest is about the hunt for tickets. And of course, saving one of them from boarding school.Mix spinal tap with a high-school comedy and you're not far off. Good music, simple story and funny dialog. Go, go go!",6,0,5,30 October 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," What is this 'dogfood' we're treated with in cinemas these days
","This got good reviews for its entertaining value and when going to this I of course do not expect Goethe, but two super agents for different agencies getting married knowing nothing of each other but body measures which then get involved in the same case causing them to hunt each other down while throwing 'we're married, I thought you knew me' type of jokes every minute get me real grumpy. The recipe, as so many times before and after, two superstars voted for sexiest person in gq, vogue or the sun (but are of course not) + an idea funny for maybe a tiny sub-plot drawn out to the length of a movie + a script worked out in three days in extreme hangover + big guns = market hit. Thanks guys, enjoy the blow.",2,6,12,7 October 2005
Man on Fire," Tony turns out another one
","Apart from its (nauseating) MTV editing and crazy camera movements, the expensive and nice pictures this movie doesn't have a lot to show for it. Halfway through the story turns laughable and in the end you just shake your head in disbelief. Mr. Creasy with a vengeance.Dakota Fanning does a good job for her age, but she is a bit annoying, Denzel Washington is good even if he did similar parts before and Mr. 'Ride on the Rhythm' Marc Anthony has no character whatsoever.Music is quite good if unfitting for this movie. The scale is epic while 'Man on Fire' is CSI Miami at best.Only for fans of brainless Tony Scott movies.",3,0,7,5 March 2006
Downfall," Brilliant
","Bruno Ganz' portrayal of the worlds most hated man is totally believable. His madness, his anger and his more humane side (and also his 'philosophy') are all covered in plenty of detail. If someone could outdo him, I would love to know who.Hitler was not the only person out of his mind inside the bunker, the mood switches from tense to hanging in the chandelier drunk, Eva Braun is detached from everything happening in the outside world. Goebbles wife, the 'best' mother of der dritte Reich, gets no sympathy whatsoever from this viewer.This is a complex piece of work, we get to see the people probably close to what they were, not pointing any fingers, but letting them be themselves.",8,0,1,7 October 2005
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Please save me
","from the melodrama. 'Taegukgi' employs the 'Saving Private Ryan' storyline with a personal tragedy in a great war. Oh my oh my how the two brothers look like they've just fallen in love (in the beginning of the movie), I for one have never seen brothers like that. In style also this is very similar to SPR. Lots of blood splashing everywhere, enemy is portrayed as only evil, music very dramatic and story very tear dripping. For those who would see this Oscar nominated: Why? To show that Korean movies cant do better than to copy one of Hollywood's biggest recent successes? Korean film is so much more than that.The films core messages lies in that they are one people and its crazy to fight ones own people. If so, then I find it confusing as to why the North Koreans are totally faceless except for the ones who deserted from the south. When one South Korean is killed, we see 20 North Koreans get blasted into bloody bits and I thought that the North Korean army was so much more powerful at that time. And the systematic killing of the civilians who enlisted as communists to get food when the capitalists couldn't give them anything, what was that about? To show that South Korea does not tolerate freedom of thought or have compassion? If it was to criticize the South Korean governing at the time, as with the drafting of both brothers, then the film shouldn't be so stereotyping the enemy. Honestly I don't think the Koreans were so black and white only five years after the divide, which most Koreans didn't care much about since they were one people.The two main actors need to mature a little. Jin-seok especially is not the same character throughout the movie, most of the time he is thinking about the family at home and disliking his brothers medal hunt, but at the hospital for instance, he seems to be happy like he spent the last year on honeymoon at Cheju island. Jin-tae seems more on a quest for glory than for sending his brother home, then why is he so celebrated for the effort? Of course his brother loves him, but the changes come without proper motivation. Like close to the ending, he went nuts and ..? I am sorry to be so grumpy when I see so many people appreciate this movie so much and were really moved to tears by it, but I think it was to messy, tried to achieve to much with succeeding in little and too sugarcoated, Hollywood style. For a Korean audience who don't know American movies so well this may be a very well made movie and seem exotic, but for me this is not what I seek out as Korean cinema. See 'Silmido' instead.",3,10,46,10 April 2005
Munich," Spielberg's plea for change
","All hail to Steven Spielberg for a change in direction, for not picking the usual Hollywooders and for taking a more political approach as opposed to the usual nostalgic and/or entertaining approach, here he takes no sides in the Israel conflict, but instead shows us the wrongdoings of both. That said, it is not brilliantly clever as some point it to be. Its good, but important things is left unsaid.'Munich's merits as a movie however is a bit lacking. For realism, it's good and gory, too gory for my tastes. And for a three hours long movie it's quite tedious in a few places.Salut to a big player that throw in a burning torch (at least for the average Spielberg-crowd) into the masses in difficult times. It's almost a hip thing these days.",6,0,1,30 March 2006
