The Blair Witch Project," My favorite horror film.
","This is one of those horror films that doesn't rely on using jump scares throughout it to make the audience leap from their seats in terror for a brief moment before settling down again. It is the kind of horror film that, once you've watched it, leaves a fear inside you, it makes you want to never go into a deep, dark forrest again. The Blair Witch Project is so terrific because it is so simple, one of the first 'found footage' films in fact. It is true that people a more scared of what they can't see, while the blair witch is never seen in the film, her presence is made, which makes it all the more terrifying. The entire film is a suspense builder that does not end until the climax of the film, it keeps you glued to the screen, holding your breath. It is incredible how simply this movie is, yet how terrifying it is. I highly recommend this film to those who want to watch a good quality horror film on a dark and stormy night, you will not be disappointed.",9,1,3,7 June 2013
