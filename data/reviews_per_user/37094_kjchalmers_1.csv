The Rock," Annoying background music
","This is quite a decent film. It is unusual in its inclusion of an American actor playing a baddie (although one with honour). The one thing that spoils it is the incessant and rather annoying soundtrack throughout. At times you can barely hear the dialogue due to the background music. Could it be as a diversion from the dialogue itself? If only the film could be re-mastered without the annoying music, it would be so much better. Nicholas Cage does a good job although Sean Connery's role is rather 2-dimensional. It has the usual mix of predictable elements, with the saving of the world / San Francisco coming down to the last few seconds.",5,0,1,6 July 2011
