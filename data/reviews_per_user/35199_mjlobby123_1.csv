Hereditary," Utter rubbish - don't believe the hype
","I love horror films and was so looking forward to seeing this film. It started off promising but never really got off the ground. The story was all over the place and felt like it was improv. Between being bored I laughed through what was a poor attempt of horror tactics. Even the few special effects were naff like out of an old Hammer movie. 
I actually was crying with laughter in the final 15 minutes along with most people in the cinema (naked oldies in the bushes is not scary, just plain funny).
Someone, somewhere has spent a lot of money paying critics to hype this movie up, and it is just plain wrong. For those who have not been paid and who still rave on about it, I can only assume they have never watched a horror film before.
Don't waste your time or money on this film - trust me, it's crap!",1,22,46,16 June 2018
