Hereditary," Awesome acting, half-assed script, terrible ending
","I really enjoyed The Witch. I like it when a movie takes it's time to develop atmosphere. When people complained about Blade Runner 2049 being to long I thought about what I think could be left out, and I couldn't think of anything. 
The problem with Hereditary is, that it does build up a lot of tension, but in the end it doesn't deliver. Or at least you wish it wouldn't, because what you get is the lamest and most senseless plot revelation I got to see in any major production since... I don't even remember when. And worse than that: it's not even well executed. One special effect is so bad, it would have been laughable in the 80s. And what it shows is even totally unnecessary, as was already established one scene earlier. All in all it looks like a movie with a some good ideas for a family drama, which was then spoiled by some underdeveloped horror/mystery plot elements. 4 stars mainly for exceptional good acting and some very good dramatic scenes in the first half.",4,6,13,4 August 2018
Disturbia," Could have been good
","Really starts out good. I even cheered at one scene at the beginning. Somewhere around the middle of the movie, it all starts going downhill. Unnecessary and very cheesy romantic situations, logic plot holes big enough to fly a death star through, characters just behaving odd. The last 15 or 20 minutes or so only work if every single one character behaves as stupid as possible on every single occasion. Carrie-Anne Moss' character is totally underdeveloped. While her son is going through a lot of pain, there never seems to be a hint of her feeling anything similar about the situation. I just changed the rating from 4 to 3 while writing this. I better stop before it drops even lower.",3,3,3,30 September 2017
