The Blair Witch Project," I think I had an encounter with the Blair witch..
","I went to the film informed and prepared...so I thought... I thought I knew what to expect...but let me tell you when the movie started my heart began to pound with such force, I thought it might explode!  This film was like riding a rollercoaster..you knew you were going to get that rush ..but when..how and by what?? YOU never knew what to expect.. For those of you who saw the film, you will get this... After the film ended the theater was silent...DEAD silent!  Not a soul spoke a word... and the last 30s of the movie were HAUNTING!! It still sticks with me.. I see it everytime I shut my eyes! Later that night around 11:30 I remembered that I had left the back door to the garage door unlocked... I went through the garage to lock it (to keep the witch and boogieman out tee hee) and half way across the garage I had the image of the last sceen (mike) flash through my mind..just then the Lights went out!  My light in the garage burnt out!  Well after I picked myself up off of the floor I got the H*** out of there... needless to say I changed my Pants and got longer life bulbs...COINCIDENCE OR BLAIR WITCH...spooky!",Null,1,1,11 August 1999
