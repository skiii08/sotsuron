The Blair Witch Project," A must see for ALL movie fans!
","I definitely had my expectations a little high when I went to see this movie.  I had tried twice before to get tickets only to find that it was sold-out.  So, when I finally got to see the movie, I was really excited. The movie was great!  I have to admit that when it ended, I wasn't as scared as I thought it would be.  But, then I got home that night, and I could not go to sleep.  Usually scary movies don't get to me like that, but I was genuinely afraid to open my bedroom door in the morning!!  This movie is one of a kind, and should be viewed by everyone, just for its originality. But, this movie is more than original, it will keep you afraid for weeks after having viewed it.  I am living proof!!",10,1,2,16 August 1999
