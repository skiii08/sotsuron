The Avengers," Amazing movie.
","To keep this short, I love this movie. All of the characters are amazing and the actors playing these characters are also doing an amazing job of really capturing the way these characters should be portrayed. I think that Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was a great casting choice as he is able to show the loving and caring side of Tony Stark and also the cocky, arrogant and snarky side of him. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was also amazing. Some of the lines that he had with the other Avengers were amazing and Hemsworth is good at making it seem as though Thor has no idea why humans do what they do. Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers was somewhat a save for the actors Marvel career, as the last time he appeared in a Marvel movie he played The Human Torch in the very disappointing Fantastic Four movies. He also does very good at acting as though he's from the 1940's. All of the other performances were outstanding but the one that stands out is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He was a compelling villain, intimidating and funny at times. Overall, I think the movie is all around amazing and is definitely my favourite MCU movie so far.",10,3,4,2 May 2018
Rocketman," Much better than last years Bohemian Rhapsody.
","Hate making the comparison between the magnificent Rocketman and the fairly enjoyable Bohemian Rhapsody, but I'd like to compare it to something. I'm a huge, huge fan of Elton John and I loved Taron Egerton in both of the Kingsman movies but wow this movie really proves that he can act. He should win best actor oscar net year or at least get nominated for it.So here are the positives. I love the style of this movie. Obviously, Dexter Fletcher has done a great job of directing but I mean the musical numbers are great. Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting was a particular favourite in the film and I love the energy it displays. Now, I've mentioned how brilliant Egerton's acting is, but let me talk about his singing. HE'S GREAT IN THIS. I mean, the guy can sing and I bought the OST.Now on to the inevitable comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody. That movie displayed a lot of incorrect facts about the band behind the scenes such as Freddie being diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and him breaking up the band by doing a solo album. Now this movie has a few historical inaccurasies but they're very minute such as Elton performing Crocodile Rock at the Troubadoure in 1970, but that's a very small detail. Bohemian Rhapsody was rated PG-13 which undoubtedly made it the huge hit it was but Freddie and the band did a lot of drugs and Freddie had huge gay orgys in the 80's. This movie shows everything.Anyway, the wrap it, I think this is a perfect movie and probably the best movie I've seen so far this year",10,2,3,19 July 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A very enjoyable movie but not one without a few flaws.
","I like to keep my reviews short so here we go. To point out a few positives of the movie, every single performance is amazing, most notably Rami Malek in the leading role. The song choices are of course spectacular and don't just follow the typical greatest hits format. Of course the hits are there but people are introduced to songs such as Keep Yourself Alive and Doing Alright. The Live Aid performance was something that everyone worked their hardest on and it shows. However, I think after the movie shifts from the 70's into the 80's, I think it slows down and gets a little less interesting. Also, there are many historical inaccursies, which isn't awful but stand out to a hardcore Queen such as myself. Finally, after watching Rocketman, I realise that this movie could have been done so much more better if they had chosen to do a 15 rated movie.Overall, it's a very good and enjoyable movie although it does have it's flawed it's a movie I did buy on Blu-Ray and I have fun watching.",7,2,3,4 July 2019
