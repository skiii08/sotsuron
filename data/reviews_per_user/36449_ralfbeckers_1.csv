The Ring," Completely terrifying, ten out of ten
","When watched all by yourself in a completely dark room this movie will scare the hell out of you. I hadn't have so many goosebumps since I saw the Blair Witch. I admit that you have to be a lover of horror movies in order to enjoy this one as I did. If you are willing to let yourself go and be drawn into the story I promise you'll be in cold sweat. There is no real gore here but the scared frozen faces of the victims are absolutely shocking.If you like the following movies you are likely to enjoy The Ring: Se7en, Halloween, Blair Witch, Alien Series, SWF, Dead Calm, Fear, Cape Fear. Basically, if you like a good scare, surprises, plot twists but also predictable situations. P.S.: Don't let the soft MPAA and FSK ratings fool you. Do NOT watch this with younger teens or children. (Or you'll get a certain phone call.)",Null,1,1,28 April 2003
