Walk the Line," amazing
",this movie was amazing i enjoyed everything in it. The acting was the best i have seen in along time. The set the sound the wow. Its so hard to explain how i felt in this movie. I laughed it made me so happy to see it. Johnny cash was an amazing singer and this movie portrayed him to the fullest extent. The only problem would be that it could have been longer now I know I'm most likely one of the only people that thinks this but i really did enjoy the movie. I think it was wow i cant descibe how i felt in this movie. I loved the begging middle and end. thanks Zack,10,1,2,21 February 2006
