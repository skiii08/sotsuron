United 93," Breathtaking out of this world 11/09 movie
","I must say I'm astonished with this movie, which is simply the best inside view of what really happened on that tragic 11 day . We must thank all of the direction of this motion picture, because it was simply beyond I could really expect, it really shows the lack of security there was on the planes those days, the exposure, and kind of an unreal attitude of what was actually happening. I think the best part of the movie comes on the United 93 scenario when the crew start taking actions, the last part when they start stopping the terrorists it's breathtaking, even at the end their cry for freedom only stops as they begin to fall down into mainland, having no chance to bring the plane back up, they die as heroes.",10,0,1,16 September 2006
