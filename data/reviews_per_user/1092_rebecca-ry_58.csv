Skyfall," Best action, best villain, best film
","'Skyfall' is the third Bond film starring Daniel Craig – it also marks the 50th anniversary of James Bond in cinema. There are lots of delightful little old references to classic Bond films with lots of old gadgets, gags, cars and theme song. The script is well-written; it's an interesting story focusing more on M than Bond. It can be a bit confusing because it's moving at such as fast pace but it does all make sense and you don't struggle to keep up with it. Like 'Casino Royale', it began with a great action sequence and an even greater title sequence. The middle of the film is interesting and there is a decent amount of gripping classic Bond scenes but at some points it can lose momentum and lag a bit. However, the ending is brilliant with a fantastic finishing action sequence and a great last scene to make us all look forward to Bond 24.The acting is very good; Daniel Craig returns as Bond and provides the same quality of performance as he brought in the past two films. Judi Dench features a lot more in this film and gives a great performance. Bond girls Naomi Harris and Berenice Marlohe are great and are probably the best of the Craig series so far. However, Bond villain Javier Bardem definitely stole the show; he gave a fantastic performance and was genuinely creepy. He may be type-cast after fantastic performances in this and in 'No Country for Old Men' but he fully deserves to be up there with the best Bond villains. The only problem was that he simply wasn't in it enough! Overall, this is a fantastic film and has already been called one of the best Bond films ever. It's the first recent Bond film that hasn't tried to be like a Bourne film so hopefully the three planned future Bond films will take heed of this. A truly excellent film that everyone should see, a great piece of cinema that could even get awards attention due to both the performances and the script.",9,10,29,27 October 2012
Se7en," Fantastic
","It's a shame not everyone knows about 'Se7en', for some reason it hasn't become a popular classic like others. It really is a fantastic film that proves that films don't need to contain lots of gore to be scary.The acting overall is great; there are few films where everyone performs well but this is one of them. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances here and contributes a lot to this film. Brad Pitt does perform well but it certainly isn't his best. Towards the end, his acting seems too forced unfortunately during the scenes where his performance is the most crucial. Kevin Spacey is fantastic here; he really does make you shiver. His creepy performance here is definitely his best. The script is really clever yet the story is so simple you wonder why someone hadn't come up with the idea of a killer killing people for each of the seven sins before. Each murder and each motive surprise you especially the films' climax. It has become one of the most famous endings in history and has been spoofed by huge numbers of shows. I won't give the ending away of course because I think everyone who watches 'Se7en' for the first time need to watch it with no clue as to how it ends to truly understand the greatness of this film.Overall, 'Se7en' is a fantastic film worth watching. It's really violent but doesn't contain as much gore as expected and sets a good example for quality film making without the need for excess.",10,1,3,20 September 2012
Memento," Genius
","'Memento' is quite a confusing film which takes a little bit of time to make sense. It can be quite difficult to understand initially because the film doesn't play out in the correct order, you're finding out different pieces of the story at different times and you slowly begin to understand what's going on.It's very clever; to film this and break it up to portray it in a mixed up order must be really difficult and Christopher Nolan has done a great job. The script is really good; a film like this can make it really easy to make mistakes and he's done a great job in making sure the story makes sense. The story itself is really interesting and the way in which it has been filmed reflects Leonard's mindset. The acting performances (of which there is really only three) are pretty good. Guy Pearce performs really well in this; his character involves a wide range of emotions and he portrays most of them really well, sometimes his dialogue can be a bit wooden but it never lasts long enough to have a negative effect on the film. Joe Pantoliano also does a good job here - he plays his ambiguous character really well. The worst performance of the three is Carrie-Anne Moss; she doesn't really have an impact on the film and some scenes where her character plays a crucial role in a scene she fails to evoke enough emotion to convince viewers. The film overall is really good, you never quite manage to determine the ending until it actually occurs and the ending is excellent. There are a lot of films where half-way through you can guess the ending correctly but this is not the case with 'Memento', really worth a watch especially if you have seen any of Christopher Nolan's previous films.",8,0,2,25 July 2012
World War Z," Disappointing but not terrible
","World War Z has been talked about in critics' circles for over a year now; it was widely publicised that the project went through development hell, there were several re-writes and re-shoots of the ending. All of this, plus the fact that it was given a mere 15 age rating, meant that most zombie horror fans and fans of the book were worried.Max Brooks' novel is in a format that would be almost impossible to convert into a faithful film adaptation. It was always going to be tough but World War Z is an adaptation in name only; there is hardly anything derived from the book included here with exception to some film locations and the decision to just call the zombies 'zombies' rather than walkers, biters or any other name that films and TV shows have done. The political satire has been left out (it is hinted that the virus began in South Korea rather than in China) and the film takes place at the beginning of the war rather than ten years after it. These decisions have been made with the best intentions, to make the film more entertaining. This is a good idea but, as with any book adaptation, it will anger fans of the source material. The movie chose to jump right into the chaos so there was no suspicious news reports of riots in distant towns, and Brad Pitt and his family were completely surprised when they found ordinary people trying to have a chomp at them. The fact that World War Z is not an 18 is a very poor studio decision; the main terrifying feature of a zombie is their ability to tear people to shreds, the result of this would obviously be a lot of blood and gore. There are several scenes of people being bitten, people being shot and even one scene where someone has their hand amputated to prevent the spread of infection – none of these scenes contain a drop of blood. Luckily, the zombies are still quite creepy; the sound of their teeth snapping at people is really unsettling and the way they twitch is just ghastly. These are seen in the final act, which is where you get a chance to properly look at the zombies. Before this, all action scenes are either in the dark or are so fast paced and quickly edited that you have no idea what is going on. The first action scene will remind people of director Marc Forster's previous editing misadventure – Quantum of Solace. The opening act began quite well; Brad Pitt has shown he is great at playing the average family man – he and Mireille Enos build up a believable family setting. A not-so-wise decision was made to make their children behave significantly younger that their actual ages – they look about 13 and nine but both act about four years old! Brad Pitt's performance becomes more and more laborious and doesn't quite look as effortless as it did in the beginning. It is actually quite surprising to see him act in a film that you can tell he just doesn't care about any more – you can tell that in some scenes these were filmed just as the production was running into problems. The supporting characters were all very disappointing; there were some fairly big actors who got hardly any screen time and their characters were severely under-developed. James Badge Dale makes an appearance for five minutes and in that tiny amount of time we are supposed to care about him and what happens to him, this was impossible. Even the brilliant Peter Capaldi features but his talent is wasted on a basic character that is not even given a name!Aside from this, most of the action was well-paced but the computer generated zombies make the massive action scenes less realistic and therefore less scary. There are some genuinely tense moments that make you want to hide behind your chair – the plane scene is definitely where the film peaks. The film gets better as it continues but the ending is very deflating; there is a 15-minute long tense sequence where people are sneaking around an abandoned laboratory which is teaming with 'dormant' zombies. All of this leads up to the controversial decision to introduce a solution to the zombie apocalypse (one of the horrifying aspects of the book was that there was no real solution apart from building bigger forts and killing the infected one by one). When Brad Pitt makes this discovery, the film ends after a few minutes of cheesy family reunion with 'our war has just begun.' This is sadly nothing more than a reason to create a sequel and you are left at the end thinking 'is that it?'Overall, World War Z was the best possible zombie movie you could make with such a low age rating. It was fast paced, tense, thrilling and riddled with jump scares. Brad Pitt starts out promisingly but his performance becomes more tiresome as the film goes on. The film is not very recommendable, simply because the ending is so lazy it ruins the little sparks of talent that it had.",6,3,7,28 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Excellent, a breath of fresh air
","'The Hunger Games' has received a lot of hype lately and it has deserved every bit of it! The story is great, I regret not reading the books before going to see the film because it's such an interesting story. The script is very good, dialogue can be a bit bland at points but it can be excellent in certain scenes. Actors in this film perform really well, there's no weak links aside from a few of the district tributes but they do not get a lot of screen time anyway. Jennifer Lawrence is, of course, amazing. She has shown she is a serious actress and has really out-done herself in this. Josh Hutcherson also performed well along with Liam Hemsworth despite not having a lot of screen time, he still makes an impression. My favourite performance however, was by Stanley Tucci. He was excellent, his role was not the most vital but it did shape a lot of the film's context, with him being the cheesy show host with a big fake smile and catch-phrases. His performance was without a doubt the best in the film. The editing was really well done, it must have been difficult to try and make such a violent plot become child friendly, they've managed to do their best. It cleverly cuts away from violent scenes meaning very little blood is shows so you think you've seen something horrible when you haven't really, it's a good example of how films do not need to be violent to have an impact. However, young children can still be frightened by this because it can be very jumpy, particularly during the climax, and the sound effects could scare easily. The only problem I had with this film was some of the hand-held camera work was just too much, there were points where the camera was jolting so much that you didn't really know what was going on. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film to both children and adults however, I do believe only people over 12 should watch this film as it can be quite frightening. This film is a breath of fresh air and shows that a blockbuster can be cinematically great as well as commercially.",8,3,9,29 March 2012
12 Monkeys," Give it a chance
","'Twelve Monkeys' is a film which has a certain audience. It's a shame Terry Gilliam's films don't have as big a fan-base as other types of film and director but his fans are loyal.The film starts off with Bruce Willis' flashback and him waking up in this strange prison-like place which automatically frightens you, the first half hour of the film is like this. One particular part is when Willis is walking through the abandoned shopping centre, it's a very atmospheric film. The plot is very interesting, it can become quite confusing at some points but, as with a lot of Gilliam's films, it all ties together at the end. The camera-work in this film works really well and provides a lot of the atmosphere and tension in the film's plot. The acting in this film is pretty good. The two main strengths in this film are of course Willis and Brad Pitt. Bruce Willis is an actors who has been type-cast unfortunately but this film broke the mould. He does not do any typical Willis-like actions and although he is the film's protagonist, he doesn't seem that way at all in this, he portrays a muddled, odd person who eventually tries to save the day. Brad Pitt is astonishing, it's the best I have ever seen him perform. It shows how great he really is as an actor and he's not just a pretty face.Overall, I would recommend this film if you have seen a Gilliam film before and enjoyed it. If you have never liked any of his films you will probably not like this one. If you've never seen any then at least give this film a chance, it deserves a lot more credit than it received.",7,7,10,26 March 2012
Argo," Genius
","'Argo' is a fantastic film directed by Ben Affleck. It tells the story of six US embassy workers who managed to escape shortly before the 1980 Iranian US embassy hostage crisis. The six people find refuge in the Canadian embassy but it is only a matter of time until the hostage takers find out they're missing. I have a massive amount of respect for Ben Affleck after seeing this film. It is brilliant and arguably one of the best films of 2012. The script and dialogue are fantastic; the film moves at a realistic pace (not to quick and not too slow) it builds momentum and the last hour is fantastic and is more like a fictional action film. The dialogue is funny, realistic and descriptive but the actors should be given just as much credit for this as the script writers.Ben Affleck, as well as directing, takes the lead role as a member of the CIA whose task it is to try and get the hostages out of Iran with no problems. It is his idea to create a fake film to get the hostages out. Affleck's performance is good but not too over the top to overshadow other performances. He gives a realistic performance here and has clearly researched his character. Bryan Cranston does not have a huge role here but he is great; he provides a lot of great scenes with his wise-cracking, funny character. I really liked him in this and I'm glad to see he is getting more mainstream work. Scott McNairy is great here; since seeing him in 'Killing Them Softly' I have looked forward to his future career and this is a good follow up. His character is completely different but he tackles it with great confidence and is convincing. I look forward to seeing where his career takes him next. Overall, I loved this film. It is a great, high quality film for modern history fans and even action fans to an extent (if you liked the Hurt Locker you might find this enjoyable). This is a fantastic film and I hope it gets some award recognition in 2013.",9,3,6,30 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great Follow-Up
","'Star Trek: Into Darkness' is the follow-up to J.J. Abrams' 'Star Trek' in 2009. It follows the crew as they face a deadly ex-member of their own organisation who is out for vengeance.The story isn't very different from the previous instalment; the relationship between Spock and Kirk is slightly different and of course there is a different villain. The dialogue between the characters was a lot better in this film however, it was very funny but it was also very dark as well.The darkness is brought by Benedict Cumberbatch with a creepy voice and outbursts of extreme violence – all of this hidden under a façade of courteous English manners. He definitely steals the show here and it would be great to see more of him in sequels. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg are all back and do a great job here; they all work really well together.Like the first one, the film works for both fans of 'Star Trek' and those who have never seen it – there's lots of little references to the series and films and a few major ones as well that fans will enjoy. Aside from this, there is a great amount of action, great funny scenes and this film is very entertaining overall ease up on those lens flares though, they make some of the action scenes a bit difficult to follow.",5,3,7,23 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A Pleasant Surprise
","This film surprised me, despite liking most of the actors in it I always assumed this would be another cheesy chick-flick with some gags thrown in but, it was so much better!The script is simply great. Nearly every actor in this film performs well and it is obvious they all got along well whilst filming. The roles of Julianne Moore and Steve Carell worked well but I particularly liked scenes with Ryan Gosling and Carell talking in the bar because there are some points where you can see they are both trying to hold in laughter and I love seeing that in films. I like to know they enjoyed acting as much as I enjoyed watching this film. Towards the end of the film it begins to get cheesy but not to the point where you start to lose interest. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this film and it can leave you in tears with some comedy sequences. Emma Stone's role in this was probably the best. She was hilarious as usual in this with her storyline being quite bizarre. That was my main objection to this film, everyone's storyline was great or at least really funny despite being unbelievable but, the story between Carell and Moore's son and his babysitter was just ludicrous. Not even funny, at some points it was just awkward watching it - especially at the end. I of course will not give anything away but it is the main factor of this film which wasn't really needed, it did provide some laughs but it got to the point where you just didn't want to see them in the film at all.Overall, this is a really good film. It's been a while since I saw a really good girl's film. I would recommend it to those who like comedies but particularly romantic comedies. If you don't like that genre then maybe this film isn't for you but you will still laugh at some parts.",7,0,1,19 February 2012
Ted," MacFarlane has definitely excelled here
","'Ted' is a really funny film that could have been brilliant if there were more laughs in it. Mark Wahlberg was absolutely the right guy for this film, he is definitely at his best when he is in comedic roles (not necessarily in comedy films) and he carried this film better than anyone else could have. Mila Kunis was really funny in this but her character held her back a bit; she could have been a lot better if the script hadn't stopped her. Seth MacFarlane's voice performance was really funny though he was pretty much just playing Peter from 'Family Guy' in a bear form. There was a lot less cameo roles than I expected here but the ones from Sam J. Jones and the delightful little one from Ryan Reynolds were really funny. Let's not forget the hilarious narration from Patrick Stewart who is just brilliant despite only saying a few sentences at the beginning and ending. The script was really funny despite the story outline being kind of basic. The jokes, the insults and the dialogue were fantastic. Seth MacFarlane has definitely excelled here with this script; I really hope he goes on to write more films after this.Overall, if you love 'Family Guy', 'American Dad' etc. then you should love this. It's the same type of humour and is arguable just a giant episode of these but it is still as funny if not more. It was still missing something however; the jokes were spread throughout the film meaning you weren't laughing non-stop.",7,0,3,30 September 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," It could have been so much better.
","'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' was highly anticipated, Wolverine was thought to be everyone's favourite in the X-Men series but this film disappointed a lot of people.Acting in this film varies from good (Hugh Jackman) to very bad. A surprising amount of this cast don't perform very well. Will.I.Am's character being one of the worst. Lynn Collins does not perform that well either, it can be quite embarrassing at times.The plot again varies, at some points it can be very well written such as the scene where Wolverine meets the elderly couple. But then in other scenes it can be cringe-worthy, like when Wolverine has a boxing match with a ludicrously over-weight person for no apparent reason. The dialogue is awful, it is so cheesy at some points you feel like turning the film off. The dialogue gets even more embarrassing as the film reaches the climax, where everyone decides to be friends momentarily. Another bad aspect of this film is where the director has decided to make Jackman look up and scream at the sky whilst the camera pans out, this happens at least three times in the film all with dramatic music playing behind it. You think they're doing this as a joke, but there is no tongue-in-cheek here whatsoever and they are being completely serious when they do this.Overall, if you really want to see this film then go ahead but be warned, you will almost certainly be disappointed if you are a huge fan of the X-Men series. It starts out really good and slowly gets worse and worse.",6,0,1,3 March 2012
500 Days of Summer," Tragi-Rom-Com
","'500 Days of Summer' is a quirky little story about a man who falls in love with a woman who doesn't really believe in love. It's a really enjoyable film to watch simply because it's different.Joseph Gordon-Levitt acts really well in this and can be quite funny. You can tell he and Zooey Deschanel are good friends because they work really well on screen together. Deschanel is good; she portrays her character very well as you genuinely dislike her by the end of the film and are glad to see the ending be that they don't stay together just because she is such a nasty piece of work. I will note that this is the third or fourth film of Deschanels' that I've seen her sing. Despite her being able to hold a tune I don't understand why this is included in all of her films. It would be interesting to find out if it is the directors or Deschanel herself who request this to be added into the scripts (sometimes a little hurriedly). The layout of the film can be a little confusing to follow because the story is broken up into several pieces and they are not played in chronological order. It is a very clever way to lay out the film however and it did work really well for this.Overall, this is a delightful little film that deserves a bit more recognition.",7,0,0,26 August 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Great but not without flaws
","I watched 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' after discovering Gary Oldman had been nominated for Best Actor in the Oscar nominations. After watching the film I feel a bit disappointed that it was him who received this acknowledgment.The film itself is very good and I would highly recommend it. However, it is one of those 'blink and you'll miss a crucial moment' films where your attention is needed for its entire duration. The investigative theme of the film is carried out right to the end and you can easily miss one part and be confused instantly. The performances in this film were all good, there is no actor in this film who I would say performed poorly. The supporting roles of actors like Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch were extremely powerful and after watching this film I'm disappointed their performances were left out of the Oscar nominations as I believe they were far more emotive in their parts than Gary Oldman. Oldman's performance is good, it's difficult because he is playing a man of few words and a man who doesn't convey his emotions. This makes his presence in the film not as powerful as others. I think he has played this character well as Smiley is supposed to be a man of few words but unlike other characters in this film, you don't feel too much for him. The only part, probably his best scene in the film, is when he discovers his wife is cheating on him. You then feel terribly sympathetic for Smiley, but this is the only instance.Tom Hardy also gives a good performance showing a wide range of emotions and generating sympathy within the viewer on regular occasions throughout the film. Overall, this film is great, it's a great story and the performances are excellent. I cannot find any weak link that puts me off the film. I would warn you however that you have to pay attention all the time, it's not one of those films you can really relax to?",8,2,4,31 January 2012
Alien," A Classic
","'Alien' set the bar for sci-fi and even horror films long after it was released. It's always remained a very popular film which is quite unusual for movies in general to still be considered excellent over three decades since its release. Ridley Scott's direction of this film is excellent of course. The atmosphere built up during the events in this film are great, the acting works very well too, Sigourney Weaver doesn't have a great presence in the film until the second half but she really makes up for it during the last hour. Other performances such as that of Veronica Cartwright are good but you can't help but wonder why their character is included in the story at all. The story is very interesting, when you first watch this film it can really shock you and can certainly make you jump on more than one occasion. However, because 'Alien' is so well-known and famous now, it will be difficult for someone not to have an idea about what it consists of so I guess not many people will find it as shocking as it was 30 years ago.Nevertheless 'Alien' is still a very good film, it's still scary in some parts and is considered to be an excellent film regardless of its now out-dated technology used. Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone, if you're a fan of science fiction or horror you should have already seen this film anyway but if you haven't, watch it.",8,0,1,2 May 2012
Life of Pi," Outstanding
","'Life of Pi' is a story about a young man stranded on a boat in the middle of the Pacific with a tiger after the ship carrying his family and their zoo sinks. Directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), this is a spectacular film with a lot of great qualities.There's pretty much just one actor in this; Suraj Sharma makes a great debut here and I really hope his career takes off after this despite not being nominated for an Oscar unfortunately. It must be challenging being the only actor on-screen for 90% of the film with no one to converse with except a CGI tiger- Sharma handles this well though and his performance is thoroughly entertaining. Irfan Khan doesn't have much screen time but he gives a powerful performance, particularly in the last scene. Rafe Spall is a bit disappointing; he doesn't show any emotion in crucial scenes and he can take away the power and quality of a scene because of this. The exact opposite of an actors' job!I am opposed to 3D in cinema and therefore chose to see this in traditional, 'boring' 2D. Visually, it is still spectacular despite it being advertised as a film made for 3D (doesn't every 3D films' advertising campaign argue this?). The CGI animals – excluding the tiger – can look obviously fake and tacky at times which can be a bit off- putting but this is very brief. The night sequences are over the top and unrealistic but are beautiful and do somehow suit the film – Ang Lee has done well in creating the setting.Overall, this is an excellent film which is sure to do well at the Oscars. It's not really similar to any of Ang Lee's other works but it is a great film to watch and is expertly made. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the book so I can't tell if it is any better but, from what I do know about the book, I think this film tries to stay as close to it as possible.",8,10,18,10 January 2013
21 Jump Street," Best comedy in a while
","'21 Jump Street' is one of the funniest films released for at least two years. I didn't expect it to be so funny but it really surprised me. The acting is really well done, Channing Tatum really surprised me, with a track record that includes 'Dear John' and 'The Vow' you wouldn't expect him to do so well. He should do a lot more comedy because he has changed my perception of him as an actor in this film. Both him and Jonah Hill work really well together and both perform great. Other actors in the film like Dave Franco and even Johnny Depp in his entire five minutes add a lot of comedy to the film. The script is well-written. Some anti-cliché's like the title drop where the man mixes up the street name really do make everyone laugh simply because it isn't expected. The style of this film reminded me of 'Pineapple Express' (the last decent buddy-comedy I can think of) so if you enjoyed that film you will probably enjoy this. The believable initial plot which slowly becomes more and more hilarious and ridiculous is very like 'Pineapple Express' but both films should be considered different as '21 Jump Street' certainly doesn't copy it. It can be a bit predictable at some points but there are some scenes where you really don't know what's coming. The film really does make everyone laugh at some points, Jonah Hill has written this script very well indeed. Overall, I would recommend this film if you really like comedies and have noticed the lack of decent comedy in cinema lately. It can be quite vulgar at some points, particularly at the end, but the entire film makes you laugh.It would be difficult for someone to not laugh at all whilst watching this film.",8,0,0,5 April 2012
Oblivion," Any Film + Tom Cruise = Top of the box office
","'Oblivion' is the latest Tom Cruise movie that is currently doing extremely well in both the US and UK box offices. Tom Cruise is – for some reason – one of those actors who will attract the masses to a film no one would otherwise care about.This film however is a film people will genuinely be interested in seeing regardless of Tom Cruise. Joseph Kosinski has written a fairly solid story here; it has been a while since there has been a decent sci- fi film out that hasn't been linked to a film or book series. However, the film does seem like Moon, Total Recall, The Matrix and 2001: A Space Odyssey rolled into one. There are points in the film where nothing really happens, this does not mean they should have replaced them with action sequences, because there were a decent amount of them and they were very well done. There were way too many flashback scenes that were very boring, they showed the same flashback almost a dozen times but with no extended parts that taught us anything, it was literally the same scenes over and over again. There were a lot of instances where I was bored but it was not all the fault of the writer.Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko are the blandest pair of actors ever it would seem. Andrea Riseborough's performance is fine; her character was supposed to be quite cold and tries her best here. Cruise and Kurylenko have no chemistry whatsoever and you simply do not care what happened to them. This is where the major flaw of 'Oblivion' was noticed; the story was pretty good, the effects and props were amazing – though it would seem aliens have discovered Apple – and the sets were just fantastic and really interesting to look at but the actors were just too dull! Morgan Freeman gave the best performance, his most interesting one in a while, but unfortunately had next to no screen time.Overall, 'Oblivion' is not a bad film. It was clearly made by someone who has a love and respect for sci-fi but it could have been so much better had two other actors been given the lead roles.",6,3,8,23 April 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Good but flawed
","'Silver Linings Playbook' is a film directed by David O. Russell about a man with bi-polar disorder who is trying to get his life back on track after suffering a mental breakdown upon discovering his wife was having an affair. The story is a bit bizarre with Pat (Bradley Cooper) befriending Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who also suffered a mental breakdown after the death of her husband. Pat agrees to enter a dance competition with Tiffany in order to send a letter to his wife via Tiffany to try and re- build their relationship. The first half of the film seems a bit misleading. It portrays bi-polar disorder was just being the same as someone being a little bit odd or quirky. I don't think that they take the disorder seriously enough – for a film that a lot of people have claimed will win big at the Oscars in 2013, I don't think it will; it has missed the point with mental illness. The plot itself moves quite smoothly and I was never bored whilst watching this. The second half is better; it becomes a lot funnier and seems a lot more light-hearted. The plot is good but the acting can sometimes let it down.Bradley Cooper is quite bad; he has obviously done very little research for his role and has clearly read a paragraph on bi-polar disorder noticing that, under stress, they can shout and panic – there's a scene in the film where he is screaming and his eyes are blank with no emotion. This meant that the scene came across as funny and people in the audience were actually laughing during a scene that was written to be a scene of heartbreak. Jennifer Lawrence was excellent here; she portrayed her character perfectly and provided humour where it was meant to be. She has obviously done a lot of research for her role and she has had a fantastic career in 2012 which can only get better. Chris Tucker was a surprisingly positive addition to this cast; he died not annoy me at all in this film which was a huge development. David O. Russell has done a great job with the characters in this film. Robert De Niro is another great supporting character here; his role as Pat's father who has some form of OCD is just brilliant and he really seems to have portrayed it just right. This is his best performance in quite a while and I hope his films get even better. Overall, I liked this film; there were just a lot of flaws within it. It has some good comedy, some great performances and is a fairly good film to watch. If you're a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, you will like this film as it is yet another film that would have failed if it wasn't for her (see House at the End of the Street). This film is worth a watch but I don't see it doing well at the Oscars – I hope not anyway.",7,3,7,2 December 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Mildly Entertaining
","'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is a dark re-telling of the popular fairy tale where two siblings are captured by a witch. The twist in this film? Hansel and Gretel are now adults and are professional witch hunters.The original fairy tale is pretty dark as it is, child abandonment, kidnapping, attempted cannibalism, people being burned alive, this film tries to make it darker simply by splashing blood all over the place and that's about it. The fairy tale has been adapted to tie in very cleverly with their latest mission and it isn't that far-fetched; it makes sense, there's some good plot twists and it isn't too stupid. The stupidity comes in other forms; you've got electricity, gramophones, tasers, and oh yeah, insulin! I still don't understand why it was necessary to include the fact that Hansel has diabetes as a result of the infamous witch feeding him too many sweets as a child. Note that in the flashbacks he wasn't really overweight at all. The insulin we see him inject into himself throughout the film appears to have the same effect on him as spinach had to Popeye. Despite this weird addition, the film is fairly entertaining though it is fairly naff. The fight scenes are graphic but interesting and at some points are pretty funny.The acting is okay, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do all that they need to do here but their performances aren't anything memorable. Famke Janssen is probably the best in it but even her performance can be a bit embarrassing at times. Maybe if director Tommy Wirkola sent everyone a memo telling them what accent was necessary it would have been better. There were American accents, English and even German – with Gemma Arterton switching between English and American throughout the film. Overall, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is mildly entertaining but it is pretty forgettable. If you just want to watch a film with absolutely no thinking involved and you just want to relax with some popcorn and have a chuckle at heads being squashed, then this is perfect.",5,3,6,12 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Very Well Adapted Film
","'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a very well adapted film from Stieg Larsson's first book in the trilogy. Having read the book and viewed the Swedish original film released in only in 2009, I did not have great expectations. David Fincher has worked very hard on this picture, the direction is very well done. The script works a lot better than the original film, it takes the time to explain a bit of the back stories of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist which helped people understand aspects of both the characters and the plot. The plot itself was explained in a style which stayed very true to the novel, but also managed to explain everything so people would not get confused by certain aspects of the story. The acting is excellent, Rooney Mara performs very well and is almost as good as Noomi Rapace. Daniel Craig was perfect for the character he played and has shown he can play more diverse roles. Stellan Skarsgard's character is very interesting and his acting is very well done.Fincher had Trent Reznor (who also did the soundtrack for 'The Social Network') and Atticus Ross do the soundtrack for this film which had a great impact in some parts of the picture.Overall, the film is very good. It's not the best film Fincher has ever made but it does stay true to the original book and has adapted very well. For people who have not read the book I would thoroughly recommend you do so and then watch this film. If you do not like extreme violence and adult themes then this film is not for you, as shown by the film's 18 rating.",7,1,7,18 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A Massive Improvement
","'The Amazing Spiderman' is a film that has been greatly anticipated but has also made a lot of people worry. The re-boot of the franchise so quickly after Sam Raimi's attempt seems ridiculous as there is not really a new generation of children yet to be introduced to Spiderman since 'Spiderman 3' was just released in 2007. I think director Marc Webb has taken this opportunity to fix what was wrong with the previous trilogy.The script is great, the film promised more information relating to Peter Parker's back-story i.e. what happened to his parents but you do not get a great deal of NEW information. Compared to Raimi's trilogy there are only a few extra bits in the beginning. Aside from that, the story is different because it sees Spiderman deal with a new villain, the Lizard. The whole story was well-written and the Lizard had a lot to do with Parker's identity.The acting was good, Andrew Garfield is already far better than Tobey Maguire. I think this may be because the film focuses on Parker's life in high school rather than in adult life so you see him in some scenes behaving like a real teenager which is great. Rhys Ifans was good but not great, he did portray both sides of his character well but I think there was a lot of room for improvement there. Emma Stone was really good; she played the love interest of Spiderman very well if you compare it to Kirsten Dunst's performance in the previous trilogy where she had no on-screen presence whatsoever. One thing that was really impressive was the special effects, they tried to use as little CGI as possible when it came to stunts but for scenes where Spiderman is swinging through the air it did look a lot more realistic, unlike Raimi's trilogy where scenes like this would look too weightless, thankfully in this film they have managed to sort this out so it really does look like it is a real person swinging through the air. The effects used to create the Lizard were very well done too, the whole design of the villain was great, particularly the face which looked very creepy, especially when he spoke.Overall, I would recommend this film as it is a massive improvement on the previous trilogy. If you've not seen a Spiderman film before this is a great place to start. Andrew Garfield is a great superhero and I can't wait to see what they do next.",8,3,7,8 July 2012
Aliens," How a sequel should be made
","'Aliens' is the sequel to 'Alien', made seven years later it is still known for being a great example for how a sequel should be made.The acting is pretty good. Sigourney Weaver returns and really makes the character her own. Simply because her character now has more lines and more screen time in general. In 'Alien' she was the main character but did not have as many scenes, in this she is the definite main character and performs well. New characters like that of Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton are brilliant. Paxton in particular is probably the best in the film and provides a lot of comic effect in the film. The script is quite different from its prequel. 'Alien' was considered as a sci-fi horror film, this is more of a sci-fi action. James Cameron has made this sequel very well and leaves but a few questions we had from 'Alien' unanswered. The script is a lot more fast-moving and exciting, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is quite cliché' but most of the dialogue is fine. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film. If you have not seen 'Alien' you should watch it before watching this it is supposed to follow straight on from the events of the previous film. A classic film and is just as popular today as it was in 1986.",10,1,3,8 June 2012
Batman Begins," A Good Start
","'Batman Begins' is Christopher Nolan's first major film and it has worked really well.His idea to make the films less comical and more realistic has made this series of films extremely successful. Compared to its sequel, 'Batman Begins' is not quite as good but does work.The plot obviously tells us how Batman became Batman; it is explained in a way that can be a little confusing at some points - there is a section where Bruce Wayne flashes back to an incident before he began training which can be a bit confusing because they don't explain that it is a flashback very well. Aside from this the plot is very well written and acts as a great platform to Batman's new era on-screen.The acting from the majority of actors is really good; Christian Bale plays a great Batman and shows how he is capable of acting in major blockbusters as well as smaller film roles. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy play the villains in this; Neeson's character is more subtle but equally as menacing as Murphy's Dr. Crane/Scarecrow. Murphy really does scare you with his manic performance, it's a shame he was not given more screen time in this film because his role felt too short. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and especially Michael Caine are all great characters and provide a lot of miniature comedy moments which carry the film. Katie Holmes is probably the weakest in the film but even then she is not terrible; there are just some moments where her performance needed a lot more.I would really recommend this film if you've not seen it yet. The final film in Nolan's series is about to come out and the first two films have been fantastic. This is a series of films you need to see.",7,0,0,17 July 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Great Fun
","'Wreck-It Ralph' is a Disney movie that could easily be mistaken for a Pixar film. It is about Wreck-It Ralph who is a bad guy in an arcade game who is tired of being the villain and leaves his game to get a medal in order to be respected by the good guys in his game.The film has some great vocal performances by John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch. The story itself is entertaining for both children and adults simply because there are jokes in it that suit both groups. As far as children's films go it is actually quite unpredictable as there are a few revelations and funny scenes that you don't see coming and they take you by surprise. The soundtrack also fits this film perfectly; a mixture of popular songs that everyone will know and enjoy with some other arcade-sounding music that works really well in the fast pacing scenes. Overall, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a really nice, heart-warming film that is enjoyable for both children and their parents. There are also lots of funny video game references dotted throughout the film that a few people will get.",8,1,2,23 February 2013
Bridesmaids," If you have not seen this - watch it!
","I went to see this film when it first came out with six other girls and I was surprised at just how funny this film was! I expected it to be like every other chick flick. I know lots of people claim this is the female 'The Hangover' but it is so much better. The acting is great, the relationships between all of the characters are so natural you can almost relate to them. Rose Byrne was especially good, her portrayal of Helen was spot on, with the fake smiles and laughs. Kirsten Wiig and Maya Rudolph are known to be good friends and it is shown greatly in this film. Melissa McCarthy does steal the show here and fully deserves her Oscar nomination - she's hilarious. You almost wish you knew someone like her because she provides over half of the films' comedy.I guess the plot outline is fairly basic and predictable but you hardly notice it because the humour in this film shines through in nearly every scene. Overall, if you have not seen this, watch it - it will make you laugh all the way through. It's brilliant because it's a chick flick with harsh language, vulgarity and cringe-worthy circumstances which are sadly rare in this genre of film which is often considered trash - 'Bridesmaids' is what chick flicks should be like.",9,0,3,24 February 2012
Django Unchained," A little bit cluttered
","'Django Unchained' is the latest film by the brilliant Quentin Tarantino which tells the story of recently freed Django who becomes a bounty hunter and tries to free his wife from slavery.Tarantino usually brings out the best in actors and this film is no different; Jamie Foxx gives an admirable performance in the lead role here but his performance is overshadowed by those of Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. You may remember Waltz's performance in Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' where he was absolutely fantastic and fully deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. Unfortunately, I don't quite understand why he has been nominated now; although his performance is good and he is very funny, I think it is appalling that Leonardo DiCaprio has no Oscar nod – his character is horrible, cruel, and evil and he plays it perfectly! He makes you shudder sometimes with his callousness and makes you laugh at his stupidity. Samuel L. Jackson is great here; I've never seen him do a role like this but he was brilliant and I'm a bit disappointed that he hasn't received any awards recognition here either. One performance that wasn't up to scratch was that of Tarantino himself; with a small role as an Australian (I think). He does redeem himself a little with his grand exit but I think he should stick to playing corpses next time. A major problem with this film is its length; this is where 'Django Unchained' fails the most. There are several points where you think scenes should have been cut just because they don't really play a huge part in the overall story. The dialogue is genius and it is a real pleasure to listen to it because it is so well written. The action sequences are so well choreographed (as always) and are really funny at some points and genuinely horrifying at others. The issue of slavery is dealt with in a very professional way here; at no point does Tarantino attempt to glamorise or romanticise the slave trade and the slaves themselves. He does a great job of showing slavery in its true horror and portrays the ghastly nature of some people during those times. I cannot think of any other film which has dealt with this issue in such a way but I'm really pleased someone finally showed how awful it was. The story overall is interesting but it doesn't run very smoothly because there are at least two moments where you think the film will end but it doesn't and you begin to get a little bit exacerbated at how long it is.Overall, this is a great film but it is far too long. I absolutely love Quentin Tarantino and he has done a great job here but a lot more should have been cut. It is a brilliantly funny and powerful film that is just a little bit cluttered.",8,0,1,21 January 2013
Drive," More than a car film.
","You wouldn't expect 'Drive' to be so subtle, you would expect it to be a high-octane thriller with a new twist every step of the way. I'm glad it was not as I had expected, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. The acting is good, the down-played dialogue between practically all of the characters works well for the most part. Ryan Gosling is excellent and because this is the first film I have seen him in I would be convinced to watch more of his roles. The main thing that I noticed with the dialogue was even when Gosling and Carey Mulligan's characters were not talking, you couldn't help but smile. It's very difficult to evoke emotion from the audience with hardly any dialogue. At some points it can be slightly frustrating however, there are some points where you desperately want someone to say something! The car chased and car scenes in general are brilliant. For too long we have seen the CGI routines of the Fast and Furious series on the big screen and we often mistake that for talent. 'Drive' shows us how a car chase should be shot! The music has a great impact on this film, the 80s style techno music alongside the beautiful camera work in scenes with Gosling and Mulligan convert LA's littered streets and landscape into sheer beauty. The script is extremely clever, for at least an hour the film is slow moving but good, with the characters all getting along well and slowly we see the protagonist become more and more violent - the violence in this film can be quite shocking and is extremely graphic in some points.I have never been a tremendous fan of car films but this is an exception. I wouldn't even say it is a car film, it focuses a lot more on human relationships despite most shots being in the interior of a car. I can see why this was one of the films of 2011, it fools you on numerous occasions and leaves you thinking 'wow'. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone, even if you're not a fan of car films, you will still enjoy this film greatly.",9,11,19,19 February 2012
Evil Dead," Not a 'terrifying' experience but still worthwhile
","'Evil Dead' is a remake of 'THE Evil Dead,' it follows five teenagers who unintentionally revive a demon who attempts to possess them so he can rise.The original Evil Dead never really had a story; it is considered a cult classic because of this, there's a paper-thin story but the excessive amounts of cheap looking gore make up for this (the cheap gore simply added to the overall charm of the film). This new film also has this going for it, okay the gore isn't obviously fake or cheap and looks a lot more realistic, but it was still excessive and over the top. You don't see many wide release gore films today; the past decade is thought to be known for increasing the popularity of 'torture porn' but even those films tend to not contain spectacular amounts of blood and guts. This is certainly the goriest film in the last five years – since Paranormal Activity, most wide release horrors have been supernatural thrillers filled with tedious jump scares. The Evil Dead was part of the 'video nasty' phase in film which is undoubtedly where torture porn stemmed from. The violence in this film is so over the top you cannot help but laugh sometimes and realise how much you have missed this type of horror. As remakes go, this is one of the better ones. You can tell Fede Alvarez (director) really did admire the original but has taken the brave step of trying to take the film/story in a new direction. I wouldn't say he is completely successful in this however since the story overall is pretty much the same. There were some interesting new touches though; the girl goes to the cabin to quit her drug addiction, the fact that the main protagonist was a woman, the brief story behind previous events in the cabin – these are all interesting additions but none are really explored thoroughly. It would have been nice to see some more references to the girl's drug habit, particularly towards the end. I did like the new plot point where certain things had to happen before the demon could rise; skin had to be burned with boiling water, faces had to be cut off etc. – it was interesting and it meant that not all of the violence was completely nonsensical. There were undoubtedly some creepy scenes dotted throughout the film and some not-so-subtle references to the original – though if the producers of a remake are the director and star of the original then this is bound to happen. The director did try his best to make us care for the characters but there was no way that was going to happen; character developments were left suspended – I thought there was some angry tension between Olivia and *insert blonde girl here* but nothing ever happened with that – and some characters got next to no dialogue at all.Overall, 'Evil Dead' is a pretty good film. If you're paying to see gore then it will be money well spent. The characters are basic, the story tries to be not so basic and the overall experience isn't terrifying but it is worthwhile. I don't really see the need for a sequel however, you won't be routing for Mia quite as much as you would for Ash.",8,1,12,26 April 2013
Prisoners," Not What I Expected
","'Prisoners' tells the tough story of two young girls who are kidnapped on Thanksgiving. Both sets of parents struggle to cope as they are left helpless and have to rely on Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to work on finding their missing daughters.The story starts off a little too rosy and 'happy families.' This is soon over and the atmosphere and tension build up as the families realise their children are missing, presumed kidnapped. The film has a very bleak tone and is initially quite gritty. However, the story soon turns into a Hollywood tale rather than a heart breaking story.'Prisoners' is really a film of two parts; the first is following rule-breaking Detective Loki as he tries to find the girls. His side is quite interesting and doesn't really have any negative aspects to it - it simply is what it is, an investigation. Hugh Jackman plays the father of one of the missing girls; he is understandably frustrated after the suspected kidnapper is let go due to a lack of evidence. He takes the drastic step of kidnapping the suspect and chaining him to a sink in an abandoned house to torture him. This is obviously to make the audience ask themselves the question 'what would I do in that situation?' As the film progresses, things get more and more extreme. It gets to the point where you realise no one in real life would ever do something like this and that is when 'Prisoners' looses its audience. Things just get too silly and unrealistic.Hugh Jackman gives a really good performance but his character's actions become too bizarre. Terrence Howard is really bad which is surprising. He plays the other father and has to cry and be upset in numerous points of the film. He just does not look like he cares at all though - his crying scenes look incredibly forced and unnatural. The two mothers are shown to be useless which is a little disappointing and slightly offensive; Viola Davis could have gave a fantastic and powerful performance here but all her character does is stare into space. Maria Bello lies in bed the whole time because her character becomes depressed but doesn't really revive from it - it would have been good to see her beat the illness. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an admirable performance - although it is quite similar to that in the brilliant 'Zodiac,' he plays an investigator who has never failed to solve a case with his brash approach and his 'f**k-it' attitude. He is the only character in the entire film who isn't one-dimensional. Paul Dano also gives a great performance; he somehow manages to be creepy and seem so innocent at the same time. The film could have focused more on the slow yet inevitable breakdown of the families rather than the endless - and ultimately pointless - scenes of torture. It was briefly mentioned in the beginning that Hugh Jackman's family are struggling financially - this is never mentioned again and it is fairly evidence that Terrence Howard's family are very wealthy. It seemed like such an obvious foreshadow that the two families would end up arguing at some point but they don't. A lot of reviews have questioned the ending, many have found it annoying or weird. It is a strange way to end the film but, in context it is the most positive ending possible.Overall, 'Prisoners' is quite disappointing; the story is unnecessarily complicated and becomes ridiculous. Most of the performances are good - particularly the leads. For a film like this you would expect there to be some really harrowing points - there were hardly any.",6,1,5,4 October 2013
The Dark Knight," One of my favourite films
","When 'The Dark Knight' was first released everyone was going to see it even if they hadn't seen the previous 'Batman Begins', simply because it was Heath Ledger's last completed role - and what a role it was. When you watch the film for the first ten minutes when you see Heath on screen you remember how he is sadly no longer with us and are reminded of the tragedy. However, when the Joker visits the mob and performs the 'pencil trick', Heath becomes the Joker. It's a rare occasion when you find a character so well performed that you forget it's an actor, but Heath did this astonishingly well. It's hard to find a weak link in the acting in this film. Christian Bale adds an almost comical edge to Bruce Wayne with his hints of mockery when it comes to talking to or about Harvey Dent. Bale also performs Batman well despite the odd voice which you get used to. Aaron Eckhart is another actor whose performance is excellent. His noble character of Harvey Dent is great but it's when he becomes Two-Face that you really see Eckhart's skill. It's a shame this side of his character is only shown for the final part of the film but he, like Heath Ledger, is able to totally immerse himself in the character.The familiar characters played by Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are welcomed again in this sequel and Maggie Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes is also not controversial and Maggie acts very well.The script itself is full of twists and turns and leaves you gasping for the finishing half of the entire film. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job with this film. Perhaps not his best ever script but it's definitely his best film so far, it will be difficult for him to create the sequel for this film as he has simply made an excellent film here which is difficult to beat.",10,5,9,31 January 2012
The Artist," Heart-warming
","'The Artist' was the most talked about film in 2011 and for a very good reason, it's the first silent film to get so much attention probably since 'Wings' won the very first Best Picture Oscar in 1927. A lot of people will suggest the only reason it received so much attention was because it was a silent film which is probably true, but it deserves this attention because of its quality also, very few films these days can evoke so much emotion from the audience. It does take a while to get used to, the scarce bits of dialogue written on the screen but the script makes up for it. The acting between Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo is extremely well done. The mannerisms all the actors make in this film make it funny, sad, serious, you are relying on their facial expressions throughout the entire film. The music gives a great feeling to the film and has been made to suit the time it is set in (1925-30's). Uggie the dog does steal the show however, his presence provides a lot of comic effect in the film but he also makes scenes a lot more heart-warming. The scarce use of real sounds is used very cleverly, in dream sequences and towards the end showing the transition in cinema from silent films to 'talkies'.Overall, this film deserved the hype it received. It fully deserved its Best Picture Oscar and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet.",9,0,1,31 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Embarrassing
","Four books and five films later, the Twilight Saga has now ended hopefully. The last of Stephanie Meyer's books was split in two for Hollywood's latest money-grabbing scheme.Part 2 is where all the drama is supposed to really kick off but after the deflating experience of part 1 it's difficult to get in the Twilight spirit. Having read the book I know how much of a dud the ending is and clearly the writers have too – I won't disclose what they do to try and solve this problem but it doesn't work and goes against nearly every rule of story-telling. Otherwise, the script is as basic as ever; the quality of these films has decreased with every sequel despite a promising beginning. The dialogue is embarrassingly simple, with laughable conversations with predictable outcomes. Not all of this is down to the script-writers however; Meyer must take some of the blame too. Sometimes you can visibly see the actors – particularly Robert Pattinson – cringing at the dialogue. The make-up always seems to get worse as these films continue - this last film saw the worst from the make-up department with the vampires clearly sticking out like sore thumbs caked in white make-up with odd contact lenses...aren't they supposed to look spectacularly hot?A lot of the actors have out-done themselves in terrible acting here. Kristen Stewart was hilarious and embarrassing. In particular, scenes where she is 'angry' she looks like she's having a bowel movement and scenes where she is supposed to be motherly and instead looks to be made of stone – I will note that the creepy CGI baby would have been difficult to work with. The CGI child was a bizarre choice and looked awful. Robert Pattinson did his best but still fell flat here; his future career looks promising though. Taylor Lautner does not have a major role here but is terrible all the same. Some of the new characters such as Lee Pace's Garrett were good additions to the cast and Michael Sheen was also great except from an odd scene where he laughs in such a bizarre way – if you've seen the film you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Overall, this is a disappointing end to a disappointing franchise – there are some sparks of talent here but it is mostly the same old dull dialogue and acting.",4,7,16,18 December 2012
Mama," Something a bit different
","'Mama' tells the story of two little girls who are abandoned in the woods for five years and somehow manage to survive. After being found and put back into society under the care of their uncle and his girlfriend, their carers begin to realise someone had been taking care of them all along.The film is certainly not the scariest film ever; it won't exactly give anyone nightmares. However, there are a few jumpy scenes – but these aren't anything special, this kind of scare is all too common in horror films these days. The story itself is quite interesting; stories of children being cared for by overly protective ghosts appear frequently in TV shows but not so much in films. The story works quite well in feature film length and it doesn't feel too bloated or drawn out. You can tell this is not your average Hollywood horror film; the suspense that builds up works really well and the unconventional ending shows that there is a lot of Spanish/ European horror influence here that has made 'Mama' so unique. The acting in this film is extremely well done. Jessica Chastain is fantastic here and has proved her skills yet again, this time playing a bass player in a rock band with an attitude. The two little girls also perform really well here – particularly Isabelle Nelisse who played the younger girl, Lilly. Overall, 'Mama' is a pretty good film with a few decent scares and a plot that goes against boring convention. It's unpredictable, interesting and different from what we usually get.",8,1,3,12 March 2013
Sinister," Sinister...but that's about it
","'Sinister' is advertised as being one of the scariest films of 2012 and it probably is, but nothing more.The acting is poor but this is due to the bad dialogue in the script. The conversations have all occurred before in countless other films, discussions can seem false and wooden throughout the whole film. Ethan Hawke does try his best to give a decent performance but it fails due to the poor script.The storyline is a bit unique; there have not been many supernatural horror movies in the past twenty years but 2012 has seen quite a few so far. The plot is scary and quite disturbing at some points, I was surprised because it's rated as a 15, personally, I think it should have been an 18. However, the plot does work it's just the dialogue that lets it down. Overall, the film will frighten most people; there are lots of jumpy scenes and quite a few creepy ones too. The films' only let down was its boring dialogue which made this film a lot worse than it should be and far more forgettable.",6,0,0,14 October 2012
Total Recall," Not the best, but not the worst!
","'Total Recall' is surprisingly good for an Arnold Schwarzenegger film (excluding the first two Terminator films of course). It's a sci-fi film about an ordinary man whose life turns out to be a lie, or does it?In the beginning it isn't really explained that well but you begin to grasp the plot as it continues and the ending is very well written. The ending itself works really well because throughout the film you're trying to figure it out yourself. The ending does surprise you and has clearly been thought about in great detail by the writers as you don't really expect that ending. The sets and makeup are of course out-dated but the imagination used for the designs is a lot better than I had expected, particularly with some of the mutants on mars.The acting is pretty poor; it lets the film down unfortunately. Schwarzenegger is weirdly the only decent performance in the film; this may be because you already expect his acting to be poor anyway. It is poor but everyone else overshadows his lack of acting capabilities. Sharon Stone was definitely the worst; having never seen any of her work apart from in a few television shows she really appalled me. Luckily, she doesn't have a great amount of screen time but her scenes are really really bad!Overall, 'Total Recall' is certainly not the best sci-fi film ever but it's not the worst. It has strong violence and scenes of gore which you don't see much of nowadays in sci-fi or action films but it's not too much to divert your attention away from the story. The film is explained really well and is worth a watch.",6,0,3,8 September 2012
Pulp Fiction," A Modern Classic
","'Pulp Fiction' is seen as a modern classic. It scores 9/10 here because it really is a great film, it makes you laugh on more than one occasion and can become extremely violent within seconds.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the best characters in the plot, their dialogue with each other is hilarious. Jackson's monologues can be really frightening and he proves just how great an actor he is. Their part in the film is also probably the most violent. Bruce Willis' part is very brief but, again it can be quite funny and extremely graphic. It's difficult to tell whether he is good at acting in this film because he's pretty much playing Bruce Willis, he can play a different character in other films but his 'tough-guy' approach is also effective, it particularly suits this role well. Travolta and Uma Thurman's section is also very short but is incredibly well done, not just by the actors but by Tarantino's direction too. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth's short screen appearances are also very well written, their almost comic performances work great in this film.Overall, the plot can be confusing, you see characters die and then a few chapters later they're alive. Tarantino sets it out in a random order but at the end it will all make sense, this can put off some people and can make the film less enjoyable but the content of each 'chapter' keep you entertained and are genuinely interesting. The dialogue is, as is usually the case with Tarantino's work, very life-like. How he manages to get conversations in film so realistic and natural is amazing. The soundtrack is also really good, in some scenes it really adds either humour or dramatic effect.Overall, I would strongly recommend this film, it is a classic. If you've never seen a Tarantino film this would be a good place to start.",9,0,2,9 May 2012
Les Misérables," Truly fantastic
","'Les Miserables' is the film adaptation of the theatre adaptation of the novel by Victor Hugo. Directed by Tom Hooper (The King's Speech), it tells the story of Jean Valjean's (Hugh Jackman) – an escaped convict who adopts and raises a child in the middle of revolutionary France.The cast, on paper, is quite impressive; everyone will be a fan of at least one member of this ensemble it is that diverse. Thankfully, the great cast live up to everyone's expectations and do a really great job here. Hugh Jackman does well in this; he acts well, provides an extraordinary amount of emotion in crucial scenes and his singing isn't bad either. Amanda Seyfried did well here too but her character does not have a great amount of screen-time despite being the core of the film. Eddie Redmayne really surprised me here; he gives a truly fantastic performance and it is unfortunate that he does not appear to have had any award recognition for his work. Another surprising performance was that of Aaron Tveit, an actor I was not familiar with until I watched this. Of course, Anne Hathaway steals the show as Fantine. Her great singing and highly emotional scenes instantly win over people who aren't really fans of musicals. Russell Crowe is the only actor here who disappoints; you can't really expect excellent singing from everyone because they are actors, not singers. Russell Crowe obviously struggled to do the two things at once because everyone else manages to bring emotion to their scenes whereas his facial expression does not change at all when singing – I'm sure he would have given an admirable performance here if he did not have to sing but unfortunately he chose a musical in which all dialogue is sung. The endless singing can get on your nerves a little but only when it is not during a huge song piece and they are genuinely just singing bits of dialogue. These moments are few and far between though. It was very brave of Tom Hooper to decide that there should be live singing but it has worked out well and made the film a lot better than it would have been. 'Les Miserables' is almost three hours long but it is not a chore to watch, there is no point where you feel bored or that the plot is moving along slowly. The whole film builds up to a truly fantastic climax that raises everyone's spirits.Overall, this is a highly emotional musical which I think will bring them back into fashion. If they're all as good as Les Mis then I welcome them.",8,1,3,17 January 2013
In Time," Not a waste of time.
","'In Time' is one of those films that you enjoy watching but can't help but think there's something missing.The acting is generally good, Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are okay but it's the other actors like Cillian Murphy, Olivia Wilde and Alex Pettyfer who strengthen the film as a whole. The plot is very interesting; a world where the currency is time itself. Films set in a dystopian world are common but the intricate details of this film are what make it unique. The plot is discussed well in the film, there are no points where you find yourself asking questions about the reasoning behind the fact that time is used as currency, scenes where people discuss their lifestyle as being like 'capitalist Darwinism' are really interesting and give the story a better setting. Some parts of the story could have been developed further, however. Johnny Galecki's character should have been given more screen-time. When his off-screen death is announced you feel bad but they could have done a lot better with that aspect of the story. The dialogue was the main fault, there were some scenes particularly involving Timberlake and Seyfried where conversations were so basic and lifeless that it just didn't seem natural at all. Even some scenes with other characters involved discussions which lacked something, it was too obvious the conversations were scripted and not natural.Overall, I would recommend this film. It's thoroughly entertaining and there are no obvious flaws aside from some scenes where the dialogue is weak. It's a film worthy of watching, however.",7,5,7,3 March 2012
The Departed," A Brilliant Film
","'The Departed' is what Martin Scorsese claims to be 'the only film I've ever made with a plot'. It is excellent.The plot itself is based on a Hong Kong movie 'Internal Affairs'. Having not seen the original version I cannot comment on whether 'The Departed' is better or worse but as a film on its own it is brilliant. The story makes sense and is really intelligent. It's surprising just how many times the story can shock you with lots of twists and turns towards the film's climax.The cast on paper looks excellent and it certainly does not disappoint. Matt Damon rarely plays an antagonist but this film shows he is capable of just that. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a powerful performance and deserved an Oscar nod for this. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best of his career; his sinister portrayal of Frank Costello is certainly worth watching. The best performance however was that of Mark Wahlberg who's character provides so much comedy and gravitas to this film. He definitely stole the show here and overshadowed a lot of other great performances like those of Dicaprio and Martin Sheen.Overall, this film is fantastic. It's one of the best modern films I have seen in a while and it really did surprise me. A truly brilliant film that everyone should see",10,0,1,2 September 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Gripping
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is director Kathryn Bigelow's follow-up to the brilliant 'The Hurt Locker.' It's based on the events which led up to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. The film can be looked at from two angles; one is that the film is nearly three hours long and sections can go on for quite a bit. The second angle is that it's trying to tell a story which spanned over ten years and there's an awful lot of source material to try and squeeze into a film. Personally, I didn't mind the film's length; it was gripping, interesting, the acting was very good and the information revealed was useful and showed how painstaking the process was. However, three hours can be a long time for some people, regardless of the film's content. The script was very well written; the dialogue seemed realistic enough. It is split into chapters which works very well and means it's easier to keep up with the time line. The acting is a lot better than I had expected; Jessica Chastain was truly fantastic and I'm now rooting for her to win big at next month's awards. Even the smaller roles played by Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong, James Gandolfini and Joel Edgerton were very well done. One thing I will not however is the really weird cameo from John Barrowman in one scene. For British people and maybe some Americans this will seem really random and I honestly don't even remember what was discussed in the scene he was in. All I remember is saying 'Wait, is that John Barrowman? Why the hell is he there?' For what it's worth though, he does deliver his two lines very well.When it comes to controversy and this film I really don't get it. Yes, there are scenes of torture but they don't glamorise it or try and make it seem like it was crucial to finding Bin Laden. They show scenes of torture because, in the early 2000s, it was seen as acceptable in terms of terrorist treatment. It would have been wrong for Kathryn Bigelow to gouge it out of her script. Bare in mind, these scenes were set in a time where the then President Bush jr. did not see water boarding as a form of torturebut then, George Bush says a lot of ridiculous things. Anyway, torture is shown and it can be quite uncomfortable to watch but it needed to be in the film.Overall, the film is very good. If you like films like 'The Hurt Locker' or even 'Argo' then you will probably enjoy this. It's an interesting film with great performances and, given that the wounds Osama Bin Laden inflicted on the USA are still very raw, it is an issue that remains a huge talking point for people.",8,3,6,31 January 2013
Whiplash," A Very Well-Made Film
","Whiplash follows a first year music student who is talent spotted by the school's most fearsome teachers. Now one of the drummers in his class, Andrew (Miles Teller) is under pressure to become the best he can be, and more.Making a film solely about drumming at least somewhat interesting can be a difficult task because it is such a niche interest. Whiplash manages to make a fantastic film about drumming. Please do not be put off by this film's subject; even if you know nothing about music or drumming, this is still a thoroughly entertaining film to watch and enjoy. One of the reasons this film works so well is that the performances are all great. J.K. Simmons obviously steals the show as the terrifying Fletcher, whose rants are appallingly personal to the extent where you eventually start cringing at every drum solo, just waiting for him to stop the music and begin his bullying once more. Miles Teller also gives a great performance, although his hasn't received awards recognition, it is still a solid performance that proves he can do more than comedies.Of course, it is not just the acting in Whiplash that makes it so successful; the direction of this is so effective that you can literally be on the edge of your seat during some of the drum solos. The only way to describe these scenes is as being almost like action scenes. The camera work at these moments is so fast-paced it creates a fantastically tense atmosphere. These are the aspects of the film that make it so great, it is difficult to convince most people to go see a film about drumming but hopefully people will give Whiplash a chance.",9,1,3,5 February 2015
Scream 2," A Worthy Sequel
","'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie cliché's and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.",7,2,2,31 May 2012
Centurion," Don't expect another Gladiator...
","This film has been sitting on my shelf for over a year now unwatched. Yesterday, I finally sat down and watched 'Centurion' with no great expectations, I was just wanting to watch a film.The film is very good, the story works well without romanticising the Romans too much and portrays the Picts very well also. The acting in this film was great for the most part, especially by Dominic West who had too small a role, his humorous character provides a lot of comic relief from gory battle scenes and he was probably my favourite character. Michael Fassbender's role was amicable, he succeeded in certain aspects of his character such as the warrior in him but failed at portraying himself as a leader. As a fan of Michael's work. his acting was very good in this but not as great as he has been in other films. However, some actors like Noel Clarke (who was simply playing Noel Clarke) let the film down in certain scenes. Even Olga Kurylenko was good despite her character not saying one word throughout the entire film! Imogen Poots' brief appearance is also welcomed with a very realistic Scottish accent - as a Scottish person myself, there's nothing more fun than laughing at an actor's poor attempts at the accent but Imogen did her's very well and there was nothing to laugh at! The script can be quite predictable at some points which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you would like a little surprise here and there that isn't through the use of over the top gore. The gore in this film is the main problem I have. I certainly don't mind gore in films but it should be used when needed, not added in to places in fight scenes where, realistically, there would not be such a splash of blood!Overall, I would recommend this film if you are just wanting a good old-fashioned war film, but don't expect Gladiator because there are very few points in this film where you are moved emotionally. The film tries its best to be Gladiator-like (with dramatic music, slow motion fight scenes and tiny incidents of tragedy) but I think if it focused more on the film itself it would have been better.",7,1,4,4 February 2012
Scream," Anti-cliché
","'Scream' brought a lot of attention back to teen-based horror films. However, despite a lot in this genre being 'movie-trash', this film certainly is not. It's a black-comedy almost with a lot of now famous names included in the cast. The most famous at the time this was made (1996) was Drew Barrymore who doesn't last very long. This opening sequence to the film automatically made 'Scream' special. Throughout the film there are a lot of nods to teen-horror cliché's which are usually ridiculed. Mocking the typical teenage horror character stereotype is what made this film so unique and very funny. The script itself is often genius, the funny scenes can be really funny and the horror/frightening scenes do what they're supposed to do.Most of the acting is pretty good. Matthew Lillard is probably the best in the film, providing most of the comedy. Other performances like those of Courtney Cox and David Arquette are very good which is something you don't see too much of in horror films. The film overall is really worth a watch, apparently after this film was released sales of house-phones with caller ID doubled, you know that a film had that great an effect on people must be worthy of watching.",8,1,1,29 May 2012
Prometheus," Didn't quite live up to everyone's expectations
","'Prometheus' was the much-anticipated 'sort-of-prequel' to Ridley Scott's 'Alien' and was directed by him. The film doesn't quite live up to everyone's expectations but it is enjoyable as an independent sci-fi film. Even for fans of 'Alien' there are a few references dotted throughout the film and the last five minutes of it reference to 'Alien' significantly. The script was pretty good, there were some great action sequences and the special effects were at some points outstanding. The major let-down for this film was the character building. For main characters such as Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw and Michael Fassbender's David there was a decent amount but for almost all of the other crew members there was little or none. Without giving too much away there are points where you are to feel sorry for certain characters but you just don't because you hardly know them. Noomi Rapace was very good, not quite as excellent as Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley but she was a decent main character. Michael Fassbender was by far the best in this film despite playing an android, his performance was exceptional. Overall, I would recommend this film to both those who are fans of the 'Alien' films and those who have not seen any of them. You do not need to have seen them in order to understand the plot of this film.",7,0,2,4 June 2012
Step Up," Enjoyable
","'Step Up' is primarily a dance film with some great dance sequences included. A lot of people therefore criticise the acting in this film because it is pretty poor from most of the performers.With Channing Tatum it's difficult; sometimes his acting can be terrible, his face hardly shows any expression at all in some scenes and his dialogue is wooden. However, in other scenes - particularly with his adopted little sister - he acts fantastically and gives a real-life performance that seems so natural. He acts best in long discussions with people. Jenna Dewan (now Jenna Dewan-Tatum) is good, not great. She's a professional dancer so you cannot expect her to be outstanding at acting because it simply is not her profession. She isn't bad though, I certainly would not say her acting performance was bad, just not great. Her dancing is of course the best in the film, Tatum is really good too. The story is not that great, it's too clichéd as is the case with a lot of films about dancing. There are some moments where you think the story could have been a lot better if they had worked on key points. They bring in important themes to the film such as living a life of crime, youth tragedies, crime taking over neighbourhoods but they don't explain or spread these themes out enough for them to take a hold on the film meaning the themes are half-explained and you're given a 'happy' ending whilst you have all of these questions unanswered.Overall, the film is enjoyable. I would recommend it if you like this sort of film, it's a decent film to watch if you just want to eat popcorn but don't expect anything outstanding.",6,0,0,20 July 2012
The Woman in Black," Better than I expected
","'The Woman In Black' genuinely is a really good film, it's had a lot of publicity but for all the wrong reasons.It is Daniel Radcliffe's first film since the Harry Potter series ended and his performance is good, he doesn't stray too far away from Potter but there are interesting aspects of his character in this. For a start he is a father and is overall shown to be gloomy. I can't tell by Radcliffe's performance in this film alone if he will successfully distance himself from Harry Potter and be seen as a serious actor from here on. I think he will need to spread his wings a bit further if he wants to get rid of his type-cast. We will need to see some more future performances before we can tell. His and the other acting performances in this film were great.The acting is overshadowed by the frightening aspects of this film, the director and scriptwriter have done well converting this novel and play into a film. There are moments where it can be very predictable which is my main problem with this film, although there are points where you do not expect to be scared or to jump so the film can catch you by surprise occasionally.The ending is another problem I have but that is more to do with the story itself and is not really the film's fault so it's irrelevant. Overall, I would recommend this film if you are a fan of horror or thriller films and like films full of suspense. Don't watch this if you frighten easily and do not like films which make you jump.",8,4,8,27 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A Great Way To End The Trilogy
","'The Dark Knight Rises' is the final instalment in Christopher Nolan's trilogy. 'The Dark Knight' was extremely successful and was praised for its excellence. This means that TDKR had a lot to live up to.It did not disappoint; this film was a lot better than I had expected. There were a few points which made this film not as good as the previous film but it was still an excellent film.The acting was quite impressive; Christian Bale returned again to play Batman and Bruce Wayne, his character had to develop a lot more for this film and he has portrayed this very well. The film is set eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight' and so he has managed to get Wayne's character just right. Tom Hardy is this film's protagonist; he plays Bane who is quite terrifying in some scenes. He plays a completely different sort of villain to Heath Ledger's Joker. He's organised and his violence is a lot more manual with necks being broken and people being crushed. Hardy's performance in this was great and despite most of his face being covered by the mask it is still obvious he has worked hard on preparing for his role and he should be given a lot of credit for that. Anne Hathaway was great; she had a lot to make up for previous Catwoman performances which have not been good at all. She performs really well and has managed to give the character a more serious and believable side which has not been shown in other films. Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a larger role in this film than I had previously expected but he is a great addition to the cast and it is a shame he was only introduced in this film. However, his character is crucial because he shows how people have grown with Batman and what their perceptions of him are. Other performances by Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Matthew Modine and Marion Cotillard were also really well done. The script can be a bit confusing at the start but you manage to understand what's going on as the film continues. The one thing that did annoy me a little bit was Bane's voice; you can tell they tried hard to dub over it and clear it as much as possible whilst making it still sound as if the voice is behind the mask. Unfortunately there are some points where you just cannot understand what he is saying. Scenes where he is shouting are perfectly audible but moments where he is quietly talking to someone can be a bit difficult to understand. You become used to his voice but even by the end of the film there are still points where you can't hear what he is saying clearly. Aside from this the plot is really good; it's clever, interesting, fast and entertaining. I would not say the plot is an improvement on the second film but it is just as good as it. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for this film was a little bit disappointing; James Newton Howard decided not to work alongside him for this film and you can tell this. For the films' most crucial points however, Zimmer does do his job and the music can help create tension in places where it is needed. Overall, I would really recommend this film. It was a relief seeing it and realising it had managed to live up to all the hype it had received. Thankfully this film was not a disappointment and has ended Christopher Nolan's trilogy on a positive note.",7,2,6,25 July 2012
The Croods," Funniest Kid's film so far this year
","'The Croods' is DreamWorks' latest animated production. It involves a family of cavemen as they are forced to venture out into the open after their cave is destroyed. The story is quite well written; it starts with you thinking it is going to revolve around teenage girl Eep (Emma Stone), with her journey, falling in love blah blah blah. However, the story develops into one about how sometimes fathers have to learn lessons and acknowledge that they can be wrong about things. Although it is only a voice performance, Nicholas Cage is brilliant and provides 90% of the comedy here. You can tell he had a great time working on this film. As children's films go, this is probably the funniest one in a while, the story is not insultingly basic and it teaches some decent life lessons along the way. The only thing that really bugged me was the Belt character – I didn't get what was so funny about a small creature shouting 'dundunduuuuun!' at various moments throughout the film in scenes where it didn't really fit. It seems to be a necessity in children's films now to have a little sidekick randomly make a funny noise of come out with some naff pop culture reference these days.Overall, the film is probably the best kid's film out so far this year. There are a lot of really funny scenes and a couple of tear-jerking moments too.",7,1,1,29 March 2013
Blade Runner," An Excellent Film
","'Blade Runner' is often said to be one of the best sci-fi films ever and I can understand why.The story is excellent; based on Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' it talks about these artificial humans known as 'replicants' who have been deemed illegal on planet Earth punishable by death. Harrison Ford plays a blade runner whose job it is to hunt down and kill a group of rogue replicants. In the director's cut version the story is explained very well but it does drag out the story a bit too much. Acting in this production is mixed. You have some really good performances; like those of Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer who play replicants. You also get fairly basic and wooden performances from Sean Young and surprisingly from Harrison Ford who fails to evoke any emotion whatsoever in this. In the last ten minutes of the film where the pace really picks up with the chase scene between Ford and Hauer there is no emphasis in Ford's character which really let scenes down. Hauer gives an excellent performance, particularly with his final short monologue.Of course the special effects and music are now out-dated but they give the film a certain charm that means it still works today. The settings were excellent; Ridley Scott likes to do what he calls 'layering' in sets where he fills them with so much detail that they look real, this works great in this film. The dystopian setting where both night and day seem to look like the same thing and it constantly rains gives the film a great atmosphere and show just how great Scott is at his job. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend 'Blade Runner'; it's an excellent film with a few aspects that let it down. The story is really interesting, the acting is mostly great with some exceptions and the settings are amazing.",7,0,3,15 July 2012
Casino Royale," A Great Start
","'Casino Royale' is the first James Bond film starring Daniel Craig and it's a fantastic start for him. The acting is generally good; Craig gives a great performance as 007 despite concerns and he has made this role his own. Judi Dench returns as M and acts very well as expected; she also provides quite a lot of comedy throughout the film. Mads Mikkelsen plays a great antagonistic role here but more screen-time would have been better. Eva Green was a bit of a disappointment; her character worked well but Green spoke to quickly and quietly meaning it was difficult to hear most of her lines except from towards the end where the film is quieter anyway.The script was well-written but because the beginning and the ending are both so high-octane, action-packed and simply brilliant, the middle of the film felt a bit flat and sometimes ever boring. Overall, this is a fantastic film which I would recommend to fans of previous Bond films or even action film lovers who have yet to see one. 'Quantum of Solace' was a disappointment so let's hope 'Skyfall' will be as good was 'Casino Royale' if not better!",8,3,5,14 October 2012
Looper," A future classic
","'Looper' is a sci-fi time-travel film which follows an assassin on the run after failing to kill his future self. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) in order to survive the present. The acting is great overall; no one lets down the film here. Willis is good enough here but I wouldn't say it is his best performance; he still suits the role however and was a good choice. Gordon-Levitt was fantastic and has proved with this and 'The Dark Knight Rises' that he can perform well in action roles. However, the prosthetics on his face made it a bit difficult to judge his performance as they cover half of his face. There have been plenty of films where people have played the younger version of the same character in the same movie and have not had the same bone structure. Of course basic aspects of appearance such as eye colour have to be sorted but Gordon-Levitt's make-up was distracting throughout the first half of the film, so much so that the plot was nearly overshadowed!The plot is really clever; it's a bit tricky to get your head around but it has been explained well. Of course, you will spend the next few days trying to figure out whether or not everything does indeed tie together in the end but they do explain it well and there are no massive plot holes. Supporting characters such as those played by Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels were written really well and performed by great actors. Even Paul Dano's small character was a great inclusion in the film despite only being there for ten minutes. There are some really shocking moments in this film and some grizzly scenes too but nothing unnecessary and they do not have a negative impact on the plot or the picture as a whole.Overall, this is a really great film which will hopefully be regarded as a classic one day amongst sci-fi and film lovers alike.",9,0,4,6 October 2012
50_50," Make you laugh and will definitely make you cry
","'50/50' tells the tale of a young, healthy man being given the shocking news that he has cancer of the spine despite not smoking, and taking care of himself in general.This film really surprised me, I did expect it to be funny which it was, but I didn't expect it to be so powerful emotionally. It's based on writer Will Reiser's experience alongside Seth Rogen when he found out he had cancer. The acting in this film is pretty good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent, he provides a lot of laughs and can evoke so much emotion from the audience it is unbelievable. As the film reaches its end emotions heighten and he really out-did himself with this performance. Seth Rogen was also great, he of course had real-life experience of the story and you can tell. His character is really funny and is a real strong point for this film. Anna Kendrick and Bryce Dallas Howard both act very well in this too though it would be nice to see Kendrick have more of a chance to show her capabilities instead of playing nearly the same character in every film, she performed very well however. Angelica Houston's character is one of the best ones in the film and she acts superbly. Having to deal with her husband who has a form of Dementia and her son who has cancer is a very difficult role to perform and she did so very well and put a lot of effort into her performance. The script is really funny, there are moments where you will cry with laughter and other points where you will simply cry. I think the reason this comedic angle of cancer works so well here is because Will Reiser experienced it himself and knew exactly what points could and would be comedic and which points to really highlight and to show how difficult the subject is, with people suffering from similar illnesses dying around him.Overall, I would really recommend this. It is a prime example of how films that deal with this subject should be able to provoke the right reaction from the audience. It will make you laugh and it will definitely make you cry.",9,1,1,3 April 2012
300," All I can say is 'Wow'
","'300' is one of those films everyone tells you you have to see. I eventually managed to get round to watching it nearly six years later!I've always hated people being un-professional when it comes to reviews but, frankly, it was brilliant. If you have not watched this film, watch it. You will not regret it. The acting in this film pleasantly surprised me, Gerard Butler is not known for his excellent acting skills and though he desperately tried to hide his accent, I think the little hints of it worked very well in his angry monologues and spurring speeches. Michael Fassbender was great as usual, for his film debut, I can see why his career has taken off so well. Dominic West played a subtle villain very well, his calm and supposed democratic appearance was torn down in excellent form in certain scenes and he portrayed his character with great precision. Again, like a lot of his films, I wish he had a greater role in '300'. All of the other actors in this film performed well and I cannot find a specific actor who let down the film as a whole.Of course the setting can be a bit unusual at first but as it goes on you get used to the almost cartoon-like definition. It's quite refreshing seeing something like '300' because you cannot help but look at some of the great CGI scenery, as well as the slow motion action scenes. The script can be confusing, for example, the main villain has a tiny back story and it is very difficult to see why they are all fighting anyway. However, the dialogue is this films' greatest aspect. Forget the acting and the effects, it's the long monologues that really bring out the emotion. Particularly at the conclusion of the film, it is then when you truly realise how great this film was. Overall I would thoroughly recommend it. Even if you don't like war films or gory films you should still watch this, purely as a piece of cinema.",10,2,6,6 February 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Outstanding
","This film is fantastic; it's a film where you're picking up little clues along the way trying to figure out what's really going on. The performances overall are really good; the five victims all perform really well, the only one who was a bit pointless was that of Jesse Williams who plays the intellectual one. He didn't have much screen time and was a bit flat. Kristen Connolly, Fran Kranz and Chris Hemsworth were all great here. The best performances were from Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford; they provided a lot of comedy here and were a great choice for their roles. The script is outstanding; Joss Whedon has written a fantastic script that was both funny and really scary. As the film goes on you get a greater understanding of what is going on. Films where you're constantly trying to figure something out or what the film as a whole will mean are great and this is the perfect example of that type of film. Overall, this film really made me laugh but also gave me some nightmares. This has the right mix of comedy and horror which is usually really difficult to make a successful film out of. 'The Cabin in the Woods' is definitely going to be a classic among horror fans.",9,1,4,30 September 2012
Gladiator," Sets an example for future films
","'Gladiator' is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once. I would highly recommend it for anyone to watch simply because it does everything a good film should do:The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's role as Commodus where he becomes more and more creepy as the film goes on. Even Russell Crowe performs well in this film despite being a bit over-the-top in some scenes. The supporting actors of this film all perform well and there is no one in this film who lets it down.The scenery and set designs all work well too, despite the CGI Colosseum being over-sized, the interior sets are beautiful.The music is the main aspect of this film which is truly brilliant. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard did an excellent job with this film's soundtrack, especially the track at the end of the film. This film is also shot beautifully by Ridley Scott, with the slow motion sequences at the beginning in the battle against Germania being a good example but also the tiny slow motion shots of Commodus, revealing his evil character. The story is overall very good, there are no points in the film where you are left confused and there are not loose ends.Overall, I can see why this won Best Picture at the Oscars in 2000. It brings out emotion in viewers throughout its entirety and its tearful end will stay with you for a long time.",10,1,3,11 February 2012
The Great Gatsby," Surprisingly Faithful
","'The Great Gatsby' is the latest film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. It follows Nick Carraway as he meets a new crowd in illustrious 1920s New York City.The novel is a classic in American literature and it is seen as an unfilmable book due to its subtlety. Unfortunately, this means that there is no way everyone who read the book will be happy, simply because the characters are so interesting and everyone has their own different opinion on them. The book could be portrayed as quite dull but thankfully 'dull' isn't exactly Baz Luhrmann's style; the ultra-glossy look of the film works really well in portraying the time period. The costumes are beautiful and the soundtrack is bizarre yet it somehow works. A major problem was the CGI; there were some points where it was glaringly obvious and drew you out of the story. Gatsby's house, the ocean and some parts of New York City looked really cheaply made because of this (this may not be quite as noticeable if it is seen in 3D). Another technical problem I noticed throughout was with audio synchronisation; there were lots of moments where the words you were hearing were clearly not being said by the actors, it was poorly dubbed in this case. I wouldn't have mentioned it if it had only happened a few times but there were definitely more than ten occasions where I noticed this. The decision to show this in 3D is really odd; yes, with Baz Lurhmann his direction is highly visual but when you go to see and American classic novel adapted for film, do you really want a silly gimmick distracting you?This is one of the few films where there were no disappointments whatsoever in the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed Gatsby brilliantly and it is one of his best performances. It now seems obvious that he was the perfect choice for this role. Tobey Maguire also gives a great performance and managed to make me like him as an actor for a change! Carey Mulligan played Daisy well but her character was written to evoke sympathy from the audience, she wasn't as selfish and vapid as she was in the novel. Joel Edgerton was quite entertaining as Tom and really portrayed the character well. Initially, I was quite worried about Isla Fisher playing Myrtle but she did very well despite only being in the film for about five minutes.Overall, this is a very faithful adaptation; nothing major has been left out and the majority of characters were portrayed as they were in the book. However, almost everyone has a different perception of the novel so this may not be the case for other people. If you haven't read the book, this is still a very enjoyable film with some really heart- breaking moments as well as some comical moments too.",8,0,5,6 June 2013
Warm Bodies," Entertaining from start to finish
","'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of the zombies.The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better – there's depth to the characters, a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not expect. I am glad there were some scary moments, with zombies you expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but, I am surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen – the film entertains you from start to finish.Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this; it must have been difficult to do this role – especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good; it's nice to see a female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the mind- numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame because he can be really funny.Overall, this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary – particularly towards the end. However, the film is really nice, funny and even heart-warming sometimes.",8,130,175,16 February 2013
