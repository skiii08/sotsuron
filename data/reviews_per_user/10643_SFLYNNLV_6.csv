The Legend of Bagger Vance," Jack Lemmon's goodbye
","The overall production is okay.  Matt Damon is getting better with every film. Will Smith is okay.  Charlize Theron has been better cast.  Robert Redford should seek retirement or another film with Barbra Striesand.However, the uncanny end with Jack Lemmon commenting on his life as Bagger Vance and walking into death is riviting - considering this is the last film he ever made (that I am aware of) and the last scene in the film is of his death - prophetic?

The Sound of Music," One of the best ever made
",The best opening sequence of any american motion picture ever made.  I still get goose bumps as the camera pans the alps and drops to Julie singing the title song - a masterpiece!The music is timeless as is Ms (Dame Commander) Julie.I can watch this movie over and over again and be filled with joy.9/10 only because they never told us what happens after the Trapp's flee Austria - and that would have been a better conclusion.,9,1,7,5 August 2001
Memento," memorable, yes?
","I just don't know.  I was energized by all the hype for this film.  I found it rather flat and somewhat predictable.  And, I must admit, I fell asleep at least twice - thank God for DVD and I was able to replay it.I understood to a point and agree that going 'backwards' and challenging the audience is interesting and at least new to me.  However, this would have been better as a comedy - in the vain of 'Groundhog Day' than it is as a serious piece of film making.Guy Pierce is excellent as the man looking for his wife's killer.  His intensity was about the only reason I was able to get through the film. Good supporting cast as well.Memento is not a 'spectator' film.  You must watch everything and suspect everything.  Perhaps another time I will rewatch this endeavor and maybe understand it.Good luck to others who are considering seeing this and make sure you are fully awake - watch everything.3/10 for Guy Pierce and supporting cast.",3,2,3,17 September 2001
Pearl Harbor," Good, robust film not without flaws, of course
","5/10 For the awesome bombing scenes and the detail to actual history.  Ben Affleck hands in a reasonable performance as the dare-devil pilot who always manages to save the day (not Dec 7, 1941 unfortunutely).  Superb FDR by Jon Voight - only wished more of his characterization made it into the film. Cuba Gooding, Jr and Alec Baldwin perfectly cast and also wished additional footage.Josh Hartnett is too pretty to be a man and it takes from his character.  He is not believable as the dare-devil pilot wanna be.  This may not be his fault as the overall writing is fair to average and the inside plot of the triangle love affair is somewhat sit-com and poorly presented. Kate Beckinsale also works with poor dialogue and does her best as the woman caught between two men.However, the overall film gets a special boost and is timely considering the other date that will live in infamy - September 11th.  Pearl Harbor stimulates our patriotism in these troubled times and provides the needed justice we currently seek.  I would rarely join a movie with current events but I urge everybody to experience this film with USA in their hearts and I think you will see what I mean.Thank-God no sequel exists for this film.",5,0,1,10 December 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Rouge-a-rama
","1/10 - awful, worse, rotten.  A genuine waste of time except for Miss Kidman who manages to shine through this mess.To be honest, I only could take forty minutes of this rip-off-a-rama of a film.  This is like MTV at its worst.  The costumes and set design were magnificent and about the only thing worth while.  Forget this loser.",1,2,6,30 December 2001
Shrek," Wonderful
","7/10 because almost everything I've seen recently has been so poor Â– finally a movie (computer cartoon actually) that is overwhelmingly entertaining, visually spectacular, well written and directed.  This film (cartoon) is a must see for the entire family.The cartoon is blessed with the voices of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Mike Myers and an especially devious John Lithgow.  If they gave out Academy Awards for voice-overs, certainly Mr. Murphy and Mr. Myers would be in the running.  Perhaps the Academy should consider a special award for this little masterpiece.  Whatever.  The simple story of the outcast ogre and his hyperactive donkey out to rescue the trapped princess is wonderful.  The action and interactions never cease making this a super movie-going or movie rental experience.  The madness of Lord Farquat in trying to make a perfect paradise in which (the magic mirror tells him) only he can do if he marries a princess.  The social comparisons are obvious but never overbearing.  The quest of the ogre and the donkey is captivating. The rescue of the princess is an intense as can be and as surprising as well.  The sequence is excellent. I could go on and on.  Go see it for yourself and see what I mean.",7,1,2,3 January 2002
