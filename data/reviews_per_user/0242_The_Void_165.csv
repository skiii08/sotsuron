The Blair Witch Project," The worst movie of all time
","This film is horrific. It's horrific that it came fifth in Channel 4's scary moment poll; it's horrific that it got good reviews, and it's even more horrific that people actually like this trash. Quite simply, The Blair Witch Project is the worst film of all time. ...and yet somehow, while this film is on the same level of crappyness as films like Freddy got fingered and The Fast and the furious (except Blair Witch isn't as good as those two), I still get the feeling that someone is going to disagree with me.For the first part of this review, I will be doing things a little differently than usual. Usually I would write out my views of the film in paragraphs, however, this time, to highlight the misinterpretations that people have of this film, I'm going to show you what my TV guide's say:
Named and Shamed 1: 'What's on TV' (The UK's best selling TV magazine)
'Three student film makers get lost in the woods while investigating a legend. Forsaking special effects, this low budget documentary-style fright fest is a return to the basics of what screen horror should be all about - sheer terror'****/****Errrr...what? Excuse me, 'Sheer terror', pardon me if I'm wrong, but when I think of sheer terror, getting lost in the woods isn't the first thing that springs to mind. And where the hell did they get 'fright fest' from? I spent most of the movie waiting for something to happen, not being scared out of my wits. sheesh.Named and Shamed 2: 'Weekend' (The TV magazine that comes free with 'The Daily Mail' on a Saturday)'How does a film with a tiny budget, no stars and no effects become one of the scariest movies ever? Simple, by making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. That's the ingenious mind game carried off by this 1999 horror hit, which pretended to be the video diary of three film students lost in a Maryland wood'****/*****Well, first off, credit where credit's due, at least they didn't give it full marks. I'll talk more about the mind game thing later but I don't how that makes the film scary, so what something that's not scary but real is somehow scary now? When I was about 10 my grandfather videoed me playing football, that was real, but was it terrifying? No.I have a more simple answer for their question though: It doesn't.
Named and Shamed 3: Sky TV's information button'This terrifying film follows three student film makers who went in search if the Blair Witch only to discover the meaning of true horror'
I think this is my favourite of the three comments. 'the meaning of true horror', oh what? So the meaning of true horror is walking around the woods with a camera? sheesh, its ok guys, none of us have anything to worry about ever if that's as bad as it gets.
People seem to think that no gore, no special effects and no big shocks are a good thing. And they can be, if done correctly. Take Rosemary's Baby for example, there is a film that has no gore, no effects and no big jumpy moments, and it worked, know why? It has an idea behind it. The idea that a woman could be carrying the child of the devil is a genuinely frightening idea, it probes into the unknown, and that is a terrifying thing to do. Getting lost in the woods, not only doesn't probe into the unknown (people have been lost in the woods before); it's just genuinely not scary. Maybe getting lost in the woods with a man eating bear might be a scary thought, but just getting lost in the woods isn't. Ok, if you really did get lost in the woods it might be frightening, but for a film, I think we need a bit more plot than that.For a film to be good, we're not talking Oscar winner here, just merely good, it needs to have several things, including:a plot a decent script Direction Acting WatchabilityBlair Witch doesn't have any of these. Look:a plot - Plot? What plot? Ok, so we have a reason why they go in the woods, but once they get there, then what? Nothing happens except for them finding a few twigs and stuff hanging from trees. Lame. a decent script - I realise that they were trying to make things look real, which gives the effect that there isn't a script but whereas in most other films the script is used to move the story along, in this film all the script is a bunch of shouting and moaning. I mean, ok, fine you're lost in the woods but surely you wouldn't just sit there shouting at each other all day. Direction - I think it's hard to judge whether or not this was directed. It just looked to me like a bunch of bad camera angles loosely strewn together.Acting - Wasn't any. Watchability - I can't see any reason to watch this film. I mean watch the film again. It just isn't watchable, the way the camera(s) move is annoying, and it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Well, really nothing goes on. The movie's more boring than Streetcar.The producers of Blair Witch however realised that to sell a film, you don't need those five things, you just need one thing: marketing. And sadly, they were right.I remember back in 1999 when this crap....err...film was released. Out of nowhere came great reviews, spouting crap like 'it's terrifying'. I didn't go to see it as soon as it came out, but some of my friends and family did, and every single one of them came back saying that it sucked. However, I thought 'uneducated fools, what do they know?' and then guess what? I went to see it and they were right. It's a good job the film wasn't much longer, I reckon I'd have left if it were.Then we've got this mind game thing. About it being real footage. When I first went to see it this rumour was still ripe and I thought it was really real. Well, actually I was under the impression that this was a film based on actual footage, not the actual footage itself, but anyway, same difference. So how come I still wasn't in the least frightened? And how come even now, now that everyone knows that the rumours aren't true, why do people like the writers of my TV guides say it's scary? why why why? It's too boring to be scary.I suppose they do deserve some credit for pulling that off though, even I was fooled. But that's credit for the producers, not for the film itself. It's a shame actually that this rumour was done with this film, if it were done for a good film, movie history could have been made. What a waste.
Then we come to the 'utterly horrifying' ending. Well actually, last time I checked, a man stood in the corner while a girl drops a camera isn't scary, but it looks like I'm wrong again. It's horrifying. I realise that at the start someone said that's what happened to a kid or something, but so what? It's still not scary.One of the (many) main reasons why this film isn't scary is that non of the characters are engaging, or even likable, the audience has no reason at all to like them, so why would we care if one of them has to stand in the corner? Even if it was frightening, who cares? For a good example of something horrifying happening to someone, see The Wicker Man. The Wicker Man did a good job of making itself scary because the character of Sgt Howie was portrayed as being likable so the audience could identify with him, and so when his time came, we felt empathy towards the guy, but what did we feel here? Absolutely nothing.In conclusion, The Blair Witch can be summed up in 5 no's.
No effects No gore No shocks No stars NothingI give this trash 0/10. What? What do you mean I can't? Oh ok, fine, 1/10, but I'm being VERY generous. I even feel like upgrading every film I ever gave a 1/10 to a 2/10, just to emphasize how bad this was, but I can't be bothered.",1,14,29,21 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino enters Spaghetti Western mode
","The first part to Quentin Tarantino's overly violent and exploitative revenge epic was a love letter addressed to Japanese Pink films and Kung Fu flicks. This second part is his homage to Spaghetti Westerns. The main difference between the styles of the two films is the pace - while the original was fast and furious, this one is a much more thoughtful and drawn out affair and while that may intrigue some viewers more; I have to say that Volume 1 did more for me. Still, it's quite clear Tarantino surely knows how to make a bona fide cult film and thoroughly entertain his audience on the way - and this film succeeds in doing that admirably. The plot is very simple and follows on directly from the first film. Having ticked off the first two names from her 'death list', The Bride now closes in on the final three killers that ruined her wedding day - Budd, Ellie Driver and of course, Bill himself. The film follows The Bride as she tracks down the killers, also filling us in further on the story of the revenge and her relationship with Bill.The key to this film's success is really very simple - colourful characters and sharp dialogue. I have to be honest and say that I found the script for Kill Bill Volume 2 to be weaker than some of his previous efforts with much of the dialogue coming off as being extremely forced - but this is a comic book thrill ride at it's best and the characters themselves shine all the way through. As mentioned previously, the film is much slower than the first one, although there's plenty going on and the first hour and twenty minutes is a constant thrill ride complete with menacing characters and grisly situations (though nothing to rival the amazing climax to Volume 1). Of course, the entire two part epic is a build up to the central character carrying out the title's statement and Tarantino really had a lot of promise to deliver on with the ending. Anyone hoping for a spectacular face off (me for example) will be extremely disappointed, however. David Carradine does get lots of opportunities to justify his place in the film - he's by far the most natural actor in terms of how he delivers his dialogue and Tarantino rewards this by giving him plenty of interesting things to say; but the final showdown is over far too quickly. The film has other problems too; the biggest being some very silly and difficult to believe sequences (such as the flashback during The Bride's talk with Bill) that bring it down a little, but in spite of that; this is still a very good cult film that should not disappoint too many people that loved Volume 1.",7,0,1,12 July 2008
Walk the Line," Excellent biopic - better than most!
","I can't say that I'm a fan of Johnny Cash or that I know much about him - but there's something for everyone in Mangold's film, and you certainly don't need to be a fan of the country music legend to appreciate it. This is a film that is based much on the performances of its stars, and while I don't know how Johnny Cash acted; Joaquin Phoenix gives a great performance in leading this film. The fact that he sings Cash's songs himself makes it all the more impressive, and for an actor who hasn't produced much of note over the past decade or so; the performance works on a number of levels. Of course, it was Resse Witherspoon who took home most of the acting plaudits with her role as June Carter; and on the whole I'd say she deserved her 'Best Actress' Oscar award. Phoenix wouldn't have been a bad winner either; but it was near impossible for anyone to beat Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Capote portrayal. The rest of the cast is good, and Robert Patrick is the actor who stood out most for me. His role as Cash's father is a world away from his usual sort of casting, and he does really well with it.Pulling good performances from his cast isn't the only thing that writer-director James Mangold can be proud of himself for. Biopics tend to leave me cold, as they tend to want to follow the full life story of the subject, which ultimately ends in depression. Contrary to the norm, Mangold focuses on Cash's life while he popular, and although the film has its depressing moments; it ends on a real high. The climax to the movie is one of the most moving moments seen on screen over the last decade. The finale is genuinely heartfelt, and provides the perfect ending to a movie like this. The plotting is good, as it gives equal credence to both sides of Cash's persona; we've got the music side, and the human side. The film always feels very personal, and the director does a good job of offsetting Cash's personal life with his musical life; but at the end of the day, at its basis - Walk the Line is a film about the love between the country legend Johnny Cash and his sweetheart June Carter. Walk the Line is a movie that I can recommend to anybody - you don't need to be a fan of Cash or his music to enjoy this movie. And that's how a biopic should be.",7,0,1,19 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not constantly funny, but hilarious in places
","I have to say, I went into this film with high expectations. Borat was always the funniest character on 'Da Ali G Show' and Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a talented comedian, but somehow this film feels like an overlong sketch, and isn't as consistently funny as the segments on Da Ali G Show. However, that's not to say that Borat is in any way a failure - Cohen delivers his lines with brilliant comic timing, and there are several real standout moments in this film. Borat is presented as documentary made for Kazakhstan television, and the base plot is that TV presenter Borat is off to America in order to report on the cultural differences between the two nations. We are introduced to Borat first in Kazakhstan where he tells us of the seedy goings on in his local town. From there, we go with the Kazakhstan man to the USA, where he talks to various people before catching a glimpse of Pamela Anderson on Baywatch, and deciding to relocate the documentary to California; where he hopes to track down and marry the sinful Baywatch blonde.A lot of this film is like watching a train wreck waiting to happen. For example, at one point in the film; we discover that Borat is going to have a chat with a group of feminists, and it's not hard to imagine what's going to happen! Most of the humour focuses on the central character and the situations he gets himself into thanks to the fact that they apparently do things differently in Kazakhstan. The fact that the film relentlessly pokes fun at the Kazakhstan people means that I'm not surprised it wasn't well received over there, although I can't say it really bothers me all that much. The thing about Borat is that he's not poking fun 'his people', but rather poking fun at the world view of sensitive topics such as anti-Semitism, terrorism, homophobia and racism. Cohen's style of comedy puts the people being interviewed at the brunt of the joke, and half the time these people deserve this treatment for their extreme views (the rodeo sequence is of particular note in this respect). My main problem with this film is that it doesn't really leave a lasting impression on the viewer...although you have to respect the star for his willingness to constantly put himself in risky situations.",7,7,14,15 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Entertaining action romp and not much more
","Whether or not the Mission Impossible series needed a second sequel is debatable, but Tom Cruise and his ego obviously thought it did; and while this film doesn't exactly stink of brilliance, it has to be said that Mission Impossible 3 succeeds in providing a good old fashioned action romp, and I thoroughly enjoyed the two hours I spent watching it. Director J.J. Abrams seems keen to take more influence from Brian De Palma's original than John Woo's somewhat silly follow-up, and rather than all out action; this film features more on build-up and suspense before the over the top set-pieces kick in. It has to be said that a lot of the movie is as difficult to take seriously as its lead star, but then again; it is mission 'impossible', so you've got to expect that. The plot once again focuses on Ethan Hunt; the daring agent who has decided to hang up his rubber masks and various technical gadgets to settle down with his new wife. Of course, it's not long before he's back in the field and on the case of something called 'The Rabbit's Foot', a secret object being sold by a callous weapons dealer to an unknown buyer.Of course, the main point of this movie is to give an excuse for Tom Cruise to flex his ego, and the fact that every single sequence in the film is obviously designed to make him look awesome shows that quite clearly. This could be annoying, but even though I don't like Tom Cruise much; the film benefits from the same idea that made the first sequel fun to watch; that being getting to watch Cruise making himself look a little bit silly. Cruise is joined by series co-star Ving Rhames, who once again isn't given a lot to do. Phillip Seymour Hoffman effortlessly steps into the role of the bad guy, and given what we all know he's capable of; it's safe to say he sleepwalks through it. Of course, the performers aren't the real star of the show; as that accolade goes to the generous special effects budget, which is put to use well in a series of stunts, which are well shot and great to watch. A sequence on a bridge is of particular note, and the locations used offer a varied platform for the stunts to take place. The fact that a major plot point is left open at the end to create mystery feels lazy; but considering that this is a third entry in a series that I'm not a massive fan of, and that it entertained me throughout means that I have to give it a thumbs up overall.",7,4,6,24 September 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Decent lightweight thriller
","I've got to admit that I always enjoy a well put together little thriller, and while Lucky Number Slevin is far from brilliant; it's a constantly entertaining and quirky little thriller that managers to keep you guessing while delivering a lot to have a good laugh at. The quirky comedy styling is what really makes the film what it is, as Jason Smilovic's screenplay revels in its one-liners, which receive good feedback from the casual nature of the screenplay, which manages to stay relaxed in spite of the high number of plot twists. The film sets itself up very well through a barrage of seemingly unconnected events that prove to have a greater significance later on. Towards the start, we see Bruce Willis' cold assassin break the neck of a stranger in a waiting area, a number of people killed and, most importantly, a man named Slevin that arrives at his friend's flat after a barrage of bad luck. He soon hooks up with the girl next door, before being dragged off in his towel to see the local mob boss, who having mistaken him for his friend; requests a favour for the money owed to him.The film takes obvious influence from the many 'cool' crime flicks, headlined by the films of Quentin Tarantino. That being said, Paul McGuigan's film appears to realise that it is, in fact, lightweight fluff and this is an asset for the movie as it never tries to be too deep and allows it audience just to have fun with the audacious plot. The film does well in lulling its audience into a false sense of security, as every time we think we know what is going on; the rug is pulled from under, and there's another twist to enjoy. Sometimes this can be annoying, but since Lucky Number Slevin is so irrelevant in its plot and execution, it's more fun to simply believe everything that is thrown at you and enjoy the ride. The film benefits from a good cast of well known stars. Josh Hartnett is good in the 'good looking guy' role, while Lucy Liu is cute enough as the girl next door. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley sleepwalk through their respective roles, and the central cast is rounded off a cool turn from Bruce Willis as a sinister hit-man. Overall, I'm pretty sure I won't remember Slevin for long; but it's good while you're watching it, and provides decent entertainment.",7,0,3,27 August 2006
50 First Dates," Another miss for the memory loss love story
","I am a big believer that someday, somebody somewhere will finally get this idea of a memory based love story right. The 2004 darling 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' would make too many film fans say that it has already been done effectively, but frankly these people are wrong. Eternal Sunshine should have been so good that it hurts, but thanks to lazy writing and less that great direction, Eternal Sunshine failed. So what about this film then? Well, 50 First Dates doesn't have acting to it's credit like Eternal Sunshine did, but it's certainly a lot more fun. In the end though, it misses the mark just as much as Eternal Sunshine, but for different reasons. Basically, this is a film of two sides; on one side, it's a breezy romance and just about every scene with Sandler and Barrymore on screen together is a delight, as are the scenes that deal with Barrymore's memory loss. However, the other side of the film shows why rom-com's so often fail, and that's the lame joke side. Another thing I believe is that comedy is good way to portray a point, but not this sort of comedy. The silly humour distracts the audience from the central theme and that is where, and why, this film fails.It's a huge shame that this film didn't hit the mark. There's lots of genuinely touching moments on display, and the two leads regenerate that partnership that made The Wedding Singer such a fun ride. I don't often say this about fun films; but the film isn't serious enough. The comedy angle adds to the film during the scenes when Sandler makes Barrymore fall in love with him, but there's just too much childishness. Adam Sandler has started to mature a little since films like 'Happy Gilmore' and 'The Water Boy', and it shows in his performance. Many film buffs dislike Sandler, but I respect his ability to carry a film, even if he's not that great an actor. He did a fine job in P.T. Anderson's 'Punch-Drunk Love', and he shows some of that here. Ironically, in fact, Sandler is one of the less silly things about this film. Barrymore has basically been doing the same thing for the last decade and she does it again here. Still, she certainly isn't bad and it's nice to see her on screen with Sandler.I was really expecting to be writing positive things about a film that deals with love in a fun way, but in spite of the fact that it has good elements and a definite point; as I've said already, it spoils itself. The film is worth seeing for it's leads and lighthearted tone (it's set in Hawaii!), but I can't warmly recommend it. Ah well...maybe next time.",6,1,2,7 January 2005
The Ring," damp squib remake
","'Candyman, Candyman, Candyman'I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me.Japan: 1998. A little known horror movie was released under the name of 'Ring'. Ring wasn't a bad film, it wasn't a great film, it wasn't very original (though it wasn't a total rip off) or scary, but it wasn't rubbish. I gave it 6/10. A fair score.America: 2002. Hollywood smeared its glossy mits all over the Japanese film, and we were given: 'The Ring'.The Ring centres on the story of a video tape, and if you watch the tape, within seven days: you die. 'It's truly terrifying' said some guy in some review on amazon.com, 'What the f**k?' said The_Void just a second ago, a haunted video tape? Run away! Run away! Lame. What's next? A haunted mobile phone? Send a text and die? No, no how about a haunted can of deodorant, smell bad or die? Or a haunted website? Oh wait.Anyway, let's just ignore the lameness of the storyline for a second. The film starts off with two girls in a room and one of them tells the other one about a piece of film she has watched and that if you watch that film, within seven days, you die. That was seven days ago. I'm sure I don't need to spell out what happens next...the girl who watched the tape dies with a silly look on her face and the other one goes insane. I just hope she never meets my friend, he can do this really strange face where he sort of scrunches his lips together and goes cross eyed, Eek. The one here sucks, though.Think that was bad? sheesh, that was the best bit.This film is probably better for the people who saw it before seeing the original. The reason for that is that this film is almost a carbon copy of the original, which is understandable because that's the nature of remakes but in the move from east to west, they forgot to transfer the two best things about the original: its look and holes in the story. The original was nice and grainy, which made it all the more frightening. I mean, OK, its hard to scare when your centrepiece is a haunted piece of plastic but the grainy picture and the darkness of it went some way to making it frightening, the fact that it was glossy meant that the picture was clear and easy on the eyes, and therefore the scares were kept down to a minimum. Which is a good thing in say, a kids movie for example, but not in a horror.The second thing: The holes in the story. Usually plot holes are looked down on, but I don't mean plot holes, I'm referring to the fact that the original left several stones unturned, or only partially revealed. I think that someone forgot to tell Hollywood that sometimes the unexplained is more scary than the understandable, after all that's everyone's principal fear: The great unknown.The main meat of the story comes when a reporter (Naomi Watts) inadvertently views the video tape, then lets her friend watch it, and then her son watches it without her permission (typical kid). Naomi and her friend then have seven days to avert disaster, and save the life of her son. They do this by tracking down the origin of the haunted video piece of plastic and finding out about the girl in the tape, Samara. To the films credit, it moves at a nice pace, and keeps your interest fairly well. Then again, that's to the credit of the original really, not the remake.To my knowledge, this was my first encounter with Naomi Watts. I can't say I was impressed. I mean, her performance in this wasn't bad, and it may be my contempt for the film that's clouding my vision, but after all the great things I'd heard about the woman, I was expecting more. More did come however on my viewing of 'Mulholland Dr.' and wow, what a step down from that to this, eeek, what was she thinking?However, despite all the negativity so far, even this film has plus points, two of them in fact. The first one is the direction. In my opinion, the film is a credit to Gore Verbrinski, his directing is nicely done and the use of the camera is solid, it's just a shame about the rest of the movie. The second good thing about the movie is the soundtrack. The soundtrack itself is nothing to write home about, in fact I can barely even remember it, but at least it didn't resort to lots of heavy metal with a strong bass line like in so many other modern horror movies, that sort of music doesn't go down well at all in my opinion.The film's ending is another one of those predictable twists in the style of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'The Others', you know, the ones that everyone likes. After Naomi and co have solved the mystery, they think all is well and they all go home. However, all is not well as Naomi's friend finds out when Samara comes out of the television set in one of the stupidest movie moments of all time and gets him. I couldn't have been the only one who saw that coming.",5,1,7,13 November 2003
Spartacus," Very good entertainment
","Due to the fact that the great director himself didn't write it, many film fans don't consider Spartacus to be a part of Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre that is on par with the many great classics that he has given to cinema. While it is true that Spartacus isn't as good as films such as A Clockwork Orange or Dr Strangelove, it's still a fine piece of cinema and it also represents one of the better epics to come out of Hollywood, and despite the fact that he didn't write it and didn't get as much freedom as he usually likes, Kubrick has still managed to inject his own style into the picture, which is at least somewhat responsible for the fact that this is more than just the standard blockbuster. The film seems to be played mainly for entertainment purposes than anything else, and it's lack of themes is testament to that fact; but Spartacus does give the viewer a comment on nature of freedom, and also a comment on what goes into the making of a hero and a legend. The famous 'I am Spartacus' scene sums the latter part up nicely.In my opinion, Kirk Douglas wasn't the right choice for the lead in this movie. Even when he's covered in grit, he still looks too polished to play the heroic lead and on the whole his performance isn't one of the best things about this movie. Kubrick isn't too good at casting actresses; that was more evident in 1980's The Shining, but you can see it here also. Jean Simmons doesn't do very well opposite Douglas, and in every scene she's in she looks either uncomfortable or incompetent. The acting isn't the most important aspect of this film, however, as it's the history surrounding the story that is. The battle scenes are brought to the screen with the greatest of care and the result is a screen spectacle indeed. The story surrounding Spartacus and his slave army is always going to be interesting, and relevant, as it can be paralleled with a number of historical events. This film may be given a new lease of life these days due to the success of several recent historical epics, but trust me; Spartacus is a hell of a lot better than the likes of 'Gladiator'.",8,3,5,10 May 2005
United 93," Dull first hour gives way to a more engaging final third
","I have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that this film was being made as while there have been countless films based on real life tragedies, the events of 9/11 only happened five years ago, and I side with those who think it was too early to have the plight of the victims turned into a film. However, everything controversial is of interest me and so I decided that I would watch the film. This sort of film is on the back foot from the beginning, as the writers don't have the element of surprise where the plot is concerned, and so have to rely on other means to ensure that the film is interesting. United 93 is something like a dramatised documentary, and recounts the events leading up to the crash of the fourth plane; the only one that didn't hit its target. I can't say how realistic the dramatisation is as I wasn't there and haven't seen any documentaries on the disaster, but basically what we have is a plane full of passengers deciding to take on the terrorists and attempt to regain control of the hijacked plane.The first hour of this movie is really rather boring, as we mostly centre on various organisations as the tragedy of the planes hitting the world trade centre escalates through America. I see this as a movie of two halves; we have the moot first hour, and then the engaging and climatic final third, in which the action changes to the plane of the title. In terms of cinema, what happens on the plane isn't all that exciting; and there are better and more entertaining disaster films than this one. Of course, the fact that it's a real life drama has to be accounted for, and it is not the action but the underlying hope that makes the final third of the film such a good watch. Even though we know how it is going to end, director Paul Greengrass manages to make sure that the audience are hoping that everything will turn out well alongside the doomed cast of characters. The reason I cannot give this film a high rating, therefore, is because I didn't like two thirds of the film. The events of 9/11 was one of the greatest tragedies of the last one hundred years, and so this film has a lot riding on its shoulders. Did United 93 do the tragedy justice? Overall, I don't think so.",6,0,5,14 November 2006
Deja Vu," Messy, and should have been better
","It's obvious that the whole point of this film is to incorporate the time travelling idea into a plot, but unfortunately the plot itself therefore got left behind and what we end up with is a fairly cool idea wasted by a messy and rather boring central plot line. The idea behind this film is not all that original - time travelling has been done before, and while I tend to avoid films revolving around the subject; I haven't seen anything done quite like this before, and the film deserves some sort of kudos for that. The plot focuses on an explosion on a ferry which kills over 500 people. The explosion is soon deemed not to have being caused by naturally, and AFT agent Doug Carlin is assigned to investigate the case. The body of a woman, apparently killed in the explosion, but who had actually died an hour before is uncovered and the AFT agent believes she is the key to solving the case. He is then invited to join a new surveillance team, which uses new technology to follow the woman during the time before she was murdered...Denzel Washington is in very familiar territory; having played a copper so many times it's hard to imagine him doing anything else. The main plot presents a problem for this film; it's always going to be difficult for something like this to really convince, and the plot here doesn't - or at least not really. It's not a flaw that had to be fatal for the film, but it becomes such because there really isn't all that much excitement to go with it. The best action sequence in the film sees Denzel chasing the culprit, only the culprit happens to be four days in the past. It works fairly well, but as you might expect; it's difficult to totally go along with. Too much of the film takes place in the lad where the central characters are watching the action unfold, and it's not very exciting. We don't actually find out what the new technology is until about half way through, and once we do find out what it is, the rest of the film seems rushed. I think more could have been made of this; Deja Vu really needed a solid plot and some more interesting scenes, so despite a few good ideas; this is a failure overall.",5,0,1,19 November 2007
Finding Neverland," Silly message, but not a bad film
","I've become so dismayed by the quality of the recent crop of 'A-class' dramas that I now go into them with zero expectations, just to avoid disappointment. Finding Neverland, however, surpassed my expectation of zero and, to my surprise, turned out to be quite a good film. It's not brilliant, nor is it a masterpiece but it's definitely worth a watch and is certainly one of the better films to be released recently. The crux of the story is fundamentally flawed, as it professes that is anything is possible if we 'believe', which is, of course, a blatant falsity as anyone that has been alive longer than five minutes will know. The film appears to realise this somewhat however, and this is shown through it's ending, which lends the film some extra credibility. In spite of unrealistic message, Finding Neverland is still worthwhile as the magic of the plot does shine through and even though we know it's not realistic; we can still believe it. Don't you just love irony?Johnny Depp is certainly one of, if not the, best actor of today and he shows that in this movie. His performance is charismatic and fun, and you can tell that Depp is an artist that really enjoys his craft. He is matched by a woman that is one of the best actresses working today, a certain Kate Winslet. Aside from being beautiful, Kate has matured as an actress since films like Heavenly Creatures and her blip with Titanic and she shows that with a prime performance in this movie. Even the child actors do well in this film, which is a rarity indeed. Even more so since they're not THAT irritating. The film is notable for the way that it portrays it's central characters' fantasies, which is both inventive and fascinating, and thus lends the film an atmosphere of intrigue. The film isn't quite as magical as it thinks it is, but the magic is increased and the film becomes quite potent because of the way that it portrays it's plot. It stays away from the pitfall of fake sentiment that so many movies fall into and keeps itself alive with the strength of it's characters. Overall; not bad!",6,0,1,24 March 2005
Lifeboat," A lesser-known Hitchcock masterclass!
","Hitchcock made a lot of great films, many of which have been met with the acclaim that they rightly deserve. Lifeboat deserves a lot of acclaim, yet its lesser-known status doesn't allow justice in that respect. This film represents one of Hitchcock's major successes in scene setting and drawing the audience into the story. The way that Hitchcock uses his camera aboard the lifeboat is amazing, as by keeping the action on the claustrophobic craft, the great director ensures that his audience is always plugged into the plight of his characters; which helps the film no end when it comes to the story, as we know their situation at all times. In fact, it's amazing just how well Hitchcock does do this; while they were starving, I was too! The plot is simple, yet a great base for a wartime thriller. We follow the surviving members of a crew from a ship that was bombed by a German U-Boat. They're crammed onto a small lifeboat, but there's one survivor that isn't quite welcome. His name is Willy, and he's a survivor of the U-Boat that sank the ill-fated ship.Given the time when this was made (towards the end of World War 2), it's hardly surprising that it's filled with propaganda. Usually, this annoys me; but here it's done really well, and the propaganda is actually worked into the story instead of just being there to rally the allied population at the time. Hitchcock turns this into a twist, and the way that he parodies the war on the whole on just a small lifeboat in the middle of the big ocean is great. The entire film takes place on just one single set. The action never leaves the lifeboat (aside from to pan around the surrounding area), but Hitchcock uses this to his advantage. The lack of locations really enforces the crew's isolation. The acting is melodramatic in typical forties fashion; but all of the cast members do well in their roles. Tallulah Bankhead takes the lead role and really is the linchpin of the movie. She is joined by the likes of William Bendix, Walter Slezak and John Hodiak, who give great turns despite not being A-class actors. Overall, this is a Hitchcock film that I would say is just as important to see as the likes of Rear Window and Strangers on a Train. This is Hitchcock at his best, and the film is a great ninety-five minutes to boot. Don't miss this one!",8,20,25,30 January 2006
Unbreakable," Unbreakable - what a load of twaddle!
","I seem to remember my opinion of M Night Shyamalan going up slightly after watching this. Not that Unbreakable was any good - just that it was a hell of a lot better than the God-awful The Sixth Sense. Rewatching bad films isn't something I make a habit of doing, but this one came on TV at a time when I didn't have control of the remote, and since I remembered the film being the best of Shyamalan's works, I didn't run for the hills. Anyway, I'm not quite sure what I was thinking upon my first viewing; as not only is Unbreakable a stupid and rather boring film, it's also completely pointless, riddled with plot holes and fails to make it's audience care about anything they've spent over one hundred minutes watching by the time it ends. The film starts by showing the audience a baby with a bone disease. From there, we move onto a train accident in which David Dunn is the only survivor. He is sought out by a man named Elijah Price - the grown up version of the baby at the start. Price is a comic book aficionado, and has a theory about Dunn's miraculous survival - he believes Dunn to be a real-life superhero...Comic books aren't such a big thing here in England, so maybe this sort of thing will mean more to Americans; but even so, that doesn't disguise the fact that this is a story that doesn't really work in a modern context, and it's one that requires it's viewer to have the mentality of a young teenager in order to buy into what's going on. The plot requires the unlucky viewer to suspend their disbelief on numerous occasions, and this faith is never rewarded. Given Shyamalan's track record, it's obvious that this film is leading up to a big surprise ending, and not only is the ending not a big surprise - it's entirely stupid and doesn't make one once of sense if you think about it. It would seem that Shyamalan does respect his audience at all, and this is shown by the fact that he gives us any number of motives that no one in their right mind would harbour, and expects us to believe in them! The finale for the central character is simply dumped on the audience and feels pointless for that reason, and not even the star profiles of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson can save this one. Unbreakable is a great big joke...which isn't even funny since I've sat through it twice.",3,2,11,4 February 2007
Monster," Great performances in an off-centre film
","Films about real life serial killers aren't exactly rare, but the story of Aileen Wuornos stands out from many others because it turns the common serial killer story on its head. It's well known that most serial killers are white males aged between twenty five and forty; so the fact that this killer was a woman is notable, as is the fact that Aileen Wuornos was a prostitute who killed men, when it is more commonly the other way around. Wuornos' story is well worth telling, therefore, and the fact that this film was an Oscar contender means that it received good handling and is bolstered by a pair of truly great performances from two top actresses; yet somehow, Monster isn't a great film and falls short of the high standard that many other biopics have set. The plot revolves around prostitute Aileen Wuornos' meeting with Selby; a young lesbian hanging out in a gay bar. We follow the pair as they skip from motel to motel, and we find out what drove Aileen Wuornos to a series of horrible crimes, in which she killed potential clients for their money without having to have sex with them.The main reason why this film fails is because of the perspective. In any real-life serial killer biopic, no matter what reasons there were for the crimes, the killer has to be the antagonist. However, director Patty Jenkins has seen fit to make Aileen out to be a victim, and while it's evident that she had a bad life; her crimes were horrible nonetheless, and the happy 'feel good' tone of the film is abysmal in the way that it offsets the seriousness of the killer's crimes. The plot plays out like a serial killer flick fused with a romance movie, in the way that it portrays its central pair, and it's obvious that the director wanted us to feel for the plight of the lead character. Credit where credit is due, however; Patty Jenkins gets great performances out of both of her stars. The usually glamorous Charlize Theron is unrecognisable as the 'monster', and gives a brutal and realistic portrayal of the character. Christina Ricci hasn't made a lot of good films recently; but her performance here is faultless, as she brilliantly delivers a performance that takes in all the insecurities and naiveté's of her character. Overall, this film is worth seeing for the lead performances and for the basic plot line, which is interesting; but it's a shame that it wasn't given better handling.",6,1,2,11 July 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino does World War II with Glourious results!
","I have to admit that I've not always been the biggest fan of everything that Quentin Tarantino has released; but I have always admired the man both for making exactly the films he wants, and for trying his hand at different genres. World War II was not the obvious place to go, and it becomes even less obvious when you take out any ties to actual history and replace it with a black comic surreal style that is fleshed out with absurd characters and intense violence; but Tarantino has done just that, and for me has masterminded the best film of his career! Tarantino himself calls this a 'men on a mission' film, but really it's much more than that and the film would better be described as a World War II themed ensemble. The bulk of the film takes place in 1944 and the stage is set in Nazi-occupied France. A group of Jewish-American soldiers nicknamed 'The Basterds' have been dropped into enemy territory in order to hunt down and kill as many Nazi's as possible - a task they carry out with relish. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Nazi's are holding a film premiere in a small theatre in France owned by a Nazi hating French-Jewish girl. Naturally, the Basterds soon take an interest in the event - since every major Nazi will be in attendance - but their plans to spoil the Third Reich's evening coincides with those of the theatre owner...who has a revenge of her own in mind.Like most of Tarantino's films, this one is executed in chapters - there are five of them and they all follow in chronological order. Each chapter has a distinct style and purpose and in fact each one could almost be a film within itself. Tarantino sets the benchmark immediately with the first scene - an intense sequence that sees ruthless SS Officer Hans Landa turn up at the house of a French farmer whom he suspects of hiding Jews. This scene is unbelievably intense; Tarantino expertly builds the pressure throughout the scene until it finally reaches boiling point in spectacular fashion. That's basically the crux of the film; each sequence featured is completely gripping and intense, and this makes the two and a half hour running time fly by. The film is peppered with Tarantino's trademark sharp dialogue, (which is featured in English, French, German and Italian!) and it is unbelievably good - almost every line uttered is infinitely quotable, and each of the conversations between the many characters is interesting in its own right. Every scene appears to have been meticulously planned to the finest detail – and there honestly isn't one moment in the entire film that isn't extremely well done. I'm also amazed at how funny the film is – several sequences in this film wouldn't be out of place in a comedy, and yet they blend seamlessly with the intensity and violence on show elsewhere.Throughout his career, Tarantino has excelled at casting the right people for the right roles; and Inglourious Basterds is another success on that front. Brad Pitt is the biggest star name in the cast, his Lieutenant Aldo Raine is a gloriously over the top stereotype and Pitt pins down the role fabulously. However, it is in fact Austrian actor Christophe Waltz who comes out of the film with the most praise; his subtly psychotic portrayal of SS Officer Hans Landa is absolutely brilliant and will surely go down as one of cinema's great villains. The mesmeric French actress Mélanie Laurent also stands out (both for her beauty and acting), and there's also memorable roles for Michael Fassbender, Til Schweiger (his awesomely cool character doesn't feature enough!), Diane Kruger and Hostel director Eli Roth, who gives a surprisingly effective performance as a baseball bat wielding lunatic nicknamed 'The Bear Jew'. All of the central characters are very well written and Tarantino excels at getting the point of all of them across, even though the screen time is generously shared between them all.Rumour has it that Inglourious Basterds was ten years in the making, and I can say that the wait was worth it! I really am struggling to comprehend just how amazingly brilliant this film is. Tarantino has made a movie the likes of which has never been seen before, and if a better movie than this one is released in my lifetime, I will be surprised.",10,6,18,1 September 2009
Underworld," Entertaining action fare...
","Vampires and werewolves in a Romero and Juliet style story? When you think about it, Underworld really should have been great; but despite being disappointing on the whole, special effects guru turned director Len Wiseman has still managed to turn out a good film. In fact, he's done quite well; as when you consider that Underworld is a story of a century old war, a love story, a Matrix-style actioner and sees the creation of a 'new' monster, it could have been a hell of a lot messier than it is. It's clear that Wiseman thinks this movie is better than it is, as it constantly takes itself too seriously and the frequent attempts at storytelling try to hard to create a story around the vampires and werewolves; but on the other hand, the mythology is well done and I'd rather Underworld be too serious than a complete joke. The plot, as mentioned, follows a war between vampires and werewolves. It's been going on for ages, but there's been a new development in the form of Michael; a 'carrier' who could become the link between the two warring sides.Visually, the film looks great. It can be said that it looks a lot like a music video, but the slick dark visuals bode very well with the action set pieces, and music video or not; at least the style suits the film. The star of the show is very much Kate Beckinsale. I like her anyway, but she looks far hotter in this movie than in any others I've seen her in previously or since. The movie makes the best of having this fine lady wearing a tight cat suit and long leather coat, and although it does this so much that a lack of other ideas becomes obvious; I really aren't complaining. The rest of the cast is mostly made up long haired, 'European' men, with only Bill Nighy standing out among them in his role as a vampire elder. The action set pieces are way over the top, yet always entertaining, and since vampires and werewolves don't really exist...they can be forgiven for going overboard. The special effects are pretty good too, considering they're CGI. They're almost always shown in darkness...but I prefer dark and good, to clear and rubbish. On the whole, this really isn't great. The romance is hardly touched on, there's better action in The Matrix and it's a little messy; but I really enjoyed it, Kate Beckinsale is awesome and it's entertaining on the whole.",8,1,2,18 January 2006
Shakespeare in Love," Not big and not clever
","Fair enough, 1998 may not have been the best year for Oscar contenders, but there were definitely some better movies than this out. Why not give the prize to Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore', or Todd Solondz's 'Happiness'. Why not be really controversial and look overseas, Sweden's 'Show Me Love' and Germany's 'Run Lola Run' are fabulous examples of film-making...and no doubt all films mentioned are massively superior to Shakespeare in Love. The Academy awards had already embarrassed themselves and proved that their shiny golden statuettes aren't worth the stand they're presented on with the handing over of 'Best Picture' to the abominable 'Titanic' over the massively superior 'LA Confidential', among others. I would have thought that they would want to redeem themselves in the eyes of their loyal followers the next year, but obviously they simply don't give a damn. In spite of having a good premise; a love story that fuses the central themes of Romeo and Juliet with events from the famous author's life, the film simply falls flat. It's a tedious and rather dull affair.I'm not saying that the crew didn't try to make the best of it; it's got energy and a camp style that would have been great if it wasn't out of place, but something is wrong and the movie just cant seem to give itself what it needs to succeed. Too many British films seem keen to implement camp British humour, and although it works now and again; it certainly doesn't always, and it is that implementation that is this movie's main vice. Because of it's campy style, it is difficult, if not impossible, to take the central romance seriously and because of that the film is never going to work. The humour does give the film an element of originality, but unfortunately it's one element that it is better off without. The cast is impressive, as it features a wealth of talent, but none impress much. Joseph Fiennes doesn't have enough charisma to take on a meaty role such as Shakespeare himself, and Gwyneth Paltrow simply looks out of place among the rest of the cast. On the whole, the film is neither funny nor touching and since those are things it strives to achieve, it fails.",5,6,11,22 May 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Terrible remake.
","The original Dawn of the Dead was a commentary on society; and this remake is too. Only this time it's a commentary on the fact that attention spans are getting shorter. The zombies move at lightening pace and the film is edited together like something that you would expect to find on Mtv (the scenes set to music only reinforce this view). This is all wrong; zombies don't move fast, they're slow; and Dawn of the Dead is supposed to be a horror movie, not a quick-edited action fest. What's going on?! The original Dawn of the Dead also selected it's characters wisely, and made them all unique and interesting, but the remake suffers from what I like to call 'Alien 3 syndrome', which is where a film introduces masses of characters and forgets to make a single one of them interesting, rendering them all just pawns for the central monster to eat. Now while this is fun because most of them do get eaten, it sucks because there is no tension since you don't care about them anyway. Which makes for a pretty boring and repetitive movie really.Ving Rhames replaces Ken Foree (who himself has a cameo) as the main character in the mayhem, and does a pretty good job with it. Rhames is a big man and he has a very cool look about him, so it's fun to see him shooting zombies. That's one of the only good things I have to say about the film. Starring alongside Ving is Sarah Polley. Sarah looks nice, and obviously has fun with the role; but doesn't really make an impression. The rest of the cast aren't worth a mention, with one exception; Matt Frewer. This guy is one of my favourite smaller actors, but he's in the film for all of about five minutes. Damn. The main reason why the cast isn't able to impress is that they simply don't serve any relevance to the plot at all, rendering the human drama element null and void, and therefore making every moment without zombies incredibly boring. The film follows pretty much the same path that the original did with a bunch of people holding up in a shopping mall, only this time there's some attempt to escape. On the whole, for a film that supposedly depicts the falsity that remakes are a good idea, this film is a massive disappointment. There's so much that still could be done with the idea of zombies, in spite of the greatness of the original Dawn of the Dead, but this film hardly attempts to capitalise at all. There's some nice moments of carnage, but overall; this is an enormous disappointment.",2,13,27,4 December 2004
Mississippi Burning," Excellent thriller with a profound message
","Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is a surprisingly good police thriller that mixes the intrigue and mystery of a police investigation with a commentary on American culture in the 1960's, and said people's attitudes towards racism. It's rare for a film to combine these elements properly, and many have failed at it, but through it's efficient pace and competent piecing together, Mississippi Burning achieves it's aim admirably. Mississippi Burning is a very professionally handled film and credit for that has to go to the director, who has a habit of putting together very professionally made films. The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings. In spite of it's turbulent plot, Alan Parker never sets out directly to shock the audience, and despite several scenes of violence, it's always the film's plot that takes centre stage and Alan Parker doesn't stray from that as many other directors have done. This film doesn't need to shock and offend to get it's message across.The plot follows the disappearance of three men - two of them white Jews and the other a young black man. We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance. The acting in the movie is strong throughout, with William Dafoe and Gene Hackman heading a strong cast. The two stars do a great job of drawing the audience into the movie, and the two shine throughout. They are joined by a host of lesser-known stars, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky and a great little turn from Michael Rooker as a racist KKK member. The themes that are implemented into the plot are impressively portrayed, with the social study being the most prominent of them. Mississippi Burning adequately denounces hatred, and does a great job of getting across the stupidity and pointlessness of it. The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling. My only real criticism of the movie is due to it's ending, which goes on a bit and kills the atmosphere that the film has done such a good job of creating. Still, this is a very good movie and one I don't hesitate to recommend!",8,2,5,28 March 2005
Shaun of the Dead," An original and refreshing fusion of two genres
","In 2003, Britain tried it's hand at the zombie film; and failed, with the frankly miserable '28 Days Later...'. Then the zombie sub-genre was given another film in 2004; the hugely disappointing remake of the classic 'Dawn of the Dead', and both of these things were leading me think that this parody of the zombie genre might miss the mark as well; but suffice to say, this one doesn't disappoint. If you're expecting to be rolling around on the floor laughing at this movie, you'll be disappointed, but although it's never hilarious, it does keep itself going with a series of giggles, which is sure to delight any viewer. The plot follows Shaun; a young slob that spends most of his time drinking in the pub and playing video games with his even lazier friend. When his girlfriend dumps him on the grounds of him being an unreliable loser, he thinks it's the end of the world....and actually, it is; as, for some reason, the population of London has been transformed into flesh eating zombies and it's now up to Shaun, with the aid of his trusty cricket bat, to save the day! I often find myself disliking films that spoof the horror genre as there's just something I don't like about someone taking the Michael out of something I love, but some of the sequences in Shaun of the Dead really are inspired moments of comedy. The parts that see the Shaun go about his daily business,completely unaware that people around him are eating each other show a rare brilliance that few comedies have ever matched. As you've probably heard, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have labeled this film a'RomZomCom', which, of course, means that it is a romantic comedy, with zombies. That's almost exactly what it is, with the romantic comedy making up the structure of the movie, and the zombies being thrown in afterwards. Ironically, since most people will see this for the zombies; the romantic comedy elements of the movie are, on the whole, funnier than the parts with the zombies. After a great initial forty minutes, after which is when the zombies start to really come into play, the movie loses steam and you don't find yourself giggling so often. However, it's forgivable as the comedy gets replaced by some great horror sequences, many of which are lifted from the zombie classics, such as Romero's 'Dead' trilogy and The Evil Dead films.Shaun of the Dead stars two of the main players from the cult comedy 'Spaced'; Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, along with a couple of other regulars from that show, and some other players from various British comedy shows. I have to admit to never having watched Spaced, but I can see that it's written by two obviously talented people, and I may well give it a try on the strength of this film. Simon Pegg's performance is silly, but believable at the same time. He does, actually, appear to be doing an impression of The Office's David Brent for most of the movie; but that's fine with me. Pegg and Frost get to play with a nice assortment of weapons for this film, from cricket bats to snooker cues to shotguns and more (but no chainsaw...) and it's a lot of fun seeing them running around and bashing the undead on the head. This film is a lot of fun on the whole, and I am proud to say that this decade finally has a good zombie film, and I'm even more proud to say that it originates from my home nation...even if it's cast do drink Carling Black Label...",8,1,4,8 December 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fastically entertaining sequel
","I can't say I was the biggest fan of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movie when I saw it shortly after its release, but it was a fun movie and I hoped that this first sequel would deliver more of the same. I can't remember a great deal about the original since it was around four years ago when I saw it, but at this moment in time, I think Dead Man's Chest is an overall better film! There's not really much of a plot to speak of, but this isn't important as director Gore Verbinski packs the film with amusing stunt sequences and sword fights, which more than makes up for the lack of plot. This film once again follows the fortunes of the three main characters from the original: Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Captain Jack Sparrow. They find themselves on the trail of a treasure chest containing the heart of monstrous sea pirate Davey Jones. Jack wants it so he doesn't have to join Jones' crew (which is made up of a motley assortment of fish men), Will Turner wants it to free his father from Jones and then there's The East India Trading Company, who want it too.There's some really great stunts in this movie, and mostly they're great because they're completely unexpected in the way they're put together - examples include a sequence that sees Captain Jack's crew traversing up the side of a mountain while contained in a wooden ball, while another features a sword fight on top and inside a giant wheel. The locations are great too, as the film capitalises on the 'Caribbean' part of the title and dishes up the action on numerous mysterious Caribbean islands. The film seems keen to add a good deal of horror into the mix too, which is always welcome. Davey Jones' crew is truly nightmarish, while the character of Tia Dalma (one of the film's biggest highlights!) hints at black magic and voodoo. Then there's the mythical sea monster, the Kraken, which provides a number of major highlights as it drags men and ships to the depths. All the major players from the first film return and do well, while new inclusions such as Bill Nighy and Naomie Harris add to the fun. Overall, this might not be a brilliant masterpiece - but it's a hell of a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it, so it gets a big thumbs up from me!",8,1,3,22 July 2007
Hostel," Daft American tourists in a European wonderland
","You can say what you like about Eli Roth, but you can't say he doesn't have vision. Roth has said on numerous occasions that he wants to bring the old-school grindhouse style back to cinema, and while Hostel is no masterpiece - it's safe to say that Roth has achieved his aim. Hostel is one of the grisliest films to come out of America in years; and what it lacks in originality is made up for with in your face gratuity. I'm actually one of the few that rates Cabin Fever as both a good film and a promising debut, and it's safe to say that Roth's prowess has a director has grew in the three years since the release of his first film. It's also safe to say that he's targeted his audience well, and Hostel is sure to appeal to fans of grisly, gory horror that leaves nothing to the imagination. The simple plot follows two Americans and their Icelandic friend on a backpacking trip through Europe. We first meet them in Amsterdam where they are directed to a Slovakian hostel on the promise of beautiful and easy girls by a stoned Dutch man. Everything is going well for the trio...until they start getting killed.Roth shoots on location in Europe, and this brings a great style to the film. We start off in sleazy Amsterdam, where drugs and naked girls are the order of the day. From there, we move onto a beautiful village in Slovakia, upon which Roth creates a great sense of wonder. The central location is an abandoned hospital, and this setting provides the scene for all the ghastly action once the movie turns into a horror film. Hostel is a film of two halves; we start off with a scenario that reminded me a lot of 'An American Werewolf in Paris', in that wide-eyed American tourists are seen taking in the sights of Europe. There's no horror early on, but there's lots of comedy and this allows Roth to build his characters and show the audience a good time. Once it becomes a horror film, the shocks come thick and fast and the second half of the film is very different from first; but also very good. The characters and acting are both surprisingly well done. Although they're not exactly deep, Roth's teens are easy to like and it actually is a shame once they enter the chamber of horrors. The horror scenes are more along the lines of cringe-worthy torture than any real scares; but Roth makes good of it, as mystery is created early on and then the film breaks into a thrilling climax towards the end. The ending itself is really good, and provides the perfect finale to a grotesque monster of a film. Well worth ninety minutes of your time.",8,19,34,27 March 2006
The Girl Next Door," Pornography - still the saviour of high school kids
","Being a big horror fan, I spend a lot of my time watching what you might call 'wayward cinema' but, believe it or not, even the very worst of those films pale in comparison to this little teen flick when it comes to misplaced morality. Here, we have a film that not only shows high school kids in the middle of the porn industry, popping ecstasy pills, stealing things and just generally sticking two fingers up where the law is concerned; but it shows them doing this in a positive light, with a great big smile on it's face! However, I'm not one to complain about such things and, again; believe it or not - this is actually a damn good film! The skewed morality can be off-putting, but it's fairly obvious that this film is meant to be more of a spoof than a serious coming of age tale; so it's better to simply go with it rather than worry too much. The film is in the vein of American Pie, and it follows a young man who is lucky enough to have a porn star move in next door to him. After being caught spying on her undressing, she takes him for a ride and, as you might expect, the two hit it off instantly. However, being a porn star has it's drawbacks, and hers comes in the form of a nasty manager by the name of Kelly.The plot of The Girl Next Door is entirely predictable, but there's always enough side stories and gags to ensure that the action always remains interesting. The film is never side-splittingly hilarious, but some of the sight gags are genuinely funny. Jokes involving a lap dance, and another that sees two high school kids pretending to be porn directors are the best among them. The soundtrack features a lot of good songs, but it can be annoying when they're being played over nearly every scene. One thing that worried me before seeing this film was Elisha Cuthbert. Like most people, I've been used to seeing her in the best American TV show of all time, 24, and didn't think that she'd be able to pull off the role of pornstar. She's a good-looking actress; but I wouldn't consider her to be 'sexy'. However, surprisingly enough she does really well in the role. Her co-star, Emile Hirsch, looks about ten; but he does a good job of getting the audience on his side, so even though it's impossible to believe that a sexy pornstar would go for him; he doesn't ruin the movie. On the whole, while this isn't anything like a great movie; it's a more than solid entry in the teen comedy sub-genre, and if you want a movie that will entertain for a couple of hours with caring about political correctness - this one should do it.",6,1,2,22 September 2005
Coffee and Cigarettes," No Cigar
","Jim Jarmusch used to be one of the coolest directors around. Down by Law and the excellent Dead Man, among other films showed this; but his latest crop of movies have been far more down to earth, and less cool than his other films. Ghost Dog, while not bad, felt as if the cast and crew couldn't really be bothered - and that is true of this film also. Coffee and Cigarettes is basically eleven stories revolving around people drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. As with all films that have different parts, the stories vary in quality; but unfortunately, there's more bad ones than there are good. Jarmusch has managed to collect a good variety of different actors (and popstars) to star in the film, and this is one of the film's best points. As mentioned, there is more disappointment than good stuff in this movie; but the highlights of the movie include the section with The White Stripes' duo of Meg and Jack, a discussion between Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina, Steve Buscemi's Elvis theory and an odd little sketch where Cate Blanchett plays both parts.Jarmusch has opted to film this movie in black and white, much like he's done with many of his earlier works, and it does serve in giving the film a sense of cool. The film is very relaxed throughout, and the two indulgences of the title give you an impression of this. However, the relaxed nature of the film is also it's main drawback, as throughout the movie we are given the impression that it is half-assed. The fact that it's just a series of sketches, loosely tied together also gives this impression, as it much easier to write a few conversations than it is to make a proper film. Like Quentin Tarantino has done with all of his movies, Jarmusch has dressed this shallow movie up in a whole host of talent; and it does make the end result more enjoyable. Jarmusch regular Roberto Benigni appears in a forgettable short at the start of the film, and after that we see the likes of Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Alfred Molina, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchette and Steve Coogan, among other. Seeing all these guys in a movie together is nice for a movie fan like myselfbut I just cant help thinking that the movie doesn't seem to have any actual effort put into it; hence the low rating.",6,6,10,22 June 2005
Spider-Man 2," Majestic movie making in every respect
","In 1981, Sam Raimi unleashed himself (and Bruce Campbell) onto the film world with his first masterpiece; The Evil Dead. Since then, Raimi has gone on to make many films, and hasn't disappointed with a single one. And that more than includes this one.It has become a common opinion among certain people that movies which are heavy on action are brainless and therefore can't be intelligent or have an emotional impact on the audience. The first Spider-Man, and the X-Men films have already disproved this theory; but Spiderman 2 puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt. Many movies that try to blend together several elements end up falling down somewhere, but Spiderman 2 manages to blend more than a few, and blend them into one coherent masterpiece. Within the plot are elements of romance, sci-fi, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and even a little bit of horror, Many films that have tried to blend several elements have failed, but here they all blend together nicely. All the elements of the plot come together, and all are definitely needed for the movie to flow; it is obvious that all these things weren't put in the movie just so the film could profess that it has lots of different elements; there is nothing in the plot of this movie that could be taken out without making the rest of the movie fall apart; in that way, the movie is efficient and yet expansive and ambitious at the same time.The movie starts as it means to go on; with a very exciting pizza delivery sequence. Yes, even pizza delivery is exciting in Spiderman 2. After that the movie is a roller coaster ride; when it's not dazzling you with adrenaline fuelled action sequences, it's pulling at your heart strings with emotionally rich exchanges. Some action films let up when they aren't giving the audience an action sequence; but this one doesn't. It's exciting all the way though. Some of the exchanges, particularly the ones between Aunt May and Peter Parker are genuinely heart felt, and because the characters are so well thought-out and appear on screen as rounded human beings; these exchanges are allowed licence to make you care for the characters. The characters in the movie are a mixed bag, with each one being made up of a number of desires and insecurities, which translate onto the screen both effectively and believably, even in spite of some of them having super powers.Technically, this movie is majestic. The action sequences are truly breathtaking and seeing Spider-Man battle Doctor Octopus around a number of different locations is an unforgettable experience. The acting is also something of note, as the movie is brought to life by a brilliant ensemble. I don't like Tobey Maguire much, but he was made for the role of Peter Parker, and he really does excel with it. The role wouldn't have been believable if it was filled by someone butch, and so Maguire makes for a believable Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst doesn't have as much to do here as she did last time, but what she does do is just fine. The great Alfred Molina fills the role of Doctor Octopus, and like Tobey Maguire was made for the part. Simply put, he's immense in this role; he's intelligent looking enough to be believable as the scientist and nasty looking enough to be believable as the super-villain; thus capturing the essence of his character in both respects. J.K. Simmons steals the show as J.J. Jameson, the head of the newspaper in downtown Manhattan. Every scene with him is a delight and much of his dialogue is absolutely hilarious, which gives the film that all-important third dimension.As previously mentioned, Sam Raimi started life as the director of the fantastic cult hit; The Evil Dead. Despite this film being completely different and on a much bigger scale than the aforementioned; it is evident that Sam hasn't lost his roots. Obviously giving Bruce Campbell a cameo shows this (although I'd have preferred more Bruce, myself), and Sam also reminds us of The Evil Dead with several tributes including a lovely chainsaw sequence, and a workout for the 'Raimi-cam' on the train scenario. The Evil Dead was notable for, amongst other things, the fact that it was extremely well directed. Sam Raimi is an extremely underrated talent and really should be mentioned along with the directors that hog all the praise more often. His direction is extremely assured, and he manages to make everything about the film thrilling and as interesting as it possibly could be.Spider-Man 2 is a film that further disproves the theory that movies based on comic books are brainless and stands out as one of the very best films this decade, not to mention it being a member of the exclusive 'sequels better than the first' club. If you haven't already; see this movie pronto.",8,1,2,15 December 2004
Batman Returns," Superior comic book masterpiece
","There has been a rush of comic book films lately that have garnered high praise, but what everyone seems to be forgetting is that, over a decade ago, Tim Burton made a film that is easily on par with the best comic book adaptations being made today; maybe even better. The film is, of course, Batman Returns; which can only be described as an all out comic book masterpiece. Quite frankly, everything that could be good about this film; is great. Tim Burton has succeeded on a number of levels to bring us the ultimate comic book movie - the characters, the plot, the atmosphere - everything in this film is right on cue. What really annoyed me about the first Batman film was that Burton didn't seem to know where he wanted the focus. It seemed as if he wanted it to be more on The Joker, but then he threw in some character building for Batman; and the final result was very messy. This has been sorted out for this film, and although it has once again left Batman in the shadows; Burton has given us two great villains to have fun with, and the fact that the focus is more on them only makes the film better.The plot mainly follows a young child that was dumped into the sewers at birth. This child would grow up to become 'The Penguin', and he chooses to rise from the sewers at around the same time that businessman Max Schrek has decided to throw his secretary, Selina Kyle out of the window; who then becomes her alter ego, Catwoman. The Penguin and Max Schrek then team up so that the former can get his revenge on Gotham City, and, of course, the caped crusader is on hand to dispatch the baddies. The plot isn't all that deep or intelligent, but it serves it's purpose and allows Tim Burton to do what he really wanted to do with the movie; create a very dark Gothic look for Gotham City! Batman's home town looks absolutely fabulous throughout this film, and the winter setting blends magnificently with Burton's Gothic architecture to create a world that excellently compliment's it's hero's dark personality, while creating a great aesthetic playground for Burton to weave his tale within.It's not just the atmosphere that makes this film what it is - a plethora of great performances have been added into the mix, with each performer giving great energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Michael Keaton returns to his role as the caped crusader, and pretty much does what he did in the last film. He's never really given a chance to impress, as his three villainous counterparts constantly upstage him. Danny DeVito is supremely grotesque in his role as The Penguin, and makes sure that he holds the focus in every scene he's in. This sort of role suits an actor like DeVito excellently, and this is the best I've ever seen him. On the flip side to The Penguin, we have Catwoman; who is played by the very sexy Michele Pfifer. She looks great in her black leather suit, and her demented portrayal as the tortured villain works brilliantly. Rounding off the cast is the magnificent Christopher Walken. Walken has an uncanny ability of making a huge impression in everything he's in, and his dark and downbeat portrayal as a shrewd businessman is just great.On the whole, I highly recommend this film to everyone. While the substance isn't always there, Burton has given this sequel enough style and enough entertainment value to more than adequately mask that fact and if you're a fan of cinema; I see no reason to dislike this film.",8,7,15,3 July 2005
Finding Nemo," As good as animation gets
","I'm not a big fan of animation. In fact, up until I saw Finding Nemo, I had never seen an animated film that I love. Now that I have seen it, however, that's all changed. With it's vivacious characters, sublime animation and wonderful voice acting; Finding Nemo is a winner all the way. The story follows a young clown fish who is, believe it or not, called Nemo. A shark killed Nemo's mother and siblings, and this has lead his father to be overprotective of his only son. This over-protectiveness leads to rebellion from Nemo - you know what kids are like - and no sooner has his dad told him not to go near the boat, is he tapping the bottom of it with his fin, getting caught by a diver and then being taken to a fish tank in a Sydney dentist's surgery. Of course, his dad isn't going to take this lying down and so begins an epic journey in which he risks life and fin (sorry) to, you guessed it, find Nemo.As mentioned, the animation in this film is absolutely wonderful. By far and away the best picture that Pixar have ever created, in terms of looks and finished item. The colour scheme for the movie is extremely vibrant, and is therefore aesthetically pleasing for the duration. The film also does a fantastic job of creating it's own world; the sea is a place that is busy and bursting with life. Throughout the film, our hero's are confronted with many challenges and inventive characters - from the sharks that want to stop eating fish, to the forest of jellyfish, down to the escape artist Gill (voiced to perfection by William Dafoe), Finding Nemo has no shortage of vivacity in it. The film is as impressive as far as substance goes, as it is on the visual front. The characters in Finding Nemo give the film a lot of it's substance and, aside from the fact that they're mostly talking fish, feel very real and almost have a life of their own. In an animated children's film, you don't expect to see characters the likes of what's on show here, but Finding Nemo delivers on the character front too. Our main hero's are great creations; we have Marlin, the father. He's very neurotic and wouldn't be out of place in a Woody Allen film (aside from the fact that he's a talking fish, obviously). His opposite number is a lovable, if forgetful female blue tang fish called Dory. Dory is a brilliant character, she is funny yet never irritating throughout the movie and it is somewhat because of her that the movie plays out so well. These two have a great chemistry on screen, which is better than a lot of the chemistries in 'serious' films. Nemo himself is your typical child  thinks he knows it all, but doesn't. And the film wins realism points for this too. There is a great menagerie for the support cast, which includes turtles, whales, sharks and much more; and all of them are brilliant examples of the kind of imagination that has gone into this film.There are also several life lessons on display in this film, and those are what lifts Finding Nemo from merely an animation film, to a film that can be respected by adults, as much as by children. The life lessons on offer are; listen to your parents, shown clearly by the fact that this whole fiasco is born of a result of Nemo disobeying his dad. There's also themes, on the other hand, of how overprotecting your children can lead to them viewing you with contempt; and the movie strikes a balance, like it does on the whole, between both sides of the parental structure. Aside from the family based messages, the film also has things to say that certain people and countries would do well to note; first of all, interfering with nature is not nice, and stemming from that is the message that if you have the power, it doesn't mean you have the right to use it; clearly portrayed by the diver that takes Nemo from his home. The fact that the film has all these themes, and still manages to be deliriously entertaining is testament to it's brilliance. Many films that profess substance don't have as much as this little caper does.Overall, animation doesn't get any better than this. Finding Nemo is fun for children, but there is MORE than enough for adults to enjoy, and I would have no qualms with recommending this movie to anyone.",8,1,5,6 October 2004
Hot Fuzz," Fighting big criminals in a small country village!
","Well, the Spaced crew had a lot to follow up on with Shaun of the Dead being such a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and after seeing this film I would say they've just about done it! This time round, they've decided to spoof cop buddy films - although there's plenty of other stuff thrown in for good measure! I went into this film expecting it to be about British policemen (sorry, British police officers), and that's the best way to go into it. I really don't want to spoil this film too much as giving potential viewers any sort of idea of where the film goes from its base plot would seriously hinder their enjoyment. The film focuses on Nicholas Angel; a London police officer with a long line of decoration. He's called into the sergeant's office one day to find that he's been promoted! However, that's not good news as he's been given a job in the small country village of Sandford, away from the busy streets of London as his arrest record is making the rest of the force (sorry, service) look bad. However, he soon finds that life in sleepy Sandford isn't so sleepy after all...What's great about this film, for me anyway, is that it's completely British! It's obvious where Pegg and Wright were coming from as they've taken the style of the big Hollywood cop buddy blockbuster and applied it to a rural English setting. It's refreshing to see, to say the least and the fact that most of the satire in the film is right on cue means the overall effect is even better. The film features a strong British cast, with numerous familiar faces such as Bill Bailey, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton (in an excellent role!), Martin Freedman, Paddy Considine, Steve Coogan and even the Wicker Man star Edward Woodward popping up alongside main stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The way that the plot works is excellent, as the writers exhaust one point and then the film quickly changes direction, meaning it never grows stale. It can feel a bit inconsistent, and the final third isn't as good as the first two; but in a movie this entertaining, it isn't a big problem. One thing I definitely wasn't expecting was this level of gore! Wright and Pegg are clearly and obviously horror fans at heart, and this is well felt in this movie with the 'Giallo' themed plot line that runs through the middle section. Overall, Hot Fuzz both lives up to Shaun of the Dead and my high expectations, and it comes highly recommended!",8,1,3,16 February 2007
Constantine," Don't expect this to be another A-quality comic book flick...
","Much like the halfbreeds of it's plot, Constantine treacherously treads a thin line between a divide. The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins, and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film, as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences, and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another, often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience, and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better, as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide, the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting, and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film, giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him, so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand, if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's 'Chain Reaction' co-star, Racheal Weisz joins him again here, and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan, and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling, and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop, as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting, the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive, this film is not, and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss.",5,0,5,25 July 2005
Troy," Surpassed all expectations
","I went into Troy expecting not to like it, due to the fact that I don't like historical epics generally, and Wolfgang Petersen's 'Das Boot' is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. While Troy certainly isn't a masterpiece, and it has it's fair share of flaws; I was surprised to find that this is actually a very good film. Based on Homer's poem, 'The Iliad', Troy is the multi-layered story of romance, heroics, war, betrayal and the importance of having a legacy. The story is absolutely brilliant, and the way that the various characters interact with each other the situations that they have been forced into is really well done and ensures that the film is always at least interesting. The plot follows the war between Greece and Troy, which is started when a young price by the name of Paris steals Helen, the wife of one of Greece's Kings and takes her back to Troy. The King of Kings doesn't take this sort of thing lying down, and it isn't long before he's gathered up the greatest warrior to ever live; Achilles, and the rest of his expansive army to the shores of Troy in order to gain revenge and take the walled city of Troy for himself.One thing that did annoy me about this film was the handling. The story is brilliant, but screenplay writer David Benioff, for some reason, has seen fit to make the themes surrounding the story more the forefront. Ideas such as the glory of having your name go down in history, as well as love and war are good; but I would prefer less of the melodramatics, and more focus on the relationships between the characters themselves. Troy benefits from a lovely cast, which includes the likes of Peter O'Toole, Diane Kruger, Julie Christie, Sean Bean and Brian Cox in support to the main players. Brad Pitt takes the lead role as Achilles, and it's amazing how well he's stepped into it. He looks the part, and obviously enjoys playing it. It can be annoying when the camera constantly moves in for a close up, or when he has to deliver some of his more corny dialogue; but his physical presence makes up for this. Eric Bana co-stars, and does what Pitt does expect better. Bana doesn't make many films, which is a shame because I'd like to see more of him. Orlando Bloom is the third-lead, in the role of Paris. This guy is talentless and annoying, but at least he doesn't have to do much; and his weedy role suits him.Like most blockbusters these days, there is some CGI present; but it's never gratuitous, and for a change; it's been used well, so I don't mind seeing it. The battles are well staged, particularly all the ones involving Brad Pitt. His antics on the battlefield help to create the illusion that the Hollywood megastar is a great Greek warrior, and unlike many battle sequences in many epics; the ones here never get boring. The locations are great and help to cement the action in Troy, which is helped by the way that all the cast have been made up excellently to represent their characters. Overall, this is surprisingly good stuff, which shouldn't be dismissed because of it's summer blockbuster status. I would definitely see this one again.",8,6,13,21 September 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Ride hi-....on second thoughts; nevermind...
","Romance films aren't really my thing at the best of times - so since this is one about two men falling in love, I think I was justified about not wanting to see it. And if it wasn't for the fact that I've seen the other four 'Best Picture' nominees for 2005, I probably would have stuck to that. Anyway, I did see it; and surprisingly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Naturally, the technical elements of the film are all spot on; acting, directing, locations etc are all good enough, so I wont bother mentioning those things too much. This isn't really a western, although it is set in the land of cowboy hats and people who drink whiskey out of the bottle; and this location choice offsets the central theme of the film. Films set in this place are usually macho affairs...which helps to make the plot line as bold as possible. The film follows the story of two ranchers that are sent up Brokeback Mountain to look after some sheep. However, the sheep quickly fail to be number one priority when the two men realise that they're more interested in each other...The angle of the film is actually quite predictable; these two 'love' each other, yet they aren't allowed to be together; thus meaning that we have a tragic film. The way the plot handles this theme with regards to the characters is rather black and white; and while they both suffer mental trauma which surfaces in violent and teary outbursts - it all feels very one-sided, and the characters don't flourish as complete wholes. I realise it's difficult to create well rounded characters in a two hour running time; but the film would have benefited immensely if we were allowed to learn a little more about the two men, besides the fact that they want one another. I can't say I cared too much about their relationship either, as it seemed a bit too cold and it's hard to believe that these two have built up such a passion for each other over a few intervals. The film seems to profess that the relationship is about each other, not just about being gay - but that doesn't actually come out until the end, and by then it feels tacked on. I'd have loved to have seen Elton John and Boy George in the leads; but those roles have gone to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, who both act to their best under the assured direction of Ang Lee. On the whole, this film is an interesting way to spend two hours - although I can't say I'm overly impressed with it, but at least it didn't go overboard with 'tender' scenes between the leads.",6,5,37,15 February 2006
Chicken Run," Great fun - something for (almost) everyone!
","I never used to like animated films, but over the past five years or so; there's been more and more good ones being released, and these days I enjoy nearly all the ones I see. The majority of animated films are either in 2D, or just lately; computer generated, but there's something about clay models that's more appealing. Perhaps it's the fact that you know just how much effort must have gone into every second of film. The team of Nick Park and Peter Lord; the duo behind the immensely popular 'Wallace and Gromit' have put 'Chicken Run' together, and that's completely obvious throughout. The plot line takes in numerous film tributes, including some small ones to likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Easy Rider - but mainly, the whole film is a tribute to the British classic 'The Great Escape'. We follow the trials and tribulations inside of a chicken coup, as the chickens try their best to escape the iron fence that keeps them prisoner. Their efforts are unsuccessful, until one day a hip chicken named Rocky flies into the pen...could he be the answer to their prayers? Chicken Run works, chiefly, because of it's vitality, and the way that it features enough fun for children, and enough attention to detail to ensure that adults will enjoy it, too. The characters benefit from a great troop of voice actors that succeed brilliantly in bringing life to their characters. Many of the actors are lesser-known stars, but the likes of Miranda Richardson, Julia Sawalha and, of course, Mel Gibson stand out the most. The film always flows well, and even through it has a short running time (understandable, when you consider how much work goes into every frame), you really feel like you've seen a story unfold by the end of the film. The characters here are a lot more deep and detailed than in a lot of 'serious' films, that's for sure! There's a big enough range of humour on offer here to ensure that everyone watching will get a laugh, all in all making Chicken Run a very difficult film not to like. As mentioned, I'm not really into animated films; but there are exceptions, and Chicken Run is definitely one of them.",8,0,0,2 January 2006
Terminator Salvation," Good guys in a truck, baddies on motorbikes...it's all gone wrong.
","The short scenes showcasing the 'future' in the first two Terminator films were some of the most captivating of the series. While I personally thought that what we saw in the first two films was enough to set the scene for those two movies and I never really wanted to see any more of the future world; it's clear that there is enough opportunity for a movie there, and it was inevitable that we'd get a Terminator movie set in the future eventually. It would have been nice if it were a better than this one, however. The film begins in 2003 and we see a man executed, before donating his body to some kind of cybernetic research project. The film then fast forwards to 2018, and the main plot, of course, focuses on John Connor; a soldier that has grown up to fulfil the destiny prophesised in the earlier films. Connor has discovered that Skynet are working on a new Terminator model, the T-800; just around the same time that the executed prisoner from 2003 has woken up in the future. The resistance has discovered an 'off switch' for Skynet's systems and hopes to win the war with it; but soon after Connor learns that his father, Kyle Reese, is number one on Skynet's most wanted list and sets out to find him.The plot sounds complicated but it really isn't; very little thought went into the storyline and it's clear that director 'McG' felt he could wing it on action scenes alone. The most disappointing thing in this respect is the character of John Connor. They went to the trouble of hiring one of the best movie stars of the moment in Christian Bale; and then completely wasted him by making his character an absolute non-entity. We learn barely anything about him other than the fact that he doesn't like the machines; but he just comes across as a paranoid technophobe. This is even more unbelievable considering that we're supposed to believe this is the same character that cried at the end of Terminator 2 when Arnie descended into the melting pot. The only character that really provides any interest is Marcus Wright; the convict killed at the start of the film and later resurrected. His story is much more interesting and I think he even has more screen time than Christian Bale; making me think that producers were just scared to have an unknown actor at the top of the bill. Which is a shame because Sam Worthington is the only person involved in this film to come out with any credit.The disappointment of the characters is matched by the incompetent writing with regards to the story. The plot features a great many coincidences and much of it doesn't make sense. There's no real imagination on display either and the film really fails to inspire the viewer. Thankfully, the saving grace comes in the form of the action sequences - which are loud, brash and well orchestrated. There are plenty of them too, which helps to ensure that the film is at least mostly entertaining. Of course, the special effects are impressive...but I can't say too much about that since good effects are simply the norm for big budget action films these days. The actor they brought in to play Kyle Reese is a bit of a disappointment. Of course, the character is much younger than he was in The Terminator; but are we really supposed to believe that weedy Anton Yelchin would grow up to be Michael Biehn? It also has to be said that the vision of the future presented in this film is far too clean and not enough like the hopeless and dirty scenes shown in the original Terminator films. There are a few nods to the older and superior movies in the form of quotes and music; but it really just feels like a young kid mimicking his big brother. All the disappointment is eventually capped off by the ending...which is just mind-bogglingly stupid. Overall, this film is a very disappointing mess. An entertaining mess for sure...but the Terminator series ended in 1991 for me.",6,5,9,11 June 2009
L.A. Confidential," In a word: flawless
","From the moment it begins, with Danny DeVito giving the audience an account of events in the style of a pulp-newspaper article, L.A. Confidential grabs your attention and doesn't release it until the credits role. This is both an intriguing mystery and a brilliant character study shot in the style of the classic film-noir. Like Chinatown before it, L.A. Confidential gained instant classic status as if it wasn't for the fact that we know it was made in the late nineties; it could easily have been made during the peak of the film-noir era. Through a flawless ensemble cast and brilliant storytelling, this film has cemented itself as a modern classic and what I consider to be the best film of the nineties on the whole.Based on a pulp novel by James Ellroy, L.A. Confidential follows the fates of three very different police officers; Bud White, a short-tempered thug that uses brute force in order to gain what he considers to be justice; Jack Vincennes, the celebrity, quick-dollar minded cop, and Edmond Exley; the collage boy that values the rules and doing what's right to achieve justice. When a shooting occurs at a night café, the three attempt to solve the mystery in their own unique way, but discover they must band together in order to defeat their imperfections and get to the bottom of the mystery. This film is very character driven, and throughout the focus is always on the three leads. We get to know them during the film and their characters are always interesting thanks to the fact that they are three-dimensional human beings. Why they do things and how the plot develops directly relates to their personalities, and this means that our confidence in them is rewarded.L.A. Confidential sets itself apart from other films of the same nature as it creates the world from which it's story will develop, as opposed to creating it's story and developing it's world around it. This allows the film to tackle it's plot from a multitude of different angles and thereby it has complete freedom to put the audience at the centre of the mystery. Because of this, the film requires the viewer to pay complete attention to the proceedings and missing a minute of screen time could result in the viewer losing the plot. The film rewards it's viewer's attention by keeping itself constantly involving and exciting, and never becoming boring. The fact that it is strongly character lead means that the film has a warm heart, and it easy to get involved with and care for the characters at it's centre; thus allowing the film to be easily to get involved with for the audience. The story encompasses many themes, most notably justice and the desire to do what's right. All three of the characters desire this, and it is only through their imperfections that their methods are different. The themes portrayed at the centre of the tale will always be relevant, no matter what period the film is viewed in, thus lending it the same longevity that many of it's fellow classics enjoy.Of course, L.A. Confidential's prowess is helped implicitly by the fact that everything about it is absolutely flawless. You could spend hours trying to pick faults with the film, but there's no point because it doesn't have any. It's surprising that L.A. Confidential so faultless because the track record of it's major players prior to it's release isn't exactly brilliant. Curtis Hanson was a director of fluff movies such as The River Wild and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and it didn't seem likely that his career was going to change. Guy Pearce started out on the Aussie soap opera; Neighbours and his only real impressive acting credit prior to this film was a silly performance as a drag queen in the comedy; Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Similarly, Russell Crowe's resume wasn't exactly impressive either and he was practically an unknown upon release. Kevin Spacey was in a slightly better position than the other two with impressive performances in 1995 films, The Usual Suspects and Seven; but it wasn't until L.A. Confidential that he truly reached the pinnacle of acting that he resides at today. Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito have made more than their fair share of rubbish and I don't feel that I even need to go into their backlog of films. The fact that it's players came from less impressive backgrounds only makes this film more of a masterpiece as they all perform faultlessly, and it goes to show that you don't need the greatest stars to create a masterpiece.The first thing that struck me about L.A. Confidential was it's delicious 1950's style. Through it's lush cinematography, the film seduces the audience into believing that they are there in Hollywood's golden age. Through the fashions, cars and mentalities portrayed on screen; L.A. Confidential succeeds in doing exactly what cinema was invented to do; transport it's audience to the place where the movie is happening. That's part of what makes this film a classic; it does for a modern audience what films of yore did for their audiences and achieved greatness in doing so. In these jaded times, it's easy for movies with dazzling effects and the latest stars to gain itself praise, but many of them fail in really leaving a lasting impression and making the audience feel like they are in the fray with the lead characters on the screen. L.A. Confidential does not fail in that respect.All in all, this film is the reason I watch films. For all the reasons I have stated above; L.A. Confidential is a cinephile's dream. When the movie is over and the final credits role; you know that you have seen a movie, and the movie you have witnessed really is the very pinnacle of 1990's film-making. L.A. Confidential is one of a few films that truly deserve the title; 'masterpiece'.",10,1,3,28 December 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Big and Bad
","From the man who brought us such disaster areas as 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla' comes this latest disaster; The Day After Tomorrow. As you probably already know, The Day After Tomorrow is about bad weather. Lots of it, all coming at once; we've got hurricanes, tidal waves, hail stones, snow and, well, actually that's it. For a movie that professes to have lots of disasters; it's seriously lacking. The disasters, when they're on, are a huge disappointment. Judging by the trailers, you would expect the disasters to make up most of the film, but this isn't the case. The effects are outstanding, but the disaster scenes themselves don't last long at all, and they're not even very exciting. The scenarios tend to cut off before the money shot kicks in, so what we're left with is several 'half' disasters and, overall, I get the impression that Roland Emmerich can't handle the vast scale of the film. Between the disasters, we are given the staple 'human drama behind the disaster' set-up, and like most disaster films before this one; it's terrible and very much something that you will be better off missing. In fact, if you've seen the trailer, then really; you've seen the film.As you might expect; the film is set in America. As if America is the only country on earth, all the action is centred there and all other countries have to either make do with a mention, or more commonly; nothing at all. We are treated to sequences such as The Statue of Liberty sticking out of the snow; but never any others. Where's the Eiffel tower while all this is going on? Buckingham Palace? The Taj Mahal? Stone Henge? Nope, because if it's not America, it's not important. Or at least that's the case with this film. Somehow, there's time for a scene where the American flag freezes, but there isn't time to show what's happening to the Kremlin. Ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, let's move on to the human drama side of the film. The main story follows a father (Dennis Quaid) who must travel all the way to New York to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) who has become trapped in the snow. For a start, this plot is ridiculous; the weather shown in this film is so extreme that you'd be taking a risk walking to the local post office (assuming it's still there, of course), but somehow this guy is able to walk halfway across America? Something tells me that Emmerich doesn't fully respect his audience's intelligence. The drama is also dripping with sickly fake sentiment, which only serves in being pathetic. The film is also far too upbeat; it centres on a disaster that has killed millions of people, and yet we're supposed to feel good because a father has managed to save his son? What about all the other people that have lost their lives?Good points? Well, the film does have some interesting sequences. One of which sees a reporter get whisked away by a piece of debris while reporting on the tornado's that are sweeping the country, another sees a helicopter pilot freeze instantly, and there's also a sequence that involves our main character being chased by a pack of wolves; which would have been interesting if the wolves weren't so obviously CGI. It's not even good CGI, for god's sake. The cast aren't bad, but nobody shines. Jake Gyllenhaal probably wanted a change from doing small independent films, and I can understand that; but he impressed in those films, and he doesn't here. Stick to what you're good at, Jake. Dennis Quaid tries to be the intellectual hero, but misses the mark due to an entirely rigid performance and Ian Holm is the British man that goes out on a tribute to Manchester United. Don't get me wrong, Man U deserve a tribute; but would you really be toasting a football team when you're about to killed? Just another of the film's silly sequences.One day, someone will make a good disaster film. One that doesn't just focus on America, one that takes it's subject material into account and doesn't turn a disaster into a uplifting drama. One that does it's human drama in an interesting way, and one that does what it says on the tin where the disasters are concerned. One day that will happen, but today isn't that day. And neither is The Day After Tomorrow.",4,4,8,24 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Nice ending to an entertaining series
","So here we are then with the conclusion of the strangely quite good trilogy based on a Disney theme park ride, and while I prefer the first two films overall; as an entertaining action fantasy, At World's End isn't bad at all! Filmed around the same time as the first sequel, the plot here follows on from that set out in Dead Man's Chest, and there are a number of surprises stemming from said film's ending. While the base plot itself is rather thin considering the amount of characters and vast running time, once again director Gore Verbinski decks the film out with a barrage of action sequences and Johnny Depp's Captain Jack is always on hand if things start to get a bit boring. The film begins with the main characters travelling to Davey Jones' Locker to rescue the doomed Captain Jack who died at the end of Dead Man's Chest. After getting the map from Captain Sao Feng, the crew sail to ends of the Earth to rescue Captain Jack. But there's more at stake as The East India Trading Company are now in control of Davey Jones, and are using him to get rid of the remaining pirates.This film is decidedly weirder than the previous instalments and most of the strangeness comes from deluded Captain Jack, who seems to have been affected by his time in the locker. Although he doesn't have the most screen time here, it is, of course, Johnny Depp's maniacal portrayal of the despicable pirate that is the film's centrepiece. Depp clearly enjoys playing this role, and his quips are always a major highlight. There seems to be more of a focus on character building and plot in this film than there was in the last one, but there's still room for plenty of stunts and sword fights  unfortunately, however, there's nothing to rival the hilarious wheel scene in the first sequel. The main reason this sequel is so much fun it down to the diverse and interesting set of characters (which seem to take a fair bit of influence from Star Wars). All the returning characters still work well together and as was the case with the last film, the new ones fit in well too. Overall, this might not be life-affirming stuff - but its lots of fun and this film ensures that the Pirates series ends on a high.",7,3,5,23 July 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man swings back in style!
","Well, I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I walked out of Spider-Man 2, and despite all the bad things I've heard about it - Spider-Man 3 certainly didn't disappoint! Sure, you could spend all day picking faults with the film if you really wanted to, but what's the point? The first two films set the bar very high for comic book movies, and this film is not a disappointment considering what went before it. I have to say that I'm not a 'Spiderman fanboy' and have, in fact, not even read the comics; but that is testament to the brilliance of Sam Raimi's vision as he has managed to turn Spider-Man into a franchise that is accessible to everyone. The plot this time around is far more complex than in the last two. Spider-Man's celebrity status has grown among the people of New York City. His private life is going well also. However, good things never last long; and Spider-Man is about to face a threat from his former best friend Harry Osborne who wants revenge for the death of his father, as well as a 'simian' life form from another planet and the return of his uncle's killer, this time in the guise of powerful new villain 'Sandman'.The most outstanding thing about this film is definitely the special effects. The fight scenes are brilliantly realised, and Sam Raimi certainly knows how to put a thrilling compilation together. The Sandman provides Spider-Man 3 with its best visuals, as the Terminator 2-style villain switches between sand and flesh in style, and the director constantly makes good use of this set-up. The visuals are obviously important in a film like this, and the film contains many a memorable scene. The best of these sequences come in the form of the creation of the villains, and while it has to be said that the way they come about is a little convenient (Sandman stumbles upon a nuclear experiment with sand...), it's not too difficult to believe since the film takes place in a world where a human/spider hybrid fights criminals in New York City. Popular Spider-Man villain Venom makes an appearance also, albeit it a brief one. However, the way that his character is built up makes up for the lack of screen time that the resulting villain has.One of the most common problems viewers have picked out with this film is the fact that there are a lot of different plot lines going on. It's true that the film does become more than a little bit complex and the new characters suffer as a result of that. But the Spider-Man Universe is obviously a vast one, and Sam Raimi had a lot on his plate when it came to writing a story that would please the fans, stay true to the comics and entertain the audience. He actually juggles the numerous plot threads very well, as most of the points get across and the impending plot holes aren't enough to spoil anyone's enjoyment. Sam Raimi's sense of humour is brilliant, it was obvious that the likes of J.K. Simmons and B-movie legend Bruce Campbell were going to provide comic relief (and they do), but the funniest thing about the film for me was Peter Parker's reaction to the black suit. In a sequence that seems to be rather widely disliked, Spidey goes from geeky physics student to a (sort of) suave lady-killer with hilarious results. The sequence shows a lot more imagination than many directors would have given the idea of a superhero turned 'dark'.The acting is largely decent also. The returning characters all give performances that you would expect from there, while the new additions fit in well. Thomas Hayden Church pretty much sleepwalks through his role, but he's still an asset to the film as he completely looks and feels like he has come straight out of a comic book! Topher Grace is slimy and irritating as he should be, and the sequence immediately before he changes into Venom says a lot about his character. Overall, Spider-Man 3 is not exactly a perfect film - but it's certainly an entertaining one and I know for sure that I'll be seeing it again!",7,7,18,8 May 2007
Match Point," A change of environment proves lucky for Woody Allen
","Every film that Woody Allen releases is automatically a point of interest for me, especially when the film in question has won itself a lot of favourable reviews. Match Point sees Allen in new territory as his beloved New York has been swapped for London, England. Despite this relocation, however, Match Point is still very clearly a Woody Allen film. The film is mostly a romantic drama, but as the story moves forward; thriller elements start to creep through, and best of all we get a very potent streak of black humour to round things off. The plot typically features the central character in turmoil. We are introduced to former tennis star turned coach, Chris Wilton. He's looking for a meaning to his life and wants to do something different from tennis. After meeting a man named Tom, Chris finds himself the object of Tom's sister Chloe's affections. However, our tennis star has his eyes on Tom's finance; Nola. After having an affair with Nola, Chris finds himself at decision-making time. Because as we all know; you can't have two women for long.The film starts off with a sequence in which the protagonist tells us about a tennis ball hitting the top of a net during a game. If it carries on going, your luck is in; but if it falls back, it isn't. Woody Allen keeps this luck theme going throughout the film, and the way that he harks back to the opening scene towards the end of the film is just great. Being from the UK myself, I was interested to see how Allen would handle the London setting. I've got to say, however, that I'm a bit upset about the fact that he has decided to set the film in the upper crust of society. It's not so difficult for me to relate to upper class New York because I'm not from America; but as far as I'm concerned, the environment seen in this film doesn't really exist...but at least the English characters have English accents. The acting is fine, with Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing well in the lead role and hitting all the right notes as his character changes his stripes later on. Scarlett Johansson is his opposite number and delivers an emotional portrayal as the put-upon mistress, while Emily Mortimer is suitably posh to round off the central threesome. I loved the way the tale climaxes and I'm glad that Allen didn't continue along the lines that many films of this nature are happy to stay between. Overall, I can't say that this is Allen's best effort; but it's a very good one, and the director has been showing good consistency over the last few years.",10,1,1,27 April 2006
Zodiac," Well done true crime flick
","David Fincher really made his mark 12 years ago with the excellent 'Seven'. Since then, however, he's been disappointing - Fight Club was massively overrated, while The Game and Panic Room were both merely decent thrillers - but it would seem that Fincher is (nearly) back to his best with Zodiac - a sprawling epic mystery/crime thriller based around a real life unsolved crime. This is no doubt a very ambitious film - it doesn't quite work as a rounded whole - for a start, the characters don't really get time to develop well - but all in all, Zodiac is certainly a very good film. The film is based on books by Robert Graysmith and follows the events surrounding the Zodiac, an anonymous killer who murdered several people in the late sixties and early seventies. The film follows reporters and police officers as they investigate the Zodiac killings and endeavour to find out the identity of the killer. Eventually, the protagonists end up becoming obsessed with this investigation and the Zodiac consumes them...The film is extremely well put together as you would expect, and Fincher has done an excellent job of recreating the time period in which the film is set. As the story spans over several years, the film does tend to make jumps from one time to another often, and this means that the characters and their personal situations have to take a backseat to the investigation, which is the backbone of the film. This is the way that the film has to be otherwise it would have ended up going on for several hours...but it does mean that the film doesn't feel like a complete whole. Zodiac is lead by three good central performances, Jake Gyllenhaal never really looked 'obsessed' to me, but at least he's an engaging lead. Mark Ruffalo was an odd choice for the police officer role, but it seems to be the right choice - and the film is topped off by Robert Downey Jnr, who gives yet another memorable performance. The mystery itself was enough to keep me interested, the ending was always going to be disappointing, but the film does manage closure in spite of the real life details of the case. Overall, Zodiac falls short of being a masterpiece; but it's certainly a very good thriller and it comes recommended.",9,6,11,30 September 2007
The Prestige," Mystifying modern film-making at it's very best!
","The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years.",8,6,10,21 June 2007
Cloverfield," You can make a boring movie about anything....even a monster invasion.
","Despite being hailed as one of the 'most anticipated movies ever' around the start of 2008, I have to say I was never really bothered about Cloverfield and as such never found myself in any rush to see it. So now the hype has died down and finally I've seen the film and all I can say is that I'm relieved I didn't rush out to see it because after spending barely seventy minutes on the film, all I really have to say about it is that it's boring! Cloverfield begins with around fifteen minutes of character building and it's a major turn off. The main characters are all twenty something good looking 'cool guys' that say things like 'dude' a lot. One of them is going away and he fancies one of the girls or something like that...etc etc. It reminded me a lot of one of those American TV dramas that I never watch. Anyway, they're all huddled together at a dull 'leaving party' when all of a sudden; Manhattan is shaken by an 'earthquake'. However, it's not an earthquake and in fact New York is being invaded by CGI monsters.The film's main gimmick is that it's all filmed on a camera held by one of the main protagonists - in the same style as that film from 1999 that shall not be mentioned. Surprisingly, this isn't one of the main things I didn't like about the movie. The film is basically a special effects-fest and there's two ways that the budget is used; firstly we've got the shots of buildings falling and various things being destroyed, which is fairly well done. But then we've got the shots of the monsters, which are awful! They're poorly designed and the effects just look cheap. The film has enough problems to ensure that cheap-looking CGI isn't enough to spoil it on its own, but it doesn't help either. The effects are generally shown briefly, and in the case of the monsters this is a very good thing. Undoubtedly the most 'interesting' thing about the movie is the shots of helpless people panicking; but even this is not used to good - or exciting - effect. I would imagine that this film will be a great watch for any movie buffs that live in New York; if the movie were set in my home town, I'm sure that I'd have a great time watching everything get pummelled, but for the 99.9% of viewers that live elsewhere, this movie is unlikely to deliver the thrills you're after.",4,4,9,18 February 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Delicious pitch black atmosphere and a camp plot make this flick a winner!
","This film is often compared to the classic Hammer Horror films, and for good reason. Aside from utilising a few of the studio's regular cast members, Tim Burton's film has the fun, innocent edge that most Hammer films enjoyed - while also putting much of the focus on the plot rather than the characters or any other finer details. Also like Hammer, the film has it's own distinct style; but instead of the bright colourful sets that Hammer so often used, Burton's film is dripping in pitch black atmosphere as thick as blood, and it is this that gives the film it's main claim to greatness. Many of Burton's films enjoy this same atmosphere, but he never used it as well as it's used here. The film feels like a dark, twisted fairytale throughout and although this can, at times, take away from the serious horror edge; there's enough blood and guts on offer to keep any horror fan happy. Props such as styled pumpkins and scarecrows help to keep this atmosphere going, and when combined with Burton's assured direction - the film is a stylish visual treat. Nearly every scene in the film is excellently staged, and shots that see things such as a beheaded mother state at her son through the floorboards show that the director has a real flair for horror.The plot follows the legend of the headless horseman. This legend hasn't been done on film many times. In fact, I can't think of a single other film that tackles it head on...although I'm not denying the existence of one. Anyway, we follow Ichabod Crane; a policeman sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of strange murders, apparently committed by a headless horseman. He doesn't believe it at first...but 'seeing is believing', and it's not long before he's tackling the legend head on! Sleepy Hollow benefits from a plethora of great performances. Burton's frequent muse, Johnny Depp, heads the cast and he is joined by Christina Ricci, along with a whole host of great actors including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken, who is superb in the role of the headless horseman. The nineties didn't offer much in the way of great horror films; but Sleepy Hollow is near the top of the short list. For some reason, the film doesn't have as many fans as it should; but that doesn't change the fact that it's a great achievement, and one of Tim Burton's best.",9,1,2,5 October 2005
Silent Hill," Should have been called Dullsville....
","Despite being a big fan of Resident Evil, I never got round to playing the original Silent Hill game on Playstation, and have since spent about half an hour playing the sequel, and found it really boring. But even so, I'm rating this movie based on its own merits, and unfortunately; there aren't many. As you might expect, the film focuses on the spooky ghost town, 'Silent Hill'. It has to be said that director Christophe Gans has done a good job with the atmosphere in the town, but he hasn't done a very good job with the implementation of the action, and Roger Avary's story about Silent Hill is not very interesting. We follow Rose Da Silva; a woman's whose child suffers from trauma in her sleep. When the girl begins to scream 'Silent Hill!' Rose decides to take her to the town that she sees in her sleep. However, it soon becomes apparent that all is now well in the ash covered town, as her husband (Sean Bean, delivering a typically bland performance) finds a website about the town that details its strange history, and Rose finds out about the town's abnormal inhabitants when she comes face to face with them herself...Probably due to the fact that most video game adaptations these days are rubbish, it would seem the team here were keen to make Silent Hill as 'faithful' as possible...and in doing so, have made a film that would have worked a lot better as a game. The CGI doesn't look good alongside real actors, and because a lot of the film features the characters pondering about creepy locations, it can be very boring. This wouldn't have been a problem if you were playing a game and in control of the characters, but sitting and watching them gets old very fast. The film also seems to have put things that I assume are from the game into the screenplay without a lot of point most of the time; case in point - what was that thing with a metal triangle on its head? The fact that the film runs too long ultimately harms it, as the film soon loses it's way and needs to introduce some kind of cult to further the overly complex and uninteresting story, and it all ends with one of the worst special effects showcases that I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not disappointed with this movie as I'm not a fan of the games anyway; but my lack of disappointment doesn't mean Silent Hill is anything but a bad film.",6,4,12,27 August 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Not bad, but definitely a disappointment
","Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.The film is very well put together, with the acting, direction and production values all being very classy examples of how good each can be. The story takes in themes of the futility of war, love for your fellow man and, of course, the race divide (another reason for the good critical reaction), and it has to be said that all of these things are done well, and even quite potent at times. The film is also notable for avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall most dramas of this nature - things such as over the top sentiment or long, heartfelt speeches. While the film definitely has an underbelly of sentiment, it never sees fit to fully expose it; and that is always a good thing in my opinion. The film is keen to give glimpses of it at it at times, however, and these moments tend to be cringe-worthy. The ending is a prime example of that; and despite the fact that this is based on a true story and that's simply 'how it ends'; the film could have handled it better, and then I wouldn't have left the cinema feeling like I'd just been slapped in the face after spending two hours of my time on the film.On the whole, Hotel Rwanda is a long shot away from being a 'bad' film; but it's not a great film either, and the lack of sympathy for the characters will make some people feel like they should have watched a straight documentary instead. Many have, and will continue to be seduced by the racism theme and the fact that it's based on a true story; but not me, and hopefully not you either, as there's more to a great film than just that.",6,19,34,14 March 2005
Crash," With more cheese than a dairy farm, Crash will repeatedly slap you in the face until you swallow the all too obvious message, sideways. Racial segregation is bad. GOT IT??
","So, what do we need to make a successful movie these days? Racial themes? Check. Lots of names, including Don Cheadle? Check. A message that any idiot can understand? Check. Heavyweight performances? Check. Many intertwined stories? Check. Searing music? Check. A screenwriter with a recent hit already under his belt? Check. So then, I guess Crash is all set for an onslaught of rave reviews - which, of course, it got. Don't be expecting one here though; I'm not fooled. To be honest, I'm sick of average films like this garnering all the credit that should have been saved for real masterpieces. It seems that all you need nowadays is to make people think that you're making them think and you've got an instant hit. The message in 'Crash' isn't portrayed - it's forced. With all the subtleness of a sledgehammer in the face, writer-director Paul Haggis forces the fact that society segregates different races. In fact, despite all his forcing - there actually isn't a message here. There's people helping other races and judging them before knowing them, but never a definite message; thus suggesting that the lecturer doesn't actually know what he's talking about.Adding to the film's problems is the fact that it's very, very cheesy and the awful music score - which shows how open minded Haggis is by mixing a lot of racial music in - is simply terrible. This film is advertised as a drama, but I would consider it more of a comedy. Haggis probably thinks that utilising sarcasm in his movie will 'make people think', but all it did for me was make me laugh. In fact, it's the moments of comedy - such as the two car thieves' hilarious comedy of errors - that has stopped me from giving this dross bottom marks. Haggis implements these scenes with a Pulp Fiction-like verve, and it's so out of place that it's hard not to laugh. Come to think of it, this Paul Haggis is a bit of a clown - he's got no idea how to make a film, yet he's sitting on a hit and, no doubt, laughed all the way to the bank. I certainly would have been if I were him. Afterall, all he's done here is exploited the way that critics react to racism and 'powerful' scenes set to silly music and made a film out of it. I'll probably be labelled a racist for writing this review; but before you skip down to the 'unhelpful' button, just remember that I'm being honest. Which is more than I can say for Paul Haggis.",4,47,86,2 October 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," A fantastic piece of cinema!
","Even though he's not always great, all of Guillermo Del Toro's films to date have at least been interesting; cult flicks Cronos and The Devil's Backbone were brilliantly inventive, while his commercial output; films such as Blade II, Mimic and Hellboy were also noteworthy. Pan's Labyrinth has been released to almost universal praise, and that isn't surprising as although I won't heap quite as much praise on it as some have; it's a visually dazzling and overall satisfying piece, and certainly Del Toro's best film to date. Pan's Labyrinth is set in fascist Spain during the Second World War and focuses on a young girl named Ofelia. She travels with her mother to stay with her stepfather; the sadistic Captain Vidal. It's not long before she is lead into the woods by a flying stick insect and meets a Faun who tells her that she is, in fact, not a mortal human and is actually the son of the king of the underworld. However, in order to take her place at father's side and become a princess, she must first face and complete three gruesome tasks...A lot of the film revolves around the implications of a rebellion against the evil Captain at the centre of the story, and this actually bodes surprisingly well with the fantasy element - which works as an 'escape' from the Second World War. Obviously the best thing about this movie is and was always going to be the visuals. The film is a visual feast; naturally there's plenty of imagination and invention courtesy of Del Toro and this helps to give the film a real 'fairy tale' feel. The fact that the film stars an eleven year old girl means that the film has a sort of 'kids flick' feel to it, although this is brilliantly offset by plenty of sadistic violence from the antagonist, as well as some fairly graphic fantasy violence (a monster with eyes in it's palms biting the heads off fairies, for example). This may make the film seem like it lacks focus - but clearly Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale for adults. The film is bolstered by a host of excellent performances from the largely Spanish cast. Ivana Baquero is the standout at the centre of the movie - she puts in an amazingly mature performance for a girl of eleven. Doug Jones is also great opposite her as the mysterious Faun. It all boils down to a satisfying and somewhat surprising conclusion and on the whole Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing cinematic achievement.",8,1,7,29 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Visually stunning, shame about the singing.
","I know a little about 'Sweeny Todd', but I haven't seen any other films/TV Shows or read any books based on the legend, which makes this my first experience with it; and I'm highly disappointed. The disappointment grows further because this story and Tim Burton's directorial style are clearly a match made in heaven - but for some reason, a terrible decision was made on how the film would work and it's spoilt something that could have been great. I would write a song about this film's main problem - but I'd prefer to clearly state that it's the musical elements that spoil it. The plot is rich with horrific elements and should be a great base for a gory Gothic horror film. We focus on Benjamin Barker; better known as Sweeny Todd, a barber returning to London for revenge against all those that have wronged him. Upon his return to the capital, he meets Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a pie shop where 'The Worst Pies in London' are made. If I made the worst pies in London, I'd keep my mouth shut about it - but she sings songs instead and unsurprisingly her shop isn't doing very well. Anyway, Sweeny Todd opens up a barbers shop upstairs and his lust for killing soon combines with her need for meat to put in pies.I have to say that the film looks great. Tim Burton has his own directorial style and it translates to the screen very well here and aesthetically, every scene is a joy to behold. The good points continue with the cast; Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch and he clearly relishes this role, while Mrs Tim Burton; Helena Bonham Carter, does well starring opposite and the director has also done a good job recruiting some good British talent to fill the supporting roles. The film is also rather graphic and Burton provides the viewers with some real nasty sights including a spate of throat slashing that result in blood spraying everywhere, a succession of corpses falling through a trapdoor and hitting the ground with a brutal thud as well as a machine that grinds Sweeny Todd's victims into pie meat. This is all well and good but it all comes down to the execution, and the musical elements really spoil it. Many reviewers have said that the horror and musical elements bode well in this film; but for me it really doesn't work. It comes off as being almost cringe-worthy in places and constantly forced me to ask myself WHY they made this a musical (I know there was a musical version of this story, but there's also several none musical versions). Another problem with the music is that it all sounds very similar and the songs are not very diverse. The first hour or so is really rather boring anyway and the constant singing soon starts to grate. Things improve massively towards the end and despite a couple of songs; the final half hour is really quite good. Overall, I love the atmosphere and the gore of this film - but I can't get on with the musical elements at all, which unfortunately means that a film which could have been a masterpiece is sadly not much better than passable. A shame.",5,3,6,15 March 2008
Nacho Libre," Tired and unfunny comedy
","I have to admit, I was a fan of wrestling when I was a kid; and the subject matter is ripe for making a comedy film about. I'm a big fan of Jack Black in almost everything I've seen him and firmly (used to) believe that he can carry even the dullest film, and although I haven't seen it; Jared Hess' 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite is one of the most highly rated comedy of the last few years...so why is this film so dry? The film is set in Mexico and Jack Black plays a Mexican. This is part of the reason why the film is so lacking; it seems that Jared Hess was too happy to focus on the silly accents and the jokes suffer as a result of that. None of the characters are particularly interesting either. Jack Black usually makes the best of what he's given, but even he isn't able to make the lead role interesting. There's plenty of slapstick and childish humour as you'd probably expect; most of it not funny at all. The central character, aside from being a wannabe wrestler also cares for kids and wants to be a friar - and this subplot comes off as being very forced and uninteresting. Overall, this film was not funny and I don't recommend it!",4,1,3,3 February 2008
Closer," A resounding success on all fronts
","Based on a stage play by Patrick Marber, Closer tells the story of four people living in the upper crust of London society. All of these characters are flawed to an extent that it is the flaws themselves that make up their personalities, and that makes it very hard to really care for any of them. This is made up, however, by the scene setting. Patrick Marber also wrote the screenplay for this film, and some of his scenes are just brilliant. They're always interesting because of the things that the characters do and say to each other - their motives are well worked out, and even though you don't really like any of them; it's still possible to get behind them because their characters are so well defined and seeing them reveal themselves on screen is always great to watch. The film doesn't really have a plot to speak of, and all the action comes about through the characters themselves rather than any actual plotting. This may be a bad thing for some people, because the film lacks structure - but I liked the way that it panned out because it also makes it unpredictable and, as the characters are the stars anyway, it also ensures that we see them for what they are, as they don't have to follow any plot line.For the characters, Mike Nichols has recruited four big names. Natalie Portman stands out the most among the cast members. This beautiful and talented young actress makes every scene she's in a treat for the eyes, and her beauty does Closer no end of favours in that respect. She has the best scene in the movie, which is shared by Clive Owen and takes place in a strip club! It's been years since Julia Roberts made anything worth seeing, and for that reason; she's the sore thumb of this cast of up and coming young stars. The male leads give strong performances, and Clive Owen in particular stands out. He's a very strong actor and that translates well to his character. Similarly, Jude Law's screen presence suits his character excellently but in a different way. Mike Nichols has his first big success with an adaptation of a stage play with the brilliant 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', and although this film doesn't come close to the brilliance of that one, the great director has managed to inject just the right tone into the proceedings and it is that which ultimately makes Closer the success that it is.",7,1,4,4 September 2005
Capote," A haunting and none too obvious true story with an outstanding performance from its lead actor
","To put it lightly, the nominations for the 2005 'Best Picture' Oscar are very weak indeed. The Academy has decided to go with politics rather than films with merit, and as a result we just have a list of films that handle current events - and if you ask me, it's a bit of a joke. Capote was the last Best Picture nominee that I saw and I set my hopes pretty low after the other four fell massively short of expectations. I am surprised, therefore, to report that Capote is actually a damn good film - and although it's not the best of the year, it definitely deserves to have that statuette to it's name come March 5th. The film is still somewhat politically orientated, as it handles themes of violence; but these are wrapped up in the involving story of Truman Capote and the events that lead to him writing his masterpiece, In Cold Blood. We follow him as he researches the brutal murder of a Kansas family. The story really lifts off when he comes into contact with Perry Smith; a death row inmate, and one of the murderers. We follow the writer as he develops a friendship with this man, in order to write his book. But the relationship may have grown beyond professional reasons only.The main stand-out thing about this film is most definitely the lead performance. For years now, Philip Seymour Hoffman has been one of the most talented, yet underrated actors around; and with his portrayal of the famous novelist here - he's finally getting the roles that allow him to reach his full potential. Hoffman holds the screen with a performance that is as intricate as it is absurd, and any success that this film gets is owed more than in part to this great performer. The story itself is intriguing, and the way that the writer builds a friendship with the murderer is both haunting and absurdly touching. This film shows that no matter what men do, there is always a deeper and more complex side that is often ignored. The tone of the film is downbeat and saddening, and inexperienced director Bennett Miller does an excellent job at ensuring the film always feels right. Capote himself isn't too well known outside of literature fans; so this film can be thanked for bringing a true story that is none too obvious to the big screen. As mentioned, this isn't the best film of the year; but it's easily the best on the list of nominees, and while its chances don't look too rosy; it will be a huge shame if it doesn't win the award.",7,1,1,16 February 2006
Lost in Translation," Not the masterpiece it claims to be
","With The Godfather part 3, Sofia Coppola proved that acting isn't her forte. So what about directing? Well, Lost in Translation is my first taste of Ms Coppola behind the camera, and let's just say; if her other films aren't as good as this, then I hope this is my last taste also. Lost in Translation is the tale of two people that suffer from insomnia and have hit a dry patch in their lives. The two are in the foreign land of Tokyo, Japan. They are outcasts in this land, not just because of the language, but the culture too. So what we basically have here is a story of two fish out of water that find romance. You may notice that my plot analysis isn't very detailed, and that has a reason; this movie has very little plot. It has a premise, and that's all; and all it does is play out from that premise. The movie is very random as it doesn't follow a set formula, and although that can work for some movies because it can be spontaneous; it doesn't work here. The film is very subdued, too subdued in fact, and after a while you are instilled with a notion that nothing out of the ordinary will happen in this movie; and it doesn't. This will be to the movie's credit in some people's opinions, because, as we all know, movies that are slow are ultimately more intelligent than anything that is entertaining. And as you should have gathered from that last sentence, I was being sarcastic. That's my first major criticism of the movie; it settles into itself to a point where after a while you forget you're watching a movie, and it just seems like you're simply watching a fish bowl with two people in it; and although this is good in terms of realism, and I don't doubt that Sofia intended it that way; movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, and although some people would disagree; movies are also meant to be entertaining, and I for one don't watch movies to not be entertained; Lost in Translation fails in both of those respects. In it's bid to realistic; Lost in Translation is ultimately a hollow movie experience. It's a simple tale of two people, and that's all that can be took from the film. The characters lack depth; he's a bored middle aged man going through a mid-life crisis and she's a bored wife that is doubting her two year marriage; we don't learn anything about the two characters other than this, and a few minor details such as the fact that he has a wife and kids. In one scene, through dialogue, Bill Murray gives Scarlett words of wisdom regarding children; and this is as deep as the film gets. She says that the advice he gives is different from everything she's heard regarding the subject, but it's merely blatantly obvious advice that any fool with kids or an imagination could conjure up; and this film does that a lot. Two people have empty lives, they find love and they like it. Yes, that's great; now where's the point? I imagine that people with empty lives can relate to this film, but I can't see why. Had the film have had depth of character, it would have improved it vastly. Take Brief Encounter; a similar film along similar lines, but it worked. It worked because it was fleshed out; we can see the main character's predicament clearly, which enables us to get inside of her head and see why she wants to spice up her life by having an extra marital affair. Here, we have none of that. Scarlett Johansson's husband is about as much use in the film as the taxi driver that took them to a party, or the waiter that served them drinks; here's there so we know he's there, but we don't learn anything about the couple's predicament, so why should we care if she finds her life empty and hollow? We know nothing about her. It's similar with him; he's a big movie star that is past his prime and now he's advertising whiskey in Japan, so what? We're supposed to empathise with this guy why? That's another major criticism of this film; the characters have no feeling, they're just there. Despite the review so far; Lost in Translation is not completely void of positive aspects. It has one in particular; the cinematography. Although I don't think the way Tokyo was photographed in this movie is among the best examples of location shoots of all time, and it certainly isn't enough to carry the film; it is good. However, although it is well photographed; Tokyo is not a nice place. Take Roman Holiday; another similar film along similar lines. That film also made the best use of it's surroundings to increase the impact of the film, the only difference is that it's locations were beautiful. Rome is a beautiful city; the style of the architecture, the relaxed feel of the city is incredible; Tokyo looks cheap and nasty. This is very much an opinion; but Tokyo is a hive of plastic rubbish and is overall a place with a very low quality feel. The town is not beautiful; in Roman Holiday, the location almost took on a life of it's own, and it increased the potency of the film; here all we have is an awful metropolis that offsets the potential beauty of the story. The hosts of the film; the Japanese, were also not portrayed in the best light. Onto the acting, then. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were praised for their performances in this movie, and they both got the essence of their characters right. Bill Murray did, at times, look like he was trying to be funny and never really pulling it off, though. However, I cant give any plaudits for the acting. The characters in the film are, like the rest of the film, subdued, and I'm sorry; but anyone can do subdued. I can mope around looking solemn and bored, and so can anyone else; it's the roles that require charisma and the actor to work that should win the awards; not stuff like this. This is typical awards fodder, however; and I'm afraid it will continue to be like this and I will continue to be baffled by it. But neither Scarlett, nor Bill won the award; and neither Scarlett nor Bill deserved the award. Sofia Coppola can create a picture that's memorable; the shot where a pink wig wearing Scarlett puts her down on Bill's lap sticks out in my memory, as does the scene with Bill on the bed; but when it comes to creating a scene, Sofia doesn't do memorable, I saw this film a little under two hours ago, and I've forgotten bits of it already. This is mostly due to the fact that in it's 95 minute (or so) running time, nothing really happens; and if a movie is forgettable, it cannot be a masterpiece. And forgettable, Lost in Translation is. The scenes tend to lack things which would make them memorable because they're so subdued and they fade into each other; which although this creates fluidity in the scenes, it discredits the movie because nothing really stands out from anything else. Overall, Lost in Translation is not an awful film; it does have its plus points, but it's not a great film either. Lost in Translation is forgettable, it doesn't stand up, in any way, to the Romance genre's true milestones; Casablanca, It Happened One Night, Roman Holiday etc. It left me feeling cold at it's conclusion. And that's not a note that a masterpiece should end on. Lost in Translation is not a boring film, and it does have enough to hold the audience's interest throughout, but once the movies ends and the curtains close, does Lost in Translation really have an impact?",3,12,27,31 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Nothing on the originals, but still a good film
","I am a life-long Star Wars fan, but there's no denying that the long awaited prequel, The Phantom Menace, wasn't exactly a great movie. Lucas went wrong with that film because rather than retaining the style of the original trilogy, he was too keen to make the movie friendly to new audiences, and more specifically; a young audience, which made the film lacking in many older Star Wars fans eyes. Thankfully, by the time of the second sequel, Lucas seems to have learnt his lesson and the film has a much more adult slant to it, plus it has that lovely 'Star Wars' feel, so it comes across as being much more linked to the original trilogy of films. The story this time round makes for an exciting ride, and it sees the first real steps towards the original trilogy of films. We catch up with our lead characters sometime after The Phantom Menace, in the midst of a galactic war. Separatist leaders have gathered their collective armies and now, under the command of the mysterious Count Dooku, are posing a serious threat to the Republic, and when you add this to an assassination plot and a love story between Luke and Leia's parents, Anakin and Padmé, we've got a film on our hands! In spite of being a hell of a lot better than the first prequel, this film doesn't even come within spitting distance of what Lucas has already shown he can do. The original trilogy of films is better than this one in every respect, but at least Lucas' talent is allowed to shine through. The way that he created his Star Wars world shows his genius, and this film expands on that world in a much bigger way than The Phantom Menace did. The new worlds on display are nothing short of amazing, with the water planet of the cloners sticking out in particular. Lucas has also given the Star Wars fans something to think about with the inclusion of Jango Fett and his cloned son, whom fans will know as the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett. The CGI effects hinder the film more than help it, however, and although the effects in the original films weren't all that brilliant; at least they were true to the 'B' movie feel of the films. Computer generated effects just don't look right, and not only that but they give the film a very lazy feel. At least with proper effects, you know that someone put some effort in.One thing I like about George is his respect towards British actors; the casting of Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing in the original show that, and I personally was pleased to see Cushing's Hammer Horror regular co-star Christopher Lee make an appearance as the villain of the piece. While Lee isn't given enough screen time to aptly show his talent, it's nice to see him in the movie and his screen presence alone ensures that he's believable as the baddie. Casting Anakin Skywalker was always going to be difficult as it's such a central role, and all that audiences know of him from the original trilogy was a man in a suit, so Lucas wouldn't have all that much to go on; but Hayden Christensen really wasn't the best choice for the lead. He has the right look for the role, but his acting talents leave a lot to be desired. Lucas' script can be blamed somewhat for Christensen's poor performance, but for such a central role; an actor with more talent should have been selected. Speaking of the script for this movie...it's definitely an aspect that Lucas let himself down with. While there aren't too many truly horrible lines in the movie, there's enough to warrant the writing a thumbs down. Still, Star Wars was never about great writing anyway.Attack of the Clones is most definitely an entertaining ride. Ironically, when the battle starts in the final third, the film loses some of it's vitality and the first two thirds are far more interesting. Still, Star Wars fans will be pleased with this film. I just wish he'd got it right with Episode I.",7,2,7,24 May 2005
Corpse Bride," Dazzling Gothic animation!
","After the huge, and endearing, success of Nightmare Before Christmas - director Tim Burton has returned to Gothic animation, this time as director, with the superbly macabre 'Corpse Bride'! Personally, I prefer live action films; but when animation looks this good, I can hardly complain. Corpse Bride is rich with skeletons, spiders, maggots and a lush dark atmosphere - making this the most horrific 'kids' animated film I've ever seen. Many of the sequences really are quite macabre, which was surprising considering most kids films tend to have a 'nice' slant. One criticism I do have for Corpse Bride is that it's theme is wasted a little. The ideas behind the central plot are too complex, and the film never really explores any of them in great detail. Don't get me wrong, I like this film; but I also feel that a really, really great live action film could be made from a similar plot. Anyway, the basics of the story are that a young man forced into an arranged marriage accidentally finds himself married to a corpse after putting the wedding ring on her finger while rehearsing his vows. Oops! The style of the film is absolutely wonderful. The lushly Gothic visuals are married to a distinctly dark picture, and this results in a great base for the macabre plot line. Many of the scenes look absolutely amazing - the title character's introduction scene being the best of them! Burton has gathered up an array of talent for the making of this film, including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson and Helena Bonham Carter in the leads; and horror icons Christopher Lee and Michael Gough delivering great supporting performances. Danny Elfman has created another great score, and while I don't usually say that I'm a fan of musical numbers in films like this; most of the songs here are actually quite entertaining. The character development is surprisingly good too, with the final outcomes of the leads being believable in spite of the fact that they're just lumps of clay. On the whole, while this film lacks the depth that the themes behind the story deserves; the animation is top quality, the film is lots of fun and there's enough dazzling sequences to ensure that any horror fan will enjoy this movie. Look out for the Peter Lorre-soundalike in the role of the maggot that lives behind the Corpse Bride's eye!",7,5,8,21 November 2005
Predator," Arnie is at his best in this sci-fi classic!
","This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid, I have only seen it once during adulthood; and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film, gory horror and intriguing sci-fi, and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes, it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favourably remembered. He's not a good actor, but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...The jungle makes for a great setting for an action sci-fi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space, so seeing the action down here on earth is different; and the fact that it's set in the jungle, with it's dense foliage, ensures that Die Hard-director John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense, as just like in the Vietnam war; the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens' - but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend, Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case. The action is great, and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious, and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either! Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor; but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence, not his acting ability, that makes his performances what they are. At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs. Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either, as an assortment of muscle men, including ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, and Carl Weathers; Rocky's Apollo Creed, among other B-movie actors, join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien', but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous, but never goes over the top and on the whole, Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It's mindless fun - but its damn good mindless fun!",9,158,189,1 February 2006
The Aviator," Entertaining and well done biopic
","I'm not usually a fan of biopics, or even Martin Scorsese films in general, but surprisingly enough; this one, in spite of it's lukewarm critical reaction, is actually really good, and definitely well worth seeing. Much of the criticism landed on The Aviator has come about because of the fact that it's not very deep and while this is a problem for the film, it didn't upset me too much because what we do have is a stylish and always interesting film, which evenly covers up it's shortfall in substance with it's positive aspects. The film follows the story of Howard Hughes; an aeroplane and filmmaker in Hollywood's golden era. The film starts during the troubled shoot of Hughes' debut film; Hell's Angels, and ends somewhat prematurely as Hughes is still a young man. We are never really allowed to get into the subject's head, but this doesn't seem to be an accident, as it was obvious to me that Scorsese was more interested in portraying the history behind the man than his psychological profile. Scorsese gives us enough of the man to keep us interested in him, but stays true to the facts of his life to an extent in which the film is always kept interesting.Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have replaced Robert DeNiro as Scorsese's muse, and despite a disappointing turn in the sub-standard 'Gangs of New York', DiCaprio shines here and really does well as the rich, yet troubled, Hollywood icon at the centre of this story. Scorsese seems to have a bit overboard with the cast, as several big names of the present appear as big names of the past. Cate Blanchett irritated me just as much as the real Katherine Hepburn did, which shows the greatness of her performance. Kate Beckinsale and, surprisingly, Gwen Stefani give life to two of Hollywood's golden girls; Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow as well, while smaller roles such as that of the charismatic Errol Flyn fall to the likes of Jude Law. This was the film's major selling point for me - there's something great about the big stars of today portraying the big stars of the golden age, and the way that Scorsese populates almost every scene with the big names of the time ensures that this is as much a film fan's movie as it is a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Critics can complain about a lack of substance as much as they like, but what I saw here was an excellently stylish take on one of Hollywood's most intriguing figures, and I don't hesitate to call this Scorsese's finest hour since Goodfellas back in 1990.",8,1,1,4 September 2005
28 Weeks Later," Soulless, boring and ridiculously stupid - a turgid sequel to an overrated original.
","I wasn't in a rush to see this film when it was released as, despite the fact that the idea for the film is interesting, the film that this one sprang from - 28 Days Later - is one of my least favourite popular modern horror films. I was really hoping that this sequel would deliver, and after the first ten minutes, it seemed like it might do. I'm not a fan of the whole fast zombie thing, but the opening to this film is action packed and exciting and it seemed like the film was going to give way to something like the film that the original one could have been. The basic plot is similar to George Romero's Land of the Dead, and focuses on the idea of survivors coming back to live in a land savaged by zombies. In particular we focus on one family, the mother of which we see killed when the father left her to the hordes of undead and ran away. The story picks up when the kids return from a refugee camp in Spain to live with their father. The first half of the film is really quite good; we get plenty of eerie location shots and the plot seems fairly interesting...but then the first twist comes into play and it seems like the writers are taking their audience for fools...I can't believe how ridiculously stupid the central plot of this movie is. Without giving anything away, the script writers take coincidence, stir it up with plenty of moronic character decisions, sprinkle on a few plot holes and expect everyone to buy into it! (And even more unbelievably, many people have...). Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo expertly captures the soulless, MTV music video style of the first film, and ensures that the characters snugly fit this, as despite a little character building for Robert Carlyle's character; everyone featured is impossible to care for, and the two central characters are incredibly irritating, too. Fresnadillo obviously subscribes to the view that freewheeling camera angles and flashy editing make films exciting, and that's a shame as they don't. This stuff only serves in making the film boring as it's usually impossible to see what's going on. The film does have a couple of plus points; the shots of an abandoned London are good, there's also a cool scene involving a horde of zombies and a helicopter and, as mentioned, the first ten minutes are good. Other than that, 28 Weeks Later is a horrible film with so many illogical distractions that I didn't even bother to think that Wembley Stadium wouldn't have been finished by the time of this film if there wasn't anyone around to finish it. I honestly can't believe this film got, and continues to get, good reviews...there's far better horror out there than this.",4,1,15,8 October 2007
Cast Away," Engaging and very powerful
","Cast Away is the sort of film that filmmakers should be striving to give their audiences more often. While it's not wholly original, and influences from the classic Robinson Crusoe story especially shine through, we haven't seen all that many films of this nature in recent years and therefore this is a refreshing yarn. Tom Hanks stars as the businessman unlucky enough to find himself stranded, all alone, on an island in the middle of nowhere. Completely cut off from any kind of society, our hero must do all he can to survive the elements that he has found himself in. Unlike most films that we've seen Hanks in before, this performance is very much of a physical nature, and his lack of dialogue gives the actor a very different feel to what he usually evokes from the audience. Tom Hanks had to work hard to give this performance, as the role requires a lot of hard work; but he's risen to the challenge excellently, and this movie has given me more respect for the actor I, at one time, didn't have any respect for at all.The way that Robert Zemeckis draws us into the protagonist's plight is really well done, and throughout the movie you almost feel like you are marooned on the island as well. I was sat transfixed with the action on screen, and my viewing of this movie marks one of the most engaging I've ever had in my film watching career. It's amazing how Hanks can be sat talking to a volleyball with grass stuck to it's head and have the audience engrossed in the action. Ironically, Hanks talking to a volleyball was much more interesting than any conversations he had with real actors in movies such as Philadelphia and Apollo 13. The film is very realistic throughout, and this helps the movie no end when it comes to drawing the audience in as this could very much be a documentary feature of a true story; such is the realism of the picture. It comes across most evidently in the scenes that see Hanks writhe in pain after gashing his leg on a stray rock in the ocean. We actually FEEL his pain, and that is testament to the power of this movie. It took me five years to finally catch this film, and even then it was only by accident. If I was you and I hadn't seen this film yet, I'd do so ASAP.",8,0,1,5 June 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Bloodthirsty mutant cannibals in the American wasteland
","The question most people ask when it comes to modern day remakes is 'why remake a classic?', but the question I ask of this one is 'why call it The Hills Have Eyes?' Many films have been made before and after Wes Craven's original shocker with similar ideas, so why not take the basic plot idea and give it a new title; thus making it a new film. Judged on its own merits, Alexandre Aja's exploitation horror flick is actually a good film, but it loses credibility unnecessarily just because it's a part of the remake crowd. After an explosive beginning which gives you an idea of what Aja intends to do with the remake; the pace relaxes a little as we get to know the doomed family at the centre of the piece. While this may not be very exciting, it pays dividends towards the end when the mutant cannibals start to get their own way. We follow a family who decide to take a holiday that involves driving through the desert. After fuelling their car, the helpful petrol station attendant tells them of a shortcut in the desert; but after they have a crash, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't the only ones amidst the nuclear hills.Towards the start of the film, Aja packs the film with references to nuclear testing which leads us to believe that he wants to go deeper with the plot. However, by the end it all feels very half-arsed, as apart from a few references towards the mentality of America - these ideas never really bear any fruit. Ted Levine heads a capable cast in a role that is a world away from his turn as Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, and actually feels a lot like a Sid Haig impression. The rest of the cast have some impressive film and TV credits between them, but nobody is a particularly 'big' actor, which actually does this sort of film credit. The real stars of the show are the make-up department, who do a great job with the mutant cannibals. They all look very realistic, and it's easy to believe that the people in the film actually are mutants. The violence and gore is fairly heavy, although Aja is actually quite restrained in this respect, as it only occurs when needed and never goes too over the top. Aja also does well with the scare factor, as he continually creates a foreboding atmosphere by way of lots of scare tactics, including the backwater desert atmosphere, glimpses of the killers early on and my personal favourite - the voices that come over the walkie talkies.The main reason that this film works is not because of the violence, however, it's the way that Aja almost makes the audience a part of the central family. The characters are all well defined and realistically done; and this means that once we get to the horror of the piece, it really is horrific. Aja does go over the top with this towards the end, but in general the characters are very well defined, and I certainly cared a lot more about the family in this remake than I did in Wes Craven's original. It seems obvious that Alexandre Aja approached this film with care, and he definitely did have a lot to live up to after the surprise hit 'High Tension' the year before. The director certainly has talent, maybe even the potential to become one of the modern masters of horror; but I'm disappointed that this was his second film, as I really think that if he'd created something original, it could have been something really special. The fact that this film feels like an attempt for him to break into the American market is too obvious also. I do have faith that some day he'll top his debut film - but he hasn't done it with this. On its own merits, however, The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is a good film, and Aja can certainly be proud of himself for doing Craven's original justice.",8,97,165,13 March 2006
North by Northwest," Entertaining thrill-ride from start to finish
","Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of films, many of which are very good; and a select group of which are out and out masterpieces. His 1959 spy thriller, North by Northwest is undoubtedly among the man's best work; yet it stands out as something of a black sheep among the great director's other works. While the likes of Vertigo and Rear Window pull the viewer into the story by way of an intriguing and mysterious plot line; North by Northwest goes completely the other way, and draws you in with simple, old-fashioned entertainment value. It's true that there isn't much substance here, but at the same time; you can't doubt North by Northwest's credibility for a second, as Hitchcock has laid on the style and his story telling is as sharp as ever. The plot is typically Hitchcockian and sees a man kidnapped by a group of gangsters; on the mistake the he is someone else. After narrowly escaping, our hero goes on the run; from both the gangsters and the law. As he is drawn deeper and deeper into unfolding events, he finds himself more and more unable to stop them unfolding.By today's standards, North by Northwest could be seen as clichéd. Hitchcock has thrown in all the common spy thriller elements; from femme fatales and a British villain, to car chases and even an overblown finale; but Hitchcock implements all these elements in such a way that the film never feels old hat and, even now, nearly five decades on; North by Northwest is still an entertaining thriller, and that is testament to Hitchcock's endearing talent, as many of the recent films that are entertaining now, probably wont be fifty years down the line. Every set piece in the movie is beautifully engineered, and as the plot is perfectly paced; nothing ever seems like it shouldn't be there, and North by Northwest flows excellently. The film is best remembered for stand-out sequences including the famous bi-plane scene, but even those scenes, that have been seen separate from the movie many times, don't feel like they've been tacked on when viewing the movie in it's entirety. Many movies these days have instances that are there merely to be in the trailer and such; but here, Hitchcock is as restrained as ever, yet he still manages to insert scenes like this into the film.To be honest, I think Cary Grant got the short end of the stick with Hitchcock's films. While James Stewart got Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rear Window, Grant only got gifted with Suspicion, To Catch a Thief, Notorious and this film; and while this one is very good, the rest of the Grant-Hitchcock collaborations are not among either man's best work. However, fans of both of these cinema legends can be thankful for North by Northwest, as both are on top of their game and in that instance; only a fine film can ensue. This isn't Cary Grant's best performance; sometimes he looks a bit out of place, and he's definitely spent too long on the sun beds - but his charm and charisma lifts even his most disappointing performances, and the one here certainly isn't one of those. Hitchcock's direction is flawless, and the film never feels clumsy or gets boring at any stage. If I was going to nit-pick, I would perhaps say that the film could have been streamlined a little bit more; but overall, North by Northwest is an entertaining classic that all fans of cinema need to see!",10,2,4,13 November 2005
The Orphanage," Runs short on ideas and lacks atmosphere and suspense.
","To say I'm disappointed with this film would be putting it lightly. For the last few months I've heard nothing but praise for The Orphanage and thus went into expecting to see something special, but what I got instead was just another slow burning ghost story without much in the way of interest. Guillermo del Toro has a production credit on this film; and it's a real shame that some of his creativity didn't rub off on director Juan Antonio Bayona, because The Orphanage has nothing on 2001's orphanage-set ghost story 'The Devil's Backbone'. As the title suggests, the bulk of this film takes place in an orphanage. Laura was raised there as an orphan, and has taken her husband and adopted son Simón to live in the orphanage where she grew up. The boy is HIV positive and has found himself five imaginary friends. Laura has decided to reopen the orphanage specifically for disabled children; but the opening day turns sour when her son begs his adopted mother to see something, but ends up being ignored On the technical side, there's really nothing wrong with this film. It's very well shot and the directing is sound; it also features a capable (if slightly clichéd) lead performance from Belén Rueda. The problems are in the plot and execution as the simple fact is that it's just not interesting enough. Similar stories to this one have been told many times and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre is liable to have seen at least one comparable film. The film has practically no atmosphere either; the central house is too drab to be a horror location and we are never given the idea that any of the lead characters are in any sort of danger, which ensures that the film lacks suspense also. The Orphanage is not very visceral; although that shouldn't be a problem as it's to be expected in a ghost story; but that's not made up for in any way. The ghosts themselves bring a little atmosphere when they appear, but they're not 'horrific' and the film can hardly even be considered horror. Overall, The Orphanage is a big disappointment and anyone thinking of seeing it should think about not wasting their time and seeing The Devil's Backbone instead.",5,17,31,12 October 2008
Doctor Zhivago," No Lawrence or Kwai, but still not bad
","David Lean is a director famous for two types of films. Firstly, he made a lot of small-scale romance films back in the forties (the best of which being Brief Encounter), and secondly (and more importantly), he's known for directing sprawling epic films! The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia are more well known, and liked, than Doctor Zhivago; and for good reason, are both films are better than this one. That's not to say that Zhivago is a bad film, but it lacks the storytelling of Lawrence of Arabia, and the exciting action of The Bridge on the River Kwai. The film is based on the famous book by Boris Pasternak, and is a story that takes place during the Russian Revolution. More important than the setting is the story behind it, and Doctor Zhivago follows the story of doctor turned poet, Yuri Zhivago. In true epic fashion, we follow him throughout his life - from childhood, all the way up to adulthood where he finds himself at odds with the state, and his love life; as he, despite being married, still finds time to fall for a political activist's wife.This film really shows David Lean's talent for epics, as regardless of being over three hours long; the film really doesn't feel like it, and that's thanks to the excellent plotting. Lean keeps the paced relaxed, and that ensures that the plot is easy to follow and always interesting, as the film never gets bombarded with too many things going on at once (which it could have, given how many things happen in this film), and the way that the focus remains on the character of Yuri Zhivago helps to ensure this further. The acting, as usual, is excellent; with Omar Sheriff taking the lead role, and doing excellently with it. Carrying a film of this magnitude cant be easy, but while watching Omar Sheriff, you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. Julie Christie stars opposite him, as do Rod Steiger, as do Tom Courtenay, Geraldine Chaplin and Klaus Kinski. Alec Guinness appears in the film also, and despite not having a lot of screen time - makes a mark with what he has, and enforces the opinion that he's one of the greatest actors of all time. On the whole, I can't say I loved this film, and I don't think I'll see it again; but it's worth watching - especially if you liked Lean's other epics.",7,2,6,31 January 2006
"I, Robot"," Most definitely one of 2004's best blockbusters
","Will Smith films are always worth watching. They aren't always very good; but they're always worth watching. The reason that they're always worth watching is that they all have one thing in common; Will Smith. Will Smith has always been worth watching; from the early days in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, to today in I, Robot; the guy has a very pronounced star power. He more than has enough to carry a film all on his own, as he proved with Men in Black and Wild Wild Westbut wait; there actually is a film under here.I, Robot is adapted from a novel by cult sci-fi writer, Isscar Asimov. It is evident that the film is adapted from a book throughout, as, despite all the explosions and stunts; the film does feel very old-school, and that is rare in today's blockbusters. Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a police inspector with a prejudice against robots. The story really starts when Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of the robots is killed in an apparent suicide. Will Smith, however, refuses to believe that this man merely killed himself and, naturally, believes that a robot is the murderer; and proceeds to investigate. As you may have guessed from that description; this film takes obvious influence from classics such as Blade Runner. With it's vision of the future, the film does feel very much like a lighter version of said film throughout. The first thing you will notice about I, Robot is that Will Smith isn't believable as a police inspector. It is set in the future, and maybe in the future police inspectors will be smart talking, cocky, back-chatting, swaggering womanisers; but it just seems like he was cast because he's Will Smith. However, as I mentioned earlier; Will Smith has the star power, and he is the reason to watch; so as far as I'm concerned, he can be as unbelievable as he wants and I'll still watch. The rest of the cast is pretty much irrelevant; they all perform to an adequate standard, but overall; they are testament to Will's star power. Alex Proyas, a man that made his name with the fairly rated; The Crow, takes the directors chair. Proyas isn't a director that will be featuring in any 'best director of all time' discussions, but he does a good job here. The film looks lovely, and it's well paced. Although it features explosions and high-octane stunts (which are all well executed), the film obviously wants to make it's story the main focus; and that is admirable in any film, especially a blockbuster. Not only is the story behind I, Robot engaging and interesting; but it's also deep and complex enough to get you thinking. The point behind I, Robot is even relevant to today's world; and that's not something that every blockbuster does! I, Robot is definitely one of the better blockbusters of summer 2004. Although Spider-Man 2 easily edges it out, there is no shame in being second to that. I, Robot is a glorious winner that does action and storytelling, which will please everyone; and it is, therefore, hugely recommended.",8,2,3,7 September 2004
The Alamo," A dismal and boring account of a historical event
","I consider myself quite open minded when it comes to film genres, as I will, basically, watch anything regardless of what type of film it is. Of course, I have my preferences; but I believe that a good film will shine through whatever genre it hails from. However, if I was to choose a genre as my 'least favourite', historical period drama would probably take the honours. That, coupled with the fact that I consider American history to be one of the most boring subjects ever means that, basically, I am in the wrong movie with The Alamo. However, since I have spent two hours of my life watching this film, I feel I have the right to comment, and that is something I intend to do: Basically, this film suffers because it's BORING. If you're going to tackle a dull subject, the least you can do is tackle it in a way that is going to be interesting for the audience. Intrigue can be accomplished via a number of methods; character development is one of them, a strong story is another; but this film manages to capitalise on neither. Main characters die and major events happens and, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. This is not good for a film that is supposed to be portraying an important historical event. The Alamo also gives off a very 'cheap' impression, and that coupled with the fact that it received an almost completely incognito release makes the audience feel that they have stumbled upon a made for TV film. The fact that the battles are poorly, and very much under, done doesn't exactly bode well for the film either. This film is also a personal landmark for Dennis Quaid, as it is his second terrible film of 2004 (the other being, obviously, The Day After Tomorrow). At least Billy bob Thornton approaches his role with gusto, but his over-American performance hardly saves it.Basically, you could do something better with this part of your life. If the subject of The Alamo interests you, then I recommend finding a book on the subject or maybe even checking out one of the earlier films, as they're bound to be better than this dismal affair.",3,4,13,28 December 2004
Wanted," Over the top and stupid, but still an entertaining action flick
","If you go into Wanted expecting life-affirming brilliance, you will be disappointed; but if you go in expecting an adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride, you should come out at least fairly contented. The film is apparently based on some comic book and is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, a name some may recognise as the director behind Russian vampire film Night Watch and its sequel. The film is style over substance in a big way, although it does at least attempt to have some substance by way of the basic idea of a normal man living a boring life being given the chance to fulfil his destiny by way of a much more exciting life as a professional assassin. His boring life is thrown into turmoil one day when he meets the sexy Fox and, after being saved from a hit-man himself, he is recruited into a group of assassins known as The Fraternity. He is taught how to use his hidden super powers; which include the ability to slow things down, shoot bullets in a circular motion and drive rubbish cars really fast. Our hero then learns the reason he was brought in to The Fraternity and the destiny that awaits him.The film takes on a very 'MTv' style and the action is continually paused, overloaded with CGI and/or quickly edited. Things like this usually annoy me, and with this film it does start to grate after a while; but the director actually uses these tricks fairly well (particularly in the first twenty minutes or so) which is a credit to him and the film. Once the plot kicks into action, we basically get treated to one action sequence after another and calling them 'over the top would be a gross understatement. Most of the things that happen in this film are completely ridiculous, but it soon becomes obvious that the film is not meant to be taken seriously and it's better to sit back and enjoy the ride. The plot itself has a number of holes and doesn't make complete sense when you think about it; but again, leaving your brain at the door is highly recommended. There's a couple of twists and turns along the way to keep the story interesting, and although the ending is not completely unexpected; it wraps things up nicely and overall, if you're looking for a film to entertain and not be too taxing; you could do worse than Wanted.",7,5,10,29 June 2008
The Battle of Algiers," Cold, brutal and hard to connect with
","The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a true-life event, they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.The cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point - it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually, but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic, so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it; except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for; The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt, it's not as potent as it could, and by rights should, have been. Due to the current state of the world, most notably the current mood in the USA, The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays, which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society. On the whole, I respect this movie for it's technical achievement and the fact that it offers an unbiased account of an important event in history. But I don't like it.",4,35,66,14 April 2005
Disturbia," Does justice to Hitchcock's Rear Window - an excellent modern thriller!
","Like most serious horror fans, I'm not pleased by the way that the genre is being flooded by too many remakes! A modern re-imaging of Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Rear Window' therefore didn't seem too promising on paper, but director D.J. Caruso has done an excellent job with this film! It takes all the things that made Rear Window a classic, adds in a modern twist and keeps the whole piece just different enough for Disturbia not to feel like a rip-off! Rather than a broken leg, our protagonist this time around is housebound via a modern means. After a family tragedy, Kale finds himself frustrated and angry, and a smart comment from his Spanish teacher ends up with the teacher on the floor and the Kale under house arrest, enforced by an electronic tag that puts an automatic call into the police station if he's more than 100 years away from his house for more than 10 seconds. Bored, he turns to the window, where he discovers sexy new neighbour Ashley...and something more sinister in the form of 'Mr Turner' - the next door neighbour whom Kale comes to believe may be a Texan serial killer...Disturbia is brought to life by an excellent cast, who all perform excellently in their respective roles. Shia LeBeouf is thoroughly likable in the central role; giving it a nice mix of angsty teenager and curious rogue. Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo fill out the other two young persons' roles nicely, while Carrie-Anne Moss convinces as the mother - and David Morse gives his best performance in years as the villain of the piece! Being more used to seeing him in more gentle roles in films such as The Green Mile, it's surprising to see just how well he fits into the bad guy role. Director D.J. Caruso, who previously made the less than brilliant Taking Lives, does a real good job of providing the thrills with Disturbia. The film works on two levels; on the one hand, it's a teen drama and on the other it's a thriller and these two elements mix brilliantly. At times, the tension is almost unbearable - and it's that which made Rear Window such a blast fifty three years earlier! Overall, this might not be completely original - but it's a great thriller in spite of that fact, and I'm sure it will appeal to most members of the audience. Highly recommended!",8,4,8,16 September 2007
Van Helsing," Classic horror writers, actors and directors turn in their graves
","The idea behind this film comes off the back of this recent trend of blending together different stories to make one lesser story; the stories in question being, principally; those of Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man. From this premise, you can't expect 'greatness', but you can expect a fun romp and, suffice to say, this film doesn't even deliver on that front; as it's action-fuelled monster antics get tiresome very quickly indeed. Stephen Sommers has basically done what he did with The Mummy, in that he's taken an existing story and added CGI effects, only this time the result is a miserable mess of a film with absolutely terrible CGI and a complete lack of intrigue from the characters and the plot line. The muddled plot basically follows Count Dracula, who has decided to enlist the help of Baron Frankenstein, along with a werewolf to help him in his plot to do...something. Enter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman); the intelligent (or not, in this case) monster hunter that goes on Dracula's tail along with an irritating priest and a Princess (played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale) and what follows is what should be an entertaining monster mash, but what is actually a dull, cliché ridden, action film with little or nothing of what made it's influences great.Dracula has been turned from a malevolent conglomeration of evil into a comic book villain. Frankenstein's Monster has taken way too much of the emotional side that Karloff portrayed so brilliantly in 'Bride of Frankenstein' and is little more than a pathetic mess of a character. The way that the werewolves are integrated into the story is actually quite good, but that's shot down in flames by the fact that the wolves themselves look ridiculous. Whoever decided that CGI was the best way to do effects wants shooting; it looks rubbish, and the only reason I can think of why it's used is to save valuable time that would have been used creating real effects. If you want evidence of how NOT to do special effects, see the Mr Hyde sequence towards the start. Absolutely awful. The title character is nothing like the character that Bram Stoker wrote for him. I don't even know why they chose to use the name 'Van Helsing' anyway, most of the target audience will have never have heard of him and since he's nothing like the character that the likes of Peter Cushing and Anthony Hopkins portrayed so well, they might as well have simply made a new monster hunter for the film. Then I wouldn't have been bothered about him being called 'Gabriel' instead of 'Abraham'. Kate Beckinsale could have been the film's saving grace, but even Mrs sweetness herself isn't herself in this awful film. I don't know if it's the terrible accent, the rubbish haircut or the daft outfits; but she's nothing like the ultra sexy character she played in the surprisingly good 'Underworld'.Basically, what we have here is a film that was made by a man that thought he had an idea that was good enough to carry a film on it's own. The complete lack of ideas and reliance on changes to the original characters shows that, and this is a very sad motion picture indeed. You may have gone into this expecting something of a tribute to the great horror classics, but this film features little in the way of horror at all. If you ever wanted to see a film that showed beyond doubt that CGI isn't the way to create good effects, this is the film to see. But since you don't want to see a film like that, you have no reason to see 'Van Helsing'. My advice is to avoid this trash at all costs.",3,2,6,12 January 2005
Being John Malkovich," Absolutely sublime modern classic
","Originality is one thing that I very much admire in cinema, and it's also the reason I rate Being John Malkovich so highly. Charlie Kaufman has taken an amazingly weird premise and twisted round a suitably offbeat story to create a movie that is as bizarre as it is as it is compelling, and it's definitely a major highlight of American cinema in the 1990's. Charlie Kaufman may have scripted his most acclaimed film in 2004 with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but if you want to see his best work - you need look no further than his first feature. Quite how anyone could have thought of this premise remains a mystery, but I'm certainly glad that Kaufman did. The story revolves around a portal that leads directly into the head of the actor, John Malkovich. After discovering this portal, puppeteer Craig Schwartz shares it with his colleague and crush, the beautiful Maxine Lund. Things start to get complicated when Craig's wife, Lottie, becomes involved and it turns out that Craig's not the only one with a crush on Maxine.The usually presentable John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are completely unrecognisable as this film's leading couple and both give career highlight performances. Catherine Keener fleshes out a threesome of leads. She is seductively sexy, and delivers a performance that reflects the quality of this film on the whole. And, of course, John Malkovich stars also. The fact that it's John Malkovich who is the title actor is what really makes this film. Had the film have been, say, 'Being Tom Cruise'; it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact. Malkovich is a big actor, but he's not THAT big and the fact that it's him takes the film away from the mainstream and allows it's offbeat indie roots to stay intact. Kaufman ensures that the story works by constantly adding new and weird events into the plot, and this in turn ensures that we never know what's coming next. Of course, this is exactly what you want from any film. The elements of the story aren't bound tightly enough to really make a lasting impression where substance is concerned; but it hardly matters, as there's enough offbeat invention in this film to more than adequately mask that fact It's easy to call this movie pretentious or silly; but it's also pointless. Being John Malkovich is a modern classic.",8,55,88,5 July 2005
The Machinist," Dark and gritty - a great film!
","In the middle of the mass of blockbusters, dumbed down horror movies and samey Indie dramas; it's nice to see that some filmmakers still feel the need to push the bar and deliver something different. The Machinist is a deeply dark and disturbing movie that sees Christian Bale as a worker in an industrial factory. If he were any skinnier, he wouldn't exist and he hasn't slept in a year; but still he manages to carry on his mundane existence. Things aren't quite rosy in his life either; strange things are happening to him without explanation and it isn't long before our protagonist doubts his own sanity. Christian Bale lost an amazing 63 pounds for this movie, and while it might have been a struggle for the actor; it certainly wasn't in vain! Bale's stick-like, ill appearance adds immensely to the film and if director Brad Anderson hadn't got himself such a dedicated performer in Christian Bale, The Machinist wouldn't have been half the film it is. Bale has impressed on numerous occasions, and it's about time he got praise he deserves.Christian Bale's main co-star is most definitely the atmosphere. Brad Anderson is keen to get down and dirty with this movie, and he's given it a truly downbeat, gritty style. This is absolutely great to look at, especially for fans of macabre movies. The claustrophobic camera angles add to this atmosphere and help to enforce the idea that the machinist is living in his own surreal environment. The plot works more from a premise than an actual story; but this is good as it allows the director to put the focus of the story squarely on the protagonist, and his decent into insanity provides an ample base for an intriguing movie. The Machinist is a very encouraging film, as it shows that there is still room for dark, macabre films in modern cinema. Brad Anderson's earlier feature 'Session 9' shows that the man has a real flair for atmosphere, and it will be interesting to see how his remake of George Romero's less than brilliant 'The Crazies' turns out. On the whole, this film is excellent. The atmosphere is beautifully done, the acting is superb and the film manages to keep your interest throughout. What more could you ask for?",8,8,13,31 July 2005
Aliens," The aliens are back...bigger, better and more!
","It has become customary among film fans to name Ridley Scott's original 'Alien' as the best of the series; but that is a notion that I cannot agree with. James Cameron's sequel is bigger, more ambitious, more exciting and just generally a better time than it's predecessor. The claustrophobic suspense-driven horror of the first film has thrown out of the window in favour of a more boisterous action stance. This would normally get on my nerves, but Cameron knows how to handle action so well that it's impossible not to go along with everything he shows on screen; and the switch from horror to action, therefore, is very much a good one. The plot is well thought out, and it follows the rescue of Ripley, the heroine of the first film, and it isn't long before she's being asked to go back into action. People have inhabited the planet where her crew picked up the first alien, and that population has become infested with bloodthirsty aliens. Enter a well-equipped team of space marines given the task of going in and finding out what the trouble is. Of course, it's more trouble than they ever imagined...James Cameron said himself that he wanted to make aliens 'Vietnam in space' - and that's exactly what he's done. The marines are well equipped and trained, but that doesn't mean anything when you can't see your enemy. Like the Viet-Kong, the aliens blend into their background and strike without being seen. This idea benefits the film in two ways. Firstly, it gives it an intelligent edge, as it's not merely just humans blowing aliens to bits or vice versa, and secondly; it's far more exciting this way! The pivotal scene mid-way through the movie where we meet the aliens for the first time shows this best. The special effects in Aliens are great, and show the massive detrimental effect that CGI has had on cinema. All the effects here have been done properly, and they look far better than ninety-nine percent of the movies done with computers. It's much easier to buy into a film where someone has actually put effort into making the effects 'special', and that for me is worth the extra time, money and effort that real effects cost. My only complaint on the aesthetic front for the film is the cinematography. The atmosphere is downtrodden, so it suits the movie; but it also gives it a sort of nostalgic feel that the movie could do without.The acting in Aliens is superb, with Sigourney Weaver heading an excellent ensemble. James Cameron has scripted a range of characters, and each of them is brought to life excellently by the cast. Weaver helps her character's development with some great subtle mannerisms, which help beyond the scripting that Cameron has given her. Michael Beihn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser and Jenette Goldstein are all solid in their roles and bring their characters to life excellently. Lance Henriksen stands out as the android 'Bishop'. You can really believe that he's an 'artificial person', which is quite difficult to do since he's playing something that doesn't actually exist. The real star of the show for me, however, has to be Bill Paxton. Like he's done so many times before and after, Paxton leads the film from the back and steals every scene he's in with his wisecracking and - later - mortal terror. The film is solidly directed, with James Cameron implementing suspense, emotion and action brilliantly at every point that it's needed, and overall I don't hesitate to call this the greatest Action Sci-Fi film ever made, and one of cinema's best on the whole.",10,3,9,14 October 2005
Saw III," Dreary and boring kids' 'horror' movie
","Well, after the disappointment of Saw 2, most people (myself included) figured that the only way this series could go was up, so you can imagine my surprise after seeing Saw III and finding out that it's actually worse! None of these films are very well written, and this dreary third instalment is no different as we're given an unimaginative central plot line that is nigh on impossible to care about, along with the usual amount of swearing, crying and sweaty people looking frightened in rooms that are often so dark that you can't see what's going on. Director Darren Lynn Bousman seems to have got it into his head that flashy editing equals good storytelling, but that is a ridiculous assumption, as all the editing does is make it hard to see what's happening - and that means that all the effort put into the film where the gore and 'inventive' traps are concerned is ultimately wasted as you can never really appreciate it while you're squinting at the screen trying to make out what's happening. This all happens mostly in complete darkness as well, don't forget.The plot line is of the 'highly convenient' variety, as despite being bed-ridden with terminal cancer, Jigsaw has somehow managed to find a man who hates a lot of people for murdering his son. Naturally he wants to play 'a game' with him, and so he's bunged him into some grotty place along with all the people he hates, and they're all hooked up to grisly traps - the idea being that he has to forgive to win the game...etc etc. Meanwhile, Jigsaw has got the doctor in to help him with his cancer - the catch being that if he dies, her head blows up. Believe it or not, this plot gets even more convenient once we get to the final twist. I actually feel quite insulted that the writers of this twaddle actually thought that people would buy into it - there is no reason to care about absolutely anything in this film! The film gets messier still when the director tries to tie all three films together with a series of boring and distracting flash backs where Jigsaw's assistant 'Amanda' remembers stuff they've done together. All in all, Saw III is a load of crap and I'm struggling to come up with anything good to say about it - and that's not usually something that happens when a film is as gory as this one. The kids might like it, but serious horror fans will need to look elsewhere for their thrills.",4,4,10,25 May 2007
Duck You Sucker," Kind of like The Odd Couple, with explosions
","A Fistful of Dynamite is often seen as the black sheep of Sergio Leone's commercial releases; and there's a good reason for that, as despite the fact that it's still a spaghetti western; it's a completely different kettle of fish to both the Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West. A Fistful of Dollars features common western themes such as bandits, guns and bank robberies - but, as he did with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; Sergio Leone has implanted war themes into the plot, and we've also got the bizarre idea of one of the major characters being an IRA bomber! All this stuff doesn't quite come together cleanly, and as the tone of the movie changes often; it seems obvious that Leone has bitten off a bit more than he can chew...but luckily enough, A Fistful of Dynamite remains a fun movie for most of its duration. The plot follows a bandit named Juan, who bumps into a dynamite-laded bomber one day in the desert. Spotting an opportunity for robbery, he manages to recruit the IRA man to his cause; but he doesn't count on being dragged into the revolution that's going on at the same time.The first half of the movie features some very astute elements of tongue-in-cheek humour, and it seems obvious that the director isn't intending the plot to be completely serious. However, at around the halfway point; the movie turns in completely the opposite direction, and the fun and silly first half gives way to a more deep and serious finale. For me, this is the movie's main problem; I like a movie that's unpredictable, but this change in plot feels disjointed and doesn't go down well. The second half of the film isn't as enjoyable to watch either, which harms the fun. However, Sergio Leone's direction is as impressive as ever, with some lovely wide angle shots capturing the beautiful landscapes; while, of course, Leone enjoys giving full focus to his actors for some extreme close-ups. Like the movie, the cast is a mixed bag. James Coburn looks the part, but his silly put-on accent makes him feel like he's having a laugh at times; and similarly, Rod Steiger dons an arguably even sillier accent and doesn't quite get away with it. Overall, A Fistful of Dynamite is not a film to please all viewers. I found it to be enjoyable despite many niggles, but I can understand why a lot of people disagree.",8,38,54,7 July 2006
Quantum of Solace," The name's Bond, James Bond....or is it?
","Martin Campbell's reboot of the James Bond series, Casino Royale, received praise and criticism in equal measures for the fact that it steps away from the James Bond trademarks. This film continues down that path and actually moves things even further away from the Bond tradition. I have to say that I'm not the biggest Bond fan myself and so this didn't bother me too much; but I won't be surprised to find that many Bond fans are not Quantum of Solace fans. As a thriller in its own right, however, the 22nd Bond movie is action packed and entertaining; and certainly a lot better than its title! The film follows on directly from Casino Royale and features James Bond attempting to find revenge for the death of his love who died at the end of the first film. He sets out to get to the bottom of the organisation that was behind her blackmail and intelligence links him to Haiti, where after hooking up with the beautiful and feisty Camille, he is lead to ruthless 'charitable' businessman Dominic Greene and discovers a plot by the shady organisation known as 'Quantum' to take control of the world's most important natural resource.The lack of gadgets is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of differences between the classic Bond film and this reboot. Daniel Craig is a million miles away from the likes of Sean Connery in terms of looks and persona; and his Bond is not even similar in character. While still suave, this James Bond at times comes across more as a highly trained assassin than a secret agent; and only one scene that sees James give British Intelligence the slip in a hotel really reminded me of the resourceful spy seen in the older Bond films. The plot really allows the lead character to show his darker side; but in essence the film is just a collection of stunt sequences and kill scenes; which while undoubtedly entertaining, it not what most people will expect from a Bond film. However, in its own right the film certainly has a lot of positives. The cinematography is gorgeous and this is more than matched by the beautiful locations; which include Italy, Haiti and South America. The best thing about it for me was the casting of Olga Kurylenko as the Bond girl. Again not the typical Bond girl, but she sure is nice to look at! Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) takes the directors chair and is actually more geared up towards providing the action scenes than I thought he would be; but several of them are edited together badly and lack tension as a result. The film attempts to tie itself to the rest of the Bond series by way of a Goldfinger-style death scene; and while it's undoubtedly very cool, it doesn't really fit in with the rest of it and comes off like an afterthought. So to surmise - is The Quantum of Solace an entertaining action thriller? Unquestionably yes. But is it a James Bond movie? Unfortunately not.",7,135,236,2 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," It's Not Such a Wonderful Life
","I must say that I was surprised, after seeing this movie, to come to it's page on this website to be met with a barrage of largely positive reviews. While I can certainly see the attraction of this movie; the fact is, it simply isn't very good. The version of The Butterfly Effect that I saw was the largely more liked 'Directors Cut' version, so whether or not the theatre version is better, I don't know. The muddled plot follows Evan Treborn; a young man that suffered from black outs as a child, and has found a way to not only remember these black outs as an adult, but go back in time and change them. Which is something that has a massive effect on his current life. As you might expect, this plot opens up a number of plot holes; and that's the first thing that is wrong with this movie. If you want to make a movie about something confusing, at least make sure that everything makes sense...and if that's not possible, at least make some sort of story that could be used in conjunction with the audience's imagination to fill the plot holes. And that's only the start of The Butterfly Effect's woes.The film's main problem is simply that it's RIDICULOUS. The whole thing comes off as being very phoney and just about every event in the film can be described as either 'over the top' or just far too convenient. The action, therefore, is just stupid and hard to fully connect with because of that. At several points in the movie, I asked myself how one guy could be so unlucky; and you will too. When you cant believe in a film's plot, that film has failed and that is what has happened to this film. Before seeing it, I thought that Ashton Kutcher might have been the film's downfall; but ironically, he's one of the best things about the movie. While his performance is far from brilliant, at least Kutcher has fun with the role and his verve helps the film to swing along. Another thing that can be credited to the film is that at least it doesn't get boring, which is something that it could well have done due to the muddled plot. However, the good aspects are sapped up by the terrible ending, which swallows both any point that the film may have had and also betrays all the confidence put into the film by the viewers up until that point. The film draws it's substance from the idea that we are products our memories and the effect that our actions can have on ours and others' lives. As you will see at the end; the movie never really knew what to do with it.",5,3,9,21 April 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Great film! ....not
","After successfully messing up film versions of both Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat, Paul W.S. Anderson has been hired to helm another project that should really make itself; Alien vs. Predator. The mind boggles, it really does. How this man continues to get work is anyone's guess - I don't doubt that his films make money, but surely the powers that be would be far better off hiring a director that knows what they're doing. Projects like this one and Anderson's video game movies were always going to make a profit anyway, so I cant understand why the studios don't hire someone good. Anyway, as the title suggests; AvP finally sees two of cinemas most menacing creatures face off! As a big fan of all the Alien and Predator films (with the exception of Alien 3, for obvious reasons), I was very much looking forward to this movie, even though my expectations were low, and alas; it didn't even meet my low expectations. I was expecting at the least to be entertained by a little bit of alien fighting; and although the movie has that and it's not boring; it also has lots of trite and dull moments and on the whole this film is one gigantic failure.The plot isn't very original, but at least it gives the film the basis for an intriguing set-up. It preaches that the Predator's are coming to Earth on a hunting trip and, as they are the ultimate prey, they've re-animated a bunch of Aliens to fight with. The 'fun' doesn't end there, however, as a bunch of researchers are on the Predator's patch after discovering their hunting ground under the ice in Antarctica. This isn't a bad plot; it's not particularly intelligent, it's very simple and, as mentioned, it's unoriginal; but still. However, Anderson still manages to mess up even this plot with an awful 'revelation' part way through, a very trite and dull first half and an ending that is an absolutely huge cop-out, and doesn't do justice to the series' that spawned it. It's almost like Anderson got most of the movie completed, and then just decided to get the movie over with quickly. Maybe his dinner was ready or he just got offered another franchise to mess up, I don't know. Aside from all the stuff mentioned, though, the most annoying thing about the movie is the terrible characters and the even worse script that they had to work from. Quite why Lance Henriksen accepted this movie is anyone's guess, I know that he probably wanted his paycheck, but man, where's the self respect? Anyway, this movie isn't recommended.",5,2,7,22 April 2005
No Country for Old Men," Absolutely great for the first two thirds.
","The Coens definitely have made some of the best movies of the past two decades; I won't profess to be among their biggest fans, but it's hard to deny the likes of Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski. After a dip in the form over the last few years, this film became hotly anticipated; often being touted as a 'return to form' for the Coen Brothers. Well, it is definitely a return to form and undoubtedly their best film so far this decade - but I do have to say that I'm somewhat surprised at all the praise this film has gotten. The film is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy and focuses on Llewelyn Moss, a man who is lucky enough to stumble onto a drug deal gone wrong after following a wounded animal. He soon discovers a case containing $2 million left at the scene and does what any man would do; takes the case without reporting the crime. However, he is discovered by the sadistic and psychopathic Anton Chigurh who tracks him down by any means necessary; and he has no qualms about mercilessly murdering everyone who gets in, or around, his way.The tone of the film is very relaxed and this bodes well with the Southern setting. It's also a stark to contrast to the bulk of the plot; at its heart, No Country for Old Men is a chase movie and the Coens somehow managed to make the film relaxed and tense at the same time. Almost every supposed great film has some sort of point to make, and while this film does touch on a few; it's never very focused and to be honest left me wondering why they didn't discard any muted 'points' and stick with the thriller elements. The cast is great; it's really good to see a film that puts gritty looking actors in the leading roles and every performance is perfect - Javier Bardem is particularly great as the psychopathic killer. The film is really great for the first two thirds; the chase is thrilling, the characters are interesting and the dialogue will keep any viewer glued to the screen - but then the film takes a shocking twist and it really all goes downhill. I do like a good twist, and perhaps this one worked well in the book; but it certainly doesn't on the screen. It's a real shame too as everything about the film is working brilliantly right up until this point. Overall, this is certainly a good film; it's very well made and interesting...just a shame about the ending.",8,3,9,28 February 2008
Batman Begins," Batman; resurrected
","It's about time that comic book movies started being taken seriously. We've had a surge of good ones recently - Spider-Man, X-Men and Sin City to name a handful, and not only are these movies entertaining and visually stunning, their drama aspects are spot on also; making these films a complete package. Batman Begins is no different, and the film marks another huge success for the comic book film sub-genre. Rather than delving straight into the action as previous Batman films have done, director Christopher Nolan has decided to take us back to the origins of the caped crusader, and therefore plugging us into his plight before dishing up some very spectacular action sequences. Needless to say, this does the film no end of favours because we actually CARE about what happens to our hero, rather than just rooting for him because he's the protagonist. The acclaimed director of 'Memento' also shows us the difference between himself and how a hack would handle the story by not overpowering the movie with action sequences, and making the drama behind the story arguably even more interesting than Batman's high-octane antics.I didn't go into Batman Begins expecting to be emotionally affected, but the movie surprises in that respect as well. The scenes that show us how Bruce Wayne made the decision to devote his life to fighting crime are genuinely touching, and add massive emotional weight to Bruce Wayne's back story. This is offset by the action sequences, which are extremely well orchestrated and show us that the director can do action as well as drama. The way that the action is held back (it's an hour into the film before 'Batman' even appears) helps rather than hinders the scenes themselves as they mean more by the time they do appear, which shows us Nolan's skill as a director. The man has also put together an astounding cast of actors to tell his story. Christian Bale, who is the absolute perfect choice for the title role, heads an all-star cast, which includes Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, to name a few. Bale captures just the right amount of darkness and strength for his character and I wouldn't hesitate to name him as the best man to ever don the black cape. Nolan shows his adeptness again by the way he handles his lead actor, which is shown best by the 'American Psycho' style scene in a high class restaurant.Gotham city is just another masterstroke in this movie, and unlike previous Batman offerings; the city is much more realistic this time round. It still holds that classic Gothic metropolitan feel; but the way it's shot is much more down to Earth, and Nolan has given us a realistic world for his unrealistic story. The story itself compliments this new landscape for the series excellently, and it's much more subtle than what previous Batman films have offered us. We deal with the idea of 'fear', and the main villain; The Scarecrow is the perfect choice for the villain of the piece. The special effects in the movie are continually astounding, and everything from the way that The Scarecrow taps into his victim's fears to the huge chase sequences in the film look and feel just like they've been taken from a comic book. This is the sort of movie that reminds movie fans exactly why they're movie fans; and in this respect, the film is spectacular throughout.On the whole, this film is further proof that comic books can be the source of movies that are just as credible as the dramas that take the gold come awards season. Batman Begins is more than just a movie about a man in a cape who fights crime; it's an emotional ride into his inner psyche and, of course, it's also a lot of fun. Nolan has captured just the right balance between action and drama and I say roll on the sequel!",8,0,3,16 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," It's not bad, but it's hardly brilliant either
","This redundant and superfluous sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents is an enjoyable, if not overly brilliant, piece of fluff. Of course, cinema could have done without this production, but since it's been made and I enjoyed the first one, I figured I'd enjoy this one too. However, simply put; this film isn't as good as the original because it's gone way over the top with it's quirky characters and instead of being something of a muddled commentary on in-laws like the first one; this is more of a film where a load of incompatible characters have been thrown into a mixing pot together. This isn't all bad however, as it does make for some nice entertainment and it also allows room for some nice jokes. While the film doesn't offer anything in the way of intelligent humour that you'll remember for a while after the final credits, it does supply the audience with nice set piece gags that are very funny at the time of watching. My personal favourite of the set-pieces involves Ben Stiller, a baby and...Scarface.Robert De Niro has been getting lots of stick lately due to the fact that, with the exception of his relatively small role in Jackie Brown, he hasn't been in a really good film since 1993's A Bronx Tale and This Boy's Life. However, his performances haven't diminished and even though the material he has to work with here isn't exactly of the highest standard, he still makes the best of the role and is easily the highlight of the movie. Returning from the original is Ben Stiller, who does just fine as the eager-to-please son-in-law, and the rather incognito Teri Polo and Blythe Danner, who don't really get to do much. Joining them is the duo of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streishand, who play Stiller's parents; the 'amusingly' titled 'Fockers'. The material for them is weak, but they both look like they're having fun, and a few of their gags are funny. On the whole; this movie will be remembered more for it's name than it's hilarious gags, but if you find yourself with nothing better to do than watch this movie...well, it's better than nothing.",5,0,1,5 June 2005
Before Sunset," A magnificent follow up to a beautiful picture
","This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.The tone of this film is very different to 'Before Sunrise' as the characters are now older and wiser and have lost some of that reckless stupidity that made the first film such a delight to observe. The anecdotes that the characters profess to one another takes a worldlier stance, and this allows the characters to revel in their newfound maturity and also develop even further than they did in the original film. In my opinion, this sequel is not as great as the first film. It comes down to personal preference in the end, but I preferred the higher energy exchanges of Before Sunrise to the more mature reflections in this film. That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into well-rounded adults, on the contrary in fact; the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains, and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.Amazingly enough, in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse; both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters, and have once again achieved a glove-like fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pent-up emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around, and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful, that's elementary, but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk, people chat away on mobile phones, walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.You really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course, you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing; so what are you waiting for?",10,12,14,11 February 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Well worked and entertaining blockbuster sequel...couldn't have asked for much more
","This sequel to the 1993 blockbuster tends to get a bad write-up from all corners, but I don't really know why. People complain about it trying to market the brand too much and featuring too many illogical and inconsistent events; but the thing you've got to remember is that this is a sequel to a fantasy blockbuster...so how can you go in expecting anything else. Personally, I've always found this film to be a far more worthwhile dinosaur themed adventure film than the first film; I held that opinion when I first saw it (in my early teens), and upon rewatching it - I'm retaining the same opinion. It has to be said that the sense of wonder is somewhat depleted, but Spielberg seems all the more keen to capitalise on the danger of the situation this time around, and that more than makes up for the fact that we've seen his array of monsters before. The plot simply follows an another excursion into dinosaur territory, only this time the monsters are on an island named 'Isla Sorna' somewhere near Costa Rica, and the lead is Ian Malcolm; by far the most interesting character in the original film.The fact that the lead role has been taken away from Sam Neill is an overall plus point for the film, as Jeff Goldblum makes for a far edgy lead, which suits the theme of this sequel. Goldblum receives good support from an array of talented stars, including Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, Richard Schiff and; best of all, Pete Postlethwaite, who brings a touch of class to the film in the role of a hunter. Given that it's a sequel, writer David Koepp doesn't need to spend as much time building up the central plot and therefore we get straight into it...which can only be a good thing. The action scenes are really well done, and a variety of different species of dinosaur help to ensure that the film always has enough up its sleeve to remain entertaining. Scenes involving the Tyrannosaurus Rex early on, as well as an awesome sequence involving Velociraptors and long grass are the pick of the action right up until the end; when Spielberg lets rip with the highlight of the entire series, which sees the main dinosaur rampaging down a busy San Francisco high street! Overall, this is not brilliant or a masterpiece; but it's a very good film for what it is and I wouldn't hesitate to rate it as the best of the series.",8,1,3,30 July 2006
The Number 23," 23, what a villainous number!
","A thriller doesn't necessarily need a great plot in order to be thrilling; the execution tends to be more important, but when your lead villain is a two digit number, the film in question is likely to have some big problems on its hands. Rated purely on its structure and thriller elements, The Number 23 is actually not a bad film; but every time I stopped to think about what it is actually happening, it was impossible not to think about how ridiculous this film is. The plot focuses on Walter Sparrow, a man who finds himself being dragged into a nightmare after coming across a book called 'The Number 23'. The book, written by the enigmatic 'Topsy Krets', soon has Walter believing that it's all about his own life. It's not long before he realises that the number 23 is actually all over the place; his name adds to 23, his birth date includes the number 23, his house number is 23...etc etc. We then follow Walter as he develops his obsession and tries to get to the bottom of the mysterious book.I can only speak for myself, but personally I wouldn't be too concerned if I noticed that a few things in my life added up to the same number. The silly plot could have been forgiven more easily if there was some underlying point to it all; and while it's somewhat explained at the end, overall I have to say that this film is both silly and pointless. That being said, the film is therefore unintentionally very funny, and despite the fact that it's very silly; The Number 23 is at least rather entertaining. Jim Carrey was great in The Truman Show and good in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, despite the film being rubbish and he's not bad in this; but the actor is clearly more suited to comedy, and I was a bigger fan of him before he started taking on 'serious' roles. The rest of the is very much secondary to Carrey, but I always enjoy seeing Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston is solid as usual. The much needed 'wrap up' ending doesn't really come; though we do get some explanation for it all. It doesn't make a lot of sense, which isn't a big surprise but in spite of all the problems; I can't hate this silly film too much.",6,1,6,12 November 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Characters overruled by action sequences
","After director Bryan Singer decided to leave the X-Men series in order to direct the new Superman film, many feared that the third instalment would not be as great as the first two. Unfortunately, replacement director Brett Ratner has only confirmed those fears, as while the film features all the action that would expect from a comic book movie; the characterisation that put Singer's film above a lot of comic book fare has been lost, as new blood such as Ben Foster's Angel and Vinnie Jones' Juggernaut aren't given much to do, and established characters such as Mystique and Cyclops get left by the wayside. The plotting doesn't work as well as in previous films either, as Simon Kinberg & Zak Penn's script tries to do too much, and the result is a film the leaves several threads hanging far too long before returning to them; and the result ultimately is a film that doesn't explore every possible angle. The plot this time largely focuses on the idea of a cure for mutancy, which divides the population between those that want to be cured, and those that don't. One again, the major story point features the battle between Professor Xavier and evil genius, Magneto.To be honest, I've never read the X-Men comics; and so can't comment on the faithfulness to the source material. I don't imagine writing a script for this film would be easy, as there's so many different characters and keeping the focus away from special effects is a near impossibility. The special effects are impressive, but not as much as they could have been simply due to the fact that astounding effects have become part and parcel of the modern day blockbuster. The film does feature several action scenes, which are sure to delight the target audience, however, and although certain scenes; including one that involves the golden bridge, are somewhat over the top - that's hardly a weighty criticism for a comic book film. The dynamics of the story have changed, as Halle Berry's storm takes a more frontal role this time around, which is a shame as it means other, more interesting characters such as Anna Paquin's Rogue barely get any screen time at all (the white hair looks great on Berry, though). Ian McKellen stands out as the leader of the wayward mutants, and is gifted with the best character in the film. Hugh Jackman fits his role as Wolverine like a glove; while Famke Janssen and Kelsey Grammar do nothing but fill out the plot with their roles. The amazing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is given nothing to do, which is a major flaw as far as I'm concerned while younger stars such as Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford and Ellen Page do well in the action sequences but don't shine otherwise. Ex-football star Vinnie Jones is great only when his mouth is closed.I'm sure that this film will appeal to fans of the comic book, as despite several painful one-liners and a lack of characterisation, the film is very entertaining and the action sequences are largely well done. In comparison to the first two movies, The Last Stand doesn't stand out and it's a shame that a series with so much promise had to end on what can only be described as a low.",7,7,14,25 May 2006
Hellboy," Entertaining comic book fare
","Following on from the recent trend of turning comic books into movies is this offering - Hellboy. I've never read, or even heard of, the 'Hellboy' comic before seeing this movie but it doesn't matter as the film pretty much explains itself anyway. Hellboy tells the story of a demon that was brought into this world by way of a very silly sequence involving a portal to hell, Rasputin (yes, Rasputin) and some Nazi's (naturally). Instead of exterminating this demon, the American army decides to not only keep it, but raise it as a crime fighting superhero, whom they go on to use in the paranormal side of the FBI, which battles various monsters and stuff. Obviously. As you can probably tell, this isn't a film that takes itself seriously and should, therefore, just be taken for what it is - an enjoyable comic book movie. And when taken like that, it has to be said that Hellboy succeeds.Guillermo Del Toro is an obviously talented director. Cronos and The Devil's Backbone prove that without any further need for proof, but it's also worth noting both Blade 2 and Mimic, which weren't as great as the two films just mentioned, but were obviously helmed by a talented auteur. Hellboy fits in with the latter two films, unfortunately, and although Del Toro has no doubt made a good job of this movie, you can't help but think that his talents would be better served making more movies like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. The CGI effects in the film are mostly rather good, and go some way to proving that CGI can work if done correctly. The film falls down when it comes to making the character of Hellboy into a well-rounded 'human being'. The word 'cliché' springs to mind immediately, and does so again when it comes to the dialogue that Hellboy has been given. Still, Ron Perlman makes an excellent job of the role, and although I've never read any of the comics; his performance shows what I would expect the character of 'Hellboy' to be. The film is not great, but it's a fun ride; so the thumbs are more up than down.",7,2,3,7 March 2005
The Incredibles," Pixar have done it yet again
","After the enormous success of 'Finding Nemo' and the two Toy Story films, we can probably count on a lot more CGI animated films to come from Pixar; but if they're all as good as The Incredibles, that's certainly no bad thing. The Incredibles works principally because it strikes a fine balance between the fun kids movie that it's facade suggests it is, and a movie of substance. That's why Pixar's animations work; there's something for everyone. Younger audiences will enjoy the high paced action and quick one-liners, while older audiences can delight in the themes of loss, family and doing what you're good at; while having a blast at the same time. The Incredibles is based on an absurdly funny idea, which sees superhero couple Mr Incredible and Elastigirl, along with the rest of the superhero world, having to take regular jobs after a series of law-suits are filed against superhero's after a number of their saves went wrong. However, Mr Incredible simply doesn't like his new life; so when an offer of a superhero assignment comes along; he just can't turn it down...The way that the film portrays the superhero's' family life is really well done and echoes serious American classics such as American Beauty. This, tied in with the quirky characters and their superpowers, makes for some very fun viewing. It's also refreshing to see an animated film tackle this sort of drama as many skip it in favour of more audience-pleasing aspects (not that this film lacks the latter, mind you). The animation is, of course, sublime and is at least as good, if not better, than the animation seen in Finding Nemo. The film also benefits from a talented range of actors providing the characters' voices. Unlike certain other studios, Pixar are more concerned with getting the right voice actor in for the job rather than having another name to add to the poster. Of course, Samuel L. Jackson and Holly Hunter stand out; but the rest of the cast is mostly made up of lesser-known actors, and all bring their characters to life brilliantly. On the whole, The Incredibles is a great piece of entertainment. Brad Bird has created his own cinematic world and it's one that isn't afraid to latch onto the clichés of the superhero tradition and make them it's own. Simply put; this is an incredible film.",7,2,5,6 April 2005
The Mist," Another big success for Stephen King and Frank Darabont!
","Films based on the writing of Stephen King have a habit of not translating to the screen very well; although director Frank Darabont made what is often considered the best of the Stephen King films in The Shawshank Redemption - and now with The Mist he's directed what is surely one of the major contenders for the title of best horror film to be based on a Stephen King story! When I first heard the plot description, I was expecting the film to be a cross between John Carpenter's The Fog and modern horror disappointment Feast; and while it does have elements of both those movies, it is thankfully much better than both. The film starts with a violent storm that leaves the Drayton family home in tatters. David Drayton sets off to the local store along with his son and a neighbour; but the town is soon plummeted into trouble when it is surrounded by a malicious mist. It soon transpires that there are otherworldly creatures within the mist and the townsfolk in the local store find themselves battling against the creatures as well as themselves...The film takes on a real classic style horror feel and never tries to be exceedingly clever or overly gory and that is one of its main strengths. Frank Darabont puts his focus mainly on the tension between the characters and the atmosphere and this benefits the film as there's always enough to keep things interesting - and that is particularly impressive when you consider the thin plot and the fact that it's over two hours long. Thomas Jane takes the lead role and gives a great performance which is nicely pitched between family man and action hero. The rest of the ensemble perform well alongside the lead actor, with Marcia Gay Harden as a fanatical Christian and Toby Jones as the quiet shopkeeper stand out most. The special effects are used sparingly but are very well done and show some great imagination. The creatures that come out of the mist are varied and interesting. There is a lot of talk about the ending of this film and I have to say I'm not really surprised; you'll either love it or hate but personally I found it to be a refreshing end to a commercial modern horror film. Overall, The Mist is an excellent horror film and can be considered a must see for anyone who is a fan of the genre!",8,63,105,8 July 2008
The Elephant Man," A heartbreaking expose of society
","Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that's all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.The film is also ironic. Aside from it's visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he's had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society's upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it's a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn't care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By 'normal' people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn't something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, 'we can't imagine the life he's had'. We can't.David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today's society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.To put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it's a masterpiece.",8,13,15,22 December 2004
I Am Legend," Has nothing on The Last Man on Earth
","In a time where just about everything is getting remade, the announcement of an updating of Richard Matheson's classic novel 'I Am Legend' (which previously spawned the Vincent Price classic 'The Last Man on Earth' as well as 'The Omega Man') didn't exactly make me excited. The film is directed by Francis Lawrence; an ex-music video director whose previous effort was the muddled Constantine. This is a better film, but again it doesn't function as a complete whole; on the one hand, we have the desolate situation that the lead character finds himself, which is well done; but then we have masses of poor CGI and a rather boring personal story surrounding the leading man, and that just isn't good. Unlike previous adaptation of this story, this one takes the original novel's title; though I can't comment on whether or not it's closer to the source material, having not read it. The story is simple enough anyway - after a scientist discovers a cure for cancer, things go terribly awry for mankind as the cure turns deadly and becomes airborne, turning most people into nocturnal vampires and making most of the survivors their lunch. Scientist Robert Neville finds himself as the last man in Manhattan...As mentioned, director Francis Lawrence does a good job of imposing the hopelessness of the situation on the audience. The streets of Manhattan are eerily deserted, while there is a constant sense of dread emanating from the fact that we know that there are always devolved humans lurking in the shadows. This hopelessness also comes through with the leading character; who has devolved himself from a happy family man to someone unable to function properly with other people. Will Smith may not be Vincent Price, but the great thing about this actor is the fact that he is charismatic enough to hold an audience's attention; something that is definitely needed in a film like this where he is on screen at almost all times. However, all this good stuff is undermined somewhat by the film's bad points. As mentioned, the CGI looks awful and unfortunately there is rather a lot of it. The story itself is strong for the first half of the film, but after a tragic twist and the introduction of a couple of new characters, it takes a sharp downturn. There's plenty of action thrown in, and I'm by no means saying that this is a 'bad' film; but I'm surprised at the reaction it's getting, and overall I did find the whole experience rather underwhelming.",6,4,6,6 January 2008
School of Rock," Jack Black makes School of Rock a very fun movie indeed
","School of Rock is one of those films where you know what's going to happen. You know that Jack Black and his class of would-be rockers will have a bumpy ride at first, you know that they'll start enjoying themselves, and then something bad will happen...only for it all to work out fine in the end. However, unlike most films of this ilk - it doesn't matter that it's predictable; as getting there is so much fun! Jack Black fits his role here like a glove, and the rest of the cast - children and adults - really give it their all, making School of Rock a very lively film indeed. The fact that it's hilarious throughout, and there's a strong degree of respect for the classic rock gods doesn't exactly hinder it either. The plot line is fairly typical, and it follows Jack Black's waster, who manages to cheat his way into a job as a substitute teacher. Of course, he has no idea how to teach; so maths, science, geography etc go out the window, in favour of a more 'relaxed' style of teaching. However, it isn't long before the bummed out rocker finds his students have musical ability; and he decides to use them to realise his dream of winning 'Battle of the Bands'.The central message of the movie seems to be that having a good time and 'sticking it to the man' is more important than boring school subjects. Depending on how you look at life, this can actually be true - I mean, if we only live once; why not spend that time rocking in the Battle of the Bands competition rather than sitting listening to some teacher waffle on about what happened three hundred years ago in some other country? Of course, proper schooling tends to allow people to leave with better prospects - but rocking is so much more fun! Jack Black embodies this sort of ideology with his role in this film, and it's clear that roles like this are what really put him in his element. Black certainly isn't the greatest actor of all time - but he's definitely one of the most exciting leading men around at the minute. At first, I thought this film was something of a departure for the usually sombre director of Before Sunrise; but School of Rock, with its slacker roots and strong sense of fun actually compliments Richard Linklater's filmography nicely. On the whole, I recommend this movie to everyone. On paper, it's not my cup of tea - but it's hard not to enjoy a movie like this, and I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to anyway.",8,2,4,28 November 2005
The Man Who Would Be King," An epic masterpiece
","Based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling, The Man Who Would Be King tells the story of two friends; Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) and Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) that go to Kafiristan in order to rule the country as kings and become rich in the process. The tale itself if relatively simple, but through great storytelling, the film is lifted into the realms of the masterpiece. The Man Who Would Be King tells a story on two levels; on the one hand, it's an epic masterpiece, spanning across Asia and embracing the Eastern culture, but on the other hand; it's a simple tale of two friends that are out for all they can get. The film switches between the two sides of it's story with great ease, and the smaller, more intimate side of the story is actually complimented by the epic battle sequences that run alongside it.This movie is headed by two of the very finest actors of all time - Sean Connery and Michael Caine (both British too, I might add). The two have a great chemistry, and seeing them on screen together is an absolute treat. Both actors have a very defined style as to how they act and how their lines are delivered; in fact, they're perhaps two of the most defined styles ever, and they play off each brilliantly to give fantastic performances in this movie. Michael Caine always seems to be more willing to give a better performance when he is on screen with another fine actor, and they don't come much finer than Sean Connery. The great John Huston directs the movie, and this is easily one of his best movies. In fact, I rate it as his number one colour film. He's got a good story to work with, and he makes the best of it, not to mention that he gets the best from his cast. Many of the locations are fabulous and the battle sequences, although not on the same scale as some other films of the same nature, are well choreographed and an epic sense is captured through the utilisation of many extras.This film is a masterpiece. All the players have come together to create a film that is both intimate, intelligent, interesting and on a massive scale all at the same time. A must see.",8,9,14,16 December 2004
Hero," One of the best films so far this decade
","Some films are heavy on style and lack substance somewhat, other films have a lot of substance but lose out in the style department. Ying Xiong, however, doesn't lose out in either; it is the perfect fusion of style and substance.The story of the film, is most definitely secondary to the amazing visuals and stunning direction, but it is not incidental; the plot of the movie is also very important. The film is set in ancient China, which at that time was divided into seven kingdoms. The ruler of one of the kingdoms, Qin, has found himself under threat from assassins; the three greatest of which are named Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow; stupid names? Indeed. When a young man claims to have defeated all three of these martial art masters, he is summoned to the palace in order to tell the king his story. The way that the plot pans out very much resembles the classic Japanese film, Rashômon; in that several people end up giving their versions of events. The film switches back and fourth from past to present effortlessly, and manages to do it without being convoluted or confusing. The narrative of the film is very well structured in that way, and despite the relative complexity of the plot; the film never becomes challenging for the viewer; but that's not to say it isn't thought provoking either.If someone was to ask me what Ying Xiong was about, I would predominantly say sacrifice. All of the characters in the film sacrifice something, whether it be their love for another character, or their life for the cause that they believe in. Their actions are always explained, and nothing seems out of place or like it's happened by accident, which makes the story flow well and allows the film to be strong in the story department. The thing that will stick out in the viewer's mind once the credits role is without doubt the vibrant use of colour that Zhang Yimou delights in portraying. The fight scenes are spectacularly beautiful; they're well choreographed and extremely aesthetically pleasing. I'm not a fan of the use of slow motion in fight sequences as it detracts attention away from the action, but Ying Xiong manages to use slow motion in a way that it ends up being of benefit to the movie. Most of the time it looks fake, and like the movie is trying to be overly arty; but here it adds to the beauty.Ying Xiong is one a few films released so far this decade that is set to achieve classic status in years to come, and it demands that you see it, if only for that reason. This film is not one that you will want to miss.",8,1,2,22 December 2004
Back to the Future Part III," A worthy climax to a fine trilogy
","While it doesn't have quite the same ingenuity and vitality that made the first two parts such great entertainment, the third and final part of the excellent Back to the Future trilogy still offers two hours of solid entertainment. The first part saw our heroes go back into the past slightly, and the second part saw us travel into the future; so to be different, this one finds us massively in the past, in the great Wild West. What follows is a mixture of various western tributes (some of which are blatantly obvious, others less so) combined with a fun, if slightly predictable, plot line. Marty McFly has had to travel back to 1885 in order to save Doc Brown, whom Marty has discovered will die on Monday if he doesn't do something about it. With the space time continuum in disarray, Marty must struggle to save Doc Brown from a notorious gunman known as MadDog (who looks suspiciously like Biff from the other two films) while also making sure that he doesn't change anything as it will have serious repercussions on his future. That's the future from 1985 onwards, not the 1895 one. I think.For a trilogy of films predominantly aimed at children, this has one hell of a confusing plot. Luckily, however, through tight scripting and a nice plot pace; Robert Zemeckis tells his story well, and even if you're not sure of the plot line on the whole, it's always obvious what's immediately going on. The film features a number of nice set-pieces (much like the other two) and there honestly isn't a moment of down time in the entire film (or trilogy, for that matter). As you might expect, the best set-piece has saved until the end; and the train chase climax blends tension, suspense and humour to ensure that the film ends on a high. The characters are well done and entertaining throughout, and both the leads; Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were born to play the roles that they play in this film. Both have made other movies, but neither one has even come close to being as memorable as they are here; and that reinforces my point. On the whole, this is a worthy climax to a very fine trilogy and it should please everyone who sees it!",7,1,1,14 June 2005
The Illusionist," Has holes, but a decent film nonetheless
","Was it just a coincidence that two movies about magicians with a period setting were released within the space of a few months of each other? I don't know, but needless to say this film is always going to find itself being compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', and it's always going to find itself in second place because Nolan's film is a hell of a lot better than this one. The two films are similar in that they're both thrillers, both focus on retribution and, obviously, both are based on magicians. This one is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser and focuses on a man named Eisenheim. As a boy, Eisenheim falls in love with a girl a few social classes above himself, but their relationship is broken up for that very reason. Cut to years later and Eisenheim is a successful magician in Vienna. He meets his long lost love during a show and they quickly rekindle their relationship; but being together is a problem as she is engaged to the Crown Prince...After rising to fame with the likes of American History X and Fight Club in the late 1990's, it has to be said that Edward Norton has been a bit of a disappointment ever since. He really was due a good performance, and while his role here isn't as great as the ones that made him famous in the first place; he performs well and the film definitely represents his best work in years. Norton is given excellent support from the likes of Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel, and the acting is high quality on the whole. As mentioned, the film features a period setting and with the help of some glossy cinematography, it mostly looks very nice. The film is obviously intended to be a thriller, although there isn't a great deal of suspense featured. The plot does remain interesting for most of the duration, however, and there is usually just about enough going on to ensure that it doesn't become boring. The film builds up to a twist at the end. I didn't see it coming myself, though I'm sure many others will. However, in spite of this it is fairly well worked, although the audience is asked to suspend disbelief more than just a little. But even so, this is decent enough entertainment and I did at least enjoy it.",7,1,2,27 January 2008
Children of Men," Perhaps not as good as the hype, but still a major highlight of 2006
","After reading all the reviews and praise for Children of Men, I can't exactly say I was blown away by the resulting film - but it's certainly a very good movie in that it manages to make you care for the characters and makes you think; something that can't be said for many movies released recently. The film is based on a novel by P.D. James, which I haven't read. The story takes place in the future, although it's not the futuristic world seen in most other films set in the future. Rather, the landscape of the film is a lot like the present world, and if anything seems even less technologically advanced. The basic plot revolves around the idea of women, for some reason, becoming infertile. No child has been born for over eighteen years and the only hope of saving the human race is a rumoured organisation known as 'The Human Project'. However, there seems to be hope from elsewhere as after being dragged into a plot by his ex-wife, Theo Faron discovers a pregnant woman and agrees to help her get the baby to safety.Director Alfonso Cuarón has managed to walk a thin line between style and substance, and he's done it well. The film features a handful of star names who all deliver good performances, but these are never at the centre of the film and the director always makes sure that the story remains at the forefront. The film is not exactly a visual feast, but the downtrodden locations have a sort of eerie beauty to them, and the special effects, when used, are dazzling. The build up to the climax, the sequence that sees an army firing at a dishevelled building was a particular highlight in that respect. Clive Owen takes the lead role, and while he's still his usual one-note self; his role here really suits his on-screen persona. He receives good support from experienced performers Michael Caine and Julianne Moore, while lesser known actors such as Pam Ferris and Claire-Hope Ashitey perform well alongside the bigger names. I'm not a big fan of the way the film ended, although I can see the reason for cutting the story off where they did. Overall, Children of Men is an excellent film and I can certainly recommend it.",8,9,16,20 May 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood triumphs yet again
","Usually when the latest 'big thing' gets released, I go to cinema and end up disappointed. With Million Dollar Baby, however; that was not the case. Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw, gritty realism. The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured, no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge, and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline. Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene, which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score, before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions. This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it.Clint Eastwood made a name for himself by playing a character that you cant possibly disagree with. In movies like Sergio Leone's 'Dollar' trilogy, down to his own films, such as High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven; we are with Clint every step of the way, no matter what evil deeds he's doing. He perfected the anti-hero and proved that an audience can be fully behind any character. For this movie, Clint has given himself a support role, and all the faith that we would usually put him has been transferred to Hilary Swank. Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in this movie, and anyone that says otherwise is sadly mistaken. She approaches her role with all the determination that epitomises her character on screen, and delivers a fine performance with it. Emotionally as well as physically, Swank never gives us a reason to doubt that she is Maggie Fitzgerald; the character she plays on screen. If Swank doesn't walk away with the Best Actress award for 2004, there is something seriously wrong. Despite taking a back step, Eastwood still manages to retain that which he made his name with. Once again, Eastwood is the downbeat loner - the man who comes along and changes thing; the catalyst of the story. This performance is much more mature than the work Eastwood did in his earlier movies, and may well go on to represent the twilight years of this classic actor.The way that Eastwood gets the audience behind his central character is simply breathtaking. During the boxing scenes especially, Clint's subdued style lends them a potent realism and the audience feels every punch thrown and every wound endured. The boxing scenes are also testament to Eastwood's triumph with characterisation as well as technical potency, as we follow Maggie Fitzgerald every step of the way. When she takes a punch, we feel it too and when she delivers a blow - the audience is able to feel the adrenaline pumping, the same as the character does on screen. It's one of the hardest things to make an audience feel for a character, but Million Dollar Baby, not satisfied with just making us feel  allows us to become one with the emotions on screen. However, all is not rosy in the almost perfect garden that Eastwood has created. Basically, it's the musical score. Million Dollar Baby is a powerful film, and just the images and dialogue alone is enough to convey the story to the audience and make them feel for the characters - but for some reason, many scenes are saturated in a horrible rural style beat and it doesn't do the film any favours at all. Music almost always adds to the images on screen, but sometimes no music is better. I almost feel like I'm nitpicking as the film is so close to perfection, but it's a niggling little aspect of it that annoyed me.Million Dollar Baby is not one of those films that comes along and changes the cinematic landscape. However, it's a powerful drama with some excellent acting, great direction and a brilliant storyline. I'm not a boxing fan, but when it comes to films like this; it doesn't matter what you like. Usually when I go to the cinema, there's a mad rush to the doors at the end  no matter what the film  but this wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby. Everyone in the cinema sat in their seats until the end credits rolled, and although I cant speak for everyone; I did so because the film is so utterly spellbinding and I needed the time for the credits to roll to catch my breath. I don't need to say this but I will: see this movie.",8,3,6,31 January 2005
Garden State," Quirkly little drama doesn't disappoint
","Zach Braff is one lucky guy. At the start of 2004, he was just the lowly star of some of that rubbish that Americans put on TV; but by the end of the year, he's the director, writer and star of a successful and critically acclaimed movie! Garden State is the latest quirky little drama to be released independently. It seems like these sorts of films will get praised whether they're good or not these days, but to Braff's credit; this one actually isn't bad. While the film feels underdone in certain places, and the story could have been fleshed out better; Braff handles his themes with care and attention, and it's obvious throughout that this is a project that the young writer/director/actor really cared about; and that translates into the vibrancy and vitality of the story. The film follows themes of maturity and responsibility and it follows a troubled young man (Braff), who returns home to his state of New Jersey after a leave of nine years. While home he reunites with his old friends and meets a new one, in the form of serial liar; Samantha (Natalie Portman).Pretty much as soon as the film starts, you can see that it's by a young, first time, director. Early in the film, Braff experiments with different shots, such as the bathroom mirror scene; which seems to be an attempt to show his character's broken state of mind. Considering he's a TV actor, Zach Braff's acting isn't at all bad; he suits the role that he's written himself like a glove, and his performance gives the whole piece an element of realism. The extraordinarily beautiful Natalie Portman stars alongside Braff as his opposite number. Portman delivers her performance with just the right amount of cuteness, while slightly hinting that her character might not quite be all smiles and sweetness. An excellent ensemble is topped off by Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm, who both do well with the roles Braff has given them. There isn't really anything on the technical side that makes this film stand out, but films like this are more about characters and story anyway; and this film has both of them. The film is interesting throughout, as the character are nurtured and we get to know them; and the film finally pays off when we finally get the end. All in all, I wouldn't go as far as to call this great or a masterpiece; but it's a solid movie and I'm not surprised at the positive reception it has won itself.",8,1,2,29 July 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Superb Gothic animation with a thin plot
","Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is a visually spectacular tour de force of Gothic styles and themes, bound around a simple children's tale. The story follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween Town, who one day while walking in the woods stumbles upon Christmas Town; a town where, you guessed it, every day is Christmas. Jack doesn't quite understand the concept of a celebration where nobody is frightened or killed, but he decides to have the celebration in his town regardless. While plotting, he also decides to kidnap Santa and deliver Christmas Town's gifts himself this year...much to the dismay of the local children, who aren't too pleased about receiving the gifts that a skeleton from Halloween Town brings them...This movie was actually directed by Henry Sellick, but it is obviously Tim Burton's film. His style is rampant throughout the film, and it is clear that this could only have come from his mind. The animation on display here is magnificent; the style is very unique and it blends very well with the Gothic theme. Where the film falls down, however, is on the story side and, more notably, the delivery of the story. The story is very linear; I understand that this film is predominantly aimed at children, but even children's films can be more expansive than this; the film also really should be more expansive as Tim Burton has created a whole world with many unique and interesting characters, yet only a handful are allowed to shine. Burton (and his composer, Elfman) seem far too keen to pack the movie with songs. I have no problem with this, but the songs here are really rather dull. The majority of them have little more than one or two lines that are sung over and over and considering that the film is packed with these songs; it gets old fast and more dialogue would have worked better.Overall, Nightmare Before Christmas is a nice film. The animation and style are amazing and it has lots of nice moments; but it is let down by a thin story and poor delivery. Horror fans will have fun spotting the tributes, and I don't doubt that many children will love this film, as will many adults; but it could and really should have been a lot better, and I have to say that it left me cold.",7,21,32,7 November 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Looks the part, but lacks emotional involvement
","Of all the critically friendly 'Oscar Contenders' of 2005, Good Night and Good Luck was the one that stood out the most for me. Not because I have an interest in the plot, or any confidence in the people that made it, even; but merely because it seemed to come out of nowhere, and it's often these films that become the surprise hit of the year. With that in mind, I am disappointed to say that, given the task of describing this film in one word, I would have to select the word 'dull'. Director and star George Clooney has done a great job of ensuring that his film looks and feels as it should; we are given a convincing portrait of the USA during the 1950's, and the film is always lovely to look at. However, it's good points end there; as there is barely any plot to speak of, and the film simply feels like a timeline of events. The plot revolves around the cold war, and Senator Joseph McCarthy. Two journalists; reporter Edward R. Murrow and producer Fred Friendly, decide to take on the senator and expose him for inspiring fear in the American people.The way that George Clooney uses archive footage instead of an actor cast in the role of the senator is a really inspired move; but the inspiration stops there. We are never allowed into the heads of any of the characters. Their actions show, but we are never given any motivation, and this makes the film very hard to care for on an emotional level. David Strathairn fits the film in that he looks the part; but like the rest of it, he is never given a chance to shine. Robert Downey Jnr and Patricia Clarkson are entirely wasted in a subplot that has little point, while George Clooney fails also to make any kind of impression in the acting department. To be honest, I'm really surprised that this film did go down well with the critics. Good Night and Good Luck is a purely aesthetic experience, and despite the fact that it looks great; surely great films cannot be called such merely because of how they look. I'm sure that George Clooney thought he was making a great film here, but it's missed the mark entirely. If you're really interested in the subject of this film, you might get some kind of enjoyment out of it; but since this film is basically a glorified documentary, you'd probably be better off seeing an actual documentary. Disappointing.",3,28,44,7 February 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," How can such good video games spawn a movie this trite?
","Like all big fans of the excellent Resident Evil video game series; I was extremely dismayed and disappointed by the first movie. The characters, the style, the location and even the zombies just WERN'T Resident Evil, and as I went in expecting to see something very much like the games on screen, I came out of the movie feeling very cold. In fact, the only thing I did like about the movie was the ending, and that's where the last movie should have started. This movie, however, does start there; so is it finally the translation that us Resident Evil fans have been hoping for? Errr...no. Once again, the movie makers have failed to capture the game's spirit, which has been completely ditched in favour of several irrelevant and very two-dimensional characters, a very suspect script and action sequences that are only in the film to keep the attention of the less intelligent film fans. The plot basically follows a bunch of characters that find themselves in the middle of the outbreak in Racoon City, and obviously they decide to make their way out of the city to safety. Resident Evil 3's main villain, The Nemesis, is thrown in for good measure.To the movie's credit, it isn't all bad. Certain things, like the city for example, look great and are very reminiscent of the game. Sienna Guillory is another positive factor of the movie, as aside from looking great; she does look very much like Jill Valentine as well. However, the good parts end there as from there on out; the movie basically laughs in the face of the fan base it's trying to attract. Dr Ashford and Nicolai Ginovaeff, for a start, were villains in the games; and I know one thing for sure, The Nemesis would never have helped out the good guys in Resident Evil 3. It is a little known fact that the Resident Evil movie was a rip-off of Aliens; and this movie has decided to take much of it's influence from the underrated Alien: Resurrection. We've got the awful Milla Jovovich stepping into the souped up female role that Sigourney Weaver did much better, and then the whole Alice-Nemesis relationship has been ripped straight out of that movie. That relationship, like all character related aspects of the movie, doesn't work because of the complete lack of emotion in the script. This also makes it hard to care about anything that happens in the movie.While Resident Evil Apocalypse is entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of a way, even this must be stripped from it's very lacking resume of good points. The film tries too hard to entertain and most of the entertaining elements pop up in the form of another explosion or Milla Jovovich jumping over some scenery and it gets boring very quickly. In my opinion, Resident Evil fans are better just sticking to the games. Leave this.",3,3,8,20 April 2005
Grave of the Fireflies," A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told
","Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see.",8,187,217,7 January 2005
The Evil Dead," The very pinnacle of schlock-horror!
","I've got to tell you right off - The Evil Dead is my favourite horror film of all time - so you can expect a praise-filled review here! I have seen this film at least one hundred times since I first saw it at about the age of ten, and to this day, I can still stick the DVD in the player and guarantee myself a good time. The Evil Dead may be low budget schlock at heart, but there's very few A-class films that I can say that for! The notorious shocker that started the video nasty debate in the eighties is as good now as it was then, and that is all testament to the imagination and dedication of the talented team of amateurs that conquered their budget restraints to put the film together. I'm sure that Sam Raimi and co. didn't know that they had a cult hit that would still be much loved twenty five years later on their hands during filming - but really, that only adds to the cult value of this masterpiece. The plot is brilliantly simple, and it follows the story of a group of five friends that go for a relaxing holiday in the Tennessee Woods. However, their holiday turns out to be anything but relaxing when Ash and Scottie, with the aid of a tape recorder, unwittingly unleash the aptly named 'Evil Dead' from it's slumber.Looking back at the video nasty list now, the vast majority of them are tame by today's standards. This is either down to the change in views of what is and what isn't acceptable, or simply because the films were so atrociously made that they're impossible to take seriously. The reason that The Evil Dead sits at the very summit of that illustrious list, therefore, is because this is every bit the film now that it was then. The film is grainy on purpose, and the gore effects, while obviously cheap; are potent, relentless and disgusting enough to still cause a stir today (the fact that the uncut version wasn't passed all that long ago shows that!). The Evil Dead has become the benchmark for schlock horror films, and this is shown by the fact that almost every film in this vain to be made post-Evil Dead has benefited in some way from the film. That's not to say that Raimi hasn't taken influence from some classics himself. The claustrophobic sets and camera angles echo those in Night of the Living Dead loud and clear, while on famous sequence involving a spade has been taken straight from the Hammer classic 'Plague of the Zombies'. However, Raimi has implemented all of these things into his film in such a way that it feels fresh - and there's nothing wrong with regurgitating elements from other people's films if you can make good of it.The claustrophobic way that Raimi uses his camera helps the film implicitly, and when coupled with the isolated setting that the central location is in; we have a great base for a horror movie. Considering that he was an amateur at the time, Raimi's use of the camera is extraordinary and more than gives many of the established horror film makers a run for their money. The idea to put a camera on a motorbike ('Raimi-cam') is brilliant, and those shots give the film that extra 'x factor'. Seeing the camera roar through the woods is actually quite terrifying. This also gives the film a very nervy atmosphere, as you never know where the evil is going to strike next! The most infamous sequence in the film has to be one that sees Ellen Sandweiss venture out into the woods, only to be violated by the trees. Raimi has said since that this sequence was the mark of an amateur filmmaker, and I agree with him. However, this sequence is an integral part of the film as it helped it to gain a lot of it's notoriety, so I guess it's important if only for that reason.The characters are thin in a typical schlock style. Characterisation doesn't matter, however, as the focus of the film is always on the atmosphere and gore - but nevertheless, the ensemble of amateur actors perform with gusto, and their heart definitely helps the film succeed. Consider the women of the film. They give it their all when their characters are turned into evil demons, and there aren't many 'a-class' actresses that would be able to do that! Of course, on the acting side this film is famous for one man over all else; B-movie god, Bruce Campbell. His performance as Ash was what has made him a cult favourite. Bruce portrays his character with comic brilliance; using a range of facial expressions to portray fear, exhaustion and a sense of loathing towards his situation. Bruce develops the character of Ash as the film goes on, going from a wimpy young man, to a resourceful 'demon-slayer' using all manner of items, including axes, planks of wood and even his girlfriend's necklace to dispatch of his foes. Don't get me wrong, he didn't deserve an Oscar (that was part II!) - but if it weren't for him, this wouldn't be the film that it is.On the whole, The Evil Dead is a film of such paramount importance that it is fundamental viewing for anyone who considers themselves a horror fan, or any young filmmaker wanting to make an impact in cinema without the benefit of a lot of money. Many people refer to this film as 'just a fun flick' or 'so good it's bad', but I cant agree with that. Considering what went into making, and the end result - The Evil Dead is one of the greatest films ever made.",10,4,11,14 October 2005
Shrek 2," More entertainment from Myers and Co.
","The original Shrek was enjoyable, if forgettable, entertainment. It worked better than most films of it's type because it was a fresh and original take on the classic fairytale and beneath it's over the top characters and general bravado, there was a rather touching love story that allowed audiences to care more than they would for the average animated picture. The sequel picks up where the original left off and sees Shrek and his bride, Princess Fiona visit her parents, much to Shrek and father's dismay. You see, Ogres aren't welcome at her father's palace, especially not when they're wed to his beloved daughter, and life is made very hard for our hero indeed. This prompts him, along with his trusty steed; the imaginatively titled 'Donkey', to set off on a quest to find a potion to put things right so that he and his princess will be able to live happily ever after (fairytale style!).This film isn't any better than the original, nor is it any worse; the two are on par with one another in terms of quality, and just different. Whereas the first film offered a love story, this one is more about acceptance and superficiality, and it actually works quite well. Of course, the message will no doubt be lost on the film's target audience (children), who will just enjoy the animation and fun of the picture, but the rest of us can enjoy the message. Also to be enjoyed about this film is the amount of film tributes - I counted many and probably missed a couple, but the most obvious ones are Alien and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The animation of the film is fabulous and undoubtedly DreamWorks' best yet. Even the regular humans in the tale look fine, and I have yet to say that for any other animated picture since this computer animation craze started. Shrek 2 also benefits from a number of big name voice actors including, obviously, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy, but also John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews and Jennifer Saunders add their voices to the impressive roster, and not to mention Antonio Banderas in the memorable role of 'Puss in Boots'.Overall, like the first one; this isn't a great film. But it is great entertainment, and for that reason it is hard to dislike, and I recommend it if you like films of that nature.",7,0,0,26 December 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Makes up in blood what it lacks in substance
","I saw this film upon its release in 2003 and have to say that I wasn't impressed by it. While the film definitely has entertainment value, it lacks substance and didn't do much for me. Since then, however, I've seen a lot of the sort of films that Tarantino took influence from when it came to this film, and upon a repeat viewing of this first instalment of 'Kill Bill', while my niggles are still there; I enjoyed it much more this time around and have to say that Tarantino definitely achieved what he set out to. The film is an amalgamation of the sorts of films that Tarantino loves, all strung round a revenge theme. Clear influence comes from the martial arts, pinky violence, exploitation and western genres. The plot is exceptionally simple and focuses on a wedding day massacre at the hands of a group of people known as 'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad'. The only survivor of the wedding day massacre is the bride, who despite getting shot in the head, was not killed. Four years after the wedding day, she wakes from her coma and vows vengeance on all those who spoilt her big day...Tarantino does his usual trick of not telling the story in a linear fashion, and here we get a segmented chapter method of getting it across, which works fairly well. I would say that I am a fan of Tarantino's style, but at times he can be a little too 'quirky' and it does his films no favours. Take the first fight scene in this film between Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox - the idea of having the two women fight each other with household items is great...but then the kid comes home from school and the whole thing is too unlikely to be believable. The fight scenes are obviously the most important thing in a film like this, and the aforementioned scene is good in spite of the mentioned problem. Other great fight sequences in the film are good too; the bloodbath at the end being the most spectacular part, with the preceding fight that sees Uma Thurman pitted against a ball and chain wielding Japanese schoolgirl being the most interesting. Tarantino usually does casting well, and this film is no different. We also get a good soundtrack that fits the film well. One of the bigger risks in this film is the animated segment, and for me it's not a good thing. However, despite my problems with the film; it's hard to deny its entertainment value and the amount of blood on display (so much that certain scenes had to be shown in black and white!) is definitely a bonus too. I won't say that this is a big favourite of mine, but I am glad that I gave this film a second chance.",7,1,3,20 January 2008
Saw II," More of 'Saw', only not as good.
","Despite it's massive over acclaim, extremely poor acting and MTV-style direction, the original 'Saw' was quite a good film. It's good points included a tight and thrilling storyline, some great ideas and a twist that worked through its amazingly simple surprise element. The sequel, on the other hand, feels like writer Leigh Whannell simply jotted a few ideas down on a scrap of toilet paper after hearing of the success of his first movie. The traps here aren't nearly as imaginative, the twist is simply thrown in at the end, the characters are clichéd in the extreme; and the 'drama' surrounding the central character and his son is boring, underdone and impossible to care for. Leigh Whannell, basically, does a terrible job of making the audience care about what happens; but luckily for Saw 2; the style is there, and this is the film's saving grace. The under wrought plot follows a trap-laden house full of people. They're inhaling a deadly toxin, and the antidote is hidden somewhere in the house. If you weren't already excited enough about that, you'll also be glad to know that there's the 'estranged son' subplot, which is ham-fistedly worked into the film.Even though Saw 2's bad points outnumber it's good ones, I still hesitate to call this a truly bad film. For what it is, Saw 2 is an enjoyable movie. It's not on for long, so the stretched plot line doesn't quite run out of steam before the final credits; and there are enough characters in the film to ensure that there's always another death scene on the horizon. The characters, however, are the film's main downfall. While we cared about the two characters in the first film because we were plugged into their plight; here, we're bombarded with far too many all at once, and this makes it very difficult to care what happens to any of them. The fact that they're all clichéd doesn't exactly help either. Tobin Bell stands out amongst a cast of nobodies; but really, he's just on autopilot. The simplistic plot does a pretty good job of hiding the fact that this is a very shallow movie; as does the dark styling throughout. Director Darren Lynn Bousman does a decent enough job of enforcing the macabre element of the film in every scene, and Saw 2 does have a very repulsive edge to it. On the whole, if you liked the original Saw; you'll probably like this one too. It's not a great movie, and most will probably come out of it feeling a little cheated; but I would say that it's almost worth seeing.",5,2,5,20 November 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Tom Cruise's show
","Brian De Palma's original worked more through suspense and style than action, but it's obvious that star and producer Tom Cruise wanted the stunts to star this time round, and so action director John Woo was recruited. While the first film was better made than this sequel, the change of focus has actually turned out to be no bad thing, as Mission: Impossible II is a more thrilling and far more accessible film than the first. Really, this isn't a sequel to the first film at all, with the only similarities between the two being that both Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames reprise their roles. I said their roles, not their characters and although the names have stayed the same; the characters haven't. Cruise's capable, yet slightly vulnerable persona in the first film has replaced by a glossy haired, all action terminator, and it's obvious that Cruise was more bothered about how he'll look on screen than staying true to the original. The plot, and everything in the film, plays second fiddle to Cruise's star profile, and while this can get annoying after a while; seeing Cruise tear his way through mountains of enemies has a sort of farcical brilliance to it.As mentioned, the plot plays second fiddle; but surprisingly enough, it's actually not bad! We follow the creation of a genetically modified disease called 'Chimera' and, of course, Cruise is on hand to dispatch it. One of his former colleagues wants to buy both the disease and the antidote so that he can infect everyone and then sell them the cure! This isn't the most brilliant of plots ever conceived, but it's a lot better than what I was expecting from a film like this. John Woo injects his usual panache to the film, including many shots of the leads in slow motion, double gun shootouts, motorbikes, doves...etc etc. While Woo obviously knows how to direct an action scene, it seems out of place in a film that's supposed to be about daring espionage. The original theme has been given an overhaul too, which is quite fitting since this has recycled just about everything else from the first movie. One idea from the first that's been used and used again is the rubber mask thing. This is good the first couple of times you see it, but after the twentieth time, it starts to get a little old. This is pretty much what you'd expect from an action film, but it takes it's main elements and does well with them. Really, this is a piece of kitsch; but it's an enjoyable one, and it's hard to really hate it.",7,1,2,30 August 2005
For Love of the Game," Sentimental love story misses all three strikes
","Sam Raimi has made something of a name for himself in modern cinema for his comic book styled movies. The Evil Dead Trilogy was, of course, his first masterpiece; but other good comic book styled movies in his oeuvre include Darkman, The Quick and the Dead and more recently, the Spider-Man films. For some reason, he decided to make a shift from comic book to drama in 1998, with the excellent thriller A Simple Plan. I'd have been happy for him to go back to what he does best after that, but he wasn't - and he went on to make this film. For Love of the Game is a film that mixes sporting action and romance, and tries to parallel to the two through it's central character, played by Kevin Costner. Simply put, the film doesn't manage to do what it sets out to do. The romance and Costner's love for the game are no doubt touching, but the film lacks the fundamental element of inspiring feeling for the characters from the audience, and this is why it falls down. This sort of film only works if you can tap into the character's thoughts and feelings; and the screenplay for this movie ensures that you cannot.As this movie stars Kevin Costner, it is very cheesy. Most movies with Costner in them work in spite of him, but since this movie doesn't work anyway; his presence doesn't hinder it. I'm still unsure as to why he continues to get roles, however; he's so false it's impossible to do anything but snigger when he's on screen. This film features many moments of cheese - especially the ending - so Costner is right at home here. An awfully sentimental musical score runs throughout the movie as well, which again hinders it. The characters on display are largely cold, and it's hard to feel for them because of this. None of them develop and the messy way that the film is plotted doesn't help matters either, and as we continually jump into moments of the protagonist's past, we become less connected with his plight rather than more so as it should be. The worst thing about this movie is the final thirty minutes. To say that they drag would be a vast understatement, and this mixed with far too much fake sentiment make it a very painful climax. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't a total dead loss as some of the scenes and ideas are good; but there isn't enough 'good' to ensure that the finished piece is such.",6,0,1,15 June 2005
The Dark Knight," Dark and frightening with a towering and memorable antagonist - you couldn't ask for much more!
","In 2005, director Christopher Nolan gave the ailing Batman franchise a successful reboot with the very well made 'Batman Begins', and of course it was very well received. A sequel was, naturally, always going to be on the cards and it's been delivered in the form of The Dark Knight; a film that follows on directly from the first film and manages to continue the story in a way that is interesting and at times frightening, and does it better than the first film did. Once again we focus on Gotham City. Things have started to change for the better as more and more criminals are being taken off the street. This is thanks in part to the mysterious masked marauder known as Batman; but police officer Jim Gordon and district attorney Harvey Dent are also partly to thank. However, things are plunged into chaos when The Joker enters the fray and begins to shake things up; specifically going after Batman. Batman soon realises he must stop The Joker and his wave of terror at all costs; but the battle may push him to his very limits.Batman Begins was all about showing the creation of Bruce Wayne and Batman and my biggest problem with it was that the film really lacked a definite villain. Having got the character creation out of way, this leaves director Christopher Nolan free to explore other characters and areas of the plot, and it pays off very well indeed. There are a lot of different characters and elements to the story and things move very quickly; but the skillful way that the film is presented ensures that the important elements are focused on enough. The success of the film is thanks mostly to the fantastic Joker character and the director's willingness to take the film further than you would expect a comic book movie to go. The Joker is a thoroughly dark villain; a maniacal anarchistic psychopath who goes round forcing blades into people's mouths and blowing things up, and this gives the film a very dark edge. The tone of the movie is also very skilfully handled; Nolan portrays the efforts of the crime fighters in making the city a better place to live, so when things are actually plunged into chaos - we feel bad for the people living in the city - which is pretty impressive when you consider that Gotham City is a fictional place.A lot of the hype surrounding this movie was due to the unfortunate premature death of Heath Ledger. I have to admit that I've not seen a great deal of his earlier performances but this last performance really highlights what a great loss his death was for cinema. Heath Ledger creates a villain that, while distinctively comic book; is also very real and frightening for that reason. He completely owns every scene he's in and this is a performance that will go down in history as one of the greatest antagonists on film. The rest of the cast is very good too. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all step into their roles from the first film effectively and provide good performances, while Christian Bale continues to provide the 'perfect; Batman; although for me he's even better simply as Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as the love interest is even better in the role. She's not a natural beauty, but she was easy enough on my eyes and always convinces as a female lawyer. Aaron Eckhart is the biggest standout outside of Ledgar, however, with his turn as Harvey Dent. I wasn't impressed with him (or anything else) in The Black Dahlia; but here he hits the upstanding politician nail directly on the head and manages to make us care about his character.Despite being based on a comic book, everything in the film is taken very seriously and the characters are one of the most important things about it. As you would expect, there's plenty of action and fighting too; and the two come into balance very well to ensure that The Dark Knight works as a complete whole. Naturally, all the hype surrounding the film does go just a little too far - but there's no denying that this is a definite triumph on the whole and deserves its place as one of the best comic book films ever made.",9,7,15,28 July 2008
Blood Diamond," Perfectly pitched, well executed action adventure flick with a point
","I wasn't overly enthused at the prospect of seeing this film upon it's release in late 2006, mostly owing to the fact that the previous two Edward Zwick films I saw (Glory, The Last Samurai) were rubbish; but to my greatest surprise, Blood Diamond is an excellent film. The film is about 'conflict diamonds' and the effects they have on the African countries that produce them. This provides the backbone of the film, but there is much more to it than that as aside from the main theme; the film is also an action thriller, a character study and a very entertaining adventure film. The plot focuses on Solomon Vandy; a man whose village is attacked by rebels and his son taken. He is forced to work in the diamond mines. One day, while mining diamonds, he comes across a huge and priceless pink diamond, and promptly hides it. After finding himself in jail, a conversation between him and the slave master is overheard by Danny Archer; a Zimbabwean diamond smuggler who convinces Solomon to take him to where the diamond is hidden...This film is bolstered by two excellent central performances courtesy of Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was seen earlier in 2006 in Scorsese's excellent 'The Departed', and here the great actor is just as good, in spite of the silly African accent. Djimon Hounsou is the real standout, however, as the unfortunate African man who finds the diamond; the French-African actor fits into his role excellently and constantly convinces that he is the character he is portraying. The two men are joined by Jennifer Connelly who impresses also with her limited screen time. The film takes place in war-torn Africa and Edward Zwick manages to get across the danger of the continent really well, and many of the locations are beautiful to look at. I have to say that the 'conflict diamond' theme of the movie doesn't really concern me much; but the reason this film works has nothing to do with what it's about but rather the way it works. Zwick has really succeeded here in making a film with a point that has enough about it to entertain audience members who don't really care. There's a constant stream of action and the characters are fleshed out enough to ensure that we care about them. The film lasts for over two hours but it really flies by. It boils down to a satisfying conclusion and this undeniably one of the best films of 2006.",8,1,2,27 January 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Pure horror, just the way it should be!
","Just when I was starting to agree with all the people that regularly complain that no good horror movies are being made these days; along comes Sam Raimi to deliver what is surely one of the best horror films of the decade! Drag Me to Hell is pure horror just the way it should be; very little time is spent on the plot and characters, and a lot of time is spent on the actual horror - the result is a shallow, but expertly made and very exciting film. And best of all the film is clearly aimed at Evil Dead fans, which gives it tons of cult appeal. Parts of the film are gruesome and disgusting, while others are manic and cartoonish; and it all slots together very well indeed. The plot is very simple and we focus on Christine Brown; a loan officer at the bank. Her world is turned upside down one day when an elderly woman turns up wanting an extension on her mortgage. With one eye on a promotion, Christine tells her there's no way she can get an extension; leading the old woman to place a gypsy curse on her...which will end with her being dragged to the fiery pits of hell! The film doesn't rely on gore to deliver its shocks. It's Sam Raimi's direction that really makes the film exciting. The plot is very well plotted and we're never very far away from another jump scene. Most of the sequences featuring the villain are fast and exciting, which ensures that the film is very entertaining. It has to be said that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense and there are some very big holes in it; but really I couldn't care less, because when a film is this exciting; it doesn't matter. Aside from the scares, Raimi delivers some laughs too and the pitch black humour is very well placed; a dinner sequence was a particular highlight. Alison Lohman at first seems a little too lightweight for the central role, but she grows into it as the film moves along and proves herself a very good sport by the end. Justin Long is, as usual, entertaining in a co-starring role; while big credit has to go to Lorna Raver, who is brilliantly effective as the villain. The film builds up nicely for the most part; and we boil down to a fantastic séance scene that is pure Evil Dead. Clearly this film isn't going to appeal to everyone; I expect a lot of complaints about the plot, but if you like entertaining horror and/or are a fan of Sam Raimi; you owe it to yourself to check this beauty out!",9,2,6,1 June 2009
Mission: Impossible," Slick and stylish action flick
","Based on the TV show of the same name, Brian De Palma's stylish thriller stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt; a James Bond-esquire secret agent working for a certain section of the government. As the title suggests, many of the scenarios in the film are extremely unlikely; but then again, the film wouldn't be living up to it's title if they weren't. It's one thing to criticise it's stunts for being overblown, but if they weren't, critics would be on it's back and calling it things like 'Mission Possible', so really you've just got to go with it. Brian De Palma makes it easy to just 'go with it' by way of an intriguing plot line, a constant array of high-octane sequences and lots of his trademark style! The plot does get a little too convoluted for it's own good at times, and sometimes it's a little hard to follow; but it gives the film a good basis for all manner of impossibilities, so it serves it's purpose. We follow Ethan Hunt and his team. After a botched mission, Hunt finds himself on the run from his employers after being accused of disloyalty. Hunt must now pull out all the stops to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and get to the bottom of why their mission went wrong.The film features a number of stunts, the best of which sees Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. This sequence is brilliantly executed, with De Palma managing to inject bucketloads of suspense into the scene. This scene fits the tone of the film as it's brooding and cerebral, but the film ditches that idea for it's conclusion, which sees a bullet train, a helicopter and the Channel Tunnel combine to great effect! The problem with all these stunts is that the parts between the action sequences aren't all that interesting, and at times can slow the film down to walking pace. This isn't a big problem, however, because there's always more action around every corner and that keeps the film going. Tom Cruise obviously has charisma and can lead a film, but I often find it hard to buy him in action roles. This one suits him, though, as although his character is still more than capable, he comes off as being quite vulnerable, and lucky at times, and that suits Cruise's persona. On the whole, while this isn't a great film; it makes for good entertainment and if that's what you're in the mood for, Mission: Impossible wont disappoint.",8,49,69,30 August 2005
Saw," Devishly sick and twisted
","With more sickness than the average hospital ward, and more devilishly twisted situations than any other film released in the last ten years; Saw became an almost instant cult hit upon release. And for good reason. It's always reassuring when you see a film like this that was made recently as it shows that filmmakers haven't become so jaded that the possibility of producing a film that isn't afraid to disturb its audience is beyond the realms of possibility. Not since 'Seven' have cinema audiences seen a twisted psychological thriller that works, and Saw is by far the best on that front since the release of Finchers modern semi-classic. Although it doesn't have the high quality production values and big name cast that Seven had; it still succeeds in being repulsive and actually quite frightening, so the production values are never a problem.Saw has received much criticism for the fact that it doesn't have a lot of backbone, and this is, actually, true. The early sequences are little more than one twisted situation after another, which will no doubt annoy some viewers - but not this one! The situations that our killer puts his victims into are some of the most ingenious I've ever seen in a film. Rich with irony and inventiveness, never mind annoying - I wanted more! Once the first half hour or so has elapsed, it's then that the film starts to explore the minds of our two central characters. It's also then that it starts to get really interesting as the tension mounts and we begin to put ourselves in their macabre situation. Sure, the acting is rubbish, with The Dread Pirate Roberts being of particular note for turning in a half-assed performance, but when a film is this dark and unpleasant - who cares? The atmosphere in the movie is it's best aspect, with various gadgets including dolls and masks providing more than enough shocks. Saw is a slick and stylish thriller that wont do much for the feint of heart, but is a must see for the more morbid-minded film fans amongst us. My advice to those people is simply 'see it now'.",7,0,5,21 February 2005
National Treasure," Decent high concept movie
","Jerry Bruckheimer and his 'high concept' movies never push any cinematic boundaries and don't exactly give your brain a workout, but they can be respected in their own right as they often provide two hours of entertainment, and that's what you get for your money with this film; National Treasure. The film stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who goes on the trail of some rumoured treasure that has been hidden in the United States of America for centuries. To find the treasure, he must decipher a series of clues, each one leading to another clue, which in turn leads to another. This theory of the buried treasure has been in Cage's family for decades and our hero hopes to be the one to finally find it! As you might expect, the movie isn't entirely serious but, to my surprise at least, it does attempt some form of intelligence. The film plays out like something of a history lesson, and the central theme of both the British and the Americans hunting for the treasure echoes the war of independence. That, coupled with a tour of the USA's landmarks, makes this one very pro-American movie! The way that the plot plays out is very silly, and the backbone of this silliness comes from the idea of the characters stealing the declaration of independence. The idea of this is stupid, but the way that it transpires is even more so. However, it would appear that the film knows that it's ridiculous, and so it just has fun with itself. Unlike many films of this type, the jokes entwined in the plot are actually funny, and certain moments in the movie will no doubt make you laugh out loud. The action is generally well staged, with a car chase taking the central stage where that is concerned. Nicholas Cage has proved his ability to lead a film on numerous occasions, and he shows us why he's a good choice again in this film. While his performance in the movie isn't great, you've got to remember that he hasn't been given great material to work with; and he does make the best of what he's got. The rest of the cast is rather forgettable, with the exception of a nice little turn from Harvey Kietel. On the whole, National Treasure won't be making cinema history; but as no brains, big budget action movies go - this isn't a bad one.",8,1,1,21 June 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Arty and pointless, but it's a film you're not likely to forget in a hurry
","Salo has a reputation for being a sick piece of filth, and that reputation is more than justified. The Nazi's were one of the most despicable sets of people to ever walk the Earth, so it's not surprising that exploitation filmmakers picked up on this and created their own genre out of the party; the lamentable 'Nazisploitation'. This film takes elements such as torture and the grim tone of Nazisploitation, but uses it's budget to put a nice gloss on it and implements some good production values; and yet what we end up with is actually more shocking and distasteful (although slightly more worthwhile) than just about anything in the Nazisploitation genre. The plot is simple and pointless and takes place in Nazi-controlled Italy during 1944. A bunch of sadistic fascists round up a group of young people and subject them to 120 days of sexual torture, which mainly involves three women reciting various stories to them and them being forced to act it out. The film has three chapters, each one focusing on a different sleazy topic.I've seen a fair bit of sick filth, and while this is perhaps not the sickest film I've ever seen, it's certainly up there and it's one of the few that has actually left a bad taste in my mouth after the final credits rolled. Anyone who sees this film will no doubt remember one sequence over all other, which features the lead players at a dinner table enjoying a meal made up of excrement. I have no idea what the point of this film is or even might be. With imagery so powerful, you would expect director Pier Paolo Pasolini to have something to say or something to make it all worthwhile, but if he has; it's buried deep under a pile of filth. I'd really be lying if I said I enjoyed this film on any level; it's extremely distasteful and unpleasant viewing that I wouldn't wish on anyone really. However, I'd hesitate to say that Salo is a bad film for reasons other than just the production values and arty style just because it is powerful and is not a film that anyone will forget in a hurry. Overall, I can't really give this film a recommendation, but I'm sure that most fans of filth will want to see it anyway just to see what the fuss is about. But definitely don't see it if you plan on eating anytime in the immediate aftermath!",6,2,7,15 April 2008
The Descent," When extreme holidaying goes wrong...
","I had relatively high hopes for 'The Descent' before going into it. Neil Marshall proved that he has a good understanding of the horror genre with his debut, 'Dog Soldiers', which is also a film that I like very much and don't hesitate to name as one of the best horror films of the new millennium. This follow up to that film works on the same terms; with tension and atmosphere being more important than characters and substance, and I'm pleased to say that Marshall has created another worthy modern horror flick. It's clear that he wanted to be more original this time round, as the monsters here are of his own creation rather than being classic horror icons, like the werewolves in Dog Soldiers. The plot follows an all girl group of cavers who descend down into a cave somewhere in the UK. Things quickly go awry for our team, when, in a surprisingly tense scene, part of the cave collapses and seals them inside. Things get worse still when it turns out that they're not the only ones down there; and what is down there with them isn't exactly friendly...Through a gritty and realistic plot pacing, Marshall has managed to take a simple premise and turn it into a slick and extremely suspenseful horror thrill ride. The film is slow to start, with only one exciting event in the first half hour, but once the movie starts properly; the thrills come thick and fast, and even when the plotting slows down; you can always count on there being another moment to drag you back into the action. I'm not usually a person that jumps during the 'jumpy' movie scenes; but this movie actually did the trick! Marshall obviously knows what makes horror movies work too, as he spends much of the film building a foreboding atmosphere, which is complimented by the isolated setting of the cave, which is two miles underground. He keeps the atmosphere going with a plethora of different tricks, including 'Argento-style' lighting, which he realistically blends into the movie by way of the lights that the girls take down into the cave with them. The film always breaths a sense of the horror of journeying into the unknown too, and this along with the tension filled atmosphere and realistic way that the horror is presented ensures that the film always sticks firmly to it's horror style.It's clear that Neil Marshall is more interesting in creating a film that shocks more than anything else, and this is shown by the complete lack of characterisation. Marshall does give his girls something of a story, but it's never the focal point of the film and, in fact, it's hard to really care about it. This does bring the film down, as the girls are clearly in the movie just as an excuse to show the horror, and this makes sure that the film is as empty as it is stylish. This isn't all bad though, as the style is consistent; and the way that monsters have been designed reflects that. Much like the werewolves in Dog Soldiers, the fiends here look great and despite the fact that they're a work of fiction; they even have some sort of reality about them. The scenes with the monsters in, however, bring the film down. For some reason, Marshall has opted to fast edit the sequences, and while this succeeds in being disorientating and true to dark surroundings of the film's environment; it also makes it very difficult to see what's going on - which is never a good thing.The Descent isn't a great film, or even a great genre film, but it's style, effects and fair amount of gore will ensure that horror fans will be pleased; and if that doesn't grab you, the vast amount of tension in the film certainly will. It definitely is nice, however, to see a modern film that isn't afraid that show blood and gore, along with a bit of imagination. It's even better to see, due to the wave of Japanese and American remakes getting unjust high praise, that the film is home-grown right here in the UK! Overall, The Descent isn't 'must see', but it's well worth seeing and I recommend it.",8,14,29,8 July 2005
Inside Man," Would have been better if it wasn't so 'clever'...
","It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is; director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society, but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends, it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say. Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me, but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining, and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache. It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary. I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made; but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints. The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out. Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time. Denzel Washington is the cop on the case, while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker.One of the principle problems with this film is that too much is made of it, and the plot sometimes doesn't come together very well as Lee analyses his plot from both a past and present perspective. This means that we have the police interviewing suspects at the same time as the robbery is going on, and this usually involves cutting back to the bank and seeing someone doing something memorable, before Denzel Washington and his partner try to crack the people they think could be responsible. It gets a bit repetitive too often, but there's usually just about enough going on to make the film interesting. The acting is good, with the wooden Clive Owen getting a role that suits him as the masked bank robber; while the charismatic Denzel Washington provides more interest as the copper. Willem Dafoe doesn't make much of an impression, however, and Jodie Foster could have been better used. Scenes such as the one that sees a kid talking to Clive Owen about a video game involving some rapper are painful and unnecessary, however. The heist plot is well worked out, though, and seeing the plan come together at the end is the film's biggest highlight. Overall, I can't say I didn't enjoy this film as its entertaining and well worked; but it's not the great film that the director obviously wanted it to be.",7,8,11,23 July 2006
Castle in the Sky," Overrated anime fare
","Hayao Miyazaki has been getting a lot of praise recently as a result of the American release of his excellent 'Mononoke-Hime' and his somewhat less than excellent 'Spirited Away'. Castle in the Sky fits in between the two in terms of quality, but adds to the feeling that I got when the credits of 'Spirited Away' rolled that Hayao Miyazaki doesn't deserve such high praise as he's getting. Don't get me wrong, this certainly isn't a bad film (neither is Spirited Away), but it's hardly the work of a great master either. The substance on offer isn't much more than what you'd find in a Saturday morning cartoon, and the film takes itself way too seriously for an animated feature. Too much of the film is spent on characters delivering reams of heartfelt dialogue and it comes across as contrived and more than a little bit silly. However, this is matched by Miyazaki's inventiveness and attention to detail, which keeps the film away from the low end of the rating scale.With this film, Miyazaki has created his own world for his character's to inhabit, and that is always going to garner praise for the auteur. The story follows a young girl that has a crystal that has the power to show the owner the way to a mythical and powerful city in the sky. After escaping from various evildoers that want the crystal for their own reasons, she finds herself on the run with a young boy that also wants to find the lost city. This creativity is both a help and a hindrance to the story. On the one hand it allows Miyazaki creative freedom over what goes on, and he makes best use of that on many occasions. However, on the other hand, because the world isn't a complete whole - it leaves many questions unanswered, and after an hour or so of being bombarded with goings on that don't make much sense; the film gets more than a little bit tiresome. The film follows the classic adventure structure, which is nice as it makes for an entertaining ride. Castle in the Sky also has a nice musical score, which fits the tone of the film excellently.This film certainly isn't bad, but it's not great either and I suspect that more than a little of it's praise has come of a result of the popularity of Miyazaki's later works and the fact that Japanese things are very much in fashion of late. However, if anime is your bag, you'll find lots to like here.",7,2,10,7 February 2005
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," A hilarious fun time from start to finish
","The obvious thing to say about this film is that it 'rocks'. And that's an obvious thing to say because it does rock, in fact The Pick of Destiny rocks hard! The style and feel of the film will be familiar to anyone who has seen the TV show or listens to the music; being a big fan of both, this is a bonus for me. Some ideas from the television series are reused for the film, although most of it is new material and the format does translate very well to the big screen. The film is a cross between comedy and musical and the two are combined; Tenacious D made a new album for this film and the songs are very well used. Anyone who knows Tenacious D knows that they're the self-professed greatest band of all time, and the plot focuses on that idea. We watch as JB (Jack Black) travels to Hollywood where he meets KG (Kyle Gass). The two form the band 'Tenacious D' but soon become frustrated at the fact that they're not as awesome as the likes of Dio and AC/DC. The reason for these bands' awesomeness soon becomes apparent, and JB and KG end on the trail of the legendary 'pick of destiny'...Jack Black is constantly proving how great he is at carrying films, and since the plot in this one is paper thin; this fact does really help the movie. Jack Black clearly enjoys himself throughout the film and it's great to watch. Kyle Gass is the less boisterous of the pair and has a good chemistry with Black. The supporting cast is decent too; Hollywood stars Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller have amusing cameos, while rockers Ronny James Dio and Dave Grohl also have small roles. As mentioned, there really isn't much plot; but that's not a bad thing. There are plenty of jokes and absurd situations to keep things moving. It's the music that provides the most laughs; the sequence featuring the song 'Break-In City' being my favourite part of the movie. The film doesn't take itself seriously for a minute and it is a lot of fun to witness it for that reason. Naturally, there's no point to the film, but if you're looking for a film with a point; this quite clearly isn't the film to see. Overall, this movie is a must for fans of the band and/or the show; the film is unlikely to appeal to everyone, but it hit the spot for me.",8,1,2,31 January 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in a movie together.
","All I wanted from this film was an action-packed parody on married life - but alas, it didn't deliver. Simply put, the film is too cool - and every action therefore comes off as being very unrealistic, and this is more a parody of fluffy romantic comedies than married life. Despite his impressive role in Troy, I've been rather unimpressed with Brad Pitt lately. He seems far too keen to wallow in his celebrity, and his role here; along with the one in the terrible Oceans Twelve last year, shows that all too clearly. His co-star, Angelina Jolie is another who is more bothered about her star status than putting in a good performance. Both Pitt and Jolie are clearly in this film for the money, and the fact that it will be liked by all the casual cinema-goers; and it's rather annoying really, especially as the idea that either of these two could kill someone  let alone be professional assassins, is ridiculous. The camera caresses them both - and all we get therefore is Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in a movie together, not a movie with characters being played by Pitt and Jolie. The excuse for Pitt and Jolie being in a movie together is that a married man, who is secretly an assassin, finds out that his wife is one too. Oh dear.The star power of the leads is what attracts most people to this movie, but for me it was always the action. To be honest, if the film could have gotten this right, I would have been willing to forgive most other mistakes. The action isn't all that great really, but the way it's fused with the idea that the two people who are trying to kill each other, don't really want to kill each other - is actually well done, and you can believe it in spite of the characters being non-existent. The film also does a good job of setting itself plainly in suburbia, and the way that the neighbours poke their nose into the central couple's business; while the two of them pretend to be just the norm in suburbia provides the film with most of it's laughs. Vince Vaughn appears too, but is lost under the central duo's 'star power', and is never given a chance to shine because of this. Overall, I would say that this film is good enough to provide entertainment - but it's not all that good. All of it's good points come in spite of the leads, not because of them; and I for one think that this plot line is capable of springing a much better film than this one. Perhaps next time (i.e. in thirty years time when this film will be ripe for a remake) they could cast a couple of actors that are right for the parts, rather than being right for the box office.",6,0,2,12 December 2005
The Departed," One of the greatest films of the new millennium
","In general, I'm not Scorsese's biggest fan; but this Americanization of the Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' is a great film, and one of the popular director's best efforts, period. The film takes in themes of deception and identity fraud, and carries off its story of undercover agents with style and panache. It is customary with modern day crime thrillers to add a layer of 'cool' to the proceedings; and Scorsese certainly does that here, although it is not a forced Tarantino-style slew of one-liners, but rather a relaxed assurance in the plot and characters, which really pays off once the plot begins to develop. The story itself follows the intriguing idea of two undercover agents infiltrating each other's organisation. Colin Sullivan joined the police force after mob boss Frank Costello decided that it would be a good idea to have some undercover agents on the other side. Meanwhile, William Costigan; another new recruit of the police force, is sent to work undercover in the same organisation being run by Frank Costello. Naturally, both men end up looking for each other and much violence ensues...As you would expect from an A-list production such as this one, the acting is superb. Both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio step into their respective roles well, with DiCaprio in particular delivering the sort of gritty performance that you wouldn't expect from him given the sort of films he was making before hooking up with Scorsese. Of course, it is Jack Nicholson who steals the show as the eccentric mob boss. This represents an absolutely great piece of casting, as Nicholson was born to play roles like this, and seeing him completely owning every scene he's in is a delight for the viewer. The rest of the support is more than adequate, and Scorsese manages to put the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and the subtly sexy Vera Farminga to good use in a range of roles. There's plenty of violence in the film to satisfy crime fans, with a particular focus on people getting punched in the face. The music used generally works well, with the likes of the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd blending well with sequences in the movie. The ending is potently bleak, and perfectly fits the film up until that point. I don't often find myself saying this of Scorsese's films - but The Departed truly is a modern day masterpiece and everyone who calls themselves a film fan owes it to themselves to see it.",10,1,10,17 October 2006
Psycho," The master director's most important film?
","There's no denying that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the true geniuses of cinema, and Psycho is his most popular film. Whether or not it's his 'best' is up for debate; but no matter what; it's definitely up there. Psycho is the film that inspired the entire 'slasher' sub-genre, and is also a textbook example of how to make a thriller. Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel. Managed by a quiet young man named Norman, the remote motel has more secrets than it's appearance suggests.Alfred Hitchcock creates a superb macabre atmosphere around the central location. Just the motel itself is frightening, without the rain effects and the psychopath that inhabits it. The master director has proved time and time again that he knows how to handle a movie; and the way that he orchestrates the surrounding here shows that implicitly. Everything about the plot is well worked, and the twist right at the centre of the film shows that. It's hard to carry off a twist like the one here and make it work, as the audience have put so much time and effort into the central character; but Hitchcock is more than equal to the challenge, and the way that he shifts the focus and still manages to retain all the intrigue is awesome to watch. The pivotal scene of the movie is, of course, the shower scene. The technicalities of this scene warrant the seven days that it took to film it, and the resulting montage represents some of the best footage ever to come out of Hollywood. I don't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' usually, but the shower scene is so skilfully done that it's hard to not respect it.The central character of Norman Bates is, without doubt, one of the most frightening characters in cinema history. Unlike many of the resulting slashers' killers, Norman isn't overblown or even unrealistic; you can really imagine this character being real. Of course, the excellent performance by Anthony Perkins really adds to the character. There are some actors that were made by one role, and Perkins is one of them. The rest of the ensemble work brilliantly together, with Janet Leigh providing the central character until mid-way through, when Vera Miles steps in. It's a shame, really, that Psycho is so well known because now everyone knows it's twist, so it's hard to really enjoy the movie the way that it's intended. I knew the twist already before I saw the film for the first time - so it's lucky that the movie is so good, because otherwise, already knowing what happens could have spoilt it. Overall, there's a very good reason why Psycho is one of the most respected movies of all time. There are some films that you cant be a cinema fan without seeing - and this is one of them.",9,1,7,7 October 2005
Rosemary's Baby," Out and out horror classic
","Based on a novel by Ira Levin, Rosemary's Baby is a slow building and suspenseful tale of horror based on Satanism. Rosemary's Baby is often cited as being one of the best horror films ever made, and there is a good reason for this. The genre is famous more for blood and scenes that make the audience squirm - Rosemary's baby doesn't feature any of that, but it does feature an atmosphere of constant dread and a plot that always remains interesting even when the pace is rather slow, and that more than makes up for any gratuitous scenes of gore. The plot is fairly simple and focuses on young couple, Guy (an actor) and Rosemary Woodhouse. They move in to a new apartment building and meet a friendly elderly couple living next door, Roman and Minnie Castevet. Guy begins to spend a lot of time with the couple next door, and before long Rosemary has become pregnant - strangely around the same time she has a dream about being raped by something inhuman. As soon as the neighbours realise she pregnant, they take a keen interest; and strange things start to happen.The rights to Ira Levin's novel were originally acquired by William Castle; and while I don't mean to discredit Castle as I do love most of his work, I have to say that I'm glad that Polanski was brought in to direct as this is not the sort of plot that Castle would have done well with. This film is the second (and best) part of a trilogy of films by Roman Polanksi focusing on Paranoia - the other two being Repulsion and The Tenant. Polanski's direction is really what makes this film what it is; while the plot often plays out like a soap opera and there are periods where nothing really happens, though the atmosphere hanging over the mystery of the story - as well as the fact that we know certain things that are unknown to the central character - ensure that the film is always interesting. I wont spend too much time talking about the actors; but suffice to say, all four of the central performances are excellent; Ruth Gordon's supporting role representing on the few times that a horror film has been recognised by the Academy. It all boils down to a fantastic final ten minutes, which manages to be chilling while still following what has gone before it - i.e. not showing the audience everything. Overall, it's impossible to deny that Rosemary's Baby is a masterpiece and also one of the true 'must see' horror films.",10,4,9,30 October 2007
War of the Worlds," B-Movie Blockbuster does exactly what it says on the tin!
","Steven Spielberg's latest blockbuster is a tour-de-force of entertainment and the latest special effects, which despite it's shortcomings in the substance department, still works thanks to the amazing effects, good plot pace and high entertainment value on the whole. The film is, of course, based on the classic novel 'War of the Worlds' by H.G. Wells' and is a remake of the 1953 film of the same title. The film follows a similar structure to that of most disaster movies, in that it follows two plot lines; the first being the major disaster itself, and the second being the smaller tale of an estranged family unit. Spielberg never truly manages to garner the maximum effect from either story. Sure, the effects are amazing and when the aliens are attacking, you wont care about much else; but he grounds the story in minute details too often, and the story of Tom Cruise and his estranged kids just isn't enough to form a solid backbone for the movie. Adding to the woe on this front is the chemistry between the actors; of which there isn't a lot. I realise that it's supposed to be an estranged relationship, but really; the three central characters could have been strangers.However, nobody will pay admission to War of the Worlds for the accompanying story, and it's the overblown special effects that steal the show and are the real star of the film. I'm not usually one to rave about CGI, but the effects really are something to rave about. As cars fly across the screen and underground tremors give way to huge mechanical monstrosities, it's impossible not to be entertained and it goes to show that all these years Spielberg has spent making popcorn have made sure that he knows how to give the audience what they want. The alien attack sequences in this movie are the reason people go to the cinema. The story of the family at the centre of the movie is typically Spielberg, and it shows a father whose kids live with their mother and call him Ray instead of Dad. The family really just gives Spielberg some characters to spin the action around, but he does manage to squeeze some credibility out of this plot. As it plays out, we can engage more and more with the characters and despite their lack of chemistry; Spielberg wins us over with them in the end.Tom Cruise isn't an actor that I rate very highly. While he has screen presence and charisma, he lacks acting talent and in this film, like many other films of his, he seems to simply be playing himself. It's lucky, then, that this film is an effects laden blockbuster; because if it was an actor's film; Cruise would bring the project down without question. He is joined by the latest child-actor craze; Dakota Flemming. Actually, this young actress isn't nearly as annoying as many of her counterparts and she delivers a solid performance in the film. Justin Chatwin makes up the threesome. I'd never heard of this actor before, and it's not surprising since he's hardly made anything. I liken his performance in this movie to that of the kids' in Jurassic Park - decent enough at the time, but forgettable by the end. Spielberg's direction is, of course, solid throughout and although he's not the most talented director to ever sit in the director's chair, popcorn is what he's good and when he's making it, you can usually count on a good time. Unless it's called Schindler's List, of course.The ending of 'War of the Worlds' has always seemed like something of a cop-out to me. It's one of the things I hated about the original movie, but thanks to Morgan Freeman's outro; the ending is wrapped up nicely and it even seems to make sense. Spielberg still manages to cop-out on us with the ending to his other plot, however; which is far too soppy and spoils the most powerful moment that the film offered. But on the whole; War of the Worlds does exactly what you would expect it to do. It offers solid entertainment, some great special effects and not a lot else. I had a really good time watching it and the film most definitely built on my expectations. A highly recommended summer blockbuster.",8,10,20,1 July 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," A detailed and thought-provoking account of war
","Before watching this epic masterpiece, I never quite understood what it is that makes people want to fight a war that was started by some politician, and after watching this film; I'm even more baffled. With it's ambiguous portrait of war, All Quiet on the Western Front never actually condemns (nor condones) the act of war, but through it's portrait; the anti-war message more than shine through. Multiple scenes show the hideousness of war, and through watching this film it becomes apparent that war is futile and a disgraceful waste of human life. We follow the (mis)fortune of a group of young adults who, due to the patriotic words of their teacher, decide to join the war effort. The rest of the film pans out as a sort of coming of age story in the middle of a great feud. We watch the protagonists as they stare death in the face and learn what is and isn't important when you risk your life at every passing moment.This was one of the first films to announce America as a major film-making nation as with it's epic battle sequences and first class acting, All Quiet on the Western Front impresses on a technical level, as well as impressing with it's detailed and thought-provoking account of war. The film features numerous excellent scenarios, all of which are thought provoking in the context of the film, but also in life on the whole. Consider the part where one young man is told that maths problems are a waste of time as he could stop a bullet at any time, or the sequence that sees a soldier try to save the life of his fellow man that he has stabbed in the stomach (a French soldier, but still a fellow man). Not to mention the classy finish. Whichever way you look at it; this film is a masterpiece. It succeeds on a technical level and also does what films were created to do; entertain and inspire thought from their audiences. There are some films that every film buff must see regardless of their genre preferences. This is one of them.",8,59,70,4 January 2005
30 Days of Night," Could have been better, but still a good modern vampire flick
","30 Days of Night is based on a comic book by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith which, like every other comic book, I haven't read. It's not hard to see why they'd turn this comic into a movie, however, as the chance for a brilliant vampire flick is clearly there; we've got a snow setting, coupled with one of nature's strangest happenings, and of course a pack of hungry vampires. Considering all these elements; it really does have to be said that 30 Days of Night is a big let down. While certainly not a bad film; it probably could have been a masterpiece. The plot centres on a small Alaskan town. Most people that live there are deserting; not wanting to have to withstand the upcoming month of darkness. Those that remain soon find that the fact that alcohol is banned during this time isn't there only problem; as the local sheriff notices a few strange crime reports, and pretty soon the town is at the mercy of a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, hell-bent on chowing down on everyone left in the town, before eradicating any trace of them being there. Only a small few stand in the vampires' way...One of the main problems with modern horror movies is flashy photography. I don't know who decided that not letting the audience see what is going on properly is exciting, but whoever it was should be hunted down and butchered by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, being sure to remove to his head to prevent him coming back and inventing some other rubbish. Credit where credit is due, however; this film doesn't feature too much of it. Once the vampires are introduced properly, things improve greatly and the film reaches its biggest high towards the middle with an excellent massacre sequence. From there, it's somewhat reminiscent of George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead, as we watch the survivor's hole up and band together against the impending threat. The film stars Josh Hartnett, who is not as misplaced in the lead role as I thought he might be. He's a bit too pretty to be the town sheriff really, but he gets into his role well. Danny Huston as the head vampire is the real standout here. One big problem with the film is that it takes place over thirty days, yet it feels like it could have happened in one night. It's obvious why they chose to do it like this...but it doesn't feel right. It boils down to a disappointing and silly ending, but most of the film is entertaining and gory enough to please most viewers. Overall, this is not as great as it could have been; but it's an above average horror film, and I recommend seeing it.",7,10,22,8 November 2007
Wedding Crashers," Lightweight entertainment, good for a laugh
","Wedding Crashers was touted to be one of the surprise hits of the year - and while it is good and definitely has its moments; there's just too much wrong with it to be a complete success. The first, and biggest problem is that it's just too long; while the plot is at it's best, you just want the film to continue; but after the pivotal middle section has expired, the film doesn't leave much to keep the audience interested. To be honest, I was bored with the last twenty minutes. The plot focuses on a really good idea - namely, turning up to weddings, pretending to be some distant relation, and then using this position to meet women who are basking in the glow of 'true love'. I'd engage in this activity myself if English weddings weren't so rubbish. Anyway, the plot follows two divorce mediators that make a habit of crashing weddings. Wedding season is nearing it's close, but there's still one big one left; namely, the wedding of the Treasury Secretary's daughter. After successfully infiltrating the event; one of the team finds himself at odds when he falls in love with the bride's sister...A lot of the movie relies on the two leads. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn team up for this movie, and they do a very good job of keeping the audience's interest. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of either of these two (or the rest of the 'Frat-pack', Jack Black aside) but they know how to make a movie like this work, and providing they keep delivering lightweight comedies; I'm sure they'll continue to please those who do like them. Christopher Walken appears in a support role, which is always nice to see; even if he does just rely on his persona these days, and Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) takes the lead female role. The jokes, as you might expect, come thick and fast; with about half of them being funny, and a select few being very funny. Most of the comedy straddles that awkward line where characters find themselves in a situation they don't like; so if you like that humour, you'll probably like this. I cant say if this is better than other recent 'Frat-Pack' films like Dodgeball and Starsky and Hutch, having not seen them - but I will say that if all you want is an easy couple of hours of entertainment, this should suffice...despite being a bit too long.",7,1,1,24 November 2005
Man on Fire," Above the usual Denzel Washington vehicle
","There's no denying it, Man on Fire clearly thinks that it's a better film than it is. Tony Scott has obviously tried to make this film appeal to both sets of audiences; namely, those who want to be entertained, and those who want to see 'greatness'. It's safe to say that he hasn't exactly succeeded with this; although it's also safe to say that the movie isn't a complete failure. The film works by presenting two very different halves. We start off with a Leon-esquire plot involving a bodyguard hired to protect a young girl, which then bursts into revenge thriller mode after she is kidnapped. The first half of the movie will appeal more to the 'Oscar' crowd, while the second half is more bent on providing entertainment. I wouldn't say either half is better; the first half is interesting, although it lacks emotion, and the second half is thrilling; but goes out of it's way to show flashy images and Denzel Washington being as nasty as possible. Still, the first half of the film does an excellent job of setting up the second; and considering this is a blockbuster, it's more emotional than you would expect.I've never been a big fan of Denzel Washington, and it's seems more and more lately that all of his movies are merely vehicles for the 'Oscar winner'. Still, he usually puts in a performance worth watching, and he certainly does that here. Washington's starring role also has the added advantage of the fact that he looks the part he is playing, making the film more believable. Man on Fire has implemented a different way of using subtitles than most films, with the words flashing up all over the screen. I don't usually like gimmicky things like this, but it actually works rather well in this film. Tony Scott is a director that I have come to expect nothing from, as his films are usually made purely for entertainment value, and sometimes don't even deliver that; but Man on Fire is one of his better films over the last few years (although he still hasn't topped 1993's True Romance). The ending of the film is particularly good, and surprisingly emotional as well. I'm not the sort of guy that cries at movies; but I could understand if other people did. On the whole; this isn't a great movie, but it's decent enough and definitely worth viewing. It could have done with being a little shorter, though.",7,0,3,12 January 2006
Downfall," A magnificent piece of cinema. Spectacular in every respect
","Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.It is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang's main claim to greatness, however - it's the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed, and all the time you're watching you can not only see what's happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene, there's always the notion that a nation is falling. That's another thing that's great about this movie - the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand, we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil; but while we're watching this almost great nation crumble around it's leader, it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country, in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi's; but Der Untergang has managed even that. 'The Downfall' is an apt title for this movie, as aside from depicting an important event in history; the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man's huge downfall, and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed.",8,37,41,21 April 2005
Hitch," Aims high and hits low....but Will Smith entertains
","This isn't really my kind of flick, but for a silly, savvy date movie - Hitch isn't all that bad. It's obvious that if it wasn't for Will Smith, this movie would never have been made - but he is clearly cut out for roles like this, and even while sleepwalking; Smith proves that he can still entertain. The film tries to leap over it's obvious layer of 'entertainment' and deliver a message that has far more substance than the film does - namely, that love is blind, anyone can fall in love with anyone, love knows no boundaries blah blah blah. To incorporate this message into the plot, the film has had to smother itself in sentiment, and this is what ultimately brings it down. When will filmmakers learn that to make people care, you have to stay away from sentimentality? The scenes that see the characters open up their hearts are largely painful, and this takes away from the film. Hitch does have a surprisingly large amount of things going for it, mostly springing from the performances, but this all falls flat when it starts trying to deliver it's message...with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in the face.The plotting can, at times, make Hitch hard to enjoy. Some plot points are either left out or not explained very well initially, and this means that the viewer has to try and piece the story together themselves as the film moves on, which can be very annoying. The film is also a good twenty minutes too long. Writer Kevin Bisch obviously wanted this film to be more than it is, and that is shown through the aforementioned 'message' and far too many scenes that go on too long. Still, the writing is actually quite good - and scenes in particular that see Will Smith and Eva Mendes bound dialogue back and forth are good and will please the film's target audience. This film is clearly aimed at the casual movie going public, so it's probably a little unfair to criticise this against it's more serious counterparts, so I wont bother. Will Smith may not be one of the best actors of all time; but he's quite clearly a star. Even from his early days in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Smith has stolen scenes and enforced himself throughout, and really; if it weren't for him; this film would have failed.",6,0,0,13 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The only prequel worthy of the name 'Star Wars'
","Let's face it, whatever George Lucas did with the final instalment of his epic trilogy, there would be complainers. Of course, the man himself is to blame; The Phantom Menace is a horrible film, and while Attack of the Clones is a lot better than it's predecessor, it still leaves a lot to be desired when compared to the original classics. However, it's third time lucky for George as this time round he's done the fans - and himself - proud. Episode III is by far the best of the new Star Wars films, and the only one that even challenges for a place among the 'proper' movies. This is the film we've all been waiting for; the one that charts Anakin's fall from 'the chosen one' to an all powerful lord of the Sith. Before seeing the movie, like lots of fans I'm sure, I was dreading the possibility that Lucas might have messed this one up too. Of course, the story this time is much stronger and therefore harder to mess up, but the other films were giving me doubts. While I still regret the lower quality of the other two films; Lucas has redeemed himself here. THIS is Star Wars.The story is the main focal point of the film, and while Lucas has fleshed it out with numerous battle scenes and lightsabre fights, it's always obvious that the man is here to tell us a story. While the first prequel got lost in the very unfunny antics of a certain amphibian, and the second one had too much camp humour and got lost in sideplots; here we get the full brunt of Star Wars' central story, and it makes for fascinating viewing. Star Wars is the closest thing modern society has come to a truly great original story, and Lucas has done the universe that he has invented proud with this movie. While sometimes the motivations of the characters can be a little off-centre, they're believable for the most part; and Anakin's transformation couldn't have been better handled. It would have been too easy for Lucas just to focus on the young man's anger to turn him to dark side, but instead he's added a new twist to it, and although the character becomes decidedly evil by the end of the movie; we can almost understand his descent. Of course, all is not so simple as Anakin making a choice, and in this movie Lucas' building in the other two films really bears fruits. Unexpectedly, this movie also increases the potency of the original trilogy, particularly the ending of Return of the Jedi.However, the talents of the man who created this great saga are also this film's major downfall. The reality of the situation is; Lucas may have a great mind for making up a story, but his directorial and writing abilities are questionable to say the least. The majority of the cast don't put in good performances, and although certain members' acting talent can be considered as a reason why, the main reason is Lucas' terrible writing and his inability to direct his actors. Giving the lead role to Hayden Christensen may not be as bad an idea as it seems to be - he has the screen presence to play Anakin Skywalker, but the delivery of his lines is very awkward, and the scenes he shares with Natalie Portman - his 'love' - are very much lacking in emotion, and somebody with more talent might have been able to get round the writer/director's shortcomings. There are certain serious scenes in the movie where all you will be able to do, if you can get over cringing, is laugh - and that's not good at all. Certain cast members do shine, though, and the brightest star in the cast is Ian McDiarmid. Emperor Palpatine is the most interesting character in the film, and McDiarmid gives a wonderful performance, every scene with him in it is a delight. However, Star Wars has never really been about great performances, and although this film does need a little more acting talent than the other five did due to it's story - it's still all about the action.The action in the movie is fast paced and there's lots of it, and that's probably the reason why this film feels much more like Star Wars than the previous two. The lightsabre battles are superb, and the final climatic one (some would say 'ultimate') between Anakin Skywalker and his mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi, is breathtaking to say the least. It does feel a little like Lucas is cashing in on the lightsabre's popularity with the number of fights that include the Jedi weapon, but I don't care - it makes for great entertainment. The special effects throughout the movie are nothing short of amazing, and each landscape in the film is brilliantly rendered. The space battles are excellent, and even though you know it's only CGI, and therefore lazy effects, the CGI is good; and when it's good I personally don't mind seeing it. Lucas has cashed in on a lot of things with this series - the droids, which are hardly relevant, the novelty of seeing Yoda with a lightsabre and the inclusion of Chewbacca in this movie to name but a few things - but hey; it's Star Wars! Some will leave this movie feeling cold, but I had a great time and the story and amount of action in the movie made it a great film experience for me. Just seeing those starting title credits come up before a Star Wars film I haven't seen is good enough, but when a good film follows; it's truly something to savour. Sadly, fans of the series are never going to see those credits come up before a new film again, so let's savour it. Lucas' trilogy has ended, and it's ended with a more than worthy film. THIS prequel is worthy of the name 'Star Wars'.",8,4,13,25 May 2005
Lord of War," War! What is it good for? Well, business...
","Nicholas Cage utters a line in this film about how we can't fight our own biology, and this idea is shown throughout Lord of War; most notably on the plotting side. The film follows the familiar 'rise and fall' plot for most of the duration that films the likes of Blow and Goodfellas have used before it; and the only real difference between them is that here the story is about gun running. This could have been fatal for the movie - nobody likes seeing things they've seen before in cinema - but Lord of War gets over this fact with the themes that run throughout the movie. The film is definitely very anti-war, but it portrays this mood sarcastically by following the exploits of gunrunner Yuri Orlov. Soldiers wage wars; but Orlov is one of the men that actually make wars happen. He provides the weapons that provide the killing; and doesn't care too much about the morality implications because the business is lucrative for him, and if he doesn't do it; someone else will anyway. War is an atrocity; but for some people it's a good thing. Peace is bad for Orlov's business; and he's prepared to keep his morals in check if it makes his wallet bigger.Lord of War may irritate some people as there isn't a clear story, and the characters serve more as a way to portray the movie's themes than add any emotional weight to the proceedings. The characters do have their moments, however; and a scene that sees Cage having his hand forced by one of his customers expertly portrays the character's attitude and the reason why 'Evil prevails'. Yuri Orlov doesn't want to get his hands dirty; but he's happy to profit from the people that don't mind dirtying theirs. Despite not being a film about characters, Lord of War definitely belongs to its main star. I'm usually indifferent to Nicholas Cage; but here he does very well, both in convincing us that he's an amoral profiteer, and holding the audience's attention. He enforces himself in every scene, and that is the reason why he will always be the headlining star. The supporting cast don't really get to do much; but Jared Leto stands out as Orlov's brother, and the slimy Ethan Hawke is perfectly cast as the Interpol agent on Yuri's tail. The support cast members that really made a mark for me, however were Eamonn Walker and Sammi Rotibi; who are excellent as the father and son that Yuri makes arms deals with.Lord of War isn't a film for everyone. It lays its themes on thick, and doesn't give the audience much in terms of an actual plot. For me, this makes it all the better; although I can understand if others don't agree. The familiar plot structure doesn't get in the way too much; and Lord of War manages to break free of predictability with it's conclusion. Recommended viewing.",8,1,3,7 January 2006
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Brothers. At War. In Korea.
","I have become so dismayed at the recent crop of Asian films that I have taken to going into them expecting to be disappointed. You can imagine my surprise, then, when this film; Brotherhood, actually turned out to be quite good! Despite an opening that massively rips off Saving Private Ryan, and more than it's fair share of clichés throughout the running time, the film is an emotional account of war that works more because of the relationship of it's characters than the plot itself. The film centres around the Korean war, which sets it apart from other war dramas almost immediately because there aren't many that focus on this particular war. The main theme of the movie is relationship between the two characters (hence the title). We have this central brotherhood, which is surrounded by the horrors of the Korean War. The way that the film plugs you into their plight is skilfully handled, and despite the fact that sometimes the film goes over the top a little with the sentiment; it's usually well meaning, and since the character actions are well explained, it's easy to care for them.Despite, essentially, being a war film; the actual war takes a back seat to the 'brotherhood'. However, that doesn't stop director Je-gyu Kang from adequately showing the horrors of war. The action in the film is gritty and realistic, with some of the violent sequences actually managing to be out and out disturbing. Scenes that see prisoners of war brutally slaughtered stand out among the top of the disturbing sequences. The acting from the support cast is genuine and feels real, which helps to add to the overall realism of the picture. Of the two leads, Dong-Kun Jang stands out the most. He looks the part throughout his character ark, and his range of emotions impresses throughout the movie. Bin Won stars opposite him and gives a far more one-note performance. Of course, this could be blamed on the writing and the character; but he overacts every emotion and, at times, it brings the movie down a peg or two. Most war films profess the horrors of war, but this film only does that in an indirect way. Brotherhood is more about how war changes people than the actual 'horror' of it, and it's nice to see a different take. I wont close this review with any clichéd comments like 'better than anything Hollywood have done, ever' or anything; but I will say that it's good.",7,5,6,14 August 2005
The Terminal," Not bad, but not Spielberg at his best either
","There's no doubting that Spielberg knows the workings of cinema well enough to ensure that his movies are always entertaining, but sometimes he doesn't choose his projects all that wisely. The man is at his best when he's got a huge budget and a long list of stunts to play with; and he showed this with his Indiana Jones trilogy and Jurassic Park films. When Spielberg attempts drama, the results are often mixed. Schindler's List stunk of a blockbuster director trying to win an Oscar, and while it doesn't look like Spielberg was going for gold with this picture; the movie doesn't quite bode right, and much of the drama seems forced or overly sentimental. This makes the film hard to take seriously at times, especially since many of the events in the film are completely detached from reality. The extremely swift wedding ceremony sticks out the most. The plot, based on a true story, follows Viktor Navorski; an Eastern European man who finds himself stranded in a New York airport when his country goes to war and isn't letting anyone in or out. He then, through lack of other options, decides to take up residency in the airport itself.In 2004, Tom Hanks delivered an outstandingly over the top performance in the Coen's remake of the Ealing classic, The Ladykillers. The Terminal sees Hanks delivering another over the top performance, but it's not half as good this time. Hanks' put on European accent isn't bad, but it quickly becomes annoying. His dumb antics are another thing that becomes annoying all too quickly, and after about an hour; the premise begins to show signs of becoming tired. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Hanks' massively underdeveloped love interest. It is this aspect that is the film's main downfall. The romance between these two is hardly explored and it happens all too quickly. It therefore feels like an afterthought in an underdeveloped movie. It isn't all woe for this film, however, as the movie does have it's good points. Spielberg does a surprisingly good job of setting up his protagonist's plight and the way that we are constantly reminded of the predicament that the immigrant is in, is good. On the whole, this is worth watching; but Spielberg has been better, and far more entertaining, than this on many occasions.",7,1,3,5 July 2005
1408," A great modern horror thriller!
","I think even the most ardent fan would have to admit that a lot of films based on the work of Stephen King are somewhat less than brilliant, but with 1408, he's certainly scored a hit this time! The film will obviously always be compared to what is probably the most successful film based on one of his novels - The Shining - due to the hotel setting and supernatural theme of the film, but the two stories really aren't much alike and 1408 can be enjoyed without having to draw comparisons between the two. The film stars John Cusack in his first good role in ages, and he plays Mike Enslin - a writer who makes a living by writing about haunted places, and also a man broken by the loss of his daughter. One day, while looking for places to visit, he receives a mysterious postcard from the Dolphin Hotel with a note telling him to stay out of room 1408. Naturally, he decides that he wants to stay in that room, but the hotel manager is not at all keen on the idea and does his best to change Mike's mind. But he's having none of it, and after an argument, he gets the keys to 1408...The build up to the inevitable stay in the room is fantastic, and the film features an absolutely great scene between the stars John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. The room itself is a masterpiece of supernatural horror and director Mikael Håfström piles on the scares once the action reaches the title location. It has to be said that the film does have a few problems - the plot doesn't always flow well and certain parts of it feel unneeded (probably as a result of the fact that this is a feature length film based on a short story), but most viewers are unlikely to care about this once the film gets to room 1408, as from there on out 1408 is a thrill ride from start to finish. The atmosphere is superb and the way that the horror builds up slowly is extremely unsettling and expertly puts the viewer in Mike Enslin's precarious situation. Cusack is just great in the central role and delivers an excellent varied performance. The film also features a great twist on the classic clichéd ending that really does the story justice. Overall, this is certainly one of the best horror films in years and one of the best based on King's work - highly recommended!",8,0,11,31 August 2007
Tombstone," Russell, Paxton and Kilmer raise some hell in a small town
","Legendary lawman Wyatt Earp is now a retired man, and has decided to travel to the town of 'Tombstone' to find his fortune. While there, he meets his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan along with his good friend Doc Holliday; and all is fine and dandy. That is, until an infamous band of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' turns up to spoil Wyatt's party. These are the outlaws that Wyatt loved to dispatch in his prime, but now all he wants is to retire and have done with it...will he be able to do that, or is it time for him to re-enter the frey?Kurt Russell takes the lead role of Wyatt Earp for this movie, and does a good job with it (despite a very silly mustache). When justifying his reasons for casting Russell in Escape From New York, John Carpenter said that he could play anybody; and I think he can...but he's a lot better at roles that require him to show off, and he doesn't really get that chance here. Still, it's different and refreshing to see him in a more serious role. Russell gets support from a number of good actors, one of which being one of my personal favourites, Bill Paxton. Like Kurt, Paxton isn't given reign to play to his strengths here either. Paxton is at his best when he's running the show like he was in Aliens and Near Dark (despite them also being supporting roles), but his character here is a more subdued one, so he doesn't shine as much as he had previously. Val Kilmer is the only cast member that is allowed to go over the top in his role. He plays Doc Holliday; the drunken, loud mouthed braggart of the film and spends most it making quips and generally showing off. Although this does the film credit as it makes it more exciting, it does become annoying after a while. These are the stars that stick out the most, but also getting in on the fun to complete an excellent cast are Sam Elliot, Paxton's Aliens co-star; Michael Beihn, and Powers Boothe, the man he would later cast in the excellent 'Frailty'. Then there's Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker and we've even got Robert Mitchum doing the narrating!The film is very dramatic; a lot of the cast look like they could auditioning for the next Oscar ceremony, and the music adds to the theatrics, coming in whenever there's a whisper of a heartbreaking or exciting moment (the latter of which the film has plenty). However, this over-dramatization adds to the campy feel of the film and it makes it quite fun to watch. Tombstone is a very good movie; it's well shot, the acting is good enough and it remains entertaining for it's duration, and it's certainly one of the better westerns that have been released since 'Unforgiven' was met with critical acclaim in 1992. However, it's no classic.",8,0,3,26 November 2004
Blade Runner," Beautiful, atmospheric, thought-provoking.
","Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, this futuristic urban Sci-Fi film is a masterpiece indeed. Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery, that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one. It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are. This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum, and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence. The plot, which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive, follows a group of four androids ('Replicants') that have escaped their masters and come to Earth, where Replicants are illegal. Their intention is to seek out 'the maker' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan, given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions. On their tail is Deckard; a policeman in the business of hunting Replicants; known as a Blade Runner.Through a grim setting and dark characterization; Ridley Scott has truly succeeded in giving Blade Runner a classic film-noir style. This bodes well with the futuristic metropolitan version of Los Angeles that the film takes place in. Both of these elements blend excellently with the characters, which are intriguing as they are dark. Harrison Ford steps into the role of Deckard; the classic noir protagonist. We never really delve into his character; but at the same time, that ensures that the mystery surrounding him is kept up, which serves in making our protagonist all the more intriguing. Rutger Hauer, who gives a career-best performance as the leader of the Replicants, matches him. Hauer treads the line between pathos and pure evil brilliantly, and it's always easy to believe that he is the doomed android that the movie presents him as. The main thing I love about this movie is it's style; the dark Gothic undertones are superb to look at, and once the film enters it's final third, the atmosphere takes over and the way that it builds to it's beautiful and classic conclusion is absolutely superb. Blade Runner may have been met with negativity on it's release; but today it's an absolute classic.",9,4,8,14 July 2005
Casino Royale," New Bond in a good action flick
","I can't say I'm a fan of James Bond films - I've seen them all (except the original spoof 'Casino Royale'), and Goldfinger is the only film that I rate highly; but I was interested in seeing this one for the fact that there's a new Bond, and he's so different from all those who have gone before. Director Martin Campbell is no stranger to making Bond films with a new lead as he was the man that helmed the well-received Pierce Brosnan debut Goldeneye back in 1995. This one, however, is wildly different from the rest for reasons other than just the new Bond - as we have an unfortunate lack of gadgets, as well as an overall darker and more serious tone. The plot line isn't the most megalomaniacal of the series, and simply focuses on Le Chiffre; a terrorist accountant with a talent for playing poker. He decides to set up a high stakes poker game in Montenegro after his other plan was thwarted by MI6's newest agent, James Bond. Coincidentally, Bond happens to be the best poker player in the organisation and so the government funds his ten million dollar entrance fee...but he has to win, otherwise Britain will be directly funding terrorism! Being a talented poker player myself, I was a little worried that the film may focus on the turgid 'stud' form of poker; but fortunately, it's the more exciting Texas Hold'Em that takes centre stage. The film doesn't focus too much on poker, but what we do get is completely overblown; along with the rest of the film. Of course, I'd be complaining more if it wasn't; and Martin Campbell provides a good mix of big stunts and smaller one on one fights. The real star of the show is, of course, the new Bond; and Daniel Craig does a really good job in the central role. The James Bond series really needed some new life injected into it, and Craig adequately provides that. He is joined by the stunningly sexy Eva Green who takes the 'Bond Girl' role, while Mads Mikkelsen is a distinctive baddie and the film is rounded off by Judy Dench and Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini, who starred in the classic Giallo 'Black Belly of the Tarantula' with no less than three Bond girls! Overall, Casino Royale is certainly an enjoyable slice of celluloid, but despite its overblown emotional scenes - that's all it is. But even so, it would be difficult to get bored during this film, and it gets a thumbs up for that reason.",7,6,11,21 November 2006
Before Sunrise," Casablanca for the 1990's - pure cinematic gold
","Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.In a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.",9,255,291,11 February 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," A belated sequel that certainly doesn't disappoint!
","I have to say, I'm not usually a big fan of belated sequels to films made years ago - but I have to make an exception here as Die Hard 4 offers an amazingly good time and is surely the best of the sequels - possibly even the best Die Hard film period! The film is almost completely made up of relentless and heart pumping action sequences, and while it might not be life-affirming stuff, you wont care about much else while you're watching it - so it's safe to say that the third Die Hard sequel more than does it's job! As you would probably expect since this is the first Die Hard movie of this millennium, the plot this time round focuses on the internet. Most of the USA is controlled by computers, so naturally they find themselves with a big problem when someone hacks into the system and begins a 'fire sale' - in which all the essential elements of the USA (transport, communication, power etc) are systematically shut down to create confusion and chaos. Detective John McClane is dragged into this plot when he's sent to pick up a computer hacker wanted by the police.One of the things I loved most about this film is the fact that it's just a straight action thriller and doesn't ever pretend to be anything that it isn't. There's no false patriotism or sentiment - it's all very straight up, just the way it should be! The film is directed by Underworld director Len Wiseman and it's clear that the man knows his way around an action sequence, as this film features plenty! The stunts involve all sorts from the standard trucks and cars to helicopters and fighter jets! It's not just the vehicles involved either that makes these scenes great to watch; someone has actually put some thoughts into them so they're not just merely the same old stuff. You've really got to hand it Bruce Willis too; he's 52 but fit as a fiddle and never looks out of place running round and fighting bad guys. He is joined by Justin Long, who is likable as the computer hacker who spends most of the movie running around with Willis, and Timothy Olyphant who is a surprisingly effective lead villain. Overall, so long as you don't go into Die Hard 4 expecting substance, there's no reason why this movie can't be enjoyed by all. Its pure action and entertaining throughout, and you really can't ask for any more than that! Just make sure that you see it in cinema.",8,6,10,9 July 2007
The Producers," An amusing gem that works despite not being hilarious
","I'm not a fan of Mel Brooks. At all. For a comedy director, I find him painfully unfunny and therefore very difficult to like. The Producers is often cited to be Brooks' best film, and for good reason; as it is. Although it never reaches the realms of hilarity, and quite a few of the gags aren't funny in the slightest, it's a breezy little comedy that's based around an amusing idea and is hard to dislike on the whole. The idea is that a Broadway producer can, in theory, make more money from a flop than he could from a hit. When accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) suggests that this could be the case, a plan forms in the mind of once great producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), and we're on course for an amusing ride as the two set out to find the worst play ever written (a drama called 'Springtime for Hitler' eventually wins out), and pull out all the stops to ensure it's a sure-fire Broadway flop! Through a stark colour scheme and overacting from all concerned, Mel Brooks succeeds in creating a distinct comic-book style that lends the film a very comedic, and fun, edge that few films have succeeded in capturing adequately since. The cast helps this film enormously, with everyone giving hammy performances that help in creating the film's sense of fun. Brooks regular Gene Wilder is, of course, the star of the show despite not being the absolute central character. His performance is more subdued than Mostel's, but still very over the top. The play itself features a very tasteless, yet very amusing and catchy opening song that will no doubt be swirling around your head for days afterwards. The play itself is actually the funniest thing about the film, with most of the hilarity coming from the monumental miscasting of an Elvis impersonator-esquire character calling himself 'L.S.D.' (Dick Shawn) in the role of the fuhrer himself.Overall, this is a very fun film. The sense of fun is carried throughout, even if the jokes don't always work. I can almost guarantee a good time from watching this movie and it's one that fans of this sort of film shouldn't go without seeing.",8,35,63,11 January 2005
Final Destination," A good premise is squandered by stupid teen cliché's
","The idea of cheating death, and then having death itself 'chase' you until the only conclusion ensues is a frightening one, and a really great premise for a horror movie. Death is the ultimate unknown and the idea of it being a malicious presence should give way to a classic horror movie. However, anything that should have been good about this movie isn't, and unfortunately it ends up being another teen slasher, just with an invisible killer instead of some goon in a mask. After a relatively decent start, the movie descends into a routine, cliché ridden, teen horror movie with not an interesting character nor a frightening scenario in sight. The story follows a group of teenagers and their teacher (also a teenager) that survive a plane crash after one of them has a premonition and gets himself thrown off the plane. What then follows is a series of over the top death scenes intertwined with a boring 'investigation'.It's a shame that this film is rubbish as the death sequences aren't that bad. We've got one kid being strangled in the bath, another is decapitated by a piece of stray metal while another is mauled by glass from a computer monitor, and later a set of kitchen knives. However, it's all spoilt by the boring characters and silly dialogue (imagine 'death' is after you; would you really 'challenge' it with harsh language?). I'm all against remakes, but this is a premise I'd love to see tackled by a talented group of people. With a good cast, interesting writing and a talented director; this idea could be taken all the way to the realms of the horror classic. Unfortunately, the chances of anyone making a film like that these days is slim because all of these sorts of things have to be done with 'teens' (a.k.a. actors in their early twenties, playing teens) for teens to ensure that the film will sell. Sigh.",5,5,10,9 January 2005
Munich," Simple thriller dressed up in impressive technical details
","It's been eight years now since Steven Spielberg picked up a 'Best Director' Oscar for Saving Private Ryan, and a massive thirteen since he snagged 'Best Picture' with Schindler's List. I'm sure that Spielberg had these things in mind when he decided to take on Munich; as it becomes obvious while viewing this film that so much time has been spent on trying to ensure that everything is professionally done, that Spielberg has forgotten to actually make a film. Munich is about the tragedy at the Munich Olympics, which saw eleven Israeli athletes lose their lives to Arab terrorists. This plot, obviously, is very relevant these days with all the hype surrounding terrorism; and Spielberg has made a film with the central idea being that 'violence breeds violence'. This is an admirable base for any film, especially given the fact that this film follows a plot that is grounded in real events; but in order for the story to carry any weight, the audience really needs to be involved in it. And this is where Munich falls flat on its face.By making the central character a terrorist, Spielberg puts us at the centre of the action. The director tries to make us believe that the lead is a complete character, by showing us scenes where he's blowing people up, as well as sequences with his wife and new born child; but this is far too black and white. Thrillers have got by with far less characterisation, but if you're going to make us believe that your lead is more than a cardboard cut-out, you're going to need to do a better job that that. At its base, the film is a list of assignments that need to be carried out by the Mossad agent at the centre; but these are caught up in far too much waffle, and while the murder sequences themselves are beautifully stylised - tension is stripped from the film by the way that the plot goes from exciting to achingly boring. As mentioned, technically the film has no problems at all. The cinematography is great, as is the direction and Eric Bana, as ever, does an excellent job of leading the film; but like Schindler's List before it, Munich just feels like nothing more than an attempt to win an Oscar. Personally, I'd rather see the award go to 'War of the Worlds'. It might not be as critically friendly, but at least it sees Spielberg doing what he does best.",5,11,16,14 February 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Absolute Horror Classic
","I'm not a big fan of slashers; they tend to be a bit dull and samey, but every now and then an intriguing and interesting one comes out, and A Nightmare on Elm Street is most definitely an intriguing and interesting one. The film revolves around Nancy, a young girl that dreams of a badly scarred madman with knives for fingers and a serious grudge against the children of Elm Street. However, Nancy is not the only one having nightmares and the fun really starts when her friends start turning up dead.Freddy Krueger, the badly scarred madman of the piece would go on to become one of cinema's greatest icons. I even dare say he's up there with the likes of King Kong and The Terminator. In the inferior sequels to this movie, Freddy would go on to become something of a comedian; but here he's every bit the insane madman that slashers would go on to become known for producing. Freddy is brought to the screen by Robert Englund. Robert Englund has managed to get himself something of a cult following for his work on all eight of the Nightmare films, but unfortunately, Freddy is the only 'big' role in his career. The rest of the cast is made up by John Saxon, who also starred in one of the slasher genre's trend setters; Black Christmas, among other films; also appearing is Heather Langenkamp, who would return to the series for part three, and she played herself in the tongue in cheek spin off; New Nightmare, and of course the movie features the introduction of a man that is close to becoming a film legend; Johnny Depp.A Nightmare on Elm Street is directed by Wes Craven; a man that has almost his entire filmography in the horror genre, and has created a number of the genre's milestones along the way; films such as The Hills Have Eyes, his debut The Last House on the Left and the film that brought slashers back; Scream are among his best works, but A Nightmare on Elm Street is the film he will always be remembered most for by the majority of horror fanatics.Unfortunately, the Nightmare franchise isn't as respected now as it could have been, due mostly to the amount of lacklustre sequels it spawned. However, don't let those sequels fool you; the first film is original, inventive, suspenseful and atmospheric, and is without a doubt a classic of the horror genre.",8,1,6,30 July 2004
The Truman Show," Entertaining, funny, thought-provoking....a masterpiece.
","The Truman Show has received quite a lot of praise since it's release in 1998, but it's never really managed to achieve the status that it rightly deserves. What we have here is a film that more than delivers on the entertainment front, while still finding time for a backbone of thought-provoking substance. More often than not with movies that work from a premise, rather than an actual plot, they miss the mark because of a lack of ideas to populate the premise with; but that certainly isn't the case here! The film follows the story of Truman Burbank. Truman is an insurance salesman, but unlike most insurance salesmen; he has his own show. And unlike most people with their own show...he doesn't know about it. Truman Burbank is the unwitting star of the massively successful TV show; The Truman Show. His whole life has been the subject of this show and everything that he believes to be real is actually the brainchild of the show's creator, the flamboyant Christof. We then follow Truman as he goes about finding out that the real world, and his world, are different places entirely.As you might expect, this plot gives the film great basis for thought-provoking ideas. The idea itself of having a TV show filmed around your life is intriguing to say the least, and is more than enough to inspire paranoia from more than a few audience members. The idea is fused with the drama surrounding Truman's life, and the two blend brilliantly. Adding to this is the way that the film gives a commentary on the waive of reality TV shows. The substance is more than evident, as we are shown that Truman is a prisoner within his own life and the TV crew are, in effect, 'God'. The Truman Show features what is probably Jim Carey's best performance. The way that he amiably portrays the character makes the film a delight to watch. Carey was, of course, more known for his over the top (and very good) comedy roles before this film, but here he really shows his worth as an actor. The rest of the cast is mainly made up of lesser-known stars, with Ed Harris standing out and the rest helping to build the film into a great ensemble drama. Before this film, Peter Weir was known for making OK-good films such as Dead Poet's Society and Witness; but this film is his masterpiece.",9,0,0,28 August 2005
The Matrix," Overrated, but still excellent entertainment
","I remember, back in 1999 (or it could have been the start of 2000), when I first saw The Matrix. It was big, bold, loud, exciting...it had guns, bullet time, Rage Against the Machine, plenty of action, a hot woman in a lead role....I remember thinking 'I should like this'. But I didn't. Like Kill Bill, it's hard to believe that a fan of extreme blood and gore like myself could possibly dislike a film that sees one lady pluck out another lady's eye, drop it on the floor and stand on it, but it's true. OK, it's a little easier to believe when you consider that every scene in Kill Bill, apart from that one and the Lucy Lui fight was rubbish, but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at. Fast forward 4 or 5 years to today, and the rewatch. I have a theory that states that any film that I enjoy cannot possibly be bad, because I watch movies for enjoyment (nobody watches movies to be bored) and if a movie fulfils that need for enjoyment, then it has done it's job and therefore it can't be bad. And I enjoyed The Matrix. However, I maintain that it's not a great film. Now, if Pulp fiction has taught us anything; it's that it isn't what you take, it's what you do with it....but by god, the Wachowski Brothers should definitely consider changing their name to the Wachowski BanditsFor a start; the film is Star Wars reincarnated. Keanu Reeves is the one that brings balance to the force, and he even has everyone doubting him for a while(!), Princess Morpheus gets kidnapped and tortured and our hero's must go and save her...him, the bad guys have taken over the galaxy...I mean the world, and there's only a bunch of rebels to save it, they go and see Yoda...I mean the Oracle, who predicts the future and stuff, there's training sequences a la The Empire Strikes Back, Neo must become one with the force, whoops, i mean 'believe', Agent Smith is Neo's father...oh, OK I made that last one up, but you see what I'm getting at.And it's not only Star Wars that the Wachowski Bandits have ripped off, The Terminator and it's sequel aren't safe either. Of course, they couldn't have made Agent Smith actually be liquid metal, as they'd have a lawsuit on their hands, but he is just another version of liquid metal really...isn't he? Shown by the way he can transform from anyone. And what about the whole 'computers take over the world' thing, you didn't think I wouldn't spot that did you? And The Wachowski Bandits obviously aren't fascists, because even shitty movies aren't safe. What about the whole SN thing? The way that the hackers are made to look cool....Hackers anyone? But like I said, it isn't what you take; it's what you do with it. Just like Tarantino did, Bonnie and Clyde...I mean Andy and Larry have stolen all these elements, and mixed them up into one coherent, and trend setting piece of cinema. Also like Tarantino, The Doberman Gang haven't just stolen, they've made some stuff themselves as well. Bullet time, for a start. Of course, it's not much of an expansion on the slow motion in films like The Killer; but still. Also, the idea of the 'matrix' itself is an original one. (unless it's been ripped off a film I haven't seen/heard of)The soundtrack fits too, which is rare when it's mostly rave/heavy rock music. I think there's only Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway that I can think of when it has worked. Anyway, when Rage's 'Wake Up' came on before the credit sequence, it fit very well. Also, the scene during the training with the woman in red and the agent worked well with it's music. In fact, that might even be my favourite scene in the movie. It's cool and it works. In fact, the film does ooze a sense of cool throughout, mostly because of the leather jackets. It's not a complete piece of cinema, however. I don't know if it's built upon in the sequels, but there isn't a lot of emotion in the movie. Sometimes, it doesn't matter, some of the best films of all time are very cold on that front; my top 2, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Evil Dead both are; but then again, they didn't try and be soul searching or have a great depth like The Matrix does. For an example of what I'm talking about; the love between Trinity and Neo. I noticed her saying she is watching him at the start, but other than, the love seemed to be based on the fact that the Oracle said it would happen....so I'm supposed to care? In fact, none of the characters seemed to have any depth, or anything about them at all. What drives them? Why does Morpheus blindly believe that Neo is 'The One'? Why did Neo take the red pill? Is it his character? I don't know.Also of note is the way that people seem to refer to The Matrix as a confusing film. It uses a non-linear style of storytelling (it runs straight, but you don't find everything out all at once), and that's the only confusing thing about it. When you think about it, it's very simple.There isn't a great deal of depth, and the film doesn't pose any real thought-provoking questions either. Of course, there's the central theme; 'it's all an illusion', but what does that mean? Of course, it's not all an illusion really...so what's the message? Don't build too many machines? There is a central question, though, which is 'would you take the blue or the red pill'...and that's not a bad question; but the film, through it's non-linear storytelling and imaginative premise, isn't as deep as it appears to be. Bit like Fight Club really. Of course, the premise in The Matrix does get you thinking in a 'what if...' frame of mind, but so do lots of things, like on British TV show, Kenyan Confronts; when he exposes credit card scams etc...'what if mine was stolen', so does that make Kenyan Confronts a deep and complex masterpiece? (By the way, did anyone think that Lawrence Fishbourne looked stupid during his 'believe' type moments?) Still, like I said; the film is entertaining. The action sequences are stunning and the film looks lovely throughout, so it gets itself high marks for that. It's well paced as well, and unlike a lot of action films; the non-action scenes in The Matrix aren't boring. But that's all; it's like Song 2 ('wuhoo!') or the 'Belly's gonna get you' advert; fun, but not overly brilliant. However, I'm 'down' with fun films, so I'm down with this.",8,5,12,8 December 2004
Casino," Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion
","Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an 'I'm a schmo' away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's 'Go Your Own Way' and The Animals' 'The House of the Rising Sun' are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie 'Heat'. On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow.",7,23,35,3 April 2005
300," History, comic book style!
","It was obvious after the success of Sin City that we were going to see more of Frank Miller's graphic novels adapted for the screen, and someone was obviously impressed enough with Zack Snyder's visuals on the dire Dawn of the Dead remake to give him the directing reigns. I have to say, I'm not the biggest fan of period epics; but I knew that wouldn't be a problem going into this film as Frank Miller obviously has a very over the top style, and as soon as I heard that it's 'very gory', I was sold. I have to say that this film is not as great as Sin City; the visuals aren't as good, the film isn't handled as well and the central plot thread isn't as interesting as Sin City's three narratives; but 300 is still a spectacular piece of cinema. The film focuses on the war between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B.C. A group of 300 Spartans, lead by the fearless King Leonidas, moves in on the advancing Persian army. The warriors are massively outnumbered, but thanks to their impregnable strategy; the few manage to out fight the many for a short time.I haven't read Frank Miller's graphic novel, but I'm guessing that certain sequences were based on it pretty much frame for frame. While this is good in some ways as it allows Snyder to capture the comic book style, in other ways it's very bad as some shots look completely out of place, and make it seem like Snyder doesn't really know what he's doing. There's no problem with post-production, however, as the cinematography is excellent and the way that the fight scenes are shot is good in that it allows them to be completely brutal, while never becoming completely exploitative. I read in British newspaper 'The Sun' that 300 is 'the bloodiest movie in history', which of course isn't the case. There is a lot bloodshed, but it never really FEELS like there's a lot of bloodshed as the atmosphere is completely other-worldly. The way that Snyder uses his actors is good as the impressive Spartans add to the overall look of the film. The two central performances - those coming from Gerard Butler and the beautiful Lena Headey are both impressive, while the largely British support cast impress in their roles. Overall, this isn't a brilliant film as there are a lot of niggles; but it has it's moments, and during the fight scenes (which, thankfully, take up a large proportion of the film), you won't care about 300's shortfalls.",7,9,20,23 March 2007
Cube," `It restores your faith in science fiction to see a movie as original and successful as this'
","Ignore the title, I was being sarcastic.If this were the movie that restores faith in science fiction, I'd hate to have to watch the film that took the faith away. (It was probably The Matrix..)`Six strangers awaken from their daily lives to find themselves trapped in a surreal prison' No, no, no, this is all screwed up. I think what they meant was `Six terrible actors wake up in what looks like a set from a low budget 80's Sci Fi Star Trek wannabe filled with very unimaginative traps and a whole host of other crapness'The whole film takes place in `The cube', that fact gives the film a crappy low budget edge right from the offset. The first scene depicts a man in a room, getting sliced and diced by what looks like a big metal cargo net or something. Sound good? Forget it, I never thought I'd say this but, Resident Evil did the laser scene better. The movie then moves on to the main characters meeting each other, and within about ten minutes another one is on the floor, this time it was an acid thing that burnt his face off. At this point I thought the movie was looking up, I mean 2 deaths in ten minutes? Surely all the rest of them are going to die in shocking and exotic ways..A film such as this is a playground for great set piece death scenes, every room could hold a new secret, a new grizzly and gruesome death, what a wasted opportunity.Which brings me to the script, the word `rubbish' just doesn't do it justice, there are lots of words I could use, mediocre, silly, unbelievable, ridiculous etc but none of them are mean enough. Seriously, we need a new word to describe the script, when you've got characters saying, `look! It's the Renne', you know something is wrong.Now, the Japanese may like films where nothing is explained, but guess what? I don't. Where did the cube come from? Why were those people put in it? Where is it? How come this film sucks so much? So many questions.the characters throw a few theories around, such as `The government built it' `Aliens!' `It was an independent person', `the baddie from a James Bond film made it' (no, I didn't just make that one up) But what does that prove? Nothing.This film tries to be clever, with its underlying `morality' theme, apparently the cube is an extreme of life, being forced to interact with others that you don't necessarily want to interact with in a hostile environment, this is shown by the paranoia the characters fall into due to their situation, well actually one character feels the effects, and he just turns into a stupid lunatic that ends up wasting two potential death scenes. Morality and metaphorical issues? No thanks, lets have a good film instead.Which brings me to the ending, I can imagine the directors sat there now `come on, hurry up, my dinner's nearly ready, just throw anything together and lets get it shipped out!' The ending is a close contender for the worst of all time, up there with The fast and the furious. I mean anti climatic is an understatement, and the only likable character (the maths wiz) got killed and the worst character (the retard) survived! What were they thinking? Well, actually we don't even know if he did survive, as all he did was walk into a big white blur.In short, do yourself a favour and give it a miss. If they had a few more ideas than just spikes and acid, it could have been great. The idea is there, but it suffered from poor execution. This is one film I would like to see remade.",8,1,3,21 October 2003
The Thin Red Line," I Fought My Own War
","The tagline, 'Every man fights his own war' does actually ring true for the people viewing this movie. I fought my own war, against sleep; as this is one hell of a boring movie. It could be said that being boring is to the movie's credit as it is a good way to cure insomnia. Personally, I'd rather have insomnia. Watching this movie to cure insomnia is like cutting off your head to cure a case of acne.The Thin Red Line, in a nutshell; 'War is bad. It affects people personally, and it affects their personal lives'. There is now no need for you to see The Thin Red Line.The Thin Red Line follows the story of a group of people that are supposed to be soldiers. Supposed, being the operative word; as most of these guys would be better placed in an agony aunt column. If they're not moaning about something, they're comforting someone else that's moaning; 'there, there', they say. What?! This is war! Where's Rambo when you need him?! The movie plays out like a children's book; rather than making you think, it just tells you things, 'War is bad', it says, 'each man fights his own war', you are forced to believe. Rather than giving you food for thought so you can come to these conclusions on your own, it just sets them to some sad music; and that is not a masterpiece.The Thin Red Line is unique in that it is one of the few war movies that is actually worse than Saving Private Ryan. At least Saving Private Ryan attempted some character development, had some decent acting and portrayed it's message at least fairly well. None of that can, or will (by me anyway) be said for this movie. The characters are paper thin, some development is attempted by showing you things in the character's personal lives etc, but that's not actual development; that's just lazy background building stuff. The film also plays 'the long card' in order to win itself acclaim. Some people will rate a movie higher if it's long, and that's clearly what the producers of this movie thought, as it clocks in at nearly three hours; most of which is pure drivel.This movie does have one good moment though.... oh wait, I was thinking of something else.This movie is over-long, over-boring and over-rubbish and it should therefore, be avoided by everyone. After I spent three hours on this nonsense; I was annoyed with myself for wasting all that time. I could have seen two movies for the time it took me to watch this one, and as it happens I'd have been hard pressed to find two worse. Overall; NOT recommended.",1,6,21,29 July 2004
Fantastic Four," Entertaining comic book fare...but not much more
","I've never been a fan of comic books (never really read one, to be honest); but I do like a good comic book film. The recent ones have mostly been very good - Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins both being great examples of how well comics can translate to the big screen. Fantastic Four has a reputation for being one of the better comic books - given that it's central quartet are reminiscent of a family structure, and how you get four characters instead of the usual one; but despite all that, this movie just isn't as great as I've come to expect this sort of film to be. Probably the main reason for this is that the film puts the focus almost completely on entertainment value, and so it lacks that dark, foreboding element that has made the likes of Batman and Spider-Man such a joy. Not that comic book films need to be dark - quite the opposite, but we never get a look inside the characters either. The Thing is the one who receives the best handling, but aside from a decent expose of how his affliction affects his personal life, we don't get much of his actual character either.The plot follows a crew of five astronauts who find themselves in the centre of a radiation cloud during a botched mission, and upon return to Earth, find that the radiation has altered their DNA. Four of the five decide to use their power for good, while the fifth goes the other way. The Fantastic Four comprises of The Human Torch; with fire as his power, The Invisible Girl (goes without saying), the rubbery Mr Fantastic and the unfortunate member of the gang - the monstrous 'Thing', who gains great strength to compliment his ugly form. On the whole, I would say that the cast is too young. Michael Chiklis is well cast as The Thing, but Mr Fantastic, for example, could have done with an older actor, who would have brought out his leadership qualities better. The villain, Victor Von Doom is the biggest casting mistake. Julian McMahon, the actor in said role, does look sufficiently menacing - but an older man would have made a far more convincing villain. I noticed that Tim Robbins was considered for the role - I would like to have seen that. The fact that all five of the lead roles have gone to young men and a woman just stinks of a ploy to get more teenagers into the cinema. Anyway, this film is entertaining enough; and I certainly don't dislike it - but unlike some of the better comic book films; entertainment is all Fantastic Four is.",6,3,7,6 December 2005
Jackie Brown," Tarantino does what Tarantino does best
","Quentin Tarantino's third feature isn't generally as highly rated among fans as his previous two. Many non-Tarantino fans say that Tarantino fans don't like this film because it's central character is a woman, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's simply not as good. Jackie Brown lacks the bite and dynamic genius that epitomised Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and instead of having a profound influence on cinema, Jackie Brown is more of a continuation of what Tarantino started with his first two features. I am neither a fan nor a hater of Tarantino; up until the Kill Bill travesty, I was a fan; but now I'm not so sure. However, this was made in a time when Tarantino was still cool, and 'cool' is something this movie definitely is. The coolness comes from Tarantino's quick-fire script, relaxed character mannerisms and old style soundtrack. The coolness doesn't do the film any favours whatsoever on the realism, or credibility front, but when you're watching Jackie Brown, you know you're watching a movie; so just sit back, relax and have fun, as Tarantino takes you on a tour of what he loves about cinema.In technical terms, Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's finest hour. This is the most intelligent and mature script he ever wrote (the fact that it was based on someone else's work not withstanding). This is also the film that he reached his directorial peak. Tarantino is good at making cool crime films; he proved it with his first two features, and this film goes a long way to proving it more. Typically, it's a long way from perfect; it's overlong (an interesting prelude to Kill Bill, which was about 2 hours overlong), the character development is cringe-worthy at times and the story gets muddled a little towards the middle; but the good outweighs the bad, and when you've got the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro chewing fat over a 'Chicks with Guns' video, you're unlikely to care about the film's problems. As usual, Tarantino razzle-dazzles his audience with his trademark 'great' cast (which really is great by the way) and a soundtrack comprised of songs that used to be hip (and now are again, strangely) and this helps to mask the film's problems also.All in all, Jackie Brown is a lot of fun. Audiences the world over should gather round and thank Tarantino for making this film. This is the sort of film that allows you to lose yourself for a couple of hours and just absorb what you see on screen. Quentin Tarantino may not be the greatest director of all time, but he knows how to entertain and this film is immense in that department. Here's to hoping Tarantino returns to projects he can handle in the near future...",8,1,5,10 January 2005
Aladdin," A massive highlight for Disney
","To be honest, even as a kid I didn't really like Disney films all that much - but there was one exception to that rule; and that was Aladdin. Maybe it was the characters, maybe it was the plot, or maybe it was simply the massive amount of fun that the film is; but something clicked then. And, upon seeing the film again as an adult; I can say that, despite the bar being raised for animation by the likes of Toy Story, Aladdin has lost none of what made it great upon release  and the fact that I enjoyed this film as much as my younger sister shows that Aladdin is fun for all ages. Because of the fact that animation has largely moved to 3D, there doesn't seem to be a lot of classic animation about; and that's a shame if you ask me, because I'd rather watch animation like this. The plot is, of course, based upon the classic story of 'Aladdin'; only it's been spruced up by all of the classic Disney elements. The characters are all overdone, there are lots of songs and there's lots of humour; but the classic yarn about a street urchin happening upon a magic genie lamp remains intact.Critics raved about how well done the characters in Finding Nemo were, but Disney's best characters can be seen in this film. It's amazing how well thought-out they are, and while their motivations are mostly simple - all of the characters behave as you would expect them to do, and it's easy to get carried along with the emotional ride as well as enjoying all the songs and stuff. Speaking of the songs - they definitely give the movie most of it's highlights. I'm not a fan of musicals, but the songs here are extremely catchy and the images put in with them make the film memorable. I hadn't seen this flick for around eight years, but I still knew what was coming in most scenes just because the movie is so memorable. Of all the classic yarns, Aladdin is definitely one of; if not the, best as it has everything; lust for power, rags to riches, a romance, magic and more. The way that it's told will mean that younger children will enjoy it without bothering with the story, while the themes carry Aladdin through into a movie that can be enjoyed by older kids and adults. As mentioned, I don't like Disney much; but I make an exception for this film.",7,1,1,6 November 2005
Sin City," An absolutely amazing experience
","The first thing you will notice about Robert Rodriguez's violent comic book crime masterpiece is the outstanding visual style. While many comic book movies are happy to simply take the story from their source material and turn it into a film, Rodriguez has gone further and took both the story and the comic book's own style, and the result is a movie that really feels like a comic book brought to life. The way the action quickly jumps from one scene to another, the over the top dialogue and, most importantly, Frank Miller's use of colour, are all there; and all in all, Sin City has raised the bar for comic book movies. Sin City is very positive for cinema on the whole, as it proves that there's still some originality left, and it also shows that if used properly, computer generated environments definitely can compliment a film and, in this case, even make it what it is. I had designs on what I thought the movie would be like before viewing it, but even so; after the first scene, which is completely in black and white except for the red on the dame's lipstick and dress, completely took me by surprise and throughout the movie you cant help but marvel at the unique visual treat that is being put before you.Robert Rodriguez is a man that often loses out in the credibility department to his more popular friend (and special guest director on this production) Quentin Tarantino, and this is unfair in my opinion. Let's not forget that Rodriguez is the man that made El Mariachi for a mere $7000, and made it GOOD. The rest of the Desperado trilogy showed that Rodriguez has a real flair for comic book style action, and all in all I don't think there could have been a better man for the director's chair on Sin City. Rodriguez has applied his trademark of rounding up a host of popular stars to this film as well, and simply put; this film could not have been better cast. Mickey Rourke is the standout as the brute Marv, and he gives an amazing performance in that role. The way he commands the screen is great and his ugliness compliments the role excellently. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen are the other two lead men, and while Willis doesn't quite look old enough to be playing a 68-year-old copper; both of them do well in their roles also. Jessica Alba is scintillating as the very sexy Nancy Callahan, and the guys will be pleased to know that Sin City features a plethora of scantily clad women! The film is split up into three stories, each based on a different Frank Miller book. Mickey Rourke's section of the film is the best, with lots of torture sequences and a beautiful dame at it's centre. Clive Owen's story is a treat for the eyes, as we enter 'old town'; a part of Sin City run by a load of prostitutes. And finally, Bruce Willis' story sees him on the trail of a child molester who he 'disarmed' years earlier. This tale is the creepiest of the bunch, and that story's central character, 'The Yellow Bastard', is a masterpiece of scum and villainy. The entire movie plays out like a film noir from the height of the era; only the comic book style gives it an extra ounce of muscle, and describing this film as 'film noir on steroids' wouldn't be a misplaced description. The melodramatic acting and dialogue help the film to capture the 50's style, and it's a treat for a fan of those sorts of films, such as myself, to see a modern day take on it. Overall, Sin City is one of the best films to come out this millennium. It's visual style is superb and this, when mixed with some invigorating stories and a fantastic cast, make Sin City a winner all the way.",8,2,5,3 June 2005
The Breakfast Club," A product of the 80's
","Often regarded as something of a minor 80's classic, The Breakfast Club still stands up today as a decent, and fun drama. The Breakfast Club tells a simple story of five kids at high school being put into detention. The premise is simple, but it's what's behind the premise that's more important to the film as we learn about the different characters. This film will always be remembered for it's casting of 'the brat pack' over it's portrayal of teenagers coming of age, but that's not to say that it's deeper side should be ignored. The way that the characters are presented initially is very much two dimensional - with them all fitting into set teen groups. We've got a nerd, a prom queen, a tearaway, a 'jock' and a basket case and it all seems very convenient that five such different people should end up in detention together. However, this is how the film portrays it's point, as it shows that the kids are more similar than their exteriors would suggest, and that is explored through their innermost hopes and fears; which is actually done quite well.The film cuts music (mainly 80's style heavy metal) into the drama, which works at times but at other times is extremely annoying. It can be hip and cool, but it also becomes annoying fast and this isn't good when you're trying to watch a low concept movie that relies on it's dialogue and characters rather than any kind of razzle-dazzle. The acting in the movie is a mixed bag, with different actors being really realistic at times, and then really out of place at other times. Emilo Estivez trying to make himself look hard being a case for the latter. The film does feature many extremely unlikely occurrences, such as our protagonists smoking illegal substances in a school library, and one of them making a trek through the school roof; but the script always keeps it afloat and it's kept interesting by the way that the characters are varied and different to one another. After what the film has been building for it's duration, it fitters out with a damp squib ending that appears to be tacked on just to make the audience feel good and it's a real shame. Still, up until the ending the movie is a lot of fun so I still give it a thumbs up.",6,1,6,23 February 2005
Donnie Darko," A surrealist and very original cult gem that is not to be missed!
","Donnie Darko is one stylish movie, but unlike many stylish films; this one's greatness is certainly not at all down to superficiality. The plot and script of this movie are both superb examples of great film-making. Drama, comedy, Sci Fi, Horror and romance are all present in this movie, and the comedy in particular is especially prominent in the early stages. I was laughing out loud at some parts including Donnie's little disagreement with the local celebrity, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and the meeting between Donnie's parents and Donnie's English teacher over the incident of him telling her to 'shove the book up her anus', as she put it. Donnie Darko revolves around it's title character, who is portrayed brilliantly by up and coming young actor; Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake plays a disturbed teenager who is visited by a rabbit suit wearing 'being' from an unknown origin, who tells him that the world will come to an end in 28 days. The film follows the classic coming of age story and shows the young man becoming understanding of the world around him. However, this is not your average tale of coming of age, far from it in fact; as this dark and surreal film stands apart from just about every other coming of age story in existence by way of it's interwoven themes of Space, time and morality.Set in 1988, newcomer Richard Kelly consciously blends a blissful eighties style with a great soundtrack of tunes from the era, and even finds time to show my favourite horror film of all time; the classic zombie flick, 'The Evil Dead'. Kelly's film is a strange yet compelling masterpiece, which puts him up there with surrealist David Lynch in terms of strangeness. I hope that this isn't Kelly's last offering as it would be a shame because he definitely has what it takes to make a film with not a lot of promise in its premise become a masterpiece. The cast, with the exceptions of Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore, is made up of relatively unknown actors, which is a surprise, as all the acting is great and all the characters are put across surprisingly well. Jake Gyllenhaal in particular is brilliant as Donnie Darko, portraying his character powerfully and believably. The rather sexy Jena Malone, another Hollywood unknown, also does very well, in the lead female role of Gretchen. Also of note in the movie is Jake's sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who takes the role of his on-screen sister also.Donnie Darko became an almost instant cult hit on release, and for some reason that has also gained it a rather unflattering reputation. This is unfair, as although the movie is now very much in the public domain, has been seen by everyone and isn't that little cult gem that it used to be; it has lost none of it's originality or power (and why would it?) in it's transition from small indie film to massive popular hit. The final song played on this movie is Tears for Fear cover; a lovely piece by Gary Jules entitled, of course called 'Mad World'. This song is a great way to end the movie as not only is it a great song, but it seems to have the power to pull the whole thing together through it's heartfelt deliverance of some very touching lyrics. Ignore the people that lambaste it's popularity; Donnie Darko is a masterpiece.",8,2,9,21 October 2003
The Wedding Singer," Great entertainment with a lot of heart
","A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies. Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film; laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema, but they're good fun, and therefore get a thumbs up from me. The Wedding Singer, however, gets not one thumb up; but both thumbs, firmly, up. So, why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre? Is it the jokes? The beautiful female lead? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs? No, it's that this movie has a lot of heart; that's what makes it a winner.Adam Sandler stars as the quintessential 'loser'. He's a wedding singer, and not a very good one either. He specialises in doing terrible covers of 80's songs. It's not the sort of act that I would want at my wedding. His life gets worse one day, his wedding day, to be exact, when someone doesn't turn up. The bride, that is. Now in a deep spiral of depression, our hero doesn't see any way forward. His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him; even his newfound friend, the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married. And to a man who doesn't deserve her, I might add. I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next, but even though it's a predictable ride; trust me, it's a ride you want to be on. Adam Sandler tends to be a very annoying actor; and for that reason he is almost universally disliked, but it is undeniable that he is good in this movie. Nobody else could have given the character what Sandler gave him; his performance is both entertaining and believable, and therefore is just right for the movie. Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast. She is the perfect girl in this movie; all smiles and sunshine, and it's impossible not to fall in love with her. The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi, who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start.As mentioned; The Wedding Singer has a lot of heart. From the way that the characters interact with each other, particularly Sandler and Barrymore, it is obvious that they are in love. The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a 'Fonz' type, womanising character. The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one; the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with; it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer, all that matters is the love between two people. The movie says that love is all you need; and that is a worthwhile message in any movie. The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other, more serious movies with a similar message.Overall, The Wedding Singer is at the very top of the romantic comedy genre. It will make you laugh, and you will ultimately feel for the characters. The fact that this movie has something to say is only another reason to recommend it; especially as it says it with a great big smile on it's face. The Wedding Singer is not a film that you will want to miss; it's feel-good at it's best.",7,47,63,23 September 2004
Back to the Future," The quintessential eighties time capsule
","Back to the Future is the quintessential eighties movie. It's over the top, kitschy, silly and lots of fun; pretty much what eighties movie making was all about. However, despite being an eighties time capsule; this movie is still well received to this day and will continue to be fun for cinema audiences for generations to come. The reason? Because in spite of being a predominantly fun flick; Back to the Future is a complete piece of cinema. It has it's heart in the right place, it's very funny, it draws themes and parallels from how times have changed, it has interesting characters that you can feel for and it's a lot of fun. Back to the Future is a masterpiece in it's field for all these reasons. We follow Marty McFly; a young slacker who is good friends with a genius inventor, Doc Brown. The fun starts when Dr Brown invents a time machine from a Delorian automobile and after certain events transpire, Marty finds himself in 1955...with his parents as teenagers and without any means to get back to 1985.The idea of going back in time and meeting your parents when they were young is an intriguing one for sure, and this film makes best use of that fascinating (not to mention hilarious) idea, as Marty finds himself the object of his mother's affections. This sort of premise writes itself, and it's so delicious that there's no way it can fail, and fail is anything but what it does. This situation that the movie creates proves itself to be constantly entertaining and the film draws most of it's jokes and parodies from it. The film also details how the things we do can have massive repercussions on our future; but again, it does it with a huge smile on it's face. I'm a big believer that movies don't have to be entirely serious to have a point, and this movie proves that. Also of note is the way that Back to the Future draws parallels between how things were, and how they have changed. It's just little things, like the way Doc Brown confusingly asks if there's a gravity problem in the future after Marty's continual references to events being 'heavy'.Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly and does a great job with it. This actor was born to play this role; he completely looks and acts the part that you would expect this character to be, and for that reason; he is one of the finest casting choices of all time. Just like the Delorian motor company, Fox never got another good gig after this film, which is an ode to how well cast he was. Also like Fox, Christopher Lloyd's role in this film was the making - and the ending - of his career. He is so magnificent and so well fit to the role of the Doc that it's hard to imagine him doing any other type of role. It's a shame for him, but a treat for the audience. Further great castings include Crispin Glover as Marty's dad, George and Lea Thompson, who is all smiles and sweetness as his not bad looking at all, mother.Back to the Future is, if you'll excuse the pun, a timeless classic. It is fit to be enjoyed by people of all ages and generations, and the fact that it's very much an eighties movie never gets in it's way.",9,2,3,23 December 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," More of the same, but it's welcome
","The Bourne Identity was one of those films that some people will love for being different to the average action film, but others will hate for it daring to be 'too' different. Unlike the majority of action movies before it, the first Bourne film, despite having stunts and explosions never put it's emphasis on them, as the focus was always on the central characters and their use of brains, rather than brawn to accomplish their goals. The sequel is basically more of the same, but it's a welcome return in my opinion, as cinema needs films that are different to the majority. It's also a good thing as I'm a big fan of Matt Damon. It's unfair that he should continue to get lumped in with Ben Afleck due to their friendship as he has a lot of talent and I think that the fact he's gone for more art orientated films as opposed to the dumb blockbusters his friend was drawn to like a moth to the light shows that he has a genuine respect for cinema. He stars as the title character; Jason Bourne, who, like the film itself is hardly your average action fare. He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a bad point as it can, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it difficult viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist-fights, explosions and a great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.Overall, I would say that this is a slightly lesser film than the original, but there is still much to like about it and fans of Bourne will no doubt enjoy themselves. It's also recommended if you're sure that every action movie since 1988 is a Die Hard clone...",8,154,211,27 December 2004
The Birds," Seaside gulls go mental in Hitchcock's macabre masterpiece!
","Despite spending most of his career within the realms of the thriller genre, Alfred Hitchcock hasn't restricted himself where variation is concerned. Most of his best work represents a different type of thriller, and The Birds is no different. It is often said that Psycho is Hitchcock's first foray into the horror side of the thriller, and it is indeed; but it's not the complete horror film that The Birds is. Often cited as an obvious influence for Night of the Living Dead, The Birds follows Melanie Daniels as she travels to the seaside town of Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds for Mitch Brenner, an eligible bachelor that she met in a pet shop in San Francisco. However, while there the birds of the coastal town begin to attack the residents and so begins a terrifying tale of man's feathered friends waging a war against humanity...It could be said that the plot of The Birds is ridiculous, and it is. The idea of birds, a type of animal that isn't aggressive, attacking humans despite living with us for millions of years is preposterous and is never likely to happen. However; it is here where the film's horror potency lies. Birds live with us in harmony; we're so used to them that for the most part we don't even realise that they're there, and the idea of something that we don't notice suddenly becoming malicious is truly terrifying. Especially when that something is unstoppable, as the birds are portrayed as being in this film. The fact that the birds' motive is never really explained only serves in making it more terrifying, as it would appear that somewhere along the line they've just decided to attack. Of course, the film could be interpreted as having Melanie's arrival, or the presence of the lovebirds as the cause for it all; but we don't really know. This bounds the film in reality as if there was a reason given, it might be improbable; but there's no true reason given (although there are several theories), so it can't be improbable! The first forty minutes of the film feature hardly any - if any - horror at all. Hitchcock spends this part of the movie developing the characters and installing their situation in the viewers' minds, so that when the horror does finally come along, it has a definite potency that it would not have had otherwise. In fact, at first the birds themselves come across as a co-star in their own movie as there are brief references towards them, but they never get their full dues. However, once the horror does start, it comes thick and fast. Hitchcock, the master craftsman as always, uses his famous montage effects and never really shows you anything; but because you're being bombarded with so many different shots, you'd never realise it. Many people have tried to copy this technique, but most have failed. Hitchcock, however, has it down to an art and this is maybe the film that shows off that talent the best. There are numerous moments of suspense as well, many of which are truly nail biting. We see the birds amassing and ready to strike - but they don't. And this is much more frightening than showing an attack from the off. Hitchcock knows this. The final thirty minutes of The Birds is perhaps the most thrilling of his entire oeuvre. First, Hitchcock gives us an intriguing situation where numerous inhabitants of the town give their views on the events, and also explains the birds' situation with humans, even giving the audience an angle of expertise from an ornithologist's point of view. He then follows it up with a truly breathtaking sequence of horror that hasn't been matched since for relentless shock value.Hitchcock has made many great films, and this certainly stands up as one of them. Here, Hitchcock gives a lesson in film directing and creates a truly macabre piece of work in the process. I dread to think what the state of cinema would have been if Hitchcock had never picked up a camera, but luckily for us; he most certainly did.",9,184,313,29 December 2004
Cinderella Man," Hard-hitting boxing, and sentiment that works!
","Ron Howard has made a name for himself for directing dull, politically correct Academy award favourites; and it is with that in mind that I decided that I didn't want to see this film. But I'm glad I changed my mind! Cinderella Man is more than just a follow-up to Clint Eastwood boxing success with 'Million Dollar Baby', and reunites the 'Best Picture winning team of Russell Crowe and Ron Howard, for the story of depression era boxer, Jim J. Braddock. Braddock was more than just a boxer in his time; he became the hope of the United States for the working class; so you've got to expect a lot of sentiment from this film. But, that is where Cinderella Man stands out; both from other films in it's class, and the rest of Howard's oeuvre - there is sentiment here, but it's not of the 'fake' kind - Howard builds it up excellently. By keeping the focus on the main character, the director is able to explore both the central figure and the era in which the film is set; and after showing the audience Braddock's first fight, and the situation that he and his family have found themselves in; it really is impossible not to only feel for this man, but get behind him as he tries to fight his way to the World Heavyweight Title.I don't profess to be the biggest fan of Russell Crowe, but you can always count on a strong lead performance from him, and that is what he delivers in this film. His acting here isn't great; but he portrays the right image that you would associate with his character, and his in-ring performance massively outweighs his performance outside of it. The fights in Cinderella Man are well choreographed, and thanks to some excellent first person cinematography; are always exciting, and it really feels like the boxers are actually being hurt! The support cast isn't bad, and it's Paul Giamatti who stands out the most there. His Oscar nomination seems more to be compensation for the film not receiving a 'Best Picture' nomination than anything; but as I say, he's not bad. Renee Zellweger is the weak link for me; I haven't been impressed with her so far, and her role here doesn't even give her a chance to change that. This film could be classified as 'predictable', but it wasn't for me as I've never heard of Jim Braddock, and therefore don't know the results of his fights; meaning that anything could have happened. Overall; I dint rate this as the best film of the year, but it is a milestone for its director. It's taken him a while, but Ron Howard has finally directed a great film.",8,1,3,1 February 2006
Jurassic Park," Not always great....but very entertaining monster movie!
","Like most kids back in 1993, I couldn't wait to see Jurassic Park. The fact that I was already interested in Dinosaurs made the film even more of a holy grail. Jurassic Park was the film that dreams were made of for yours truly, and despite my massively over-inflated expectations - the film really DID deliver. I saw it in cinema several times, and, at the time, couldn't ever see anything topping Jurassic Park. Of course, this was just the simple view of a child and, having seen many other films by now, as well as several subsequent viewings of this one; it's clear that this isn't the film that I once thought it was. But don't get me wrong - the fact that I now understand that films do indeed get better than this don't mean that Jurassic Park isn't a brilliantly well sculpted piece of entertainment. The plot is taken from the Michael Crichton book of the same title, and follows a new theme park, where the attractions are Dinosaurs. We follow a group made up of palaeontologists, other experts and the owner's children as they visit the park. Naturally, everything goes wrong and the lot of them are thrust into the world of the dinosaurs! Steven Spielberg can win a million Oscars for Schindler's List, but it doesn't change the fact that entertainment is his forte when it comes to film-making. The debate as to whether or not he's a great director can rage, but he definitely does know how to entertain if nothing else - and he shows that brilliantly with this film. The build up to the main action can be a little dull at times, but you're always on the edge of your seat due to the fact that you know it's not going to be all rosy. The film really comes together in the scene that sees the 'king' of the dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus Rex break free from it's cage. This scene is incredibly well directed - so much so that the rest of the movie never comes close to outdoing it. Spielberg tends to cast his movies with likable actors, and he's done that here. This does make the movie easy to like, but the resoundingly 'good' characters are often as flat as something that the T-Rex has stood on, and that doesn't do the movie any favours. I'm a big hater of CGI - except when it's done well, and I've got to say that it largely is here. Some scenes look very fake indeed, but the monster effects give it an old-school monster flick feel, and to be honest I'm glad that not all the dinosaurs look absolutely great. On the whole - this wont impress the people looking for great acting and the like; but Jurassic Park really is a first rate thriller, and if you like your films to be fun - you'll like Jurassic Park.",7,3,6,24 October 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Not The Simpsons at their best, but still an entertaining comedy.
","Obviously the big fear with this film was that it wasn't going to be as good as the TV shows; and while I wouldn't say that this movie is The Simpsons at their very best, the movie does give many of the episodes a run for their money and it certainly is very funny overall. Another fear for this film was that it might not make the transition from small screen to big screen in a way that feels right; and while this is hard for the movie to get over since we're all so used to seeing them on the small screen, and I cant really say that it particularly 'feels' like a movie; I cant make that too much of a criticism since I enjoyed the movie on the whole. Given more of a running time, you would expect a plot that is 'bigger' than the average episode's plot and it is. There's the usual Simpsons trick of first featuring a seemingly irrelevant plot, but soon it becomes clear that the plot is focused on Lake Springfield, which gets cleaned up before Homer decides to dump a load of waste in there; leading the Government to take the drastic action of having Springfield encased in a giant dome, and having the locals take it out on the Simpson family...As is often the case with the show, the jokes here are varied and so personally I wasn't laughing all the way through, though the movie does feature something for everyone, which is a plus. There's no real point in talking about the voices or the animation; all of which are just what everyone is used to. The film maybe does try to be a little too expansive; obviously the Simpsons creators wanted to go for a big blockbuster sort of feel, but personally I would have preferred a 'smaller' story such as the one featured in the classic dual episode 'Who Shot Mr Burns'. I can remember the moment I really decided I wanted to see this film; it was shortly after seeing the trailer, which featured the supremely silly 'Spiderpig' song as sung by Homer. This is a brilliant little gag, and definitely the funniest thing in the film for me. The film does try and bring all of the Simpson family into the plot; though as it often the case with the episodes, it's really Homer and Bart that are the main stars (being the most interesting characters) and that is OK with me. Overall, I wouldn't rank this as a big favourite were it an episode; but The Simpsons Movie certainly works well as a comedy and I'm glad the yellow-skinned family have finally reached the big screen.",8,1,2,18 December 2007
Dodgeball," Makes for an entertaining hour and a half
","Films starring Ben Stiller tend to be funny, and that's what this is. You cant go into a film like Dodgeball expecting much more than a good time and a few laughs - so the fact that it's no masterpiece won't disappoint, and the fact that it delivers exactly what you want it to ensures this further. Dodgeball is at least somewhat original because it follows a sport that (to my knowledge) hasn't been done before, or at least not recently. Prior to seeing this movie, I had seen Dodgeball being played 'professionally', and it's easy to see why the filmmakers here decided to base this comedy on that sport. It isn't quite as ridiculous in real life as it's portrayed as being here, but seriously - it's not all that far off. The film follows two rival gyms - the huge Globo Gym, and the small-scale local gym - Average Joe's. Joe's is owned by Vince Vaughn, who finds himself in trouble with the bank when it turns out he hasn't been paying his bills. He owes $50,000, and after his friends' idea to wash cars fails miserably, they find that the only way to pay off the bank and keep the gym open is to enter a dodgeball competition, which has a first prize of $50,000 (mere coincidence). However, the owner of Globotech wants Average Joe's for himself...and enters the competition to make sure that happens.I'm not exactly Ben Stiller's biggest fan, but it's impossible to deny that he has a talent for comedy. He's shown in his recent films that he has a great range - from the very straight Starsky, to his average kind of role in Meet the Parents; all the way to his role here, which sees him as the maniacal fitness freak turned dodgeball player. He stars along with Vince Vaughn and wife, Christine Taylor. Vaughn has shown his comedy talent a lot recently, and even though his role here is merely as an average kind of guy; he does it well. Stiller's wife definitely is hot - I don't like blonde's as a rule, but every man who doesn't would have to make an exception here. She steals all of her scenes. Many of the jokes come as a result of Stiller's over the top character, and the general silliness of the game; dodgeball. It doesn't take a highly trained eye to notice that this is Ben Stiller's film - and it's him that you're going to remember most after seeing this film, and that is testament to his comical abilities. Some of the humour is a bit grating and doesn't really work (like the awkward romance between some ugly woman and a dorky kid), but on the whole - this is suitably silly, and is sure to sufficiently entertain most people.",6,2,5,6 December 2005
High Fidelity," Top five romantic comedies of this decade so far - number 1...High Fidelity
","Stephen Frears' analysis of one man's love life is a very personal tale of love, told by our hero; Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Despite being predominantly a tale about a love life, High Fidelity also finds time to be a very hip musical study, as well as integrating a fistful of hilarious lines and sequences. As mentioned, the film pans out from the perspective of Rob Gordon; an insecure young man that cant hold a relationship down and so embarks on a personal voyage of discovery to find out why he's doomed to be left. What follows is a journey through Gordon's 'top 5' break-up's, and present insecurities and through this a complete three dimensional portrait of the character is painted in front of the audience's eyes. The way the story is presented is dynamic and makes the film easy to like. Of course, the fact that it's carried by the charismatic John Cusack and features the awesome comedy talents of Jack Black doesn't exactly do it any harm eitherÂ… This film is a very different take on the classic romantic comedy as the humour is very potent, much more so than the easy humour that the genre usually leaves us with. The music in the film is mostly of the indie pop persuasion, but despite this; it gives it a distinct sense of cool, and puts the film at the 'cutting edge', so to speak. The film is excellently cast, but I don't think there is another actor in existence that could have played Rob Gordon like John Cusack does. He's believable in the role because he's good looking, but he also has that sort of self loathing atmosphere about himself, which is put to good use in this movie. Cusack has spent far too much time in the romantic comedy genre and it's a shame because his talents could be used well elsewhere, but here he makes the film his own and this is definitely one romantic comedy that I'm glad he did make.High Fidelity is a rare thing; a romantic comedy that is original, hilarious and quite touching all in one go. Rom-com's like this don't come around often and this is one that you will not want to miss!",10,3,6,10 January 2005
V for Vendetta," Loud, Brash and Disappointing
","I can't say I've ever heard of the graphic novel by Alan Moore, but I hear he wasn't too pleased with this cinematic vision of his work. I cant say I was too overly impressed with it either; I saw it mainly because Natalie Portman thought the project was good enough to shave her head for, and even though the last two films by the Wachowski Brothers weren't very good, the first Matrix film made it obvious that they have a flair for action sequences. The plot is based on numerous ideas, all of which focus on government. V for Vendetta is supposedly a commentary on Thatcher's Britain, and this is mixed in with ideas stemming from Guy Fawke's plot to blow up the houses of parliament, and a revolution against the Government. The ideas are mostly very good; but there's too many of them, and many of the themes get lost in a convoluted plot that mainly sees a masked marauder calling himself 'V' picking off various members of government, while finding time to plant bombs and share a tentative near romance with the angelic Evey, played by the very talented Natalie Portman.The film constantly nods towards more intelligent work, such as plays by William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 'Faust', and this serves to remind the audience of the shortcomings in this work. It has to be said that the technical work on the film is very good; the dark and brooding atmosphere works very well when coupled with the doomed vision of London. It would seem that The Wachowski's couldn't be bothered to direct their own screenplay, so that honour falls to James McTeigue, otherwise known as the first assistant director on The Matrix Trilogy. His direction is largely pretty good - he has an eye for aesthetics, and constantly makes use of the dark locations and many of the characters' dark clothing. The masked central character makes for a memorable anti-hero; but his spectre does look a bit silly, and seeing him constantly deliver convoluted dialogue in the style of 'The Oracle' soon wears thin. Natalie Portman looks stunning as always; even when she loses her luscious locks. The action is loud, brash and entertaining; and this provides the film with its biggest strong point, but it tries to be too clever and often ends up looking silly, as the plot is never deep or engaging enough for all the elements to really shine through. A shame; with the right handling, this could have been great.",7,6,12,22 March 2006
The Island," Flawed, but nice Sci-Fi thriller
","Michael Bay is well known for his in your face action thrillers, and so it came as something of a surprise to see him direct something like this. The Island is a Sci-Fi thriller that takes influence from the likes of THX-1138 and works more on it's ideas and themes than Bay's trademark action sequences. The film starts off in a Utopian facility where we meet Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGreggor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), along with a load of other people dressed in white. The people of this facility have been told that a contagious virus has wiped out the population of Earth and they are the only remaining people. The only thing that keeps them going is the promise that 'lottery' winners get to go to a serene paradise known as 'the island'. Lincoln Six Echo smells a rat, however, and after finding out that the facility is really a place where clones of rich people are kept for spare parts, he takes Jordan Two Delta and escapes into the wider world (of many advertisements...) to look for the man he's a clone of, and hope to stay alive.Once we leave the Utopian facility, the film pretty much follows a standard chase formula, and this is obviously where Michael Bay is much more at home. Cars get smashed and people are dropped from the top of skyscrapers, and it's only then that you know you're in a Michael Bay movie. Usually Bay's daft action gets annoying quickly, but it's OK here because at least it has something behind it. While the action sequences are pretty hollow in terms of emotion; it adds a further level of enjoyment to a movie that has already tested your brain by that point. The cast is really good, with the two leads doing their jobs well and being supported excellently. Steve Buscemi is an actor that needs to be seen more, and his performance is nice; albeit too small. The real standout among the support cast is Djimon Hounsou. He has an incredible style, and it's obvious that Michael Bay thinks so too with all the close up's we're treated to. The Island isn't without it's problems  the music is out of place most of the time, there's an extremely out of place sex scene and the film goes on a bit towards the end, as it could do with being about twenty minutes shorter; but on the whole, this is an enjoyable flick that will entertain and get you thinking. For once, Michael Bay has made something worth seeing.",7,1,4,14 August 2005
