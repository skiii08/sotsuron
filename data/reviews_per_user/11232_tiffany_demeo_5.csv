Casablanca," Casablanca
","When I first started to watch this film I was trying to get into it and really understand what was going on. As the movie went on I started to get lost and confused and couldn't really follow what was going on. I would defiantly want to watch the movie again because I think I would get more out of it. What I could follow was the love triangle that was going on, I thought that was interesting how Ilsa was running back and forth between then men. I thought the setting of the restaurant 'Casablanca' was really pretty and I felt like I would want to go to that place. It had a really elegant feel to it with a little upbeat twist. For myself I would defiantly have to watch this movie over to understand it better and get the whole feel of it again.",5,2,4,24 October 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
","The movie 'The Grapes of Wrath' was a very real film to me. The Joad family was kicked off their land and had no place to go. The characters all showed their emotions very well and their actions were so believable. You could really understand how the people of that era felt since it was happening to many families. The lighting of the film was very good, when it was dark in the house and the camera was just on his face in the beginning was very realistic.For me, as I was watching this film all I could think about was the fact that this actually was happening back then to many land owners. This film was very dramatic and I felt bad for their family. They left everything they had in Oklahoma and had a difficult ride to California where there was suppose to be work. When they found work and earned very a little a day you could see the disappointment in their eyes. Every scene was so believable and really captured your attention for what it was like in that era.",7,0,1,18 October 2010
The Graduate," The Graduate
","The Graduate was an excellent movie. I was very into it and couldn't keep my eyes of the screen. This is the first movie we have watched in our class that has been in color and to me makes a complete difference in the movie. Dustin Hoffman was one of my favorite characters, he did an excellent job playing Ben, he really played the role so well you actually believed it was really him and those were his own actions. Mrs. Robinson also was another top character of mine, she was funny in a serious way and you could tell a lot about her through her actions. Ben's parents were also hilarious and kept the movie with a little funny twist. The movie to me has a meaning, what goes around, comes around. Thats normally what happens in life anyways. I would so recommend this movie and I think everyone should watch it.",10,1,1,1 December 2010
Psycho," Psycho
","Psycho is considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and after seeing it, I agree! Every part of this movie was just amazing to me. I was always used to seeing the horror films of today, and after seeing this, nothing compares.The score of the movie was the best that it could be and is simply amazing. All the music fit the scenes seamlessly and in modern times, it is considered one of the greatest movies scores. The music that is set to the shower murder scene is quite possibly one of the scariest movie music I have heard. Come to find out, the score is known as the best in cinematography history for a horror movie.In the genre of horror movies, this has to be one of the best to scare audiences. The settings go certain scenes, such as the Bates motel, absolutely created an image in your head that could not be forgotten.",9,0,1,17 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
","The film 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' was hilarious and I really enjoyed watching this movie. I heard of this movie but I never got the chance to actually watch it. Jack Nicholson was awesome as he normally is. I think his character made the movie to what it is. He lightens up the film and gives it a little flavor. I also feel that he helped out the rest of the people that were in there to and brought their self-esteem up. This movie showed what a mental institute is about and it shows you the real thing but with Jack Nicholson it makes it interesting to what. All the characters played their roles so well and you actually believed that they weren't actors, and that they were real. I would love to watch this movie again on my own leisure time. I defiantly recommend it to others!",9,0,2,9 December 2010
