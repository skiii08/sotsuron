Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What criticisms?
","Here are all the things wrong with this movie: It's too kiddified, Jar jar is annoying, there's too much FX, there's no story, the acting is bad, etc, etc, etc.  All of these criticisms are stupid.Hollywood would do well to watch this movie (repeatedly) and TAKE NOTES. Instead of giving us hundreds of 'hip', brainless action movies, schmaltzy 'character dramas' and other endless tripe, they should watch the Phantom Menace and see what real imaginative filmmaking is all about.They are far too concerned with adding just enough pointless sex and blood splattering gore to avoid the 'awful' PG rating that would otherwise label their movie a 'kids' movie (since when did PG mean 'children's movie'?  I thought it meant parental guidance suggested.  On that thought, why do G movies have this label?)  Dialogue?  You want to talk about dialogue? What about all the gen-x, hip, smartass dialogue that spouts ad infinitum out of every other movie out there?  The dialogue in Star Wars isn't Shakespeare, but it is at least free from cynicism and (half) witty euphemisms.Call me defensive, but Star Wars transcends everyday films.  Why?  Because it is art.That's right, CGI effects or not, the atmosphere and mood setting in this movie are georgeous art.  I don't care if it is accomplished with computers or not.  What's the problem?  Computers are tools, like canvas and paint, and Star Wars oozes visual magic and loving attention to every detail in every single frame from start to finish.  Lucas is a master of mood and visual tone.And the music!  Operatic, dense, flowing and beautiful.  The choral piece at the end invites us into a pagan world of mysticism and magic ritual, to the scene of laser sword hyper-fighting that dazzles the mind.If you don't know this by now, Star Wars is at it's heart a silent movie. The music is much more important, the visual spectacle carries the story, and the sounds and melodies surround you with the mood.  That is why so many people don't understand them.  It isn't about dialogue, or even characters and story.  But we love the story, because it is as old as myth, and we love the characters, because we experience the magical worlds and imaginary vistas through their eyes.  They don't have to be interesting, they ARE us.If you don't understand that, you don't understand Star Wars.  It is unlike anything Hollywood can conceive, since all they are interested in doing is cranking out cheap copies loaded with trendy mega-stars.  It pales in comparison to this richly weaved tapestry of imagination.  I don't care what anyone says, Star Wars is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Welcome back to a galaxy far, far away
","You'll find that all of the criticisms about TPM are recycled from the criticisms of the old trilogy, or at least of Return of the Jedi.Trust me, the story isn't as simple as it seems.  I think that people were so dazzled by the effects (which are impressive), they weren't paying attention to the acting, or the story, both of which are very good.  Are they as good as the imagery?  No, but they never were!Besides, Star Wars isn't so much about characters, as it is about legends. Don't believe the criticisms, it is really a great movie, and it fits in perfectly with the others.One special note:  You've heard about the podrace and the duel (both of which are unbelievably amazing) but watch the queen in the senate chamber. She is so sad at seeing the Republic as it crumbles away, it will tear you're heart out--as will another scene, when young Anakin (perfectly portrayed by Jake Loyd as a child genius with a secretive soul) must part with his mother.  Unforgettable.'I had a dream I was a Jedi...'Welcome back to Star Wars...Episode II, III, we wait eagerly.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
The 13th Warrior," Positive, spoilers
","Awesome.  Those who grumbled about the 13th warrior, such as many movie critics, kept me from seeing it on the big screen, and now I regret it. Having seen the gorgeous DVD edition, I was very impressed with this movie. What I don't understand is why so many people didn't like it.But for now, anyway, I can snag the DVD and enjoy '13th warrior'.  Only the beginning is a little rocky.  As usual, a lot of plot has been condensed heavily--only McTeirnon decided to do it all at the beginning.  I haven't read Crichton's 'Eaters of the Dead' (thank goodness they changed the title), but you can tell a lot of 'book-to-movie' plot trimming went on. Once the Arab Ahmed and his barbaric buddies get to the task of dealing with the Wendol, however, the plot pace becomes more even, and you get a great adventure.In case you are one of the few who didn't know, this story is a retelling of the old english poem Beowulf.Critics moaned about the over-simple plot a lot.  But considering the source material (which was VERY simplistic, but nonetheless exciting), I think Crichton did a fine job.  He reinvented Grendel and his mother, and added a band of viking warriors, and an arab scholar to make the story more realistic.  Not that that was necessary, but it gives everything a grittier feel.Once you realize that Ahmed is not actually the 'hero' of the film, and you recognize the obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's Seven Samurai film, I think you will probably enjoy the movie tremendously, but I warn you there are a lot of things this movie doesn't have:  It doesn't have any silly barbarian queens running around in cleavage revealing armor.  It doesn't have a muscle bound hero that spouts cute one-liners.  It doesn't have any modern sounding dialogue or obvious anachronisms, and it doesn't have any campy humor.  It doesn't have a lot of 'hip' actors playing themselves in costume, in fact most of the actors are unknowns, adding to their authenticity.What it does have is some utterly beautiful set pieces, and some heart stopping battles.  The fights are bloody, but like Braveheart, the camera does not linger on the carnage very long.  It has some cool undercurrents dealing with themes of fear, the nature of heroism, and some thoughts toward the harsh, brutal life of the Norsemen.",10,0,0,1 February 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," very positive (spoilers)
","One of the things that makes 2001 so interesting is the total lack of movies out there even remotely like it.  So many people complain that it is incomprehensible, dull, or pretentious.  The problem is that 2001 is all of these things if you watch it like you watch any other movie.People are used to plot, character, and dramatic urgency being spoon fed to them, and so 2001 fails in all of these areas.  In fact, it really has no plot, no interesting characters (except HAL), and no drama in the conventional sense.  But this is the movies unique strength, and what a strength it is.The key to enjoying 2001 (and I don't mean understanding it, I mean enjoying it) is to let go of these needs and simply experience it.  2001 isn't about characters and their petty concerns, and it isn't about dramatic dialogue (there isn't any dialogue hardly).  Instead, 2001 is about contemplation. It asks--no demands, that we sit back and think about things most people don't think about (indeed that most people don't want to bother thinking about).It asks questions like what is our place in the universe?  Where do we go from here?  Who are we?  How is our development related to our tools--and the use of violence?  Most of all it tries to invoke the sheer awe that the universe inspires, but to appreciate it, you must think about it.2001 is not incomprehensible.  It answers all of these questions--but not in a conventional way.  Rather than give pat resolutions or quasi-religious sermons, it asks that you feel the answer, rather than express it in words.Many people dislike the fact that 2001 has such a baffling ending.  But the ending isn't really all that baffling--it is just difficult to describe in words.  The awesome mystery of the universe, the movie asserts, is more likely beyond our ability to completely understand.  Kubrick understood this, and so presented the entire movie using the least amount of dialogue he could, hoping that the viewers would follow the visual journey, and experience it on a more visceral, primal level than intellectual, even abstract narrative could ever provide.2001 is a unique masterpiece.  You don't watch it.  You experience it.",Null,1,3,2 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Captures the imagination
","Probably everyone has heard of the Star Wars movies.  They stand out as pieces of mythology, classic film lore, and technical wizardry.  Star Wars set the standard in Sci/Fi movies and special effects have been a huge part of movie making ever since.  Simply put, Star Wars is a masterpiece, made with meticulous attention to detail by a reclusive but highly knowledgeable film maker known for experimenting.  Star Wars speaks to the child in all of us, that naive spirit of adventure, of Good versus Evil, that pure idealism that surrounds us with feelings of awe and wonder.  It's a great work of imagination, of tribute to the classics of the past, of legends, heroes, magic and wide open fantasy.  George Lucas was right when he said that modern audiences longed for a mythology all their own, and he delivers with his epic story, aimed at kids of ages 8 to 80, with a grand sweep.  I love these movies.",10,2,3,3 February 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Utterly bizarre
","This is the weirdest, most absolutely inane movie I have ever seen. Fortunately for me, I love this type of humor, but not everyone likes it. The Holy Grail is loaded with tongue-in-cheek, irony, sarcasm, total silliness, and everything else you can think of, including the most quotable script ever.This is Monty Python, either you get it or you don't.  I love it--but you must not EVER take any of it seriously.  You have to look at everything that happens in it with the same zaniness that they present it with.  Holy hand grenades, mighty wizards named 'Tim', coconut-clacking lackies, moose credits, fake swedish, non-sequitors, all thrown at you with out any sense of coherence or plot--and all just for the sake of being crazy!  If you can't appreciate everything being parodied so blatantly, you won't like it.But if you like humor taken to the most ludicrous level possible, like me, you will.",Null,0,0,12 March 1999
