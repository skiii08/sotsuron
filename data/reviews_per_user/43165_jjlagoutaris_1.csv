The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Life-Altering
","Greatest movie I have ever seen. Could relate to Charlie on so many levels. Also, I would recommend Chbosky's book as well. The acting was terrific. I particularly enjoyed the love story between Emma and Logan's characters. I like the issues that it touched on. One of the only movies I am willing to re-watch. The movie makes you re-think the people around you. This is the only movie I have ever given a 10/10 out of over half a thousand as even its flaws can be viewed as purposeful and necessary to the work as a whole. The movie will pull on your emotions in every which way from the very on-set until the figurative curtains are drawn.",10,0,0,31 July 2014
