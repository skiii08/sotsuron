The Lobster," Art for Art's Sake
","This black comedy explores devotion, jealously, honesty, compromise, deception, and true love. Bizarre and dystopian, the theme had great promise. Still, it was a movie to be endured. After about 35 minutes, I wasn't sure that I could take any more. The Lobster has that purposeful and all-pervasive awkwardness that saturates Wes Anderson films. The embellishments on this story, however, nearly ruined it. The narration and musical score were grating. In fact, the avant-garde posturing could have been much more easily and pleasantly achieved by leaving out the accompanying music and voice overs. Unfortunate casting with Colin Farrell. It's not that he did a bad job with the part, but that it would have been so much better with an unknown playing the role. Overall, this was not an enjoyable film but instead a provocative watch. I'm not sure that it will have any long-lasting implications for the way I think, and I'm really not sure that I'm glad I watched it. I'm just not sure what the deal is with these purposefully made bad movies.",5,1,6,29 February 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Unfortunate
","Blockbusters typically suffer for a lack of artistry. Blade Runner 2049 smothered in a surfeit of it. It had a great script, a story that was engaging and surprising. It had stellar acting, from minor cast to the lead actor. It had beautiful sets and effects, worthy of the big budget. The 1980s modernist lighting and camera angles, however, were a step backward. That was a mistake thirty years ago, and to taint this beautiful film with the monochromatic tinting, neon lighting, and awkward closeups was simply unfortunate. The film would have lost about 3 minutes of running time if they cut all the closeups on eyeballs, for instance. Get rid of those extended scenes focusing on someone standing - yes, standing.... There was probably about thirty minutes of material that could have been cut from the unnecessarily long close-ups on facial expressions and postures. Those shots have a place in movies, and deserved to be in here, but Villeneuve lost all sense of perspective and moderation. Perhaps the most unfortunate artistic indulgence of the entire movie, however, was the soundtrack. I was stunned that the 2017 version of Blade Runner would return to 1982 for musical inspiration. The synthesizer gave the impression throughout that this was the 1980s artistic vision of the future. I had already seen that one years ago. In Villeneuve's quest to pay homage to the 1982 cinematic precursor, he demonstrated a real lack of discernment, no awareness of what made the original special and what was simply then-fashionable. By carrying over, in block, so much from the Ridley Scott version, the 2049 director smeared all sorts of incongruous artistry over what should have been a new and dazzling production.",5,9,18,9 October 2017
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim: Nothing Unexpected
","The not-too-revealing-synopsis:In a not-too-distant future, political rivalries have given way to a unified construction and military effort to combat a shared, other-worldly threat. New technology and science produce the next generation of defenses for the Earth. These new defenses, dependent on humans, are limited by their vulnerabilities while simultaneously bolstered by their vitality.The not-too-revealing-review:Pacific Rim captures 'big'. The movie convincingly relates the big threat to humanity, the big communal response, the big industrial production, and the big adversary. This near future is even made plausible on the political, technological, and fantasy level. The movie fails, however, to escape the graphic novel origins. Where storyline development could have come through the explanation and development of the futuristic technology, it settles for unsurprising weaponry 'reveals'; where it could have entertained grand science fiction questions, it throws in another action scene; where it could have showcased large-scale action choreography, it focuses in on a punch landing or head being knocked backward. It belongs in the video game movie genre with all the flaws one expects to accompany such a label: weak storyline, repetitive action scenes, and clich√© characters. It does fare better than expected in a number of categories: the acting was acceptable nor and the character development was less than ruinous. It was as shiny and glossy as one expects from a big budget motion picture of this sort, but the action scenes were sluggish and clunky. It matches up with Transformers in effects but is more Godzilla (1954) in terms of action choreography. I enjoyed it while I was in the theater, but I will not think fondly of it on the outside. I do not recommend the movie, but neither would I discourage those who desire a good solid two hours of big effects and mayhem.Acting: 6/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Character Development: 5/10 Choreography: 3/10 Storyline: 6/10 Resonance: 1/10",5,4,15,12 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Lows and Highs
","The Not-Too-Revealing-Summary: Large, bad guy army tries to squash rag-tag rebel army. Desperate and longshot guerrilla style missions give the underdogs hope and viewers an opportunity to better know the characters. The Not-Too-Revealing-Review:The Lows: Editing, Slapstick, Creature CGI, New Casting, Side Plots. Editing: Star Wars has always been choppy. The transitions between scenes are something you could easily work into your Powerpoint presentation, and the blocks are so obviously blocks that the fact of editing comes to the forefront instead of remaining a behind-the-scenes technicality. This was the worst edited Star Wars movie - ever. The choppiness and blockiness was exaggerated by snippets of awkward dialogue and frames of irrelevant people being blown up or pushing buttons. Adult viewers know that this is not the way to make movies today, Star Wars geeks know that this is homage, but everyone can tell that it was done badly. Paying homage to the original is a staple for reboots, but you have to master those technical aspects for it to work. It didn't here. Slapstick: Everyone likes a good laugh. There were a few - perhaps even several - in The Last Jedi. For every good one however there were three flops. These were all the worse, in many cases, because the editors planned the moment as a humorous one, made the joke central to the scene, and then left some seconds free afterward for the expected laugh. When these failed, it was especially awkward. Even when they worked, it was obvious how contrived the moment was. The best laughs were those that weren't centered, that moved forward quickly leaving the viewer surprised as well as humored. Creature CGI: Way too many new creatures. Way too edited. The contrast between those creatures that were wearing suits and makeup and those completely generated by computer were stark, so stark that it often felt like I was watching movies from two different eras at the same time. Like the editing, CGI creatures are a place where their generation should not come to mind, but it was a distraction in this film. New Casting: Vice Admiral Holdo was awful. Cringing, there-must-be-something-up-their-sleeve mind-boggingly bad where the only possible explanation was that it was foreshadowing. And maybe it was, but it foreshadowed all the wrong conclusions.DJ was awesome. Far too awesome, in fact. His very presence can't be lent to a minor character when the acting and personality are that good. Side Plots: Okay, let's put it out there. These were dumb. One excursion was largely a waste of fantasy potential and the other gratuitous and mindless. So many moments and dramas were strained - people making dumb decisions, caricatured villains, implausible traps, and contradictory sacrifices and lessons. This was both badly written and badly envisioned.The Highs: Acting, Character Development, Cinematography, Second Half of the Film. Acting and Character Development:Rey and Finn are excellent characters. They have contagious strengths and very real weaknesses. The respective actress and actor live these roles, and it is a genuine pleasure to watch them. Rose and Luke also had great performances. What is surprising about the film is that it was a very good drama first and a satisfying action-adventure second. The nemesis-turns-into-something-else relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren is without a doubt the highlight of the drama. Cinematography: Forget the space action sequences, aircraft, and weapons. There were some stunning scenes from the secluded island - the dark place hauntingly so. The sets were passing at best and distracting at worst, but the aerial views and more artistic shots of nature held a lot of value. Then, of course, there's that heavily edited CGI battle scene that everyone is going to be talking about and that all are going to remember. It might have been dumb, but it was breathtakingly beautiful. Second Half of the Film: I can understand reviewers and critics who watched the first half of the movie and had decided that it was bad. It was made for families and children and with such poor justifications for the taken upon dangers and decisions that one could easily let that ruin the rest of the film. Once you get past those cringe-worthy attempts at humor, past the awkward supporting actor performances, and let yourself get taken up into the dramas of the end, one can find a very good movie in here. This is where the drama and character development met the action adventure. No longer separate tracks, distractions, or filler, things came together in the movie. We viewers understood who was fighting for what and why, and we cared. The action scenes become not simple additions to the story but culminations of long-walked paths. There is both a very good movie in here and a very bad one. Wearing blinders helps one to ignore those mind-numbingly dumb moments and focus on the personal story arcs of the main characters.",7,0,0,19 December 2017
Inception," I can't stop you from watching it....
","The Not-Too-Revealing-Summary: Inception is a thought-provoking action movie that is best tagged with keywords like 'con-men,' 'corporate espionage,' 'psychological thriller' or even 'philosophy.'The-Not-Too-Revealing-Review: Inception takes a very simple - and very traditional - genre and fashions it around a complicated idea. The movie is truly a work of art - in a positive sense as much as in a pejorative sense. Director Christopher Nolan takes a fairly complicated notion and unravels it for the audience in such a way as to entertain visually and provoke thoughtfully. The movie was, however, art for art's sake. It was a demonstration: the goal was not to amaze, thrill, or surprise but to bewilder. It was a presentation of a mental knot and then the step-by-step exhibition of how one would disentangle it. In this regard the movie was a success. Some of my many grievances (and they were many) against the film: The action scenes were quite obviously padding for the core of the film. Most of the scenes were shot in indoor, extremely confined situations - and though stylish - they were not the strikingly visual scenes I had hoped for. The big, outdoor, scenes where this big budget film had a chance to truly impress failed completely. The fight scenes where the movie had the opportunity to provide some iconic segment - looked like men hoisted in the air with wires. Between two of Nolan's other works - Memento and the Dark Knight - Inception was more Memento. The attention to detail present in the Dark Knight made it into Inception - but only into the unraveling of Nolan's idea. The many filler scenes lacked this consideration and left the film with a duality of wonderfully thought-through details interspersed with inanity.Some other odds and ends: Tip of the hat to Nolan for leaving some things unexplained. It is unclear if this is truly present day or some time in the future and the director rightly leaves that for the audience to decide for themselves. Explanations for the mechanisms of the technology are left alone - and for the better. I could not have told you who Tom Hardy was before this film but after this performance I look forward to whatever it is he may do next. I hope Nolan credits a certain 1999 film (whose title I shall not mention so I do not spoil this movie for anyone else). The relationship goes far beyond similarity or inspiration. Nolan took it further (with a budget of over $130 million more) but it is bothersome to see Inception heralded for 'originality.' Overall I cannot recommend this film. It was neither enjoyable nor entertaining to watch. I can respect the skill it takes for someone to make a house of cards but in the end I have no real desire to stare at a house of cards.",5,15,26,5 August 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Quality but not without flaws
","The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis: This is the fourth in the 'Die Hard' action series that centers on a New York cop who begrudgingly serves in the hero role against a highly organized criminal plot.The Not-Too-Revealing Review: 'Live Free or Die Hard,' succeeds as an action blockbuster and is undeserving of the usually accompanying adjective 'mindless.' The rough, tough, bruiser of a NY cop is still there, though now with some exploration of just what it is that makes him capable of performing his heroic feats. The stuck-in-the-80s McClane is juxtaposed with a technological world and the people - good guys and bad - that populate it. These and a few more thoughtful and even more subtle themes run through the film and give it a well-rounded flavor. Though mostly adequate justification is given for the appropriate suspension of disbelief, there were three scenes in particular that pushed it too far. For thorough enjoyment you have to overlook those moments. Typically the preface 'It was never intended to win an Oscar' is used to give license to mind-numbing special effects and action drivel but not so with this 'Die Hard.' Make no mistake - this is an action film - 97% pure action - but the remaining 3% supplies quality character development that sets this action film apart from the standard. I highly recommend this to any Die Hard followers and anyone who enjoys an action movie.",7,1,2,23 July 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," An unpleasant viewing experience
","The not-too-revealing-synopsis: This is an addition to the Mad Max series that is set in a desert world where order and scientific progress have ceased. Mankind, still dependent upon fuel to power engines built in the productive times past, scavenges and fights for whatever gasoline can be found. Organized bands of highway robbers are the closest approximation to society and those still with traces of humanity and civility can only survive on the periphery of savagery.The not-too-revealing-review: It has a good story. There are great action scenes. The created world itself is thoughtful and detailed, full of wonder and surprise. It is full of memorable characters, and Charlize Theron was perfect. How, then, did it go so terribly wrong?.... Imagine a talented painter who spends months on a piece. He creatively employs the appropriate techniques: lighting, texture, perspective, etc. Then the artists hands a random stranger a Sharpie and asks them to overlay the painting with a stick figure mural which offers the stranger's interpretation of the artist's work. In the end result, one can still glimpse the beauty of what is underneath, but the final product is irreparably marred. This was Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller had created a fantastic world. And then, for reasons I cannot fathom, decided to ask Tom Hardy to reprise his role as Forrest Bondurant from the movie Lawless. Hardy is a great actor with versatility, and you ask him to do this? Why would you so extensively (or at all for that matter) rely on double-film speed to make the action scenes seem faster? That wasn't actually that cool in the 1970s, and it is just bizarre today. And why would you edit the scenes so that they were choppy and seeming to purposefully stifle continuity and development. It was almost as if the director wanted to regress to the graphic novel format. Somewhere in the vaults of the studio there lies the unedited footage for this movie. If that could be put together in a less choppy, slower pace film that more reflected mainstream films today, this could have been a truly enjoyable movie.This was truly an unpleasant viewing experience. For those wanting a comparison, think Crank (2006) merged with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014). I suppose that if you liked Crank and/or Sin City, however, this might be just the thing you are looking for.",4,9,20,20 May 2015
