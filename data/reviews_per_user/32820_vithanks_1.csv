The Incredible Hulk," Surprised me!
","Starting to watch Marvel movies in the shared universe in chronological order, I come across the fear of arriving in this movie and find it bad, but what I saw was a movie with a lot of action from beginning to end, good plot, good effects specials and good performances and filming in Brazil.",9,3,4,12 May 2019
