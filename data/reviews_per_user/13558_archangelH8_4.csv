Kill Bill: Vol. 2," As a whole, one of the best films I've witnessed
","After viewing Kill Bill: Vol. 2 this weekend, I've come to the strong conclusion that I need Quentin to release a special dvd edition as soon as possible with both films together as one.  The sooner the better because this film, Kill Bill, as a whole blows me away and I cannot wait for its release.  Volume 2 was just as good, maybe even better than the first, with its strong dialogue and flawless performances by Gordon Liu, Uma Thurman, and David Carradine.  Carradine truly delivers a great performance as Bill, no longer the evil man behind the sword but an actual sympathetic character. Granted, he 'overreacted' but we finally get a chance to see who he was and the whole background to the Bride and Bill.  Overall, this film gives well needed closure to Uma Thurman's character and thus ends a great Tarantino tale.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
Memento," Don't watch this movie forward
","well now recently i bought the special dvd edition of this wonderful film and there is a little option that lets you watch the movie forwards. after first watchin it, i didnt like it whatsoever.  who knew that watchin it backwards was the best way to view it because the whole point of the movie is being lost in what is going on.  you are just like the main character who is in constant inquiry of his life and his past.  he knows nothing and thats how the viewer is while watchin this movie.  its perfect, and if anyone says differently...well then they may be insane.",9,0,3,14 July 2003
28 Days Later...," I can understand...
","So I can understand why people would not like this film.  Maybe the camera work bothered them.  Maybe they wanted more zombies and gore.  Maybe they didn't like the characters or story.  Or possibly some had trouble with the male nudity.********SPOILERS AHEAD*********Well now, after the release of the this horrible infection, known as Rage, the world, 28 days later, has succumb to the disease.  And the infected do not die, they become these horrible creatures, almost in a state of having rabies where they go insane and just attack people.  In comes Jim, someone who wakes in a hospital, naked, and roams this forsaken city, seeing his world in shambles.  Soon he meets up with Selena and another man (who does not matter, trust me).  They then meet up with a father and daughter and go on there way from a radio transmission telling them to go towards a military outpost of some sort.  After reaching it, the outcome grows ugly but in the end their saviors come and the movie closes on a happy note.I loved Jim's performance in this movie and I also thought that the daughter, Hannah, was portrayed quite well.  The characters are believable and they react as anyone would do in those situations.  And for those who complain that this is not a zombie film, well you are right, but I am glad that it is not and that it turned out to be something better than that. It had much more important themes, the most important to me was that even though the world can be ravaged by such a horrible disease, that human beings can still be horrible to each other.  It's true in those times, and it is true now.  Overall, I give this movie a 8 out of 10 and I was glad to watch it.  I will buy it once it comes out.  Until then...later",9,0,1,14 July 2003
Titanic," how is this the top grossing film of all time?!?
","*possible spoilers ahead...the ship sinks!!!* Well then. I saw this years ago and i've seen parts of it since. It still sucks every time. First of all, does anyone else think that Rose was quite whorish for those times? i mean, sure, women were i guess starting to be more experimental but hell she stripped for him so he could draw a picture, then they had sex in the car, then she was so 'in love' with him that she jumped back onto the ship so that she could be with Jack. Ridiculous. now heres the part where i actually give some credit to james cameron. the film was beautifully shot and i consider that one of the only good reasons to see that film. unfortunately leonardo dicaprio crapped this movie up real good.if only they went with one of their original choices...mccauley caulkin...yea thats right, the kid from home alone. seriously, he would have made that movie a comedy and then u could salvage that piece of crap. i would have totally bought a ticket to that movie if i heard that when mccauley found out the ship was sinkin, he would slap his cheeks and scream.priceless moment right there.",Null,2,4,23 May 2004
