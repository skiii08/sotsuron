The Lobster," Just want to talk about its time setting
","The film didn't specify the year - so you can say it is a story about either future or past, or whenever the time you think is reasonable. But funny enough, I really like the way the director sets it.The technology they use to turn human into animal, and the way they operate the hotel, or, the social system, make you feel like it is from the future. Plus, the way people talk in the film (unemotional - in fact, I find that it is the director's intention to have characters act that way to make the film look surreal) gives you a stronger 'future' feeling.However, if you look at the facilities - the entire hotel, the yachts, people's dresses - everything looks so old fashioned, like it is from 70s. Especially the way how Colin expressed David - serious, cautious, introverted - literally a dogmatic guy from decades ago.I believe there is a reason the director designed it that way. The conflicts more or less satirized the advanced technology versus backwards social system and people's cognition. There is another conflict in the film - couples and loners. Both use extreme approaches to maintain and manage its systems. However, there is no right and wrong side, it is just how you choose. Ironically, David (Colin) is always on the wrong side. He was a loner in the hotel, and fell in lover in the woods. What a sarcasm.In the end, what would be in front of them? Would David finally sacrifice to fit into the system? And, would the system accept them? To me, it's an open question too.",8,1,2,17 December 2017
