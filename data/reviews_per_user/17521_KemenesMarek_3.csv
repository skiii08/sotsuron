Ford v Ferrari," A very good movie
","One of the best movies, I think, but I expected more from this. The critics said 'It's a very, very good, or excellent film', but I think it could be better. That's only my opinion and yes, it is a very good film, but I think it's not excellent.",9,1,3,12 March 2020
Rocketman," The best movie of the year!
","I love this movie so much! When I watched it for first time, I tought it is 'just' a good film, but now, I watched it at least five times, my opinion is this is the movie of the year (or decade). Taron Egerton's acting is brilliant in the whole film.",10,0,0,11 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not the best, but not the worst
","I think it's not a brilliant film, but it is not the worst. For me, it was a bit boring, and I waited for some 'activity' but it not came. I know, it isn't an action movie, where all the people die, but I think this film isn't as good, as the critics say. We are not the same, and I don't like movies like this, but it isn't that bad, and isn't that good.",8,1,2,12 March 2020
