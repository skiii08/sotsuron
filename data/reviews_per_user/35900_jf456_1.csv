Requiem for a Dream," Excellent movie!
","Don't feed the dog. Get off the phone with your spouse. Don't eat or go to the bathroom. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.......NOW!This film is an immersive experience that will leave you feeling exhausted, yet overwhelmingly fulfilled. This excellent movie is a welcome departure from the usual photocopy-of-a-photocopy 'Mr. Handsome meets Ms. Perfect' or 'Guy Must Defend World From Aliens.' I won't spoil this wonderful film by revealing details, but I just can't seem to praise this movie enough!As a slight warning, this movie is not for someone who crys when they see a dead mouse. This is not some 'Feel Warm and Fuzzy Right *There*' movie. This is a movie about reality, and it creates a picture of it on many levels, including the emotional.I have read a lot of rhetoric that says 'this is so graphic' or 'this is so cynical.' Watch the movie and make the judgement for yourself. Don't listen to the conventional talking heads.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did!",10,1,1,18 November 2000
