The New World," Beautiful tale of two cultures meeting
","The place is Virginia, the year is 1607.Three ships of the Jamestown Expedition,led by Captain Newport,arrive and the Native Americans are witnessing this.When two cultures meet it means bloody battles.The English men build a fort there.John Smith leaves the fort to explore another area and trade with the Indians, but he gets captured.But it is princess Pocahontas that saves John Smith's life.Captain Smith and Pocahontas find romance with each other.Once he is released he becomes the leader in the fort.People live in terrible conditions there, they don't have much to eat, there are diseases, people are dying...The whole situation seems pretty hopeless.And there is another battle to be expected with the Indians, who see that the English will not leave their country.Also Smith loses the trust of their men, when he disagrees with them trading Pocahontas and lodging her in the fort to protect their families.Then Captain Newport returns from England and informs Smith that the king has offered him the opportunity to lead a new expedition of his own to find a new passage to the West Indies.Smith returns to England instead and asks his friend to tell Pocahontas that he has died in the crossing.All the beauty of Pocahontas' life is now gone.Then John Rolfe, a tobacco planter arrives and wants Pocahontas.He marries her, after she's baptised, but she still has a place in her heart that belongs to John Smith.Terrence Malick is the writer and director of The New World (2005).This is a very poetic movie.Malick has portrayed beautifully the story of these people.Especially those moments between Smith and Pocahontas, but you can find some beauty in the battle scenes, also.And he has done an excellent job capturing the era on screen.There's nothing to remind of our times there.It's almost like watching a documentary on how these people lived.There are some outstanding performances in the movie.Colin Farrell does a role of the lifetime as John Smith.Q'orianka Kilcher is very sensuous in her part as Pocahontas.I think we'll be hearing from her in the future.Christopher Plummer gives another fine performance as Captain Newport.Christopher Bale is great as John Rolfe.Wes Studi does a good job playing Openhancanough.Ben Chaplin plays Robinson and John Savage is Savage.The love story portrayed in this movie is beautiful.Watch this piece of art and step back to the 17th century.",9,3,6,22 April 2009

Requiem for a Dream," Better than drugs
","Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) and their friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) all suffer from a severe drug addiction.Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000) is a journey to the minds of these people.They are not pretty minds, they're dirty minds, that have been damaged by the addiction.The acting work is something unbelievable. The legendary Ellen Burstyn is just amazing as the woman who wants to lose weight for a TV program.Jared Leto is superb in this movie as he was in his TV debut My So-Called Life playing Jordan Catalano and other things.The Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind) is spectacular.Wayans is also brilliant.The movie is based on the late Hubert Selby Jr's novel and he's also seen in this movie as Laughing Guard.The way this movie is made is just amazing.The director really knew what he was doing.We'll be hearing from Mr Aronofsky.This movie should make people realize that drugs are no good.Sadly it's not going to happen.Requiem for a Dream is not a pretty movie.It's reality.",10,0,1,20 December 2004
The Sound of Music," A new member of the von Trapp family
","Maria, living in Salzburg, Austria, is studying to become a nun.But the convent life is not meant for he, for she's a free spirit who rather sings on the mountains.So the Reverend Mother sends her to the residence of naval officer, Captain Georg Ritter von Trapp to be the governess to his seven children.He's a widower whose raising methods are strict.And his household used to be filled with music.But now Maria brings the music back in the house.The baroness Elsa is about to be the new mother to the children.She's the total opposite of Maria.Eventually Georg finds the beauty of Maria, and finds the music.At the same time some dark clouds are hanging over the von Trapp family.It's 1939 and the Nazis are in power.Mr. von Trapp is not a supporter of Hitler's Third Reich.But now the Reich wants him, but he rather wants to be free.So they all sing at the Salzburg Music Festival.They are the winners of the first prize, but they do not appear on the stage.They run away, and in the end we see them all free hiking over the Alps to Switzerland.The Sound of Music (1965) is directed by Robert Wise.It's written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Couse.The story is based on the true story of the actual Maria von Trapp.It's based on the Broadway musical, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.The song list is numerous, and most of those songs are timeless classics.I really loved My favorite Things and Do-Re-Mi.This movie represents some perfect entertainment.And it is a movie of a darker tone as well.",10,3,10,20 August 2009
Spartacus," 'I am not an animal!'

Deja Vu," Dealing with time travelling
","It's Mardi Gras in New Orleans.A ferry carrying hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors and their families explodes, killing over 500 people.Special agent Doug Carlin is sent to investigate the case and it is found out that a domestic terrorist called Carroll Oerstadt is behind the deed.Doug is introduced by FBI surveillance unit a program that uses a space folding technology to look back a little over four days into the past.They follow the last days of a woman called Claire Kuchever, who was murdered a little before the explosion.Doug falls in love with this woman.Soon it looks possible he could go back in time and safe this woman's life.Déjá Vu (2006) is an action sci-fi thriller directed by Tony Scott and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.The movie was shot in post-Katrina New Orleans.Denzel Washington is the right man to play Doug Carlin.And Paula Patton as Claire is the kind of woman you can imagine Denzel falling for.Val Kilmer is great as Agent Paul Pryzwarra.Jim Caviezel is a pretty scary crook as Oerstadt.Adam Goldberg is superb as Dr. Alexander Denny.Bruce Greenwood is terrific as Agent Jack McCready.Matt Craven is very good as Agent Larry Minuti.Child actress Elle Fanning is seen as Abbey.This movie deals with a topic that fascinates me very much, a possibility to travel through time.And this differs from any other time travel movie.It's an action movie, and the time travel itself doesn't have the biggest role.It's also a romantic movie.It's quite fantastic the love story it portrays here.The man falls for the image of a dead girl, and there is a way to safe her and make her love him.So both the sci-fi part and the love story are something you haven't seen before.There is no chance of this movie giving you a déjá vu.The last scenes on the ferry are quite intense to watch.And that Beach Boys song 'Don't Worry Baby' really works.This is a kind of movie, where you shouldn't stop and think: does this make any sense? Is there any logic here? You should just enjoy the ride.",Null,0,1,29 October 2011

Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack) to come to her after her husband starts the monologue of Hamlet.Ernst Lubitsch is the director of To Be or Not to Be from 1942.It's awfully funny in many parts.When the magnificent, and Jewish comedian Jack Benny does a Nazi, it's just hilarious.Sure it has got some drama too, because of the war topic.This was the last movie of the glorious Carole Lombard before she died in an airplane crash.She was too young to go.It's been 65 years since this picture was made and a lot has happened in that time.There is no Adolf Hitler anymore and the world lives in peace.Do we? Sadly there will probably always be wars.But luckily there are those fine comedians to make it all better.The darkest matters can be turned into something funny.Another fine comedian Mel Brooks starred a new version of this movie in 1983.That was also hilarious in many parts.Thank you for making us laugh, comedians.",10,0,1,9 August 2007

All men and women should be equal, black and white.There are people that still don't get that.Amistad is a movie that should make you cry.Like in the scene that shows you how those African people were treated on the ship, what they did to them...It's just horrible.This shouldn't have happened.",9,0,2,26 July 2006

The Great Dictator," Chaplin's first talkie
","Charles Chaplin plays Hynkel, Dictator of Tomania.He also plays a Jewish barber.Resemblance between these two is coincidental.The Jewish barber fights in the first world war and he loses his memory.He comes back to the ghetto and realizes that Hynkel has started the persecution of Jews.And why?Because he thinks that the Aryans are the best race and the others must be destroyed The Great Dictator from 1940 is Charles Chaplin's first talkie.It is a movie that shows how horrible the Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler were.He started making the movie in 1936 when practically nobody knew what kind of power Hitler had in his hands.They didn't know how he was going to send the Jews to concentration camp and brutally get them killed there.Now it's obvious that the man was insane.How could anybody think he was a great man and there was some sense in his speeches.Hitler was an idiot.It's nice that somebody could make a movie which laughs right at Hitler's face.Chaplin has told later that he wouldn't have made this comedy if he had known how much the Jewish people actually had to suffer.Also an other fascist leader gets laughed at; Benito Mussolini.In the movie he is Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria and he is played by Jack Oakie.The acting work in this movie is superb.Chaplin is amazing in the double role.Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at that time, is Hannah in the movie and she is doing terrific role work.Everything works perfectly in this great comedy which showed that Chaplin did very well in a talkie.He only made five talkies.The first one is the best alongside Limelight.There are some excellent scenes in this satire.In one scene you can see Hynkel playing with the globe and the scene after that shows the Jewish barber doing his work while Brahms symphony is playing on the radio.It is one of my favorite scenes and the funniest in the movie.Of course there are some serious scenes in the movie.You can't make this kind of movie all funny.The ending isn't funny at all and it's better that way.There the barber makes a speech for humanity and tolerance.It is a very touching scene and made my eyes a little wet.He tells us to love one and other and he gives hope to us all.In today's world I can't see too much hope for the mankind.Many people don't even want to become tolerant.Those people judge other people because of the color of their skin or their religion.I tell you to stop being intolerant and unite!Tolerance is the key to the better world.",Null,1,3,12 September 2001
Dead Poets Society," Robin Williams is the teacher we all wanted to have
","It's autumn in 1959.Todd Anderson is a shy young man who starts his senior year of high school at Welton Academy, an all-male, elite prep school. His roommate is an outgoing Neil Perry, who wants to be an actor but whose dream is objected by his father. The school has a new English teacher, John Keating. His unorthodox teaching methods inspire most of the students to carpe diem- seize the day. Dead Poets Society (1989) is a drama classic directed by the Australian master Peter Weir. Tom Schulman is behind the great script. The actors are all extraordinary. Robin Williams gives a memorable performance as Keating. This actor, who was mostly known as a comedian, proves here he could master drama as well. It is sad we haven't had Robin on this Earth for three years since he took his own life. Robert Sean Leonard is terrific as Neil. His character kills himself in this movie and we all cry with his fellow students. Kurtwood Smith is very good as his strict father. Ethan Hawke is great as the shy Todd, who finds courage in him he thought he didn't have with the help of his teacher. Then we also have Norman Lloyd, who is brilliant as Headmaster Gale Nolan. This actor is 102 years old today and has kept on working in the recent years! I had seen this movie a number of years ago, and recently I found the DVD from the library. I found the story very inspirational. The way Mr. Keating teaches the boys poetry...I mean, I have written some poetry in my spare time, but maybe I should have had a teacher like Mr. Keating, who would have put more faith in me and I could maybe now consider myself a great poet.

Scott gives a very powerful performance as Bert Gordon.Just look at him where he shouts 'You owe me MONEY!'

","Woody Allen goes from New York to London.In the film Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), after realizing he won't be a professional tennis player he takes a job as a tennis coach.He befriends Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), a rich playboy and starts a relationship with Tom's sweet sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer).They get married.There's no real passion in that between them.But he finds passion with Tom's actress fiancée Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson).Chloe wants to become pregnant but he gets Nola pregnant instead-and she wants to have the baby.She urges Tom to tell her wife.Tom sees no other way out of the situation but murder.Woody Allen calls Match Point (2005) his arguably the best film he has made.I probably wouldn't go that far but it is very good.The way the music has been used in the film is extraordinary.Opera music has a big role in Match Point.The young Scarlett Johansson collaborates with Allen for the first time and she does a great job.Jonathan Rhys Meyers is brilliant as Chris.Emily Mortimer really is sweet and good as Chloe.In Match Point you can find some similarity with Allen's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989).It also had the whole Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment theme.A person who feels terrible guilt after the deed.Match Point plays with love and moral issues in a fantastic way.",9,2,3,20 September 2008
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen travels through time
","Owen Wilson plays a screenwriter called Gil Pender who goes to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams). He has troubles finishing his first novel, and then all of a sudden he finds himself from the 1920's, his favorite era. There he has a chance to talk to people like the Fitzgerald couple, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso. Midnight in Paris (2011) is a movie directed By Woody Allen. This Jewish New Yorker born as Allan Stewart Konigsberg turns 80 today, and still comes up with a movie per year. Now there's an achievement! He has made most of his movies in New York, but in the latter years he has gone to Europe. This movie made in France works very well and is one of his finest movies made in Europe. I am a big fan of time traveling, and that's one of the reasons I like this movie. This is like Back to the Future, in Woody's style. It's most intriguing to watch this 21st century guy interacting with celebrities of the past. The meeting with Salvador Dali must be the funniest. The acting work works as it always does in a Woody Allen movie. Owen Wilson is really good as Gil. In supporting roles you can see people like Michael Sheen, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard and Adrien Brody.If you want to see a time travel themed movie handled in an intellectual way, you should see this movie.",9,0,0,1 December 2015

Catch-22," War is insane
","It's 1944 and the World War II.The reluctant bombardier, Capt. John Yossarian gets a permission to leave the war, but he gets stabbed.Now we see all the crazy phases of this crazy war.We see men in the air wanting to be anywhere else but there.Mike Nichols is the director of Catch-22 (1970).It's based on the novel by Joseph Heller.I haven't read the book.I probably should.The movie is a real good satirical look on the war topic.Catch-22 makes a statement that war is not good.But it can make a good movie.This movie is filled with loony characters.And those actors and fine comedians portraying those characters are just priceless.Alan Arkin plays Yossarian, who tries to prove that he's lunatic so he doesn't have to go flying and bombing.Martin Balsam is the lousy Colonel Cathcart, who wants to increase the number of flights.Bob Newhart's entrance into the movie is memorable.He plays this nervous and stuttering Mr. Major, who becomes a Major.That's Major Major.Very easy to remember.The legendary Jack Gilford is terrific as Doc Daneeka.Art Garfunkel, who we know also from his singing career, does his movie debut playing Captain Nately.Gina Rovere plays Nately's whore.Bob Balaban is great as Capt. Orr, who was in Sweden when we last heard of him.Charles Grodin does another great role as the pipe smoking Aardvark.The legendary big man Orson Welles plays Brigadier General Dreedle, who would execute the soldiers if he could.Austin Pendleton is wonderful playing Lt.Col. Moodus, his son-in-law.Susanne Benton is Dreedle's WAC.Norman Fell is First Sgt. Towser.Peter Bonerz plays Capt.J.S. McWatt who slices one soldier in half with his plane and then crashes himself to the mountain.Bruce Kirby, father of the late Bruno Kirby, is Doctor.Collin Wilcox plays the part of Nurse Cramer.The movie is full of funny and zany stuff.It's hilarious when Arkin's Yossarian and Grodin's Aardvark are in the cockpit together without any parachutes and Yossarian is panicking while Aarfy stays calm smoking his pipe.And we see Yossarian getting a medal from Dreedle without any clothes on.And of course the bunch of horny soldiers staring at Dreedle's WAC.Or when Chaplain Tappman goes to see Cathcart and he's sitting on a toilet.Mike Nichols told Steven Soderbergh on the DVD commentary that it was inspired by something the young Elizabeth Taylor experienced with the MGM chief Louis B. Mayer.It's often also very serious, like when Yossarian tries to help the dying soldier Snowden.The movie moves somewhere around surrealism and dreamlike state.You see in flashbacks all the events that have taken place.Except that those flashbacks seem more like a dream that Yossarian is having.Places can change quickly, or the screen can be filled with whiteness and Yossarian finds himself in the plane and hears through the intercom said by Dobbs: 'Help him! Help him! Yossarian: Help who? Dobbs: Help the bombardier! Yossarian: I'm the bombardier,I'm all right.Dobbs: Then help HIM, help HIM! And there lies Snowden covered with blood and you also see the guts falling out of his body. It reminds me of Franz Kafka and his character K from The Trial, when Yossarian walks in the dark streets of Rome and he sees dead girl killed by Aarfy.Then in Aarfy's room he says they're coming to arrest Aarfy but they arrest him instead of going AWOL.The movie bombed both critically and commercially, which is a shame.Catch-22 makes a clear point that there is no point in war.And it does it brilliantly.",9,8,12,29 April 2009

'King' Kong.Sellers was originally supposed to do his role, also, but he was reluctant fearing he could not get the Texas accent right.And he also sprained his ankle.George C. Scott is terrific as General 'Buck' Turgidson.And Tracy Reed is wonderful as his woman, Miss Scott.Sterling Hayden is great as Brigadier General Jack Ripper.This movie is often very funny.Sellers as president calling the drunken Soviet Premier is one funny scene.Sellers as Mandrake trying to contact the president with a payphone is hilarious.And Wynn's character Guano gets Coca-Cola on his face from the vending machine.Or Sellers doing his Strangelove, the German scientist in a wheelchair.He's a former Nazi whose hand keeps doing the Nazi salute.And him raising to his feet and shouting 'Mein Führer, I can walk!'This movie is The ending is, dare I say, beautiful in a scary way.We see images of exploding nuclear explosions and we hear Vera Lynn singing 'We'll Meet Again'.This movie certainly succeeds in bringing a message and being funny at the same time.",9,1,2,7 September 2009

John Bergin.Jerry Wasserman is Baldez.Shia LaBeouf plays Farber.Fiona Hogan is V.I.K.I.The movie was nominated for an Oscar in visual effects.A sequel for 2012 seems possible.This isn't a perfect sci-fi flick, but it works.There are some pretty neat action scenes, like when Spooner is attacked by all those robots on the road.The movie's future looks pretty cool, and a little dark.Spooner's futuristic Audi can drive itself and the robots seem to do most of the jobs.That would be the downside of the future, and most likely it would turn many people against robots.But hey, this is not the future yet.We don't have to worry about the robot revolution.But maybe someday...",8,1,2,20 April 2010

Movies are too much the same old, same old these days, so it's refreshing to see a movie that is far from that.The casting is excellent.John Cusack, this now forty year old actor, does excellent job in the lead.His acting is never bad.Cameron Diaz is fabulous as Lotte.Catherine Keener does great job as Maxine.Charlie Sheen makes a visit as Charlie.Sean Penn and Brad Pitt pop in as themselves.Then there's of course John Malkovich playing John Horatio Malkovich.I wonder what they would have done if John hadn't accepted the part.Maybe the title would have been Being...something, something. The movie offers lots of funny scenes.I laughed a long time when John went into his own head.And then there are the apes.It can also be dramatic from time to time.Being John Malkovich is a fine example of combining comedy and tragedy.Those two walk hand in hand in the movie as they often do in life.In the movie all those people want to go into the head of a movie star because they want to be someone else for a while.In real life you can't be anybody else.You're stuck with yourself.All you can do is act.But it won't do no good.Be yourself.Being yourself is the best you can do.",10,5,10,29 June 2006

Woo likes to use doves flying around in action scenes and slow motion scenes are also his trade mark.There are some breath taking scenes in this movie where the characters shoot in slow motion with powerful music hearing.John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are fine actors and together they are amazing.I recommend Face/Off for every action freak out there.,Null,1,1,20 March 2001
Cross of Iron," Fighting the war- The Peckinpah view
","Cross of Iron shows us WWII fought at the losers' side.We see a squad of German soldiers fighting on the Eastern Front in 1943.Unteroffizier Steiner leads the Wehrmacht infantry platoon in the Kuban bridgehead.He doesn't get along with the new commander, a Prussian officer called Stransky.His only goal is to get the Iron Cross to maintain the family honor.The legendary Sam Peckinpah is the man behind Cross of Iron (1977).Peckinpah was brave when he decided to make a movie about German soldiers.The movie certainly doesn't sympathize Hitler or the Nazi Party in general.These men here don't belong to the Party and we see some harsh criticism portrayed by Coburn's character.James Coburn is truly amazing in the role.Other actors do superb job as well.Maximilian Schell is Hauptmann Stransky.The aging star James Mason plays Oberst Brandt.David Warner is Hauptmann Kiesel.Klaus Löwitsch is Unterofficier Krüger while Vadim Glowna plays the part of Gefreiter Kern.Slavko Stimac is the Russian boy soldier Michail.Senta Berger plays the part of the beautiful nurse Eva.One of the most detestable character is Lieutenant Triebic, who's played by Roger Fritz.One terrific scene in this movie is when Steiner is in the military hospital and he sees visions.Also the moments before he's sent to hospital are pretty fantastic.The war portrayed here doesn't look beautiful or glorious.It's one big bloodbath for both sides.But it does look good on screen.",9,1,2,14 January 2009

Tropic Thunder," Vietnam part 2
","A group of actors go to Vietnam go to shoot a movie called Tropic Thunder based on the memoir by Vietnam veteran John 'Four Leaf' Tayback.Tugg Speedman, who plays Four Leaf, used to be one of the greatest.Now he is a fading star, with a flop like Simple Jack.Kirk Lazarus is a five-time Academy Award winner.He's an Australian method actor who's playing a black man, Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.Jeff Portnoy, a Chris Farley- like obese comical actor known for his fart comedies.He plays Fats and has a severe drug problem.Kevin Sandusky, the only normal guy of the group plays a young soldier named Brooklyn.Alpa Chino, a rapper portraying a soldier named Motown, who promotes his 'Bust-A-Nut' candy bar and 'Booty Sweat' energy drink.The movie turns out to be impossible to make and soon they find themselves fighting almost a real war, after Tugg is captured by Flaming Dragons and taken to their heroin factory.Ben Stiller, director, writer and actor of Tropic Thunder (2008).Robert Downey Junior plays Kirk, the actor with identity crisis.Jack Black is Jeff, who needs his dose in the jungle.There are times when this movie crosses the line.Maybe I'm a little old fashioned myself, who often looks back to those days when good taste was compulsory.But this isn't the worst choice of modern comedies, not even close.There was a lot there that made me laugh.The film starts with hilarious trailers that are starred by characters of this movie.I can't wait to find the DVD collection of Scorcher parts I-VI.And I'm looking forward for Fatties: Fart III.The scene of Simple Jack makes me wanna see the movie.Must be better than the critics say.The action of this movie works too.The shot where the bridge explodes as Tugg runs through it...It looks freakin awesome!",8,0,1,1 July 2009

Gone with the Wind," The movie that won't be gone with the wind
","This classic movie is set in the Civil War era, looking from the South's point of view.More than the war it concentrates on the troubled relationship between Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.Gone with the Wind (1939) is David O. Selznick production.Victor Fleming is its director.Also George Cukor and Sam Wood worked briefly in the project.The movie is based on Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer-winning novel from 1936.Selznick had troubles finding the female star.But eventually the right gal was found.The role of Scarlett O'Hara went to Vivien Leigh.Everybody knew Clark Gable would be the right man to play Rhett Butler.Leslie Howard had to be made look younger as Ashley Wilkes.My favorite character must be Melanie Hamilton, who is played by the lovely Olivia de Havilland.She is one of the few cast members to be still alive today.Olivia turned 95 last year.Thomas Mitchell plays Gerald O'Hara.Barbara O'Neil plays Ellen O'Hara.Evelyn Keyes is Suellen and Ann Rutherford is Carreen O'Hara.The latter one is 91 today.Hattie McDaniel portrays Mammy.She was the first black American to win an Oscar.It won nine more of those.Another black actress, Butterfly McQueen plays Prissy, a character quite the opposite of Mammy.Ward Bond is seen as Tom, Yankee Captain.Alicia Rhett plays India Wilkes.She is the oldest (b. 1915) surviving cast member.Other surviving members are Mary Anderson (Mary Merriweather) and Mickey Kuhn (Beau Wilkes).The movie has plenty of classic moments, like that 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn'.They had some problems with using the word damn.Luckily they got away with it, because 'Frankly my dear, I just don't care' would have sounded lame.This movie has a reputation as a chick flick.But there's also the war theme, so I can't see why us men can't enjoy the movie as well.Sure it's possible that women get more out of it, but no one can deny the movie's classic value.The year 1939 was a good year, movie-wise.This movie, that was made in glorious Technicolor, is one of the brightest classics from that year.",9,1,1,29 February 2012

","Woody Allen is comedian Alvy Singer.He's Jewish, he's neurotic and he lives in New York.He goes to a psychoanalysis to hear that Freudian mumbo jumbo, which is very helpful of course.Sounds like a Woody Allen movie to me.In the movie Alvy goes through his relationship history and what went wrong in them.He concentrates particularly on one of them, the one he had with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).Of course Diane and Woody were actually going out and this is obviously a movie about their relationship.And Keaton's real name is Diane Hall.Woody's character speaks straight to the camera and steps into his past every now and then.He could go back to his childhood, listen to his parents quarrel or go sit in the classroom.That, I think is very well done in the movie.Woody Allen is a genius of movie making.Believe me, he is.Annie Hall (1977) is just terrific,wonderful, a masterpiece of romantic comedies.The dialogue, just listen to the dialogue and you know what I'm talking about.Every member of the cast is excellent, not just Allen and Keaton.I could mention Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duval, Janet Margolin, Paul Simon, Christopher Walken, Jonathan Munk.Jeff Goldblum and Sigourney Weaver pop in there.Truman Capote is seen walking looking like himself.I can recommend Annie Hall for all those reasons mentioned up there.Maybe you can think of some others.Just go watch the movie.Why are you wasting your time reading this review, this mumbo jumbo of mine? You'd be half way the movie by now.",10,2,4,3 July 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick take us to an unforgettable journey into space and beyond
","The story begins from the dawn of man, from the prehistoric era when the apes ruled the Earth.A rectangular monolith is being discovered by some of them, an object placed by aliens.In the distant future the evolution has taken the man into space.Another monolith is being found from the surface of the moon.In the year 2001 S.S.Discovery with its crew, captains Dave Bowman and Frank Poole and their computer HAL-9000 are on their way to Jupiter to find out what alien force is watching us.After a while HAL starts causing some trouble...Arthur C. Clarke, who we sadly lost at the age of 90 last March came up with the story of 2001.He was inspired by a short story called 'The Sentinel' he had written in 1948.Clarke was such a great science fiction author and this is such a fantastic story.Stanley Kubrick, who we lost in 1999 at the age of 70 made Clarke's story into a film.And what a great film it is.The cast is very good.Keir Dullea plays the part of Dr.Dave Bowman.Gary Lockwood is Dr.Frank Poole.Douglas Rain provides the voice of HAL.William Sylvester plays Dr.Heywood R. Floyd.Vivian Kubrick, Stanley's daughter is seen as his daughter he calls squirt.Margaret Tyzack is Elena.There's a lot of classical music used in this movie that works brilliantly.There's 'The Blue Danube' by Johan Strauss there.GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti was behind most of that fantastic music.This is a movie that's hard for you to fully understand.Even Arthur C. Clarke once said: 'If you understand '2001' completely, we failed.We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.'I've seen this movie a few times, four perhaps and it hasn't totally opened to me yet.But nevertheless it's a very cool movie experience.2001: A Space Odyssey came 40 years ago, in 1968.After all these years it still looks great.",9,0,4,17 December 2008

Singin' in the Rain," What a glorious movie!
","It's the year 1927 and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a silent film couple. Their latest movie is transformed into a musical but for Lina the transition to talkies isn't so easy-she has the most horrible singing voice.But they have a solution to that problem.They dub over her voice using an actress called Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds).There is the plot for this incredible movie called Singin' in the Rain (1952).Gene Kelly (1912-1996) in the lead is just brilliant.The way he sings!The way he dances!The way he acts!He was a star that you can't find too many these days.He wasn't only the star of this movie, he also directed it with Stanley Donen.I have to give credit to other actors too because they really deserve it.Debbie Reynolds (1932-) is wonderful as Kathy.Donald O'Connor, who plays Don's former partner Cosmo Brown is superb.Unfortunately Donald passed away this year to heart failure at the age of 78.We will miss you, Donnie. This movie has the most amazing singing and dancing scenes.Just watch how Gene sings and dances in the rain so cheerfully without a worry on his mind.And O'Connor's performance Make 'Em Laugh is really something. They really don't make movies like this anymore.Some people want to bring the musicals back and that's good.Chicago and Moulin Rouge are two modern musical movies and probably there will be more.But I think the magic's gone.There was magic in the musicals when there were Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.But those days are gone now.Watch Singin' in the Rain and have a piece of the good old times.",Null,2,6,16 December 2003

The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is not your typical romantic movie.It's no wonder since Charlie Kaufman was writing it.He can come up with an eccentric film like this.Michel Gondry is the director.There are some science fiction elements in this movie.That's one of the reasons this movie is as interesting as it is.Jim Carrey, who we know mostly as a comedian gives a fantastic dramatic performance as Joel.It's a little tragicomic when he goes back to being a little child in his memories and he cries.That's so heartbreaking yet amusing with his mommy and those bullies there.Kate Winslet with the changing hair color is brilliant as Clementine.Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine.Sorry, just couldn't help it but that's such a wonderful song that we also hear in this movie.The fantastic Tom Wilkinson plays Dr.Mierzwiak.Other great performances include Mark Ruffalo, who plays Stan.Elijah Wood is Patrick and Kirsten Dunst is Mary.David Cross and Jane Adams play the roles of Rob and Carrie.This is a movie I recommend for all those who are into original films.This is a movie not to forget.",9,0,2,16 December 2008

Rob Reiner's When Harry Met Sally... (1989) is a brilliant example of a fine romantic comedy.It's not kind of romantic comedy you see all the time (not that I watch them all the time), but it's something very different.In this movie you can't tell anything for sure, what will happen to these characters, will they end up together etc.It has got some superb dialogue.You won't hear dialogue like this in too many modern movies.Nora Ephron is behind the brilliant writing.Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan make a terrific leading couple.Billy can be both comical and serious.Meg gives one of her finest performances in this movie.The supporting cast is amazing as well.There's Carrie Fisher as Marie.The director's mother Estelle Reiner makes a memorable visit in the movie.And then there's Bruno Kirby as Jess.I just read on IMDb that this terrific actor died of leukemia a few days ago at 57.I was devastated about the news.I have seen Bruno in so many movies always giving a fine performance.I really admired the man and now he's gone.The best of them always leave us too soon.I suggest you'd watch his movies and see what a great actor he was.Watch When Harry Met Sally... and see what a great movie it is.",10,0,1,17 August 2006

You can't fail with these people.I'm not saying Bruce Almighty is a masterpiece, not at all.But it is highly entertaining, and most importantly it made me laugh.It's awfully funny watching Jim Carrey using his powers.One time he makes Steve Carell look like a total fool live on TV.They're both terrific comedians who have been blessed with the ability to make people laugh.They say there's going to be a sequel for this next year called Evan Almighty with Steve in the lead.We'll see what's that going to be like.This may not be the most critically acclaimed movie but I acclaim it.And I praise the Lord for giving us Bruce Almighty.",9,0,2,30 November 2006

Live Free or Die Hard," John McClane- back in action
","20 years ago Die Hard (1988) introduced us detective John McClane, played by Bruce Willis.He fought against terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza.Two years later we saw the same cop in Washington D.C. at Dulles Airport fighting for his life.In 1995 the New York cop goes back home and goes all over city looking for bombs.Those were all good action movie.The first part is an action movie classic.I saw it for the first time in 1994 and was amazed.After seeing the third part I started waiting for the 4th part and last year it finally happened.Yippee Ki Yay! John McClane is back and he's still the cowboy! I saw the film a couple of weeks ago, September 28th.It was Sunday.I may not be as exited of it as I would have been in the late 90's but it's still pretty cool.Now McClane is fighting against cyber-terrorists that are hacking into FBI computers.That is an unknown world for this analog cop.With him he has this young guy, hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long).Bruce Willis is bald and a little bit older this time as John McClane.But he's still as tough.Justin Long is good as his young and scared partner.Kevin Smith is Warlock.Maggie Q is the female villain Mai Lihn that kicks.The main villain, Thomas Gabriel is played by Timothy Olyphant.He doesn't quite have what Alan Rickan had as Hans Gruber.Or William Sadler as Coloner Stuart.Or Jeremy Irons as Simon Gruber.There's also John's daughter Lucy in this part, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.It would have been great if Bonnie Bedelia would have reprised her role as Holly Gennero, I mean McClane.But that didn't happen since they're divorced.Len Wiseman, a director I didn't know previously directed Live Free or Die Hard (2007).In Finland and in some other countries it's known as Die Hard 4.0.John McTiernan and Renny Harlin did steady job with the previous parts.This time there's this younger fellow in charge and the movie is also for the younger audience.It's rated PG-13 instead of rated R.That's a little disappointment since after all this is Die Hard we're talking about.Why must pretty much everything be for the young teens today? But it does have some great action scenes.Take Bruce Willis and the truck for instance.Or the car colliding with the helicopter.And when he's in the elevator shaft with Mai.He was in the elevator shaft also in the first part, except this time he's there with a car.This is a nice addition to the Die Hard franchise.I guess all we can do now is wait for Die Hard 5.",8,0,1,10 October 2008

Night Shyamalan.Mr Shyamalan is becoming one of the top directors in Hollywood.There are some great actors in this movie.Bruce Willis is good as always but it's Haley Joel Osment who steals the show.He does a brilliant role work as the kid who sees ghosts.This 12 year old child genius had his big screen debut on Forrest Gump (1994) with the Oscar winner Tom Hanks.Haley himself was nominated for an Oscar last year but it was Michael Caine who got it.Haley should have won it.There are lots of spooky parts in this movie that keep you scared to the very end.There's a surprising twist in the end.Surprising for those who don't know what it is yet.I recommend The Sixth Sense for everybody.I guarantee you can't sleep after this movie without checking under the bed first.",Null,0,0,14 March 2001

The Producers is a Mel Brooks masterpiece from 1968.It has got the best actors.Zero is far from zero in the lead.Gene Wilder also guarantees you laughs.Kenneth Mars makes Nazis look ridiculous, which they were. Christopher Hewett is hilarious playing the actor, who plays Hitler on stage.That wouldn't have made Adolf proud, but I really don't care. This is some brilliantly written stuff, which isn't a surprise since it was written by Mel Brooks.People still seem to love The Producers.I mean, a lot of people went to see it on stage with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.This year there is an other movie version coming, with also Nat and Matt.Why wouldn't they love it? It's always funny, when a Jewish genius makes fun of the most hated dictator. So watch this movie and have a springtime of your life.",10,6,9,25 February 2005

But Alex finds a way to cheat Death.But is it possible? Final Destination is an excellent slasher horror movie from last year.It has some very talented young actors who may be unknown to the world now but maybe not for long.Dewon Sawa plays Alex and he does a great job.I'm sure he will be a big star in the future.Then there are Ali Larter (Clear Rivers) and Kerr Smith (Carter Horton) who may also be future's stars.Seann William Scott (Billy Hitchcock) proved his talent in a modern classic called American Pie (1999).Final Destination has many thrilling moments that make sure you won't get bored.It keeps you in its touch from the beginning to the very end.I recommend Final Destination for everybody who likes to see a good horror movie.I don't recommend this for those who are afraid of flying.,Null,1,3,28 February 2001

","June 17, 1972.Five men are arrested after breaking and entering into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel complex.This becomes a national scandal that eventually leads to the resignation of President Richard Nixon on August 9, 1974.Two Washingon Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein do a lot of work to find all the dirt that is involved in the story.Their job was never easy because people had hard times naming names of the ones involved.Woodward was helped a little by a man they called Deep Throat.The identity of Deep Throat was kept in secret.It wasn't until 2005 when it was announced that a man named William Mark Felt Sr, Deputy Director of the FBI, then 91, was Deep Throat.Alan J.Pakula's movie is a masterpiece of political thrillers.The tension is kept on from the very first second till the end.All the President's Men (1976) is based on the book written by those two brave men, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.It was Robert Redford who made this picture possible.He saw a story that needed to be made into a movie.He was also the right man to be performing Bob Woodward.And as Carl Bernstein we get to see the brilliant Dustin Hoffman.These two men share an awful lot of chemistry together.Just like Woodward and Bernstein did.And the rest of the cast isn't any lesser.Jason Robards is very fine as the legendary managing editor of Washington Post.Jack Warden plays Harry M.Rosenfeld.Martin Balsam plays Howard Simons, the man who came up with the name 'Deep Throat' for the man with classified information.Hal Holbrook plays this man of the shadows and what a fine job he does.Jane Alexander is Judy Hoback.Ned Beatty performs Martin Dardis.Stephen Collins plays Hugh Sloan.Meredith Baxter, who became known as Elyse Keaton of Family Ties during next decade, plays his wife Debbie Sloan.Robert Walden is Donald Segretti.F.Murray Abraham plays Sgt.Paul Leeper.Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos is Eugenio R.Martinez.Richard Herd is James W.McCord Jr.The legendary news anchor Walter Cronkite is heard there.He and many other people who were there spoke on the DVD features.I learned a lot from this movie.It's full of memorable scenes.One fine scene is where Bob thinks their lives are in danger and so he plays music very loud and starts typing.And when the television shows Gerald R.Ford announcing Richard Nixon for the second term while Bob and Carl are writing his doom.This is a winner of four Academy Awards.It included William Goldman for writing while Jason Robards got one for his performance.All that stuff that took place then were still pretty fresh when this movie was made.It's important for the modern viewers to watch this movie now so we know what happened.And this movie remains current today because we will always have rotten politicians, those who only think of their own interest.That's why we need movies like this, to show us how these people work.",10,4,4,13 June 2008
The Wizard of Oz," Magical transition from Kansas to somewhere over the rainbow
","Can you believe I just saw this movie?! I've watched many classics over the years, but I just hadn't got to this one. Until this week. And I'm glad I did.The young Judy Garland as Dorothy singing Somewhere over the Rainbow is one memorable moment. And that's just one among lots of others in this movie. And all those lovable characters, The Scaregrow who wants to have a brain, The Tin Man who wants to have a heart and the Cowardly Lion who wants courage. Not to forget The Munchkins. The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a timeless classic, that's suitable for both kids and adults. Some kids may find some scenes rather scary, though. If you haven't seen this one yet, go do it now!",9,5,6,13 June 2015
