Skyfall," This is the end, the end of Bond
","There are a lot of movies that are really popular but you do not like them, then there are those movies that many people like you do not understand why and why you need a time or look at them again and slowly understand what people love and then there the movies are probably the columns of opinion because exactly the things the other people love about you just did not like you. 'Skyfall' is not one of those movies that is a movie I did not like from the first time and with each new watch it got worse and worse. I still can not understand why anyone can like this movie and still am still shocked to see how many people worship this movie. That people love this movie is bad enough but that they praise this movie as much as anyone else that is the biggest tragedy 'Skyfall' contains no suspense the drama is passable but the effects are funny there is no real plot I third of the movie is just jumping from one place to the next and so I really really took a long time to follow the process of the movie It's always going to be bad if you only see an action movie but you have to read through the Wikipedia article to get the plot (I mean that's not Blade Runner what the complicated storyline?), but I'm a lot more baffled the train that arrives so well on the ground nothing done dirt that has no special quality or anything special. I even go so far as to say that the film would not even have received a third of the money of praise or prizes if not for the brand name James Bond. Everything in this movie is stupid the characters you suffer can die all the ones you do not like die sometime later but then not in a good way, Javier Bardem looks like they painted him the visage, and the movie is literally anti-climatic you because the entire last third is even more boring than the rest of the movie. So the movie starts okay, then gets annoying then gets boring and ends in just awful. I do not understand today it was the people who loved this movie so much and I honestly lost interest in the answer, of course I know the tastes are always different and not all like that but if he changes me half a puzzle want and say that is the most beautiful picture in the world although over half missing and what you see looks like ass then I miss the words. My conclusion, of course, is that the James Bond films are not always the best in the world and I know that they are made for entertainment only because none of these films will get you an Oscar or be represented very much in the general movie encyclopedia but Skyfall is absolutely shitty, Direct are pretty stupid, the drama is tolerable, the record is super stupid, the end is a single insult and the music would be pitiful even for a Disney musical. This movie should die.",1,3,7,14 November 2017
It," White Noise
","Unfortunately the film is not exactly subtle, it is way too often exaggerated and too loud.
He does not go into the emotional one, so what really happens to do such things with the psyche of one, but rather makes jokes or cuts directly to a quiet teeth, wasting his full potential. In addition, nothing in this movie is subtly so exaggerated music, too loud jumpscares, too loud sound effects and so on.
There were a few things that I liked but the negative things cover the positives and I think the book was not adapted very well but too superficially just flown over.",4,1,1,15 September 2019
Kung Fu Panda," Do not judge a movie by the title.
","I do not know that it is still possible. Thanks to first impressions advertisements and personal experience. I thought I would get a stupid silly children's movie that hopefully can entertain your 3 year old.BUT I was 100% wrong. The movie was incredible in the truest sense of the word.
It was a really serious, and profound martial-arts-film you can also interpreting with a good message.Po is, of course, a typical 'All-Loving Hero,' but in this movie, it was indeed a good fit to understand his goals and motivation, so you are always excited when he went one step further and was happy with his success and progress the time is learning more and more.
In addition, I find Tai Lung is not a good opponent let alone antagonist. He has a good fighting style but does not do much and is not really taken seriously of his cheap motivation.
That would be tolerable if he was at least really dangerous or visibly evil, but he's just a strong jerk.
Tai Lung does not even have a really balanced character design, a few red or black shades would have done him good.That made the whole movie a wonderful experience and tied me to the screen from the first second.
The colors, the world and the music immediately fascinated me and all with such an interesting lore that I first thought it was a bit wasted on a children's movie.
But there I was also completely wrong, because the idea and implementation are so perfectly interlocked that it's great to grow up with such a movie.All that and a few super cool fights that you could compare to a Jackie Chan movie.
The only things you could probably improve on are Po's clumsiness. Because the fat comic relief is not permanently funny.
Because in a movie about learning to fight kungfu, and that you should take geeks seriously, this is only to some extent endured.
Besides, the character names are chosen rather uncreative, of course we have some good ideas, such as: Grand Master Oogway (Chinese for 'Tortoise') or Master Shifu (Chinese for 'Master'). But then we also have names like Tigress, Crane, Monkey, Mantis and Viper what the hell?",7,0,0,12 November 2018
Se7en," This is a movie that made some of you could not forget so quickly
","This movie is about an ingenious pair of detectives played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt the two are looking for a dangerous serial killer with a scare then precision, totality and pleasure in the days and approach several people murdered according to the motto of the 7 deadly sins.The stuff has no big stickers or crazy time lines just one of the police's story left on the floor and that's what makes it so disturbing and psycho table then theoretically any of us could pass and so on the floor this is probably the most mental scary movie could be on this list.
Every actor here has everything out that only goes with acting from all sides the absolute grasp the fist.Even Brad Pitt I absolutely do not like makes a good figure here.
This is a movie that made some of you could not forget so quickly.",7,0,0,17 September 2018
Monster," A killer movie with a killer performance
","He is definitely a really good movie that has impressed and surprised me in many ways. I do not like watching movies that deal with crime. Just say I'm not a fan of crime thrillers or crime movies but I'm very interested in what's going on in the human head and that's why movies based on true events and the biography of a criminal or convicted person are always very interested I do not have much of this Film expected and even if I had that I would still be surprised to the most positive.
The actors are doing a great job but I can not say more about the story the music the rest of the movie is okay but I think the director is really unique and this is one of those movies where I wish there were more female directors because there are some topics feelings and mindsets in films that can only be followed by a woman and therefore only women can bring decent.So this is not a movie I would buy or anything but definitely one that I would watch at again when he is on TV or whatever I can recommend to anyone who is also interested but I say you should have a strong stomach.PS:
I take my hat off to Charlize Theron not only because she is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful white women of all time.
she is a fantastic actress who always goes out of her way even in her bad movies she does a good job and a good job and here comes the best of her for show and I just can not believe what the make up artist did for a fantastic job because they are unknowable and it's almost unbelievable who is going to do it.

Memento," In chronological order the movie would not be that good
","I'm so fond of this movie that I even thought about playing this part of the review backwards.The story of a man with blackouts trying to find the murderer of his wife does not sound very exciting.
Because you need a lot of talent to present that interesting, a lot of courage to dare to publish such a lame story at all and a lot of creativity to bring out the special and to present it in a unique way.
No joke I think Memento is one of those movies that would be mediocre if not for the super creative narrative structure and the excitement you got from talented people in front of and behind the camera.
Here was clearly the thriller aspect capitalized so I did not just have to watch this movie several times, I even think that we should shoot more movies in the Memento style or make some remakes and shoot them like Memento Hey I would do all those Watch movies again if they are shot like memento.",8,1,1,21 August 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," This movie is just OK.
","As a kid I've loved pirates and adored pirate-movies, as growing up I do not even know how many times I saw the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, how often I quarreled about it.
Man, this was my favorite movie.When the fourth Film was released, I wanted to watch the first one to get rid of the bad taste and the terrible memory of all the other movies. I took her on a weekend time, put myself in the right mood, had a big plate of pancakes on my table and saw, after a long time, the 'Pirates of the Caribbean 1' again in the atmospheric light with my freshly purchased boxes and the best sound...And Now:
The plot is relatively complicated tolled for such a simple pirate adventure, all locations look quite chic so I think it's a shame how much time on the water or on ships spend. The special effects are pretty cool, I like the eerie atmosphere and the actors manage to convey it correctly, making you feel like you're part of it. Even the costumes and make-up contribute to the impression that I do not see actors but I really see these characters. I think Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were born for these roles.
I'm sooo happy to see again Disney movie with action and sword fight instead of musical numbers.But:
This movie was just below my expectations. It was not so exciting, not so cool, not so funny, not so thoughtful and not as creative as I thought or remembered.And to my astonishment, the movie is not nearly as good... as I thought.
The movie was still good but, maybe I had lower demands as a kid, maybe the movie is still good but my taste and expectations are now too high, maybe the movie was never good was never that good to begin with and as a kid I tolerated it more or anything else happened so I can say today this movie is just OK.",6,0,1,29 December 2018
Beauty and the Beast," This movie is The beauty in the beast
","Oh yes, Beauty and the Beast
I will now list all the things that I liked about this movie.
The beautiful animation
The colors
The character design (despite the limitation of realism)
The camera rides
3 of the songs
GastonNow we come to the things that I do not like in this movie.
All other songs,
the music
The backgrounds
The next to characters
The romantic
The love story
The absolutely verrschung worthy messageI know even that this movie is based on a storybook, how often Disney changes stories he fits into their canon and it just as with the little mermaid does not make sense to compare it to original story.
It is enough to mention that both stories have my absolute contempt for the same reasons and that I am not satisfied with the story's execution.
There are other things about this movie that you might want to mention, however, is the story, the plot plot the foundation on which this movie turns out to be so despicable in my eyes that I love the beauty and the beast with all the attention to detail and the visual Glamor performance can never count so my positive movie experiences in.",4,0,1,14 August 2018
The Fifth Element," Visually unique, content wise cheap
","From a visual point of view, this film is one of the most impressive of my life, every second looks like a painting. The movie sets the colors the props everything is beautiful. Although I do not always like the costumes and I want to ask a few questions in some design decisions, I would say that the movie is a masterpiece. (From a visual point of view) But then he is pulled down by the fact that the script looks as if it had written a small child or comes from a children's book. The narrative style, the narrative structure everything is cooked really soft and fade the characters are quite okay but the dialogues are, please do not misunderstand, too stupid for science fiction. Especially during the climax I had the feeling that every moment 'Dora the Explorer' shows up and asks for me help.However, I think Dora got lost in the plot holes, no plot caves. Not every story has to be infinitely complicated but if you make a movie out of it, we expect it to be a movie and if this movie has a PG-13, then I'll rate that as well. I am against the age restrictions, but even as a 13 year old boy would this cheap narrative + black and white representation of good and evil bother me tremendously.The story is the most important thing that makes a good movie and when I get such a 'My Little Pony Fanfiction' that even my 5 year old cousin finds miserable mixed with costumes and furniture that belong in a museum, then I get headaches, depressions and gripes at the same time. I think it's a pity that all these wonderful set pieces and technological details are stuck between this crap of script. I'd rather have a movie with a fantastic script and awful flaws than the other way around.Bruce Willis is fantastic as always he could play a Nazi and I would still like the man. Chris Tucker is unbearable but Milla Jovovich has anything in this performance which just fills me with hate. I do not know what it is, whether it's her voice her costume or the way she talks like a baby, something annoys me so much that I always want to skip her parts because I'm afraid I'm going to go crazy. I like Gary Oldman but here he is totally wasted in this movie Zorg is a totally superfluous character that has no (major) impact on the course of the story.It's also really difficult to assign a fixed genre to this movie, what is it? Is this Comedy Action, SciFi Action, SciFi Comedy? Is it satire, is it serious or a costume orgy?PS: A lot of people like that the protagonist and antagonist never meet firstly Zorg is not the antagonist but only a lackey from the real villain, we never met our hero, Korben Dallas do not know about Zorg's existence or its influence the whole thing. That's why it's not worth mentioning. I like that the film has a theme of 5 that is a nice Easter Egg what I did not notice the first time.But on the other hand film has two TV troops I loathe as a solution to the problems.My conclusion: applause for Luc Besson ideas and cinematography but I can do without his films.",4,1,3,17 November 2017
Blade," So everyone who loves Twilight, will hate Blade.
","In itself a super cool movieBlade is definitely super cool money for the movie as well as for the main character. However, the film has little '90s troops that are quite outdated and take something out of the sails of the wind, the same goes for the' 90s CGI effects, but instead kicked 3 annoying action movie cliches as it should be.I love to watch movies that stand out from the others. I love it when I do not know who in that time a surprisingly big part and I love R rated comic book adaptations (Blabe came first).But there are many things about this movie that bother me, such as the constant shaky cam, is a tripod really that expensive? The back and forth intersect between the normal dialogues, not everything has to be presented excitingly high 10, because that makes the really exciting something bland. The main villain is just as old as muscular and looks as cool as the hero, so it would be better if he stings out more, especially as he is in a wheel full of old men who look like they are having children's souls to fight to the top as he represents the new kind and the new danger. Then do it too dangerously enough: if your rogue is not cool, then make him ... huge and scary, scary, super strong, diabolical, or at least entertaining enough that it does not interest you like boring.Seriously Deacon Frost just does not say it out and behaved like that until the climax, I wonder why we and the ever wasting our time with him, at least if he was super pretty and always well-dressed, you could at least to conclude that he served only as their figurehead and that would explain his motivation but unfortunately no! Nothing like that!Or we just change a few character traits and attributes in this movie because Frost's right hand, his asshole, was so nasty and so annoying that she always wanted to clap her hands when Blade missed one, her jokes were damned funny and his whole character so exhausting that you're just waiting to satisfy the feeling of salvation when he finally dies. (Unfortunately, a fight as well as his death like sex with a tuna can is painful, disappointing and totally anti-climactic.But those are the mistakes in the script that was probably stretched to double length (with over 10 minutes of filler), an amateur music video editing and post credit scene which for some reason was inserted after a blackout but before the credits, there are only a few plot Holes in the bad plan but otherwise there is not much to find worthy in this movie.The fights are exciting, so the characters are super interesting the whole movie has a cool look, only half of the movie is night city and even the scenes that take place at night are neatly photographed and lit up so you can see enough and that Film has enough stuntwork for about 50 trailers.",7,1,2,13 January 2018
The Mummy," Looks to me like you're on the wrong side of the MOVIE!
","It was one of the first films I saw in Germany. I have seen this movie about 3 times as a kid but loved it every time.Now that I'm an adult and have a clue, I see what a pretty Lama movie is not that bad or anything. It's just a big budget movie the special effects are better in an animated movie comma many 90s troops are present in there but unfortunately not the most intelligent, the forces as well as the laws of nature in this movie are so inconsistent and the casting is not really fitting point so none of that Actors are bad, they make an effort and so on, but I do not know what's missing there.Since the film is sometimes really cheesy a cheesy actor like Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Lundgren might be better suited or a dirty actor like Bruce Campbell, Kurt Russell, or Gerard Butler.
I would honestly leave the rest like that because then it would be balanced or overtake the cast and change only a few characters otherwise I like how ironic the movie is because there are a few things that are obviously only in there because they should look cool and in the movie That's at least addressed anyway, I have a problem with humor.
The beginning of the movie is like chewing gum the jokes are absolutely not funny the character of Evelyn's brother is absolutely superfluous and so not entertaining that he just annoyed and the middle of the movie is a bit repetitive.Making a good movie is difficult to make a remake, so taking a movie with a great concept and just packing it into another genre is a very smart idea and I would say they did that partially, you can not do it cheap Variant of Indiana Jones designate it looks more like a movie version of 'Relic Hunters'.
However, I have always wondered why Tab always had such a stupid curse that made him transfer money, but what do I know? I've always wondered why the Arabs can not be our main characters because they're pretty entertaining, but what do I know?All in all found. I thought the movie is alright not good not bad but quite enjoyable there are some things I liked it there are a few things I do not understand but I have not taken the urge to answer these questions.",6,2,4,17 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman, Spiderman, comes home like a spider can
","Now what can I say it is the Marvel Most Moderate Spiderman movie of all, with a big ethnic different cast and I know it sounds weird because I'm a foreigner myself a bit too much. It's one of the few MCU movies that can not stand on its own, but in a few places it has too many jokes, but at least it's really funny. Spiderman Homecoming is absolutely awesome, super fun exciting and has every five minutes any things that tickle your nerves and bring your feelings to light. I also find the new style that the films take with the modernization of the optical look and, above all, the size of the film is very appealing. The old Spiderman movies by Sam Remmi will always have a special place in my heart but these are films for other times. In addition, this movie contains in what most films, not superhero films but most of the films are missing in all danger. The danger of failing to be humbled the danger etc. Rarely have I really had the feeling that the characters in a movie are in danger this film shows us the danger and delivers it to us correctly and that's best because we can take the danger seriously. Tom Holland is awesome and Michael Keaton ages like good wine. But though I like all the characters, Peter's best friend is a bit strange it does not quite fit in with the world of Spiderman. The character of Michelle (MJ) got on my nerves so hard I can put it into words like is a Lisa Simpson 2.0 and it's always a downer it's unbelievable, the pacing and up movies is just in a nutshell and it is wonderful. But why are the 50s high school drama aspects repeating? Why do all the battles take place at night? And what does the police actually film in the superheroes?The fights are super uninteresting and repeat in their moves again and again, the direction of the action is directly on MTV quality and this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the MCU. Call it 'Peter Parker: Iron Man Jr.' What the movie does best .... It's just that it was a remake, tribute, reissue or adaptation. 1. Enough nostalgia references for the old fans. 2. create enough own for the new fans. 3. enough explanations for those who have no idea but want to know why it works and 4. The most important! A natural interest arouse so that you feel like you have to deal more with this franchise.",7,3,4,29 November 2017
Blade II," Blade 2 It's a super good movie
","Blade 2 It's a super good movie but I do not know why so many people say it's even better than the first one. The film is no doubt cooler than the first but not automatically better because the pessimist is slower and the movie is a bit smaller in any case a smaller one. With over 10 minutes filler.However bad looks different I always find it awesome when the people in a sequel idea in expand and at least enough new offer that you can watch the movie itself so you could watch this movie without knowing who Blade is or without the first And yet you would never be lost, that's the right way to make a sequel.The movie has a super cool look, the slogans are wandering out, sometimes they are not that good at me, but not so much that it bothers me. The movie does not come with many surprises that can really surprise but I think that was not the goal.The battles are unfortunately not so nice because too much CGI effects are used which have not been decently changed and the movements are inhumane. I do not know why but this movie has not been filmed in Cinemascope for some reason either. And the film editing is very difficult to follow.Catapulting the middle draws a bit and the movie has no big surprises the last half hour makes everything worth of that is why you watch this movie the last half hour is top North best fights best effects and best action that is the right way how to make movies.Gillamo Del Torro has used the right people here and his visual look fits perfectly in this bleak world the computer effects are just as bad as in the first part but I think that's intentional the practical effects are fantastico.",7,1,3,13 January 2018
Taxi Driver," i have no idea
","So maybe I'm just not in the right age to fully appreciate this movie, maybe it's because I do not live in America and therefore can not understand many things. Maybe I'm just too young to understand many things I'm only in my early 20's and I'm sure I do not have as much life experience as the characters in this movie. But for some reason I did not like the movie so much, so I did not think you were bad or boring or somehow but I can not quite say why this movie is being quoted Why are there constant comparisons with this movie or why so many people behind the movie? to run after. I feel like watching the movie again someday and you can really learn something from this drama the camera work is also unique I am absolutely sure this is a helpful movie and everyone who likes the movies should have already seen it to further educate. But I'll be watching the ocean again in a couple of years because I'm sure my opinion has changed and I hope I can say more about what I've seen.

Otherwise, unfortunately I can not really say much about this movie because I do not really like it because I have not thought about it for a long time so I looked him over several times to be really sure because I thought at first maybe I just did not understand him then I thought maybe I was not paying enough attention and I thought I should give the movie another chance but now I find it even worse than before so I do not even try to deal with it the less I get from this movie better.",2,1,4,17 November 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Marvel's Mulan American edition
","It's just the kind of movie I always wanted to see and wanted to do myself
It has remained a typical superhero story on the ground and not quite so super natural.
That's an advantage sometimes a disadvantage the interactions of the people are the best.
There is a place where a child is kidnapped and then it is thrown into a river by evil our hero wants to go after but the boy says 'no, no, I can swim, run after him'
There is a very dramatic place where the hero and his dear interest have to say goodbye, he goes away she kisses him first. He is surprised and Tommy Lee Jones just looks at him weirdly and says, 'I will not kiss her'
The film is full of little moments that are just typically Hollywood and sometimes kitschy but then skin on the table and says how things are. That's exactly what I love and I would watch if the movie was boring. The movie is anything but boring.
It's basically an American soldier version of 'Mulan' but without any crossdressing but I mean that in the best sense of the word.
Although the movie is nothing more than thick America propaganda but that was the comics, too
The movie is just a preview of the movie Marvel's The Avengers but those were the comics too ...
and of course you should see how cool and strong the American military is, but I repeat myself too often.
Since World War II was nothing else, I do not think you can complain about it. I think the villain is a little cheap at Hugo Weaving is a very talented actor and has a very angry voice in his appearance and appearance as The Red Skull left a lot to be desired.I hope he survived very much and come back to avenge himself that would be a little bit clichéd and often seen but if someone can do it right then Joe Johnston.",7,0,0,17 December 2018
Kung Fu Panda 2," It's clearly one of the best animated movies I've seen and one of the best sequels I've ever seen.
","I'm impressed that the makers took the relatively small concept and actually the expanded the story.
And I'm glad you've improved all the things that did not vote in the first part, at least with the characters here.
You clearly see a change but also a form of confusion compared to the predecessor because they can not believe how they all started and you see that the respect of others has earned and the recognition that he built here.
But 'A hero is only as good as his villain.'
And this is even better managed. This 'Lord Shen' is everything I want from a good villain. He is strong, smart, brave and a good fighter. But above all, really diabolical.
Really has a personal connection to our hero unlike any other.
Is everyone still funny that makes it so entertaining to see I like to see him but thanks to his actions I want to see how he loses.
That makes a great villain and his wonderful noble design gives him even a bit of class so he really deserves the title Lord.
I did not expect to hear anything about genocide in a children's movie. And it did not just seem to be thrown in, it was as if it had been planned from the start. A personal vendetta against the hero is one thing, but eradicating the entire Panda people puts them at such a new level of villains that I'm used to in animated films.
That was just great, that's why every time the two clashes at the edge of my seat, I did not know who was going to win and because I did not know how to cheer.
Unfortunately, he dies in a rather unspectacular way and loses his coolness in the last few moments, but it's literally only 2 seconds, so he's forgiven.
It's just wonderful I want to see where the journey leads us next and I can not wait to see more of it.",8,0,1,12 November 2018
American History X," Definitely a unique movie
","There are some great ideas and great artistic elements like everything that used to be filmed in black and white.
And it is always nice to see that there are also films dealing with problems from the here and now, namely discrimination and racism.
but the question is always how good is the movie
but such films always seem to excite me as an excuse or excuse and not to torture white minorities in front of the camera.So I just went a few scenes too long, I found a few of the dialogues are completely pulled on the ass hair because skinheads are so bald. But I have to applaud the movie because it's the first movie of my life that actually showed racism in a realistic way.Of course, there are other films about racism but people are just ugly ass bones screaming. As someone who belongs to a minority, we noticed in parallel and this was perfectly captured in the film because the problem of most racists here is that they believe they are right because they are convinced that they have to help others and with their actions You achieve that.
Of course I could still talk all the key scenes everywhere, the famous scenes like the conversations, the basketball scene or, of course, the curb scene the distance is more famous than the movie itself but I focus on the important.
And say the film is very realistic and artfully decent but not really good
I've been just as smart afterwards as before I've been as unimpressed afterwards as before, and I've felt less pity or anger than other films of this kind.",6,0,3,4 August 2018
Liar Liar," The 90s were really full of films from Workaholics.
","The film is nothing big and nothing earth-shattering but the acting by Jim Carrey is so over-the-top that I find it a bit of a shame that you don't get an Oscar for comedy rolls.
In itself it is a really great idea with a nice message, but I don't know if it is wise to end up with a pretty malty kitschy Hollywood in a movie that is about telling the truth because in the end everything turns out well and the couple comes back together is the biggest lie. I am sorry for the new friend of mine because I really think that he is a personable person and they deserve more than Jim Carrey's character who is just too unappealing.Despite his thin plot, Liar Liar is highlighted by Jim Carrey's exuberant physical humor, and the result is a laughing revolt that has helped to add to the comedian's appeal.But I like that the film has a relatively vulgar and rough way that makes it much more believable even though it is an adult film for children it is not held back when people shout at each other.despite everything I'm not happy with the end and wonder if that was really the right decision because Jim Carrey is unemployed at the end of the film, a good man with good intentions didn't get married, a boy who had the opportunity to get into a bigger one Moving to town continues to live alone with his mother in a small apartment, and the woman has come together with a constant lying to the idiots.Also, if he's such a good liar, I mean why doesn't Fletcher Reede just become an actor.
I know you don't have to do it with a hundred percent logic in the end it's still just a film but it has to be credible and meaningful somewhere.
or at least plausible enough that you can get involved to follow it.Art und Weise",5,1,2,18 May 2020
How to Train Your Dragon 2," This is a warm-up version of Part 1 pissing on it.
","To be honest, I'm quite surprised apart from the animation in World Building and the music.
Everything has been messed up in this part. All things really all the things that I have so much revered in the first movie has been here once folded and pulled through the buttocks.
'Hiccup' is no longer courageous but expresses his responsibility and his fate,
The mother whose death in the first part was still a linchpin of the parent's relationship turns out to be still alive but for that the dad just dies in a pretty stupid way, I just despised my favorite character 'Astrid' in this movie because she is completely stupid and in some ways reminded me of 'Daphne from Scooby-Doo'. and also the rest of the dragon riders regardless of whether you know the TV series or not simply characterless and wrong behaves.I am even more offended than after 'Dragonball Evolution', because this movie is successful.
Imagine a Harry Potter adaptation based on the blurb written by a one-armed dyslexic. And the super dubbing voice actor and voice actor make the whole thing even worse because it hurts to see how I wasted so much talent time and effort here.
Not all ideas are terrible, only the execution is the last and the super terrific animations work that has actually surpassed itself in this part kept me from turning off, however, it has not been able to reduce the suffering
I hate this movie because, in contrast to the first one, it's not good, it's just clichés without a clever twist or reissue, good characters destroyed, and some plot points just fetched from the bottom that foul the big picture with the still sticking chunk.
I hate this movie, all in all, it's not a good movie but in the overall standings, a low point in the movie series is a really bad sequel and an insult to the reputation of the franchise.I will always honor the first film but this sequel should die.",2,0,5,18 September 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," This movie is unsettling and unintelligent
","I do not even ask how such a stupid movie could make so much money. I'm only interested in why this film is loved by so many people. And why everyone considers him the best 'Mission Impossible' part. Did you all forget the third film? Anyway, the movie is as stupid as if a five year old had written the screenplay, all plot sort of looks absolutely the same as if the studio had only three sets available, the stereo typical characters in this movie are so embarrassing even Walt Disney itself I would be ashamed and the comic relief if you can call it that way I was totally on the pointer. Of course, not everything was terrible the climbing scenes on the skyscraper was wonderful. And some fights were good. But the whole movie is full of decisions where I had to take my head and screamed out loud why? And the pacing is crap, really cheap so that every five minutes to 99% in the movie I knew what happened next, that's not exciting. (The remaining 1% were just filming stupidity) There are movies you do not like but at least you can understand why other people love it. These movies just do not irritate you but all things you do not like irritate other people. However, this is a movie where it's not just about me personally, but it's about really technical mistakes. This movie is a poorly composed puzzle. (With missing pieces) And I can not understand, I really, really can not understand why this movie pleases people; and that he pleases just so many people disgusts me.",3,1,3,21 November 2017
Frozen," Actually, I have really mixed feelings about this movie.
","Because it's a really competent made movie with gorgeous animation and beautiful voice acting. But it's hold back by a weird convoluted story, weak characters and I hate musicals.My favorite character is Hans, for personal reasons, but even he is not a really fleshed out character because everything about him is a lie.I like the message of love this is really the strong point about this movie, with a great build up and an even better pay off. It is one of the few films in which the victim has saved itself and in which 'the love' of a couple is not in focus.
BUT even that is ruled by it's stupid fake out death. (And yes that annoyed me already while watching.)Nevertheless, the film has not much to offer in terms of content, most of it is simply meaningless, it is just meaningless filler and it only tries to keep the children occupied instead of really entertaining or teaching them.I openly admit after watching the movie I was happy for a week and wanted to tell everyone how much I like it. BUT when I really had to tell people what or why I liked it I noticed how much imade no sense, had no purpose and how stupid I felt.This is not a junk food movie because even junk food can taste good, this movie is opium.",5,4,5,18 March 2019

","This will probably shock many people but a movie that has never really been done for me is one of us love Spielberg allegedly best movies namely Schindler's list. Schindler's list is really a movie the upload has not triggered at me has Lust tell me that I have already told you that the most important thing about a movie for me is that he touched you somehow emotionally or that has her something says there were a lot of bad movies I've seen there were a lot of unnecessary films I saw and also a lot of boring Movies to Aldi in I could say something because they have triggered something in me and even boredom disgust to vote these are all feelings but if the film does nothing triggers with me then this is just the biggest you can send a movie can do if I have two Hours sitting close not feeling this is just sad. I prefer a bad movie that bores me offended and offended as a movie that is simply empty and does not taste good. What does the girl do the list? Well, I've seen a lot of second world war films watching metal messages is all possible perspectives and a possible feelings though Gin the list the only one of not one of these feelings drive even boredom anger or grief and I find a pity because I want this movie really really made great great music he is super filmed and so and I can not say to you actors what not even a thousand times was said, unfortunately, this is really the only movie that is just not for me and I was really shocked that that was the case. I always say that the miserable is the worst movie he has seen you or find one that I hate the most Varel who just pushed the wrong buttons with me, however, Steven Spielberg Schindler's list has absolutely no button pressed with me.

","I have seen this lousy apology for a cinematic-suicide only because I thought it's about hookers who sleep with half the city because they going to be on the breadline. Instead, I was punished with the story of two lovebirds who are too stupid to communicate with each other. They stold two hours of my life with a story that is more holey than a Swiss cheese, stinks more than an old mold cheese left for 3 weeks on the heater and pictures that were filmed so strange that it feels like someone would spank me with Picasso's. The costumes and sets are really beautiful, but you have no way to enjoy them, because the pseudo art-house style that penetrates the movie from all sides makes it absolutely horrible.I like all the actors and that makes it even worse because it feels like your best friend spit in your face again and again.
I hate this movie from beginning to end with every cell of my body. It's most likely made from the fires of hell was torturing me and the sooner I manage to forget that musical puke the faster I move towards to inner peace.",1,2,13,31 July 2018
Big Hero 6," I try to picture me without Baymax but I can't.
","After overdosing on Disney and superheroes, I urgently needed something to comedown.
I would never have expected in life that exactly this film could do it. It is one of the Marvelous Marvel films ever. And has revived some of the Disney tropes that have not been used since the days of Cinderella and the Jungle Book for a good reason.Probably no one is as surprised as me but all these things, all these ingredients and just these clichés have really promised me so that I could not get enough of this movie. Always I have the impression that time is standing still and I have discovered something new and just want to dive into this movie. I know that many things have been changed and there are some things that have nothing to do with the comic but ..
Who cares?
In space it does not look like 'Star Wars', 'Hellboy' is not a 'Men In Black' and the makers of 'Starship Troopers' never read the book. I was simply impressed, fascinated, encouraged, wanted to train, applauded and even had watery eyes at the end.Despite all these praises, unfortunately, I have to give a few criticisms:
The character relationships are resolved a bit too fast, the team is not exactly balanced and the members do not complement each other very well, it is called 'show, don't tell' but not 'just don't tell' and the end again is Typical Disney kitsch, but I think we would not be so over saturated with all the happy ending this movie would stand out a little better. It is a really very emotionally satisfying film that only suffers from the fact that it is between so many films that have tried the same.
But that makes it a hidden gem that I can always admire again.They say we are what we are But we don't have to be.",8,3,4,29 December 2018
Evil Dead," The movie is too serious, but not brutal enough
","So I think the movie is pretty garbage
I do not like horror movies is not a secret but I made the Evil Dead movies and so I was very curious how they might look today, with today's facts, today's technology, today's make-up etc
but unfortunately the movie does exactly the wrong thing that makes many horror movies today it takes too seriously, wide parts of the movie are completely dark so you can hardly see anything and the brutal scenes are once again cut as ugly as in a hip hop video so that you can not enjoy the full impact and impact of the injury at all, or suffer the pain.What a lot of people will not understand I think it's too good a lot too nice a lot to it yes it's too much with that and the cold drug withdrawal is way too serious that just does not fit into this kind of movie.
I want the beginning scene with the father who has to expel the evil from his daughter and because he does not succeed then then shoot.
but nothing else absolutely nothing I could not find anything about this movie, nothing in this movie was anything exciting, nothing was funny, nothing was scary and he was not even bored so he would be a good fall asleep just boring in terms of that he has moved and I wondered all the time when this garbage is finally over.I know the movie has its fans but I definitely do not have it I just thought it was disgusting and I'm glad to be left alone with this version of 'Evil Dead'.",2,1,4,4 August 2018

","I will not even list the things that are better in this movie than in the original because there are actually a few points. I could also mention that I did not know the original at all and have seen this movie completely virginal even in the cinema because I love Greek mythology about all I love.
And I did not expect to get a damn boiled up version of Hercules with a big portion of teenage free in the 'God of War'.
and once again we get a Hollywood movie 101.
I do not know what I'll do if there's not a lot more variation going on soon.

","So I'm honest I can not say much about this movie. It's one of the best movies I've seen in life and one of my favorite movies. In my life I met movies that I liked but not so good films were good or well done but I did not like it so much. This is one of the few movies of my life where I just have to search the bad things with the magnifying glass and years later, the first look at my opinion has not changed until today. Therefore, to give a proper review, I'll just list all the things I did not like about this movie: The cut is a bit too fast for some places The sound is a little bit poorly controlled from the middle (the place where Alex goes back to the house of this artist, I mean especially the truth, that's the only part of the movie that bothers me You have to be able to get involved in this movie if you go in without knowing in this movie you get confused out until you can not do it anymorePS: The movie is not the most brutal in the world but still has some view that makes many people shocking.

How to Train Your Dragon," We have dragons
","This movie is just amazing, in the best sense of the word. Especially because the film has so many things that I can not stand and had to endure more than 1000 times in children's films. I'm blown away as always.
Every time something new happens you will see how both characters and the environment react to it, (almost) all the characters and characters are slightly stereotypical kids adventure characters but totally designed in contrast to their visual appearance and the flight sequences are just the stuff to be made of dreams.
That's why there is 3D cinema you have the impression you are a part of this world and of the experience. The animation itself can not compete with 'Pixar's', but the world excels.I'm honestly aware of this movie only through the TV series and I'm sorry that I did not get to see it on the IMAX, but I'm always waiting for a new release.
The characters are made unique, the story is well known but narrated in a new, unique way, and the flight tendons are some of the best ever shown.
I do not really like the voice of 'Hiccup' but everything else about this movie and what it says is so awesome that I can hear about it, I'm glad that I saw this movie and I have no idea how you feel about it have already seen and still will. 'Astrid' is so much better that I think she is my favorite character followed by 'Hiccup' with 99%.
The symbiosis and symbolism between humans and dragons is beautiful and it makes me happy every now and then to feel the danger in a movie to have me so worried about the characters. Besides, how often do we have movie characters with a disability? certainly not main characters in a children franchiseHow to train your Dragon is creative, funny, warming heart, fun and never boring.
It is a pizza that was almost only occupied with things I do not like but properly laid out and properly dosed and suitable spice so that it tastes even better than many pizzas that were only filled with things I like

Total Recall," It's the mix between a typical Schwarzenegger movie and a big sci-fi movie.
","As even the smallest science fiction should know what her film on a novel by Philipp K Dick.
But that's why we are not here but the question is how good is this movie?
The whole movie would make you a good quiet tone that could break anytime because you just know that Arnold is being hunted and anyone could be against alone or a traitor.
this is a movie that has just those things that the garden movie recommend to me feeling and excitement.
I do not have to mention that the movie is just super awesome but the fact that it still does so many things right is just what makes my favorite science fiction movie and song to be so special.Arnold Schwarzenegger is again called 'Balls to the wall action' and one liners. Although we're supposed to be running a 6.5 foot tall but the pictures with an Austrian accent are meant to be a secret agent, the film addresses how ridiculous this premise is and plays with it and does not work that well, in the end you believe it. 
Sharon Stone is hotter than glowing coals on the Oak wood barbecue and has simply nailed the role.
Simply the fact that everyone in this film has done such a good job makes it a unique experience.
Defects are pretty cheese in some places because the backgrounds of Mars are not that real and some of the animatronic dolls look like mannequins.
But everything has such a little 80's charm with it that it just does not bother you.
Fun I violence is as it is of course for Paul Verhoeven heard exaggerated and cartoony but that's intentional because he makes a statement in this way.With a budget of $ 50-65 million, Total Recall was one of the most expensive films produced at the time of its release, despite the estimates of the
Production budgets vary and whether it ever actually kept the record is not certain. (I do not think so.)The film initially received an X rating. Violence was trimmed and various camera angles were used in the over-the-top scenes for an R rating. (I believe immediately)And it's just really unusual to see Arnold Schwarzenegger in a serious movie and twice as impressive to associate him with such a quiet first night in a clever movie that is even more obvious because you just do not know until the end Dream is or real or not, or does it really matter, I really think that's one of the movies they use more often at school times, both on film schools and on normal already is really a movie of the time that you can not do it all Judging by the look if I know that the message is still the intention of the movie but that is also a central theme that you should keep in mind while watching this movie the actors are great the effects are just fun and I can Do not tell yourself if he is an agent or not and that's just the main reason why I watch the movie again and again the fun is the corner thing the violence and the sayings are the reason why I want to watch the movie again and again.",8,1,2,17 April 2018
Les Misérables," All of my hate
","This is without doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.
It's like someone have made a list of the top 50 things I do not like about movies and then create a script around it.
If this movie was a cocktail then it would only have been made from things I did not like. The nastiest food in a blender and diluted with so much water that it took over two and a half hours to drink it.In addition they gave me a pizza with a very good tomato sauce but a chewy old dough but it is only occupied with my favorite ingredients and that makes the taste even worse, And the cheese is sandy. If I did not know better I would think the film exists solely and solely to annoy me.No spice in the world can improve the taste, a movie that got so much attention because it's world literature.
However, I can say little positive about the book and the fact that almost only actors I like (and with which I would like to shoot myself) offend me to such an inward depth way.With all the imagery, the music and all the content I can really say that is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. (The movie equivalent to an insult.)
The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I now have a scale of bad movies and can always compare for the rest of my life for the very bottom drawer.",1,2,8,9 September 2018
Hercules," I have never really liked this movie but can understand why other people do it.
","This movie tries to pack a lot of stuff.
However, for a proper parody of The Hercules story, the movie is not radical enough.
For a true divine comedy, this is simply not funny enough for a new staging of Greek mythology, it deviates too much from the original story and the world.
And for a real fantasy film adaptation, he has too many pop culture references and modernity inside. All this could not be a problem if they had gone completely out of the way like the Flintstones. Or if you pack a little more excitement but all the things that really made the movie are just a short cut.The visual drawing style is just not my taste, all look like background characters from other films and although I prefer the message, is very much the representation and the danger and the fights I used here are just wrong.
I would prefer Meg to hurt herself to give Hercules his powers back. If we had really seen Hercules solve his 12 chores and fight against the monsters, if we had seen Hercules try to fight without his powers and put more emphasis on his mind and his training ect.
And if the mix between fun and danger was more balanced.I like James Woods as Hades, but wonder how he could not know if Hercules is dead, I like the reinterpretation of the gods a lot but they do not do enough to take them seriously as powerful beings, I hardly remember the passages in the they have been singing since it distracts from the story narration every time and I liked the fight against the Hydra that was all.",5,0,1,17 December 2018
12 Years a Slave," I hate this movie
","Cons a film of a serious subject but has the focus is on violence and cruelty. The film is only about half only scenes of close-ups, gaps filler, humiliations and whispers. If it make the concern was to show how bad slavery was or how fast you lose the freedom then only needs to be explained by the history of Solomon Northrup exactly make it a one clearly. I actually had no desire to watch the movie so I had probably already a preconceived notion but which was not fulfilled I am used by the actors much more, the landscapes see not that great and I only realized that it is the music of Hans Zimmer as I let itGenre Rating: (Drama, Special Interest) 10% Story: 30% Claim / massage: 0% Music / Score: 15% Dialogues / language: 45% Look / Style: 40% Effects: 0% Camera technology: 50% Actor: 20% exciting / dynamic: 40% Blood / violence: 70% I recommend Django Unchained",1,4,8,17 November 2017

Never Back Down," Karate Kid for the very poor
","I would not say the movie is glorifying violence but its characters are definitely and I do not know who the bigger psychopath is.
Ryan = (Jake's rival and the main antagonist) the sadistic bully who clearly belongs behind bars and bars.
Or the other people who incite, cheer, incite, and post on the Internet, as well as force each other to hurt each other.
When I was younger I really liked the movie. Because I seem to have only paid attention to the fights now that I am older, do martial arts myself and think better about movies I am very shocked that I liked such a movie and even more that flattened on a strip with a dubious fair ever filmed was allowed to.I wonder until today why the movie came out in Germany under the name 'The Fighters'.In itself, the film is well done great fights, good camera work and everything is just filmed sharp and not so hectic cut. why are everyone in this movie either dumb or unsympathetic assholes?There are a lot of martial arts movies and series that show both sides of the coin and the really real empty ones from the fights are none of this is the case here.Why is the whole movie full of inappropriate music?
For a real fighter movie you have to take music to let the blood flow into your veins and it makes you want to move you need metal, rap, hip hop or hard rock.And not this shallow emo kack that just gives a completely wrong picture.I'm a little bit offended by the character Max because he does not have that much wit but actually was one of the nice shadows and his obsession to film everything is personally offensive to me in two ways.The film would have been a lot better if Jean Roqua had been the focus because apart from him there was no really presentable character and Djimon Hounsou is by far the best actor, everyone else deserves the guillotine.Fighting has consequences, but doing nothing is the worst

Halloween," Halloween - Die Nacht of Grauens
","So it's always difficult for someone of the horror movies to watch Aurora classic because if you want to make movies yourself there are a few movies you have to watch to see how they work to understand what they mean by their time and technology Dara he is one and the work is back in it to be able to analyze. I basically like doing that, but not necessarily with horror movies because I really hate horror movies. I always watch the remake without informing about the films and then always a few weeks later I look at the original or the first part and so on. And I have to admit, people are right, the original is better but that does not have that much to say, it's like having a choice of stomach ache and genital pain, of course, the stomach ache is better, but actually just because of keeping your stomach down Crossing the road is a lot less embarrassing. I think the original by John Carpenter is a better movie but I would not say it's a good movie I did not find it boring at all I was invested and I was already worried about the characters especially Jamie Lee Curtis. But I really did not enjoy the movie and there are so few positive things I can say about this movie or even a lot of scenes I remember, now without a joke the biggest reaction I wanted to do was write the babysitter out the window and with the foot stuck in a loop and if that is the only other thing you remember or the only thing you react to in such a movie then that is a bad sign. So I liked the fact that Michael Myers does not even talk about that we know much about him or his motivation that makes me somehow dangerous to the development of which is very interesting and the music of the soundtrack is really exciting, but he repeats himself for my liking often. Still, I found the movie boring and uninteresting almost not saying I think it's good that this movie in contrast to you doing others will not bring any rage moments he did. And at no time did I have to think 'that can even make me better'. Still, my bottom line is that I did not have to see him, I do not want to see him again, and I did not get to look at him.",5,0,3,13 November 2017

The Iron Giant," Definitely one of the best animated films I've seen in my life.
","I was quite young when I saw him for the first time and I have to admit I was thrilled from the first second.
I was very young when I saw the movie for the first time and I have to admit that I probably did not understand half of it. Because some things simply fly over the heads of the youth that's why it's so much fun to watch such films again a few years later when you can enjoy them again with a completely different look, but it was still presented interesting enough that he aroused the interest of one.
(PS: For a change we have a movie without a villain but just people with different opinions and views) I'm pretty impressed with love, music and animation. I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different.
This topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days.
If you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a 'PG-13'? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.Brad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher).
As a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *.
(Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing
but not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)I have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.However, my heart always is.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life.
Unfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.I thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard.",7,0,0,13 June 2018
Shrek," I'm not a big fan
","I'm a big fan of fairy tales I'm an even bigger fan of parodies of these fairy tales and other interpretations.But I'm not a fan of an obvious plot and predictable arc.
I am also not a fan of cheap flatulence humor or generally these big out jokes.
I'm not a fan of the characters or the nature of the language.
Although I'm a fan of the end and I'm a big fan of a good message of true love first kiss and your fan of transforming Fiona into an ogre and that she ends up being an ogre.But I'm not a fan of character design or the background design.
I'm a fan of character animation but not a fan of facial expressions
I'm a fan of a bit of frugal animation but not if it looks half-finished
I'm not a fan of those old weary movie tropics or the typical burst in romantic comedies of the big misunderstanding and the back and forth between two love birds.On the complete free teeth with the dragon if I do not even mention or the strange plot convenience better contrivance.Although he has an end and a message I would have liked in many other fairy tale films especially from the house of Disney but,
The very dated humor that lacks an exaggerated pop culture credentials or the rather reduced danger keeps putting my fun on hold with this movie.
It is also a comedy and I have said enough times how much that does not suit my taste
That's why I can only say I'm not a big fan",5,0,4,19 November 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," I watch this movie with some fava beans and a nice Chianti
","Of course the movie that constantly pops up on any psychothriller or horror last
And the light without reason in this film has to really combine in itself 3 good story and to keep this gloomy and incomfortable mood throughout.
The cops played by Jodie Foster must bring down dangerous serial killer Buffalo Bill. Tax that does not succeed remains the only one thing left to think like him and who thinks better tax that does not succeed the only one thing left to think like him and who could help her better just another serial killer who is also a psychologist.
Meanwhile, the crazy aspects of the Lecter's past from Buffalo Bill's past of Joey's clear past experience.
Do not be confused by title the movie is based on a brilliant book containing ingenious actors of Ted rightly his Oscar where I deserve against category.
And thus the most successful films from the year pushed the sound The beauty and the beast which if you take it exactly is also quite sick and abnormal.",8,1,2,17 September 2018
Space Jam," I loved this movie infinitely as a child
","If you look at the movie as an adult then you realize that nostalgic goggles have covered a lot. For example, that the story is a bit stupid that most of the seats are not so funny, it has just about all the typical sports movie clichés from the book that the Looney Tunes are more weird than really crazy and funny in the cartoon and the humor Michael Jordan as the other athletes can not actors.But this does not matter to us all because this movie is fun from start to finish the effects are pretty silly and that helps the movie and the fast paying the interaction between the real people and the cartoon characters is pretty good and is pretty much even during the basketball game seamless, you can make a game of how many cameos in this movie occur in both the cartoon characters and the actors and I still love it.Already as a child, I found the feelings in this film between Lola Bunny and Bugs Bunny really strange and wondered if they were just a couple because they are both rabbits now as an adult is that a bit more unpleasant because you know the devintart anyway I am thankful to this day that this character was invented and you can also see it as a career as it began.
I love this movie i love this soundtrack i love space jam.",7,3,3,17 September 2018

A Nightmare on Elm Street," This movie is very interesting and has given a new twist to everything I despise of horror movies.
","Actually, I hate horror movies.
This movie is very interesting and has given a new twist to everything I despise of horror movies.It's finally a movie with its own stories that stands for itself, that acting is good and understandable despite the clearly much older actor than the characters (that goes for all), broken ones are good and I was the dark atmosphere who pervades all the movie.But I like this here in the dark literally pat tapping most of the time, I hate it when movies are just dark because we watch movies I want to see what happens in most parts of the movie play during the day or are so lit up that you even scenen at night recognize enough I also like the fact that we end up with little to know about Freddy that gives the whole a mystery touch and one is willing to work with the protagonists to find out more.I also like the fact that people really fight against Freddy and do not just run away that one sees far too rarely. There are some parts in film that you do not know if Freddy is real or not, or if you are in a dream or not that is very good for the movie experience
(Why do horror movies of the 21st century all have the same ideas and horror movies and films of that time are unique and different? One would think that today where more time has passed and there is more technology people would have more ideas?)The practical effects are all really good except at the end of the film Passau's a picture in because you can clearly see it's a doll and it gets laughable, even though it's not even a second, it's a big deal the last second of the movie is.I probably will not believe that, but I found the film to be 0% scary but at least incredibly interesting and exciting.Unlike many other horror movies and you really swear the danger here and you're excited and want to see people win, this movie is really exciting, interesting, had a good sorry, great acting and I also like Freddy Kruger's voice in places really funny.",6,0,4,4 August 2018
Aladdin," Probably one of the best animated cartoons I know
","I only recite films that I want to talk about when you've seen a movie and your body just wants to talk to all the people you met in life about the movie. Normally I only talk about how much a movie annoyed me or disappointed me because unfortunately it is the only feeling I have felt in the last few years. This movie has turned everything upside down.
I was overwhelmed from the first second by the world of the colors of the music
Usually I skip the songs in Disney movies because you just do not need them to understand the movie here I wanted to hear the music and here you really miss something if you should skip the music. There is a song that I have not listened to either in the movie nor in any other way because I just do not want to hear now but I could listen to Robin Williams as the genius for days.
May the man rest in peace he was definitely a legend who left us something big, but even so, it is a unique film with a unique display of unique animation and unique everythingOne thing I can not get over today is that Aladdin might have had a wish or that some of Jafar's stuff is not cleared up but every time I see the movie I do not care because I just want to be kidnapped by this world because it feels so good and looks so good.Of course, many things have changed but this is a movie you have to change some things because the same things do not work in different media and of course the movie is more based on the indian rather than the arabic culture but this is a fairy tale and no docu anyone who can Coin takes anyway is too stupid to enjoy movies decently.Some of my story problems are changed and clarified in the play, but we're talking about the film here and rate the movie as a whole
How could you save the movie?
I think it's a pity that I did not grow up with this movie because just like Edgar Wright movies in this movie are so many things I like or want to see more often but better late than never at least I know now what I can show my children the first Movie that almost made me cry.",8,1,1,17 December 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," unrealistic or more unbelievable
","I can imagine that someone from the street ends up in a gameshow, I can imagine that even a poor person is getting such a huge million dollar chance and I can imagine that he actually wins.
I can imagine that many things in this movie have been exaggerated to make it more interesting and exciting.
Also, I know that a lot of people who have never been to school, know more than people who study all their lives because they are more often among people, so they have more real life experiences and therefore better real life knowledge. But it's simply not possible that in fact all the incredible things that happen to the most unlikely character take place in the exact same order as the questions asked in that game show. 
It's just not possible. Not possible! There's no other word except 'no'.Incidentally, I'm just tired of seeing characters again and again whose motivation is love or a love interest because there are just enough other motivations that push people forward and make them always go one step further.
There were enough things about the movie I liked but this thread was unbearable for me and the little touch of the Bollywood aspect speaks the vocals and dance numbers were just too much for me though only a real Bollywood like.Incidentally, I'm just tired of seeing characters again and again whose motivation is love or a love interest because there are just enough other motivations that push people forward and make them always go one step further.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Oh, what a day, what a lovely day.
","I love this movie for the same reasons as Conan the Barbarian (1980). The action is super clear filmed so that we really see what happens there the story is told very linear so that everyone can understand. (Many say the story is so simple but I can not think outside the box because so little is said in this movie). The action is super filmed, almost praised, actors give everything they can only by facial expressions and gesticulating because very little is talked about in this movie the music is cool. Yes, I'm honest, there are only two songs that I think are super blatantly the rest was okay.",8,2,4,18 November 2017
Contact," My summary appears to be missing.
","Honestly, I love science fiction and you always find the idea religion versus science is something very fascinating. I also like to see Jodie Foster the rest of the cast is also great. But aside from a pretty good opening scene, there is not much good that I can say about this movie, the technical aspect was really top notch and the film has 2 of the best camera shots I've ever seen in life anyway I hate this movie. The movie is not really bad or somehow I just do not like the attitude I have a real problem with the message and it uses the very movie crew I despise. I do not want to talk badly about the director or the actors because they are doing their best, I rather want to trash the scriptwriter. I hate him the most because of the combination of things that happen here. (I know that the movie is based on a novel but that does not matter.) So my conclusion is great idea, fantastic camera work, awesome effects but the less I hear from this movie and see for the rest of my life the better. Because I can really feel how the bile slowly comes up every time when someone reminds me of this movie. The fact that the foundation seems made for me, however, the facade and the roof only consists of things that I despise is simply the greatest impudence.",3,0,3,29 November 2017
