The Blair Witch Project," convincing, atmospheric and damn frightening. a success on every level.
","I went into the New York screening of this film only vaguely knowing the details behind Blair Witch and its filmmakers/creators. The hype outside the theater was incredible. And in a pleasant surprise, the film inside was more than worthy of that hype.Shaky camerawork is complemented by razor-sharp editing. Improvised dialogue begets true honesty in acting. And unseen threats translate into some of the scariest on-screen moments I've ever witnessed. The Blair Witch Project is a study in expectations turned inside out to the best possible effect.I applaud the filmmakers for their imagination, thoroughness (have you SEEN the website and companion materials?!), and audacity. But I applaud the actors even more for their no-holds-barred intensity. Their performances are extraordinary.",9,1,2,14 July 1999
