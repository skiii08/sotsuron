Ford v Ferrari," There was a demon that lived on the track...
","I have never written a review here before, but this movie inspired me so much, I just had to say something. FvF felt so much like my all time favorite movie, 'The Right Stuff,' I was duly impressed. The acting, the cinematography, the script and direction were just spot on. I at first didn't want to see it because I absolutely hate Christian Bale, but his performance IMHO was Oscar-worthy. The racing scenes were exciting and visceral, the CG locations were perfect; everything about this movie just drew me in. I highly recommend FvF for the whole family!",10,3,7,18 November 2019
