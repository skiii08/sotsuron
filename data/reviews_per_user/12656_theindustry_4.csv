The Avengers," A Thrilling Ride
","This new superhero flick by 'Marvel' is quite good. Being a fan of many past Marvel movies, I feel that director Joss Whedon did give most comic book fans a film that they will remember. It is packed with action, costumed superheroes, villains, gadgets, plot-twists, witty dialogue - much like a well written comic strip. However, for those not entirely familiar with the heroes, as well as those who are looking for a more serious plot, they won't find anything deep in this flick. It is, as Roger Ebert put it, 'The Westminster Dogshow of superheroes.' The production team incorporates myriads of digital visual and sonic effects to give film-goers the biggest bang for their buck.Nevertheless, children will find it very exciting, as will most Marvel aficionados. If you are a sucker for a pleasing Friday-night flick, with not too much to offer other than a thrilling, star-studded adventure, and a number of humorous jests by Robert Downey Jr. this is certainly for you.Enjoy!",7,1,4,7 May 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Great action film on the whole; fast-paced, fun and an action-packed frenzy.
","One might argue that the whole nuclear war theme has been used a bit too often, but Brad Birds latest film is well worth the exception.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in another action-packed suspense film. Together with Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, and Jeremy Renner, he travels to Moscow, Dubai, and Mumbai in order to prevent nuclear destruction. Each act in each country gets better and better, and the suspense never ceases to thrill. Great gadgets, gizmos, stunts, action sequences, CGI, and acting make this a must for anyone craving a high-octane, yet still family friendly adventure.I found it to be the most interesting of the 'Mission: Impossible' films. Others might disagree. It has a thick plot, but director Bird communicates it very well from start to finish. I appreciated the score of the film as well, which includes a nice title sequence with the theme we all know. It wasn't without its flaws, but most will pass unnoticed.Overall a 9/10. Get a ticket as soon as possible because this flick is one 'Mission: Possible.'Enjoy.",9,3,7,25 December 2011
Joker," Masterful study of the descent into evil
",In a beautiful character study of a man that society has neglected. Great film. Masterful visual work in this production with an equally lovely and terrifying score that complements Joaquin Phoenix's character development. Fan theories abound. A definite must see!,10,1,1,9 October 2019
The Green Mile," Brilliant, a lot of fun, and full of heart.
","Truly a wonderful picture. I agree with what most people on here are saying: this film, along with Shawshank define great American cinema. Both pictures are ingenious in their conception -kudos to master writer Stephen King - and really spark more than just entertainment. This is not ars gratia artis, art for arts sake; it's art for the sake of humanity; for portraying brilliant stories that center around human interactions in the most inhuman of places. If anyone stumbles on this review, understand that there are few similarly heart-wrenching films out there. Others have pointed out more, and I agree. But these stand out among the rest, and that is indisputable.If you are a film enthusiast that has not seen these films, or if you are just looking for a great flick, look no further. Definitely rent or buy these films for they are pearls of American cinema.Enjoy!",10,6,8,25 December 2011
