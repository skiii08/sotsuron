Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Lame Humor
","The success of this movie just shows how hypocrite people get excited by watching racial, female, and non-American bashing. When people don't understand other cultures, they make fun of them, implying that their own culture is far more superior than of those they make fun of. If all the fun is made on the expense of one nation (and its not sarcasm like Simpsons, and its not US), then gee I wonder why the world hates us.Borat is an idiot from Khazakistan, and he makes sure that he gets the worst out of people by acting crazy in front of them. Where it may seem funny at points, it really isn't movie material, its the kinda stuff you want to watch on hidden camera shows, and that too for half an hour with commercial breaks, thats about it.",1,28,55,8 January 2007
Silent Hill," Movie is for Silent Hill Vedio Game fans
","I'll be straight forward. The movie is gorry, and its for the silent hill vedio game fans. The acting I thought was not impressive. Some scenes were kinda freaky, and the transmission to the darkness was scary stuff. You'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie. It was definitely a decent scary movie, not as good as the Ring though. There is no way you can compare Naomi Watts with the chick in this movie. You can really screw up a scary movie, you may not like this one either because of a lot of unexplained stuff. But if you sit back and want to be scared, you will be scared. Oh yeah, The nurse scene could be longer.",5,1,4,23 April 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Different Comedy with great performance
","I read other comments about how people hate this movie. Some people said its made by someone who's made at the world, or mad at US, some people said its not realistic, some people said its not funny, some people said that the humor was that these people are worse than us.The movie had a rhythm to it, it was not very long, and held an interesting theme until the end. It is basically about a dysfunctional family, and if people think it wasn't real, they must look in people's life in US, it was very real. You won't find every other family with so many issues, but they are out there, they exist. And if it was made as a serious movie, about a family with such problems, then no one would laugh at the misery of such a family, but then again, no one would watch this movie if it wasn't funny. People watch reality shows everyday, reality shows are mostly about some jerks judging some victims, sometimes the judges are us viewers. This movie takes a shot at that in the beauty pageant in the end.I gave this movie a 10, even though I would give a 10 to movies like Lord of the Rings, or Apocalypto, this movie may not have had a big budget, but it outdid itself. Excellent work.",10,3,6,8 January 2007
Inside Man," Complete waste of talent, time, money
","Movie: There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie. Its truly awful. Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it, it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick. Characters/Actors: Denzel has done 'EXACTLY' what he does in every movie, so no surprise there. Here is a little mind game for the readers. Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies. Now count how many of them were in which he played a cop/detective/body guard, whatever. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. His best performance was I think in 'Beyond Borders'. Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well. His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in 'Sin City'. Surely this guy knows acting, what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles. He is in desperate need of a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life. She has done better. She has had better roles. It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie. Plot: Plot was not confusing, in fact, I could think of such a plot, in fact the whole movie, while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner. I mean come on, ****SPOILER ON THE WAY----> I am sick of the un-necessary Haulocast and the Racism token. The movie is about bank robbers, why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there, nice try playing with people's emotions, worked on anyone? NOT ME. Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages? Riiiiiiight, please, we're talking about US police force and security here. Nobody could find out where Clive was, I mean they didn't find anything different with that room. Who're we kidding? Conclusion: Sure, go watch this movie, if nothing, you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was. At least people won't think you're stupid to go watch this movie because they'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast 'MISTAKE'.",1,46,89,18 April 2006
