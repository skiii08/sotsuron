The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch comes out of the forest and takes over the world
","Watching this movie is being part of a cultural phenomenom. The marketing created so much expectation that you just can't miss this great film. Making people think it was a real story was the best campaign they could have created. You already know what it's about: 3 kids get lost in the woods while shooting a documentary on the Blair Witch legend. And you know that since the budget was so limited, you can't expect to see a computer animated witch.But the film does deliver an eerie atmosphere. You can easily relate to this characters, just by remembering when you've been in the woods, or heard strange noises coming from the dark. And if you add the story of a haunting, you can feel the despair and fear of this three people.Many people have criticized the camera work, saying it's confusing and dark. And that's exactly what it's supposed to be. You're looking at the work of Heather, Josh and Mike, not a professional Discovery Channel documentary.The most important thing here is the psychological development of the characters. The way they react to the situation, the way they confront each other and start losing their sanity. The acting was amazing, specially when Heather asks for forgiveness.What would I change? Maybe the sound effects should be clearer, specially the first night they get haunted. It was hard to recognize the noises they were talking about. And maybe we should have seen a light, a mist, a glowing figure in the distance. Not an eye popping special effect, just a little touch of visual terror.But you can't miss The Blair Witch Project. Whether you like it or not, I'm sure we'll still be talking about it in the years to come. It'll be a trendsetter.",9,0,1,15 October 1999
The 13th Warrior," Is that suppossed to be a professional Hollywood production???
","This movie really dissappointed me. I didn't expect much from it, and I'm glad I didn't. The story really sucks. When they said there was 'an evil that can not be named' I thought they'd have to face a dangerous, supernatural evil force. But when they fought this african looking tribe (is that suppossed to be politically correct), the story dies. I mean, how could they be hiding if there were thousands of them, along with a horse for each one? Who said Antonio Banderas was the leading character? and who thought he looks like an Arab?But the worst thing is the photography work. I've been in the production of school short films myself, and I bet our work was way better than this trash.In the same scene you can see at least three variations in color. Some of the night scenes were so bad you can't see anything but a huge blur. And some day scenes are all burned out! The editing in the battle sequences is terrible. It's all confusing and boring.I won't recommend you not to watch this disaster, but don't expect to see a good action movie.",4,0,1,9 October 1999
Ice Age," Love the sloth
","I'm just wondering, why do people seem to think that computer animation started last year with Shrek and Monsters Inc., talking about them as the beginning and the end of the genre (especially Shrek)? It's probably because 'adults' read Shrek reviews saying it was so smart they would enjoy it too. I guess must of these people have never seen the true masterpieces of computer animation...What about TOY STORY 1 & 2, real classics that are funny, heart-warming, intelligent? That should be your standard when it comes to animation, not Shrek!!Now, about ICE AGE... it definitely works on the most basic levels of emotions and values like friendship, loyalty, sacrifice, etc... And that's OK, no complications but a strong emotional foundation. John Leguizamo is excellent as Sid, the sloth. It's funnier than I expected, too bad they only showed the slapstick in the trailers.Technically, some scenes are amazing (the sliding sequence), but it's true that characters such as the humans are a disappointment. Or maybe they were never looking for photo-realism a la Final Fantasy.Give a chance to Ice Age, and never say no to an animated movie thinking 'it's for kids' (except when it's produced by Nickelodeon).",Null,0,0,3 April 2002
The Sixth Sense," Bruce Willis sure has a special sense
","I really wanted to see this movie since I first saw the trailer. I didn't know what to expect, it could be a drama, a thriller, an action or horror movie. But I don't want to make 'The Sixth Sense' fit into a film genre. I just can say it's an amazing, smart, touching movie. It'll give you some scary sequences, huge surprises and great acting from Bruce Willis and the boy who portrays Cole.The first part is a little slow. But you need to establish the characters' psychology and the way they're going to interact. Once you get through the introduction, you'll see a great development of a very simple story (you already know the basic plot from the trailer). Even if you think it'll be a predictable movie, you have to give it a try. Let it get inside you, feel Cole's fear and Malcolm's need to help this kid who thinks he's a freak.I won't say anything about the ending, only that it's an unexpected twist that gives the movie a nostalgic and emotional mood.This is not an independent movie. It had a large budget and it features my favorite Hollywood actor, Bruce Willis (if you've only seen him in the Die Hard series  - it was awful - you should try '12 monkeys', 'Pulp fiction', 'The fifth element', 'The bonfire of the vanities' and so many great movies Willis has made). It's an example of Hollywood at it's best: smart, well done, great actors, big bucks. But most of all, it's a movie with a soul.Don't miss it.",Null,0,0,23 October 1999
The Matrix," The miracle of script clonation
","Come on, how can anyone say this is a good, deep, reflexive movie? Have you ever seen Dark city, Total recall, The thirteenth floor (highly underated movie), and many others? It has SOME good FXs (and all were show on the trailer), but the action is in a boring video game style. If it WAS an original idea, maybe i'd say this is a good movie. But since it's just a remix of many great stories, i'd say THE MATRIX is just a mirage of a good movie.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
Contact," No words for Jodie's performance.
","There are no words to express how Contact makes me feel.When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a predictable moral fable. But it became one of my all time favorites. Contact is not a story about alien invaders. It's true that it features amazing special FXs. But most of alll, it's a story that touches your soul and makes you think about faith and science. This comment may contain some spoilers, so be warned. It's a complex portrait of contemporary society, our obsesions, our fears.
If you start thinking what would happen to us if we got a sign from an alien life form, it wouldn't be very different from Contact.The fear of facing the unknown, the need of holding to old traditions and religion (in a fundamentalist way), it would all be confusing and controversial. The destruction of the first machine is breathtaking, it's like you lose all your faith in mankind. How can governments and people be so stupid and intolerant? If we can't trust ourselves, how could we ever trust an extraterrestrial intelligence?Jodie Foster should have got the Academy Award for her performance.She became Ellie Arroway, her despair, her amusement, it was all real.When she tries to convince an skeptic audience that her experience was real, she made me cry.Would you believe Dr. Arroway's story? Would you have faith in her words? I believe in them. I believe, as Ellie said, that if we're alone in the universe, it would be a waste of space.",10,1,3,21 October 1999
