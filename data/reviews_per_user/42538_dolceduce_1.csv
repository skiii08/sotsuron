Requiem for a Dream," Mind-blowingly real
","Every middle school in America should immediately scrap its DARE program and institute required viewing of 'Requiem For a Dream' for all 14-year olds. I guarantee you would see a sharp decrease in intravenous drug use after a few years.  This film punches you in the face; it uniquely adopts the perspective of drug addicts as they're actually shooting up or pill-popping, and the effect is quite unsettling.  Sharp, jarring editing and disorienting sound design contribute to the effect.  One of the most intense movies I've ever seen.  I will never forget this movie and the implications of its' characters' sorry fate.",10,0,0,26 January 2001
