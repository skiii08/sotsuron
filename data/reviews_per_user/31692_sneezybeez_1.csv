Hereditary," A Very Original Horror Movie.
","I didn't know exactly what I was about to watch after seeing the trailer, but WOW I wasn't expecting this. The entire movie is completely filled with surprises. One of my favorite things about the movie is that it's unique. Instead of using horror cliches, like most do, the people who made it came up with entirely new scares. Most of the events that happen in the movie are totally unexpected and gruesome enough to satisfy even the most snobby horror film viewer.",8,17,40,8 June 2018
