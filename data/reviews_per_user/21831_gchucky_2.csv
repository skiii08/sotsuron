The Rock," one of the coolest movies, ever.
","putting aside all other opinions that i may have, this is one of the best action movies, ever. an awesome movie directed by an awesome... uhh... director is, well, awesome. :)the plot: here we see a rather unique, but predictable, story. in short, hummell (played by ed harris,) who is an ex-army general (or something high-ranked,) has decided to steal a whole bunch of rockets with some nasty stuff in them because his men were not reimbursed for the stuff they suffered. he puts all of the rockets on the rock - alcatraz island - and maintains base there. enter the government. they decide to use (cheesy) the only man who's ever escaped: john mason, who is played by sean connery. with mason is goodspeed, who is played by nicholas cage. together, and with other guys, they have to disarm all these bombs before hummell fires them off.character development: the three main characters - hummell, goodspeed, and mason - are rather well developed. from the beginning of the movie, we see hummell's reason for doing this, and we feel some form of compassion, as if it's something he has to do. and we see goodspeed's relationship with his girlfriend and how he puts work above all, and yet he has a fear of needles. finally, we see mason's struggle because he's been in jail for the longest time because he stole a microfilm. everything in the movie has a purpose, and in time, we see the purpose.the action: what's a bruckheimer movie without action? one of the greatest action sequences in this movie is the shower-room scene. hummell's men have the advantage of height, looking down on a now-infiltrated shower room. we see the bloodshed and the loss of men, and then we see hummell's reaction - he is ashamed and angry because of what has transpired. without giving away more of the movie, we see some very cool deaths for the characters we grow to hate.the music: i love a good movie score. in fact, i hold the soundtrack in my hand right now. hans zimmer did an incredible job when he wrote this - the recurring notes we hear throughout the movie are reverberated and pounded into our heads. the music is action-packed and keeps the audience into the movie.all in all, this is one of bruckheimer's greatest movies. he has put together a masterpiece, and i am incredibly glad for having seen this movie. and if you see it, you'll feel the same way.",8,1,1,26 May 2000
Mission: Impossible II," this movie is worth seeing.
","to be completely honest with you, i prefer jerry bruckheimer over john woo. i think that bruckheimer's movies are a lot easier to follow, and that the camerawork he does is of a higher quality than woo. however, i think that john woo did a very good job directing this movie. the camerawork fits seamlessly in with the action sequences, and it was quite a change from other action movies.now, then. mi:2 is better than the first one, in my opinion. it's a lot easier to follow than the first, and it's got a whole lot more action. however, the problem here is this: there's just too much tom cruise. yes, the audience likes him, but just how far does one take it?the movie has a fairly decent plot about biological weapons. it's nice to watch, easy to follow, and is full of plot-twists. but the minor characters - which is everyone except cruise - are too underdeveloped. when something happens to the girl in the movie, we don't feel the sympathy that we should. so that's a big flaw.now, im a big fan of movie music. i own a fairly decent collection of movie soundtracks, and this one holds up incredibly well. during the fight scene (towards the end,) we hear an incredibly cool piece with chanting and the like. and then it turns to guitar, which is incredible. hans zimmer did a great job on this soundtrack (you might also remember him from doing *the rock* soundtrack.) so the music is a plus.all in all, this is a great movie. it's more tactical and spy-oriented than, say, a james bond flick. but go see it, it's well worth your $8.25.",Null,0,0,26 May 2000
