Moneyball," Even non-baseball fans will enjoy this film
","Moneyball can easily compete with some of the greatest baseball movies and is arguably one of the best films of 2011. I'm not a sports guy and I'm always baffled when people get so upset when their team doesn't win. However, I was able to understand the mindset and feel the agony of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt). This true story based on the 2003 Michael Lewis book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, shines a different and less romantic perspective on the sport. With a strong theme of taking down the system and fighting the established order, Billy Beane takes a risky yet revolutionary step into combating the deep pockets of large baseball franchises. Brad Pitt (Se7en) and Jonah Hill (Superbad) are outstanding together and develop an on-screen friendship that feels legitimate. Casting Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia) as Oakland A's manager Art Howe is unfitting. Art Howe has a physique of someone that could field a couple grounders whereas Hoffman would fall on his fat ass. Interestingly, Art Howe has expressed displeasure with the portrayal of his character in the book and the movie in which he is seen as a stubborn traditionalist. Moneyball offers a multitude of entertaining facets with an exceptionally well-written screenplay that even non-baseball fans will enjoy.",8,2,5,6 February 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," One of the most overrated films of 2011
","The film is based on the 1974 British spy novel by John le Carr√©, and is a condensed version of the 1979 seven-part BBC series of the same name. The film's largest flaw is that it fails to inspire the requisite emotional investment needed to care about the characters. It's hard to fit this sort of investment into a two-hour film considering the complexity of the plot. However, with this disconnect from the characters it becomes nearly impossible to care when someone is killed off. It also doesn't help that the film's low suspense level is like heating up a pot of water that never makes it to a full boil. The stage is set for a great espionage spy movie including a fantastic cast, but it just fails to leave any kind of lasting impact. This is far from your Jason Bourne hollywoodized type of spy films, and favorably takes a realistic approach. However, this red-herring story needs to up the ante by increasing the tension giving the viewer the sensation of suspenseful anxiety mixed with paranoia. This has to be one of the most overrated films of 2011.",5,4,7,6 February 2012
