Black Swan," Lovely, chaotic masterpiece.
","Critics who don't get this movie or old prudes need not apply. This is one of the most beautifully chaotic yet intelligent movies I have ever seen. As long as you have good taste and a functioning brain you'll like it, and especially so if you are an artist yourself because it gives you, not so much a comment or exploration (fast becoming a clich√© in the critical world), but a feeling of art and the excesses to which artists willingly go for their art. This is why I have a feeling some critics didn't 'get it.' Critics too often calculate and add up too much to recognize their own feelings about a movie, and frequently judge a movie based on its adherence to a particular formula, but this movie tosses away a formula and creates its own impressionistic view of a situation, much like Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.There is an added bonus if you are an artist who has given themselves to a project and sacrificed something for it, because this movie shows you the extremes to which you can go for that feeling of having done your job to perfection. As an actor I sympathize mostly with Nina's desire to be perfect and to successfully fulfill her director's wishes, and I'm sure it would apply to so many other fields of creative art.Make no mistake, it is a melodrama, and I would compare its tone to the books of Dostoevsky, only with less dialogue and more chaotic dance. It's really quite Russian, as ballet was embraced by the Russians more than many other countries, and let's face it, no one else has matched Fyodor's skill for introspective melodrama in any medium. The end result is that the tone and the subject seem made for each other. Nina is consumed by one zealous focus similar to Alexei Ivanovich, and the style added by Aronofsky's direction makes it totally his. The fast editing, mesmerizing dance choreography, and excellent score made me dizzy, and that was exactly the point.But the one thing that made it truly great as opposed to a beautiful disaster was Natalie Portman. Good God, she gave herself to this role and jumped into the deep end. It's a lovely thing to see an actress these days with talents to match her beauty, and as evidenced in Leon, Natalie has always had talent, but she seemed to have left it at home for a while. Well, all her other roles were warmups compared to this. Paychecks to make it to this script. So haters gonna hate, but you will love or at least appreciate this movie if you let it take you away to another world, or in the case of this one, into someone's eff'd up but utterly fascinating mind. All who love art and good movies go see this now!",9,2,5,19 January 2011
Underworld," Great popcorn flick
","Underworld's biggest strength is its rich atmosphere and feel of Eastern European-ish Gothic fantasy. If you really like a movie that sucks you in and has some kickass action (but not too much) with an entertaining story involving vampires and werewolves check it out.Kate Beckinsale is a great heroine, and not only because she's in a completely form-fitting suit the whole time. ^^ Michael Sheen and Scott Speedman are also fantastic, and play their characters very well. The rest of the cast is so-so, but since the three aforementioned characters give us most of the story it doesn't matter too much that Craven seems like he took a term of high school drama and then signed up for the movie.So if you appreciate dark brooding fantasy rent this movie or see if a friend has it, since it's certainly worth a few viewings.",9,0,0,21 September 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Pan's Labyrinth - excellent period drama / fantasy
","Possible spoilers follow, but nothing plot-ruining.El Laberinto del fauno is one of the most widely, metaphorically, allegorically, etc. (you get the idea) interpreted artsy movies I had heard of in a while. That said, I was fairly turned off at first to the idea of having to piece together a whole separate message, on top of watching a movie and glancing at the subtitles to see what was going on. I'm the kind of guy who loved and hated Dante's Inferno in class just because it was interesting but still so bloody metaphorical (and believe me, our teacher made it so).If you are this kind of person you are in good company with the rest of that high school English class, and in good company with many film viewers out there who like fantasy. But probably more Lord of the Rings fantasy that introduces a rich world all its own and really sucks you in with something like 9 hours of screen time for the whole story, universe, and history of said universe. Believe me, I am one of the aforementioned. But if YOU are, do not by any means discard Pan's Labyrinth as fluff without substance. Because it isn't.What works very strongly for the film, and which is what I noticed right off the bat, is the music. The music ties the whole movie together as it is powerful enough to give you an attitude toward a certain scene, but still subtle enough to not let you notice it's happening. Secondly all the actors are great. Not since Natalie Portman in Leon has a child carried a movie on their shoulders as well as Ivana Baquero in the main character's role of Ofelia. All the supporting actors are superb as well. Namely the captain comes to mind as he gives an unexpected nuance to his character that not many would, and I don't want to spoil anything by giving you details.And now doubtless what some of you have been skipping through this review to find: the fantasy element. The tag in the title that made you check this movie out. It's misleading to say the least. Pan's Labyrinth isn't a Drama/Fantasy/Thriller as IMDb would have you believe, but on the contrary a History/Drama/Thriller/Fantasy (prioritized in that order). There's mostly a great intense war story going on that is supplemented by Ofelia's fantasy escapades. My only beef is that they didn't flesh these out a little more, if for no other reason than to toss us fantasy nerds a bone, and to utilize those awesome tension-building directing skills Guillermo del Toro has going.The fantasy totally works, though. In a nutshell Ofelia has a few tasks, quests if you will, to complete. They seem at first trivial in the face of what reality is sending to both sides of this military conflict. However, the thing that makes you see the fantasy as appropriate is when it all comes together to show you that everything was for a purpose and was interwoven to work together. That's the ending and I won't spoil it for you, but it is certainly fitting considering what comes before.Another thing is that the story works just by itself, considering significant points within the plot as they flesh out. For instance, watch out for when the captain is seen shaving in relation to the storyline. It's great to see it a few times just thinking of how everything ties together, and what could certain people have thought when they did certain things. Sometimes the movie tells you, sometimes not.And if exclusively visual production values just add another layer of paint to an already solid movie, they dumped buckets of the best on this one. The makeup, cinematography, lighting, etc. are all fantastic.So yeah, if you haven't seen this already see it. You'll like some aspect of it no matter who you are, unless you just can't watch the few but admittedly realistic violent scenes. Cover your eyes if you're squeamish. If it makes any difference, the violence isn't at all gratuitous and speaks volumes concerning the characters of those who inflict it. And incidentally I think the youngest person to appreciate this would be a teenager, anyone younger would probably just be bored out of their minds. They wouldn't catch the subtitles very fast anyway.Final verdict: An enjoyable intense historical drama with a dash of fantasy that sucks you in with its incredible layers of polish and mesmerizing score. If you want a quality drama and don't mind leaving your brain on while you watch to take in the story (gasp!), see it! I just hope this makes a special appearance in theaters again, because it would just magnify the atmosphere by a fair amount with a big screen and surround sound.",8,0,3,10 June 2008
