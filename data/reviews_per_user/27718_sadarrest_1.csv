Ali," Brilliant Use of Music
","Ali does have problems as a biopic, but it deserves a ten for its brilliant use and selection of music. The best parts of the film are montage sequences set to R&B and Soul. The only non-musical parts of the film that are really outstanding are the 'Whats my name' fight and Ali's first exit from the hearing. Will Smith, Michael Mann, Jami Foxx etc. have done an excellent job.",10,0,0,28 December 2001
