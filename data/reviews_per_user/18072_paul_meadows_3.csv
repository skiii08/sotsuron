Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A brave/foolish decision
","I automatically assumed that The Phantom Menace would be good. After all, Lucas had over a decade in order to think of the script, adapt his ideas and to ponder what made the original trilogy so great. Perhaps my expectations were a little too high. As a big Star Wars fan, I found it hard to believe that I'd just seen a brand new Star Wars film and thought it was rubbish. However, 5 years later, I can appreciate where Lucas was coming from when he made TPM and I can understand the decisions he made. That doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with them wholeheartedly.I think the main problem is that the film lives up to its title of Episode I too much. It is the very beginning and no mistake and, consequently, is really only a prologue to the rest of the saga. With Episodes II and III profiling the Clone Wars and IV-VI the Civil War, TPM will stand very much separate from the the other 5 films once the saga is completed. I think it was a brave/foolish decision on Lucas' part to make a Star Wars film that wasn't, well, Star Wars! One of the reasons it received the criticism it received is that it wasn't what the audience expected at all.With Lucas deciding to set TPM so much apart from the other films, it means that Episode II Attack of the Clones also serves as an introductory film. One can't help wondering if the the first two episodes could have been condensed into one or if Lucas should have made four new films with AOTC being Episode I and TPM being a stand-alone movie sitting outside of the saga rather like the Ewok movies and Droids cartoons, and Episode II taking place during the Clone Wars before the events that we'll see in III.However, none of this excuses the fact that, as a film, it was badly made. The villains weren't threatening: the worse thing we saw them do was mow down a few trees. The main characters weren't engaging: where was the chemistry between the cast that Hamill, Ford and Fisher had in the original trilogy? Why was the acting so appallingly bad in places when you had the likes of Samuel L Jackson, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGraggor and Natalie Portman in your movie? The film even included a fart and a cartoon battle!!!All in all, the film had characters that non-Star Wars fans didn't care about, being placed in a situation that didn't interest them. Therefore, it's of no surprise that the film wasn't well received by the majority.Once the saga is complete though, I think the film will serve as a curiosity and even a cult classic among the die-hard Star Wars community, but it will, by no means, reach the same heights of adoration that A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back enjoy.5 years on from the shock, I can enjoy TPM for what it is: the opening chapter of what is a fantastic saga.5/10",Null,0,1,30 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Lazy
","As a kid ROTJ was my favourite SW film because of the special effects. However, as an adult, I see ROTJ as the weakest of all 5 films. Shock! Horror! Yes, even worse than The Phantom Menace. Why? Let me explain...ROTJ is lazy script-writing and feels uninspired and really doesn't compare well to the other films. Although TPM seems very shallow, it does have very dark undertones and almost every scene is setting up or heralding the themes and ideas to be explored later in the series. Whereas ROTJ is just a video game, with the exception of the Vader/Luke confrontation.However, I'm by no means saying this is a bad film. The end space battle is mind-blowing and the redemption of Vader is probably the highlight of the entire series. The trouble is, The Empire Strikes Back was character driven and the characters seemed real, but in Jedi they revert to the comic book caricatures that they were in A New Hope. In other words, ROTJ was a step backwards in character development. For example, in the previous film, Lando betrayed Han and condemned him to what could have been an eternity in carbonite. It would have been nice for Han to at least say to Lando 'Hey buddy, thanks for rescuing me.' But no. Perhaps spending all that time in deep freeze scrambles your memory. Seriously though, it would have added a much needed depth to these 2 characters which is severely lacking in this film. And as for the Ewoks...well, they're not as bad as Gungans. In fact. I've got a lot of respect for any teddy bear that stands up to a stormtrooper.Score 2/5",Null,1,2,31 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Menace and Jedi.
","Lucas always said that his prequels would be very different from the original trilogy. How right he was as he has yet to surpass A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back.AOTC is a vast improvement on The Phantom Menace as we finally get to see the Republic turning into the Empire we all know and love from the original films and it feels much more like a SW film. However, I think the problem that the prequels have is that the subject matter is really only going to be of interest to Star Wars fans. I can't imagine that the average cinema-goer could give a damn about how the Republic became the Empire.I think the acting and drama in this was way better than TPM and the action at the end surpassed anything seen before in a SW movie. OK it's not a great movie, but for a SW fan like me it held my interest and has a lot more depth/richness to it than Return of the Jedi. Lucas still hasn't managed the chemistry between the characters/actors which made the first two films so good and I still can't take Ewan's impersonation of Alec Guiness seriously. Also, the Christopher Lee character was so boring and uninspired. How could the man who gave us Vader and Fett come up with Count Dooku? I think a female villain would have been great. I was so disappointed when the female babe of a bounty hunter at the start of the film turned out to be an alien. What was the point of that? Can't women be bad in the SW universe?6/10",Null,0,1,31 October 2004
