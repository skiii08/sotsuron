The Avengers," Absolutely Brilliant
","The danger with every superhero movie is that it will end up either horrifically unrealistic or unappealing to anyone over the age of ten. I am pleased to say that 'The Avengers' does not fall into either of these pitholes - in fact, it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012.The actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters. Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic. The director Joss Whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come.",10,15,26,24 December 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Excellent - for a disaster film
","I watch a lot of disaster movies and I can honestly say that this is one of the best I have ever seen. Okay, so it isn't exactly particularly realistic, but it's a movie not real life so it doesn't have to be realistic. You couldn't call Avatar or Lord Of The Rings realistic either. Dennis Quaid is superb in the role of Jack Hall and Jake Gyllenhaal makes a pretty decent Sam. The special effects are excellent and really blend together, so while the science may not make sense on screen it looks brilliant. There are definitely better movies out there - but for a disaster movie it's absolutely fantastic. If you like disaster movies it's definitely worth a watch - but if you just want to pick apart every movie you see for not being realistic then this is not for you.",8,1,2,25 June 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Absolutely brilliant
","This movie was absolutely incredible, I can't fault it. It has good characters, excellent actors and an all-round amazing plot. This is one of the only films I have ever seen where the film is just as good, if not better, than the book. I think Viggo Mortensen was one of the best actors - his portrayal of Aragorn was just incredible. He really captured Aragorn's personality perfectly and delivered a performance that was practically flawless. Orlando Bloom also made a very good Legolas, and Elijah Wood's portrayal of Frodo Baggins was brilliant. In fact, all the actors were amazing so it is hard to pick out the best ones! The special effects and computer generated scenes were magnificent to - sometimes it was hard to tell what was real, what was done in a studio and what was completely fake! This movie is one of the best I have ever seen - only matched by the other films in the trilogy, 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King'",10,0,1,26 June 2011
2012," A great disaster movie
","This isn't exactly the best film in the world - but for a disaster film it's pretty good. The plot is exciting with plenty of action and drama, the characters are nice and varied and although the ending might seem decisive it actually still allows you to decide what will happen. Will the arks sink before they reach Africa? Will the people be thrown out - they weren't exactly nice to the Africans before, were they? Or will they reach Africa safely and have a nice happy-ever-after ending - that's probably what most people expect to happen. I thought Amanda Peet made a great worried mum character - and she was also a good sceptic before the disasters got worse. Probably one of my favourite parts of the film was when she was on the phone while watching the TV and laughing at any suggestion that the disasters were going to get worse. The reporter on the TV went 'I'm happy to announce that the worst is over' (or something along those lines) and the entire state promptly starts cracking up. Brilliant. I would recommend this movie to any disaster or action film fan.",8,1,3,25 June 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Incredible
","The second film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is just as good as the first. It has all the right ingredients - great actors, brilliant characters and bucket loads of action - to make it one of the best films ever made. Viggo Mortensen once again makes an amazing Aragorn, with a huge natural authority that translates brilliantly into the film. Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood and John Rhys-Davies are also excellent as Legolas Greenleaf, Frodo Baggins and Gimli respectively. The special effects and computer generated scenes remain just as good as in the first film, and the use of models to create difficult scenes works absolutely incredibly. I would giver this film a definite ten out of ten - I just can't fault it. A must-watch film for everyone, no matter what your tastes in film are.",10,0,1,26 June 2011
Avatar," Incredible
","Avatar is unlike any film I have seen before. It has a unique appeal and the animations and effects are absolutely spectacular. It truly captures the world of Pandora and makes it seem real.All of the characters are well acted and you can really understand everyone's point of view. In many ways, it is a very emphatic film.This film is very popular and caused a huge sensation when it was released in 2009. In my opinion, the hype surrounding it is deserved - it is certainly a film with a difference that should appeal to a very wide target audience. Obviously, the main target audience is those who like science fiction and fantasy, and not younger children due to some violence and a possibly too complex plot line.So why not 10 out of 10? Well, while it is an excellent film it is not perfect, and it just feels like there is something missing.All in all, an enjoyable film I would definitely recommend watching.",9,2,5,9 August 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The perfect ending
","I must admit, I had my doubts whether this film would live up to the incredibly high standards set by the first two films, but it has spectacularly succeeded. Once again, Viggo Mortensen delivers a polished and convincing performance as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom remains a very good Legolas, and Elijah Wood puts in a fantastic performance as Frodo Baggins. The special effects and computer generated scenes remain incredible and very difficult to tell from the real scenes, especially during the epic final battle. I always think that the final film in a series is the most difficult as the director has to tie up any loose ends, but Peter Jackson makes it look effortless - this is definitely one of the best films he has ever made.While the trilogy doesn't exactly follow the plot of the books, and this film is no exception, it still captures all of the ideas laid out in the books by J.R.R.Tolkein. A must-watch film.",10,0,1,26 June 2011
The Matrix," Fantastic - A must-watch film
","This movie has got to be one of the best films ever made. It has it all - great characters, good actors, plenty of action and incredible special effects. The plot is brilliant - everyone is living inside a computer programme so nothing is actually real? You would need a superb director, great actors and a bucket load of fantastic special effects to carry that off. However, this film manages it brilliantly. One of my favourite scenes is when Neo stops the bullets dead in front of him - absolutely legendary. The stunts in this movie are breathtaking, and despite how unrealistic the plot is, you find yourself wanting to believe it! This is one of the films that everyone has to see at least once in their lives - no matter what their taste in film is. A definite ten out of ten.",10,0,1,26 June 2011
