Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the nerds obsess over it....but its not the best of the series
","There are many people who enjoyed the original series, and why not? With all-stall cast such as Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carie Fisher, James Earl Jones, Peter Cushing and John Henderson, it was a legendary lineup for the whole world.Over the years the new generations view Star Wars as supreme nerdlike and have frowned upon the entire series. What once was a popular franchise was regulated to sci-fi fans and obsesses.Thus we begin Phantom Menace. Prequels to movies can be great (The Godfather 2) and they can be downright disgraceful (Star Trek: Enterprise) but this one is right in the middle. The storyline is a bunch of no-goodniks in alliance with a corrupt Chancelor have taken over a peaceful planet in hopes to get the corrupt Chancellor promoted. In their way are a group of jedi knights, queens, kids, and computer generated aliens that will do anything to save the planet.I didn't think this movie was bad at all but some of the stuff mentioned was kind of unsettling. I'm going into nerd mode for this next rant. Like if this was supposed to be 30 years before Episode 4...that would make Anakin/Darth 40 years old by that time. Luke Skywalker appeared to be in his mid 20's which means Vader conceived him at the age of 15 or so. Episode 2 and 3 has some explaining to do because it sounds weird as of now All in all it wasn't a bad movie and I think non-nerds would like it just as much as everyone else.7 out of 10",7,1,3,17 May 2005
12 Angry Men," A true classic
","In a movie that has basically 3 settings and only 14 cast members, it probably cost more to buy the cast than it did to buy the props. It still was one of the greatest movies ever made.12 Angry Men is a story of how a boy is charged for murder and 11 jurors are convinced that he is guilty...the 12th juror isn't sure. What happens is Henry Fonda has to convince the 11 jurors one by one that the boy is innocent.The cast was incredible, Juror #1 was the take control Foreman. Juror # 2 was the mousy kind of guy. Lee J Cobb as Juror #3 did a brilliant job. Even though I'll always remember EG Marshall for playing Upson Pratt in Creepshow, I also admired his calm and intelligent character of Juror #4. Jack Klugman's Juror #5 was convincing as the street bred man. The working class Juror #6 I can relate to because my father was the same way. Everyone knows Jack Warden for his role as Big Ben Healy in Problem Child, and he was just as funny as the wisecracking Juror #7. Henry Fonda as the hero of the movie, Juror #8 was important giving his role as the good guy in many movies. Juror #9 as the wise old man did a nice job. Ed Begley made me laugh with his performance of the racist Juror #10. Juror #11 I couldn't relate to as an immigrant watch maker but he did play a vital role throughout the movie. Robert Webber as the advertising exec Juror #12 rounded out an all-star cast with style.Great plot, great movie... 10 out of 10",10,0,1,2 May 2005
500 Days of Summer," The harsh reality of love
","To anyone that's ever been in love, you know how it feels to have loved and to have lost.With that said, 500 Days of Summer is a chick flick even guys have to sit up and take notice. Why? Because the message the movie sends out explains pretty much life in general.Stuff just happens....yup, how true is that? The plot is a down on his luck greeting card writer named Tom (played brilliantly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a miserable so and so until he meets the mysterious Summer Finn (also played brilliantly by Zooey Deschanel) and this is where the fun begins.He spends half the movie trying to get with her, a middle portion of the movie with her and pretty much the end trying to get over her. Anyone who's had a woman (or a man) that you can't explain but just can't get over can identify with almost every situation that happens in the movie.I'll give away everything and say right here, that midway through the movie Summer just ups and breaks up with Tom...which drives Tom over the edge into insanity. This insanity also fires him up to leave his crummy job and go into what he really wants to be, an architect. We then find out that Summer has gotten married in the months she's been away from Tom. Which leads us to the end scene which explains pretty much life. Tom is now an architect sitting where he and Summer once hung out and she happens to sit there with him. He then asks how she got married so soon after breaking it off with him and she says 'It just happened' As much as that made me want to jump through the screen and strangle her, its true....things in life happen you just can't explain. Love works in mysterious ways and this movie is proof. You feel for Tom having to watch the woman he loves fall for someone else so easily, and you feel for Tom trying to rebuild his life. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is brilliant...if not sad and wall-punch inducing. The only downside is that...well there really isn't any because this movie is not claiming to be an action or a thriller.The one and only downside to this movie which prevented it from being 10 out of 10 is when Tom gets into a fight with a jerk at the bar and Summer blames him for it....he's defending your honor sweetie, why be mad at him? I say the highlight is after Summer first breaks up with Tom, he's on a date with another girl and he describes their breakup. 'She took a giant s*it on my face, literally' Her 'Literally?' Tom catches himself and says 'No...not literally, that's disgusting!' All in all its a life lesson to be learned by everyone, things just happen. 8 out of 10",8,0,2,7 December 2009
Juno," Surprisingly good
","Life isn't always perfect and this movie symbolizes this sentence very well.Ellen Page plays Juno, a weird high school girl full of sarcasm who realizes she's pregnant one day. Her b/f is a complete tool and she's obviously not fit for motherhood so she enlists a married couple (Jennifer Garner not holding a gun, wtf?? lol) to raise the child once it is born.I have friends who have been pregnant before and they say most of the pregnancy situations in the movie were as they should be such as the tri-mesters, the bodily functions and especially the raging hormones though at severe as in 40 Year Old Virgin. I liked the sarcastic nature of the movie and it depicts how not everything is perfect in life. I liked how near the end Vannessa's (Jennifer Garner)husband takes off and she appears to raise the child on her own. In a cheesy movie, he'd make a comeback saying something like he's sorry and we all live happily ever after, but in the real world that wouldn't happen, hence the ending we were left with.The only negative I have are how she was very mobile when close to berth, I have friends who say there was no way she could have reached in the back of her minivan the way she did in real life. Other than that all is well. Its sort of a chick flick but if you're an aspiring parent and appreciative of sarcastic humor then this movie is for you. The only other negative is the soundtrack makes me want to vomit up my intestines, but other than that check it outThe highlight of the movie is when Jennifer Garner asks if Juno if her parents care where she is and she answers 'I'm already pregnant so there's not much more shenanigans I can get into.Not exactly a family comedy but good sarcastic humor and a great life lesson, its not perfect.6 out of 10",6,2,8,22 February 2008
Blade II," very good sequel
","The original Blade was a decent movie, not exactly Aliens quality but a good one. This movie was even better as it had a compelling storyline that followed through nicely. I like the idea of having two separate types of vampires. Most people said Blade 2 wasn't good because it had Blade fighting along vampires, but isn't Blade supposed to have several vampire traits? I thought it worked out fine, and Ron Pearlman does another great job in a movie.The only problem I had was with the swerves and what not. If Reinhardt was working alongside Damisaikus (I can't spell it) the whole time then why did he wipe out a whole slew of bald vampires with Nyssa and Blade earlier? Everything else, the storyline, plot twists and action was great from beginning to end, great flick 8 out of 10",8,0,5,29 June 2005
Aliens," One of the best movies ever made
","Most of the time...a sequel to a popular movie wouldn't be as good...in this case its not only a better movie than the original but one of the best movies ever.This movie has all sorts of different character personalities to root for. The wisecracking Hudson, the laid back Hicks, the puzzled Gorman, the bad-ass latina Vazquez, the trigger happy Drake and many more.Usually in a horror movie you can't wait for the extra's to be killed off to get to the final climax (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc) but in this case the characters were so lovable it was impossible not to go 'aww damn!' when one of them bought the farm.The action scenes were intense and the fight at the end was pretty cool in the imagery...two mother figures protecting their young ones.The only part about the movie I didn't understand was there was a character who has no lines, never seen on camera and that was Wierzbowski...give the guy at least one line or something.All in all this proved to be an all time classic and with everything one would want in a movie, cept nudity but naked marines doesn;t sound too pleasing.10 out of 10",10,1,2,1 May 2005
Saw III," Too predictable
","The original Saw will be forever one of the most brilliant movies ever made, from beginning to end the first time you see it you are left in amazement. The second movie was a bit of a let down but nonetheless very entertaining to watch, but too much of a good thing is a bad thing which leaves us with....this.The thing about the first 2 movies are the plot twists that 'no one sees coming', and while the first and second movies (the first time through anyway) have that killer x-factor, by now movie fans are looking for the twists. The sad part was I wanted to love this movie, I liked it because of the gore and Tobin Bell's continuing brilliance of John/Jigsaw but I wanted to love it like the first two movies, but I couldn't.Several plot 'twists' become disappointingly clear well before they're supposed to be revealed, which ruins the suspense when you know something's coming. You can come up with the ending's twist simply by putting 2 and 2 together about the possible parents of the children.The plot of it isn't that great either, a man loses his son in a car accident and must save all the people involved that did nothing about justice for the child? Least the first movie centered around a Doctor with a shady past and the second around a cop's son trapped with a bunch of people his dad locked up. The dude running around debating whether to save people or not was not really something to get behind.Now lets get to the gore...Dina Meyer gets her ribcage ripped out, a woman literally freezes to death, a judge almost drowns in pig guts and someone gets turned around 180 degrees. I must say they kicked it up a notch from the first 2 movies, but more doesn't necessarily mean better. Where the hell did Jigsaw and Amanda find 100 dead pigs anyway? Unlike the first 2 movies, this movie didn't end like there would be another sequel...yet they made one anyway. I can only hope that one can be a lot better than this, because this was just too predictable.The highlight of the movie has to be the ribcage thing, I thought she got it bad in Starship Troopers but this takes the cake 5 out of 10",5,0,0,17 May 2008
The Usual Suspects," Easily one of the all time best movies ever made
","This movie has it all from great casting to great plot and everything in between. If you're intelligent you will get the entire movie and at the end will be like 'this was awesome' Everyone who was involved in this movie I have seen in others which is a testament of how great this particular cast was, not one of them were B-List. Another great quality was the 5 criminals each had their own character type and was different from the others. Chaz Palmanterri with hair also was amusing to watch.This movie is for everyone, man or female because it deals more with psychological and non-action themes such as drug deals, court casing and immunity.One of the best flicks ever 10 out of 10",10,0,2,2 May 2005
Gran Torino," Absolutely awesome
","If you've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie before, and if you're under 21 that's a lot of you....this is one of his best performances of all time.The storyline is, crotchety old Korean War vet Walter Kowalski (a tip of the hat to Killer Kowalski no doubt) is near death and has nothing to live for. The neighborhood he's lived in for years is now overrun with Koreans, and he being completely racist, can't stand it. One day he catches a kid named Tong trying to steal his prized 1972 Grand Torino and rather than blowing his head off..he takes him under his wing and tries to make a man out of him. Along the way he runs into just about every ethnic gang imaginable and talks down all of them...GOOD! I won't spoil the rest of the movie but lets just say, if more old men were like Eastwood's character, the world would be a much better place.The one liners in the movie had me laughing till 6 in the morning, one in particular was when Tong asks Walter what he wants to do and he says 'You see that tree outside? I want you to go in there and count the birds' All in all its actually a very well done movie and even though the language is not suitable for the whole family, it does have a lot of life lessons throughout and should be a must watch for people of all ages.The highlight of the movie is when Eastwood calls one gang who's harassing Su, a bunch of 'spooks' 8 out of 10",8,1,4,4 January 2009
Slap Shot," Hey Hanrahan!!!
","Growing up as a kid who played all kind of sports, there are usually two sets of movies that you can watch to get some fun out of them. For instance kids will watch The Sandlot while adults watch Major League and kids will watch Little Giants while adults watch The Longest Yard. This movie is the adults hockey movie to combat The Mighty Ducks.The story is a struggling independent hockey league franchise is about to go down the drain until the player/coach (played by Paul Newman) gets the idea to spice the game up with trash talking, constant fighting and vicious violence.Think about that, back when I was a kid most of the kids who liked hockey were watching Mighty Ducks to learn how to skate and stuff like that I was watching Slapshot, learning how to curse and beat people up. The Bash Brothers or The Hanson Brothers....hey cake-eater or hey hanrahan, it was a great time.Back to Slapshot, it was so hilarious watching Paul Newman shout invectives at a goalie about his lesbian wife. You have to watch this movie to love the feel and atmosphere, its a great one.9 out of 10 (would have been 10 but the soundtrack puts me to sleep)",9,0,3,29 May 2005
The Evil Dead," Original
","While this movie was never in the running for an academy award, it has touched two generations of fans now in the last 26 years. It was made by college kids as nothing more than a b-movie but it turned out to be one of the most original and gruesome movies in the last quarter century.Evil Dead is a tale about 5 college kids taking a vacation in a secluded cabin among the woods somewhere in Michigan. During their stay they stumble upon the centuries old Necronomicon, the book of the dead. (Not to be confused with the book of the dead from The Mummy) After stupidly reading from the book, the ancient evil the book possessed comes to life and begins attacking the 5 kids (including one scene where a woman is raped by a tree, yes you read that right) until they are either killed or posssessed. One by one they are dispatched by the one remaining survivor named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and by daylight the evil is gone....or so we thought.This movie took the possession concept from The Exorcist to a brand new level. This was supposed to be a b-movie orchestrated by college kids yet the special effects are AWESOME for 1981 and non-Hollywood standards. If you see this movie and not the next 2 in the series, its quite amusing to see Ash play the role of the wussy as upposed to the hero he'd become. If you look at the movie from the perspective of it was a low budget flick run by unknown actors, actresses, directors, etc you can truly appreciate its lasting effects on the world and the sequels spawned from it.The highlight of the movie is the end when Ash throws the Necronomicon into the fire and the remaining deadites (names for the possessed) melt, that's tremendous special effect work if I may say so. Definitely watchable 6 out of 10",6,1,4,28 January 2008
Shrek 2," decent kids movie
","Being the horror movie guru, kids movies aren't my cup of tea. When forced to look after kids, its nearly impossible to not watch a kids movie. One night in Rome I had to look after my sister and 4 other kids and we watched Shrek 2. I haven't seen the first one so my knowledge of the series is limited.The storyline is Shrek had married Princess Fiona and are supposed to return to the castle to visit Fiona's parents. Standing in the way of a perfect marriage is The King, Prince Charming and Fairy Godmother. On Shrek's side is Fiona, his sidekick Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), foe turned friend Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Bandaras), and a gang of storybook people like Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, 3 Blind Mice, 3 little pigs. Shrek will do anything to make Fiona love him so he drinks a magic potion to turn human, which Fairy Godmother uses to Charming's advantage in confusing Fiona to thinking Shrek is Charming. Shrek and his gang of fairy tale people storm the castle using a Stay Puff Marshmellow Man inspired huge Gingerbread Man to save his marriage with Fiona.Its a decent kids movie for what its worth. The message to the kids that everyone has their own beauty is brilliant and the voice overs are somewhat hilarious. Hard to see Antonio Bandaras to go from El Mariachi to Puss in Boots but it fit the character well. If you want to entertain the kids and watch a movie as a family, this is a great choice.9 out of 10 for a kids movie.",9,0,0,26 July 2005
Evil Dead II," groovy
","After the underground success the original Evil Dead had, 6 years later Hollywood decided to make a sequel. By this point Bruce Campbell was in his mid to late 20's so playing the college kid was a little far-fetched so they altered the plot a bit, basically rendering the original movie as useless. Seriously, if you watch the whole series one after the other, its like the first movie never happened.The story is Ash and his girlfriend go on a romantic getaway in a secluded cabin among the woods somewhere in Michigan, sound familiar? Ash then finds a tape of some doctor who used the house for research on a mysterious evil book known as the Necronomicon. Professor Knowby somehow translated the book and with the help of a huge 1980's tape recorder begins reciting passages from it. The passages he recites resurrect the deadites (the demons of the Necronomicon) and then WHAM all hell breaks loose, literally. Ash is forced to kill his possessed girlfriend, cut off his own hand and fight a tree...yes you read that right. Meanwhile while all this is going on, Professor Knowby's daughter and her boyfriend make their way to the cabin to find ol Knowby himself and run into a redneck couple along the way. All things come together where the handless Ash must join up with the crew to stop the Evil Dead once and for all.I won't give away the rest because its too good to give it away so you'll just have to watch it yourself. Again the special effects were the star of the show but this time its kicked up a notch thanks to it being a better funded film than the first one. What made Evil Dead 2 a little better than the original was the original one was 100 % serious while the sequel was more of a horror/comedy with a few scenes that make you laugh including a Hulk Hogan style hulk-up before the final fight and of course the transformation. In the first movie Ash was this wussy guy caught in the middle of something strange but in this movie he transforms into a chainsaw welding, shotgun carrying superhero. He somehow manages to hook a chainsaw to where he cut off his hand (nevermind the fact he didn't bleed to death nor suffer gangrene) and carry around an old sawed-off shotgun......groovy.Discount anything you've seen in the first movie if you want to enjoy the sequel, otherwise you'll be scratching your head wondering what's going on. Otherwise kick back with popcorn and enjoy the show. The highlight of the movie is the laughing scene where every inanimate object in the room begins to laugh and then Ash joins in the fun, priceless comedy.7 out of 10",7,0,1,28 January 2008
