The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," That was a total crap fest
","What a load of crap that movie was. Bad script, bad acting, bad everything all around. The movie drug on for ever to say basically nothing. The strange cgi baby just about killed me. I only gave it 2 stars because the cgi on Stewart was pretty cool. Everyone looked odd in this movie. Alice had her hair cut, and Carlie Cullen looked like he had a bad wig on. The other three movies and I would be stretching it to say I liked them, but this one I hated. It was a total crap fest. Go read the books you probably get more out of it. Ewww shudder this was a God awful movie. And the whole wolf mental thing, give me a break. I am like one of the other reviewers on here, why not talk in human form and then shape shift into a wolf, that was really dumb. Oh those Voltaire vampire dudes, I really don't like them, and that little snippet after the credits, it was a wast of time.",2,6,10,25 November 2011
Knives Out," The butler didn't do it
",I really enjoyed this movie. So many laughing points and watching how all of these great actors inter act with each other. I felt like this movie was like playing the game clue. Mostly laughed at Daniel Craig's accent..fried chicken southern drawl...as Evens character says. It was done in Agatha Christie style which made this movie fun to watch. Great script and each character was written fantastically..Man I hated this family. Watch it if you really want to be entertained.,8,3,6,30 May 2020
Aquaman," Super action and fun
",This was a very enjoyable movie. A lot of action which made the movie fun to watch. The visuals were beautiful in this movie. Jason Momoa is a excellent Aquaman. His one line cracks are funny and match his character. This was a great movie. Story well done....Directing and writing good....I don't see anyone not liking this movie....a good time all around.,8,2,4,19 December 2018
Marriage Story," True to life
",A sad look into the divorce of two people who still care about each other. I had a few tears while watching this. It was so close to my own life and how my own divorce was. A grownup look into a window of the end of a marriage and it affects both sides...SJ and Driver had such great chemistry.,9,12,23,8 December 2019
