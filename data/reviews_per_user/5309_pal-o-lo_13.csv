Mission: Impossible III," Without doubt the worst of the three movies.
","I'll be nice and start off with the good things I have to say about the movie. I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy myself in the theater. But that is probably saying more about my lousy taste in movies, than it says about the quality of MI3.Okay, I said I would start with the positives As always the special effects, were incredible. And the Mission Impossible theme is still the most thrilling spy-movie music ever written. Yes even better than the traditional James Bond theme. Well, I think that anyway. That theme just gets my adrenaline pumping every time.But after saying this, it just goes down the drain. I don't think I have ever seen Tom Cruise play this lousily. He should never try to act in an emotional scene, he just doesn't cut it. The guy is like an emotional block of liquid hydrogen frozen granite.Besides, said emotional scenes seemed so out of place in this move that i barely could keep myself from bursting into roaring laughter, every time.SPOILER WARNING: The resurrection scene at the end, is still now, an hour later, giving me the urge to laugh like a hyena. It is a stupid try to reproduce what Ed Harris and Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio did so splendidly in The Abbyss.END SPOILER.Now, back to MI3.It helps a little that Tom does the action part pretty well, but it doesn't take away the ridiculousness of the whole movie. The plot is so recycled and so minimal that it isn't even funny. It wouldn't even fill a full written page. And within the first minutes we get a clue the size of the Milkyway, about what will happen in the end. Why such a splendid actor as Laurence Fishburne agreed to be in on this move is beyond my comprehension. Some of the things done by Ethan hunt here, would have fit nicely into The Matrix, but in the 'real world' it just isn't possible,to the point of being ludicrous.Finally, that villain were so two dimensionally boringly acted by whomever did it that it was laughable.The actor didn't seem to make an effort at all.So why the heck I enjoyed this movie, I do not know. I think I need to have my head checked.That's all folks Paladin Steelbreaker.",3,11,23,5 May 2006
Spider-Man 3," Uninspired and almost dull
","Well, what can I say. I AM DISAPPOINTED! I was expecting way more than this garbage!!! No, to be honest, it isn't that bad. The problem is that it could and should have been so incredibly much better. The biggest problem is that they piled three major villains upon each other. They should have stuck to only Sandman, Venom, or Goblin. NOT ALL THREE OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME!!! It simply became too much, and it totally killed the suspense and plot. Instead of a well thought through plot with a real character development like in the two first movies, everything seemed rushed and half finished. In my opinion they should have staid with Venom as the villain. He was the best of the three anyway.And what in the world were they thinking when they made the Goblin one of the good guys? If memory doesn't serve me wrong, Harry became just as psychotic and evil as his father, once he became the Green Goblin. And I don't remember him die either, although I may be wrong there. Well over to the stronger sides of the movie. The fight scenes were as always fantastic. Sandman was just the way i imagined, and so was Venom. And Mary Jane's failure as an actress, were like taken right out of the comic book, with her being too ashamed to tell Peter, and being jealous of the attention he is getting as Spiderman. Although both Mary Jane and Peter were characterized a bit too much goofy teenage like(i don't think Harry became Goblin until after MJ and Peter were married), Tobey and Kirsten did an overall good job catching the essence of MJ and Peter. But I will say that Tobey has a thing or two to learn from Kirsten when it comes to acting. I feel he did a better job in the first movies. His heart just didn't seem to be in it this time. the filming and the soundtrack as always managed to bring me into the Marvel Universe, and the atmosphere of the movie were god. In fact it WAS a good movie, but nevertheless a big disappointment. Thats all folks Paladin Steelbreaker.",4,2,4,11 May 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Clearly the best of three
","Well, this one annoys me! It is one heck of a spy thriller. Matt Dammon continues to portrait Jason Bourne in a surprisingly good almost shockingly so way. From being a barely mediocre actor, he in these three movies have grown to be a splendid actor. And in this last installment, he simply is Bourne. Well, at least the movie version. The only thing that pulls down, is that Matt doesn't know martial arts if his life depended on it. But what could have been disastrous for the series, have been saved by one heck of a genius behind the camera. The fast moving close in camera, successfully hides his lack of fighting skills in most instances.the plots have become better for each movie also, and it is with a heavy heart i have to give this one 8 stars. Because I am sorely tempted to give it an ZERO.Why?! You may ask. And the answer is, the entire trilogy is a bloody mockery of the ingenious books by Robert Ludlum. Almost nothing from the books has made it into the movies.I sincerely hope someone will make a real modern movie version of the books. That done properly, ladies and gentlemen, would be a sure 10.Thats all for now. Paladin Steelbreaker",8,3,5,16 September 2007
The Bourne Identity," A movie that is both really good, and really bad
","Okay, this was a good spy movie, of the traditional kind, but still up to date. And the sequel is even better, and a bit more true to the books. And if I never read the books, I would give them a vote of 6 for the first one, and 7 for the second. The books. Therein lay my problem with the Bourne movies. Almost nothing from the books have made it into the movies. And what little there is, they have messed around with until it is almost unrecognizable. It is a great shame, and a travesty to the genius works of Robert Ludlum. If he were alive today, he would have been steaming mad! I wish for once they would make a movie that did justice to the Bourne books. That would have been the father of all action dramas! But if you never read the books, these movies are well worth watching. This is surprisingly enough, much thanks to really good acting from Matt Damon. I have never really liked Damon as an actor. He never seem to be able to connect with his character. But in the Bourne movies, he for the first time really impresses me. Especially in the second movie, where he simply IS Jason Bourne.",6,1,2,7 November 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Simply the best movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","There is only one thing to say. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is the best movies that has ever been made, and is ever going to be made! This is the utter perfection of movie making! Uh! Okay, that sounds really fanatical, and I am sorry about that. But the fact remains. The trilogy is the best movies I have ever seen. I could not find anything negative about any of them. I don't think it is possible to come closer to perfection, in the way Pete have adapted the book onto the big screen. Yes, I am aware that many things from the book has been left out. But if they hadn't done that, the trilogy had become five times as long, and probably a heck of a lot more boring. A lot of the stuff that worked splendidly in the book, simply wouldn't on the screen. Pete Jackson saw this, and removed those bits. Still he managed to keep the feeling, the atmosphere of the books. And I firmly believe that if Mr. Tolkien were alive today, he would have wept in joy after seeing these movies.Since I have not seen every movie in the world,lol, I can not REALLY say that this is the best movies that has ever been made, cause i don't know. What I CAN say, is that they are the best movies I have ever seen, and I don't expect ever to see something as good again. I highly recommend that you make a huge pan of popcorn, make sure you have enough to drink, and then sit down and watch all three movies after one another. Preferably on as big a screen as possible. I promise you, given that you don't hate fantasy, it will be an experience you will remember for the rest of your life.",10,0,3,7 November 2004
Van Helsing," A darned good movie !
","Well what can I say?!I went to the Cinema, just hoping I hadn't wasted perfectly good money on a total fiasco of a movie. I left the theater with a serious Adrenal High, and the feeling that I had seen a very good movie. Of the swarm of superhero/comic movies over the last years, this one is my absolute favorite. The acting was superb. Hugh simply WAS Abraham Van Helsing. The filming, and soundtrack was just as good. And the sheer atmosphere of the film got chills running down my back. Now, I haven't seen any of the Dracula movies, and I haven't read the book. So I don't really known how Van Helsing was described originally. What I do know is that i simply loved this version. My hope now, is that they will make a sequel. I want more monster slaying. Lol.",8,1,2,6 November 2004
Die Hard 2," Simply one of the best, maybe best action movie ever!
","So what negative things do I have to say about this movie? The answer is null, zero,silch,nada,nichts,ingenting, well, you get the picture. This movie is truly a MUST SEE, for everyone who like action movies.In many action movies, the hero tends to be so mighty, one never really doubts if he/she will prevail. In this movie on the other hand, Willis manages to give a great deal of human vulnerability to the tough as nail John MacLane. Making you sit there with your heart in your throat, wondering: How does this end?!!! SPOILER WARNING The scene where MacLane sits down on the stairs and just cries, knowing that the plane where his wife is, will soon crash, is perhaps the most heart wrenching scene I have ever witnessed in a action movie. END OF SPOILERBruce Willis truly proves in this movie, what a splendid actor he is. In my experience very few, maybe no other action actor can show such an ability to not just act the character, but to become the character.Although this would have been a good action movie no matter who played John MacLane, It is Bruce Willis that lifts this move up to a level, where it will be held in high regard for a very long time. It is very rare that a sequel is better than the original, this is the fact here. Although Die Hard certainly is a very good action movie, it lacks that nagging doubt. Does this end well! The same is with the thirdmovie, which is in my opinion the weakest of the three. It is kind of funnier, but lacks most of the nerve from the first two movies. Even so, the third move is also more than worth watching. If you have not yet seen Die Hard 2 or it's prequel/sequel, then you are seriously over due. Run and rent them!!!!!!",10,1,3,7 November 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Okay, but not impressive.
","Well, there isn't much to say about this one. It is an okay action movie. The special effects, and costumes were fabulous, but the rest didn't measure up to it. Lance Henriksen gave probably the worst acting performance in his career. He always seems to have a very strong presence on the screen. This was not the fact here. He seemed to almost disappear in all the ruckus. As if he were bored to hell by the whole movie. I was actually relieved when his character died. The woman that had the lead role, sorry I don't remember her name, performed much better. Although by no means worthy of even looking at an Oscar, her acting alone saved this movie from being a total let down. Even though she gets totally squashed by the looming shadow of Sigourney's Ripley character, she does deliver the goods in a convincing manner. Instead of trying to act like Ripley, which would have been a catastrophe since no one can fill her shoes, she chose to do it her own way. And it worked! But the camera work were too bad. I got totally confused, trying to find out where the heck they were! There seemed to be no point what so ever, what way they walked. they just stumbled, ran and fell around, with no plan! Luckily the sole remaining young predator seemed to know where he and the environmentalist went. But it didn't help on me almost getting a vertigo feeling. And we very seldom got to really see the hieroglyphs, as they always were too far away or in an impossible angle to see. Mostly they just looked like decoration, ugly decoration.Still, all in all I enjoyed the movie, with all it's weaknesses. Let's face it, one doesn't go to this kind of movie, expecting to get a excellent written plot. The plot here were minimal, but did work to some degree. Although, I never understood why that Alien Queen never had escaped before then. And I am wondering why that queen didn't die from all the bullets and energy blasts she got struck with in the end. If i don't recall wrong, Ripley killed queens left and right with a gun. Not to mention that there was no way in hell this queen could survive the blast from the predators bomb! It was designed for that purpose, for crying out loud!!! As the queen was pulled down into the deep, the possibility of a sequel were jumping almost painfully at me. THE ALIEN QUEEN RETURNS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TO SEEK HER REVENGE!!!! BWAHAHAHA!!!! And finally, the one thing in the movie I really couldn't swallow, the ending. It just HAD to come! AN ALIEN/PREDATOR HYBRID!!!!I enjoyed this movie, but I hope to God they never make a sequel.Thats all, folks.",5,1,2,16 November 2004
Batman Begins," Excellent!!! Just plain and simple excellent !!!
","Well, I always loved the Batman movies. But in the later years, as I grew up, I have found them more and more over the top comic book like. Okay,Batman IS originally a comic book, but they tried too much to make a cartoon out of a real movie. Especially when it came to the villains.Don't get me wrong, I laughed my head off, at Jim Carey as The Riddler, and Tomy Lee Jones was okay as Twoface. and And Jack Nicholson as The Joker was excellent, even Arnold was okay. But Danny Devito's The Penguin, made me want to puke. As always, Danny did a good job, but the character almost destroyed the movie with its outrageously disgusting parody of a comic book villain.Well, enough about the old ones. Batman Beginns, Is on an entirely other level of quality. The plot is extremely much more thought through. Every detail has been made more believable. Especially how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman. To my great joy, they dropped the more or less psychotic avenger attitude of the previous Batmans. Here is at last, a sane Bruce Wayne!!!! The guy who played him, did an excellent job portraying a person who actually manages to defeat his inner demons. All right, there sure is an element of vengeance in his fight against crime. But his main motivation is to do something with what has happened to his beloved city. He like his father, sees the pain and suffering of other people, and does what he can to help.Ironically it is the main villain who helps him become a whole person, who learns him how to discern vengeance from justice. That being said, Liam Neeson was incredible as an villain. He perfectly portrayed a person who in a way had noble intents, but who had strayed off the path, and into madness. It was this example that showed Bruce how not to be. Liam's character had let himself be consumed by vengeance, whereas Bruce thanks to seeing that, managed to stay on the right track.I must say that when I first saw Liam, I gave a inward sigh. I should have known better, but I highly doubted he would be able to portray a villain, as he always seem to be some sort of a 'hero'. But his characterization hit bulls eye. I actually shuddered in discomfort a few times, from seeing the fanatic madness, of his character. In my opinion, he is by far the best Batman villain so far.There is not much to say about Kate. She did the job in a good but not very memorable way, and I think that she looked much too young to have the kind of job she had.Gary Oldman on the other hand, did the best characterization of Commissioner(I know he wasn't that yet in this movie) Gordon, to date. It always amazes me to see how much of a chameleon this actor is. If you see this movie, and then you see The Fifth Element It is almost unbelievable that it is the same actor who plays Zorg and Gordon.Morgan Freeman is one of those actors that hightens the quality of a movie simply by being there. And so it was in this movie to. He has this PRECENSE on screen, that very few can duplicate. He managed to make this in fact very small role, into one of the major characters of the movie.The butler. I am sorry to say I don't know the name of the actor. But I was glad to see that they had kept true to the only realistic character of the old movies. Although there was a new actor, he managed to pick up right where the former was, with his characterization of a loyal butler, who becomes sort of a surrogate father to Bruce. And this time we got to see more clearly the deep friendship that was between the two of them. Alfred, really was more of a dear family member, than an employee.I am sorry, I seem to have taken off completely here. I'll try to stop now. JUST RUN TO THE NEAREST CINEMA AND SEE THIS MOVIE. THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!And think of this! They are already planning a new one! I sure as anything will be there!!! Well, thats all folks.",10,1,3,16 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," What a crime!
","It worked fine as an action flick. But it is totally and utterly rubbish according to the comic books. The guys that wrote the script must not know the first thing about the story. Especially when it comes to Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix and Caine Marko/Juggernaut. Really!!!! the movie didn't do them justice at all. Both of them were infinitely more powerful than the movie showed. That goes for professor X to. Well to be honest, the only three in the movie that was described close to the original, was Bobby, that fire guy, and Magneto. The script writers should be ashamed. We who went to the cinema should get our money back. This was perhaps the worst movie ever, based on a super hero comic book. Thats all I have to say now. Palmar Olav Løklingholm",3,12,30,26 May 2006
Blood Diamond," Surelly the best acting performance of Di Caprio so far.
","Well, I went to the cinema, hoping for a reasonably good movie. Lets face it Di Caprio, in the past, never really was more than a pretty boy face and a lousy actor.But in the later years his acting has been steadily increasing in quality. He seems to have really grown up, as an actor. I mean, with The Aviator he proved once and for all, that not only can he act, but he has become a darned good actor.In Blood Diamonds, he does one of the best performances by any actor in recent years. The way he managed to balance total cynicism with just the amount of humanity for the viewers not to despise his character, was awe inspiring. In my opinion he should have gotten an Oscar for this film. Not to diminish Hansou's performance, but Di Caprio really shone. And as Hansou got a really well deserved Oscar, I feel that Di Caprio did just as good a performance, maybe better.Jennifer also did a splendid job. Here is maybe the only weak point on the script. I felt she was maybe a bit underused. Had she been given a chance in the script, i got the distinct feeling that she would have done just as well as her male co actors. But what she did, was a piece of flawless acting.All in all, I will give this movie a strong eight. I will stop at that, because it lacked the bit of emotional weight that would have given it a ten. Nevertheless, i think this is going to be one of the better movies in 2007.Run to the Theatre and watch it! You will not be disappointed. Thats all folks",8,0,0,4 March 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," If you have read the books, for gods sake don't watch these movies!!
","Yep! If you have read the books and still want to watch the Bourne movies, then there is one very important thing to remember.JUST FORGET EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOOKS,AND TREAT THE BOURNE MOVIES AS IF THEY WEREN'T ABOUT JASON BOURNE.If you manage to do that, like I almost did, then you will enjoy these movies, because against all odds, they are really good.But if you can't put aside the contents of the books, then you are going to become one hundred percent steaming barking mad and totally incensed. They have messed up the entire story line of the books so entirely, that they should not have been allowed to neither claim it was built on the books of Mr. Ludlum, nor get to use the name Jason Bourne on the main character.Sorry about this. All the reviews for the Bourne movies seem to have nothing but good things to say about them. and if they didn't claim to be guilt from the Jason Bourne books, then I would agree wholly. These are really good action movies. But I felt there needed to be some serious warning out there, for those of us who had read the books.To us, these movies were an utter disappointment.Paladin Steelbreaker.",7,1,2,6 November 2005
The Island," All in all a pretty decent movie
","Well what can be said about this one. It wasn't a bad move, thats about the best I can say about it. After reading a bit about the movie, I was looking forward to watching it. I bought my ticket and a bottle of Urge, and sat down for what I expected to be one of my better movie experiences this year.That didn't happen. Yes there was some good action, and the base concept of the move was quite good. And then there was that Laurent guy, who in my opinion did the best acting in the movie, maybe except for Ewan MacGregors double role. I never expected Ewan to be able to be such an complete asshole. so yes that was good acting. Sean Bean was an utter disappointment. He is usually much better in playing more or less psychotic persons. but this wasn't what stopped the movie of going from decent to good. I don' know what it was. All the things needed to make it a really good sci-fi was there. It just...flopped. I never really was caught by this movie. I wasn't pulled in. I kept sitting there in the movie theater, thinking; something is missing. Maybe it was that neither Scarlet nor Ewan seemed to be really interested in doing their best. They just went through the motions of making a movie. A few times it actually seemed as if they wished they were somewhere else, especially Scarlet. But to be fair, I can understand it if she was a bit uninterested, since she never really had to do anything in the movie. I got the feeling the director just wanted a pretty female co-player to Ewan.I believe Scarlet could have done considerably better if the script just allowed her to. Inside the complex in the beginning, she didn't seem so bad. but as soon as they were on the run, she just stumbled after Ewan and wasn't any help at all.Okay, enough complaining here. All in all, the movie WAS worth its money to watch. It just could have been Sooo much better.That is all folks.",6,0,0,6 August 2005
