Marie Antoinette," weak
","Just a boring movie! It has little to say. Shows you what everybody already know through history. No strong point of view! Most likely Columbia Pictures and Sony will loose money! It has the utmost capital SIN: little happens weak plot! Thanks god, Columbia and Sony has 007 to compensate the result of this box office. Also the characters are a passive, few areas in this movie are not slow. In general too slow even the cinematography doesn't hold the film, that's a mission for plot. Where is the plot????? I also could see the boom microphone get in and out few times in two scenes. That's something that nobody notices when the movie is entertaining! I fortunately could go through the movie because I drank some coffee.",1,2,8,21 October 2006
