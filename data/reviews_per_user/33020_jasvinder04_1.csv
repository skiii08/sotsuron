Iron Man 3," Such a disappointment.....
","Iron Man 3 was such a waste of my money. I went to watch the movie because of Sir Ben but was disappointed. The movie is poorly directed, it has cheesy jokes which I found really unfunny. If you are going to watch this movie because of the 'super awesome' trailer, you are going to waste your money and your time. Believe me, the movie sucks. Robert Downey Jr. played his part and it was really excellent, Guy Pearce's acting hardly made an impression of a villain. The movie is more of a comedy movie than an action movie. The movie's really good for small kids. If this is an end of the Iron Man trilogy, it's a rather disappointing end.",5,3,6,4 May 2013
