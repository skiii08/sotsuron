3:10 to Yuma," Perfectly ordinary
","I've seen the greatest westerns ever made, 3:10 To Yuma (2007) wasn't in the same ballpark. Much too ordinary to rate high in any category. The cast was weak. Some great actors in roles that did much less than use their talents. The good guys and the bad guys were low in personality and just not convincing in their roles. The 2nd in command bad guy was the most convincing. The usual sheriff character was especially weak. I liked the fact that people had to load their revolvers now and then instead of shooting off 40 rounds without reloading. To compare the star's role to his other movies really sank the movie for me. Great and interesting actor in a real bore of a character. The good guy was boring beyond belief. I hope this role doesn't sink his acting career. When I think of great westerns, I think of Red River, The Big Country, Winchester '73, Bend Of The River, The Far Country, High Noon, Shane, The Searchers, Once Upon A Time In The West, My Darling Clementine.",5,3,7,2 January 2008
