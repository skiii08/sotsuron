United 93," dramatic, gripping and raw
","The movie was more than anything to me (aside from emotional reactions) informative. It shed a lot of light on the behind the scenes events of 9/11 from the perspective of Traffic Control and the Military especially. With the inclusion of real participants the reality was heightened greatly.United 93 seemed very authentic on the ground but I couldn't shake the fact that many of the plane events had to have been dramatized and that wasn't disclaimed. The wounds are still fresh and this movie certainly won't make that any easier but I for one am glad I overcame my aversion to this hard subject and the painful memories and hope you do the same. as a movie: 7/10as a tribute to the crew, passengers and ground people involved or lost:9.5/10",7,1,5,11 May 2006
