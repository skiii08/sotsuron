The King's Speech," Pure Excellence.
","Most of the film's on my watch list for 2011 are either sci-fi or superhero movies. I could never have predicted this to be such a hit.I understand the amount of hype that is surrounding this film, and normally I recommend staying away from the hype, but here I'll make an exception. The King's speech is simply a masterpiece.The storyline itself is simple, yet incredibly intriguing. The direction of the film is beautiful making it a sheer joy to watch. I was never once bored, in fact I was completely entertained every second of the film. But the real reason I watched this film was, not because of the story, but for the acting. It shouldn't come as a surprise, but Collin Firth is truly astonishing. His performance is more than Oscar worthy, and deserves to be always remembered. In fact, it was not acting. Collin Firth became the character of George VI. Also Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter both did a marvellous job in the film.This film went straight to my list of must-own films, and I suggest everyone else do the same. A film like this is extremely rare, and deserves all the praise it can get. There is only one word that can sum the film up. Masterpiece.",9,0,0,22 March 2011
The Avengers," Utterly flawless, though not quite a classic
","Let me just cut straight to the main point: Joss Whedon has made the impossible work. Not only has he made it work, but work well. Marvel Avengers Assemble is just as good as the hype would have it, though fails to surpass it.To avoid confusion, this is the same film released in the US which is titled Marvel's The Avengers, but has been re-named in the UK to avoid any confusion with the classic 60's television series The Avengers. Despite its awkward title (I'll refer to it as Avengers), Avengers fulfils its very goal in bringing together the characters of the Marvel cinematic universe and making an incredibly entertaining action movie. The greatest challenge of this film, no doubt, was bringing these characters together and giving them all a fair amount of screen time whilst trying to make their relationships work. Not only does director Joss Whedon do this, but he manages to include a nice level of believable character development and emotion to a film that is first and foremost and action movie. Whilst the action scenes were undoubtedly entertaining, it was in the film's smaller moments, in which the characters share the screen (particularly the chemistry between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner) that make the film such a success. When these characters have their individual movies, they are learning how to deal with their personal problems. In this movie, they are learning how to deal with working together as a team, this being the main purpose of the film. It really is a marvel (sorry!) that Whedon has managed to make this work, let alone being as entertaining as it is. The film packs in humour, emotion and tension without becoming a clustered mess.The special effects were all impressive, especially on the motion-capture used to create the Hulk, and the Iron Man armour. The final battle did admittedly remind me of Transformers 3, but unlike that film, this never regresses into chaos, and the film feels very in-control of itself and you always know exactly what is going on. The action itself is nothing special, but it's watching these characters work together as a team that is so much fun. The film is a little biased towards Iron Man action, containing more Iron Man than the last two Iron Man movies put together, but fear not, this is a good thing.Performance wise, all performances were on top form, even from Scarlet Johansen who has vastly improved her 'Black-Widow' character from the wooden acting we saw in Iron Man 2. For me, the stand-out performances were from Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ Hulk. I was initially biased against replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, but can safely say Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner we have seen to date, and I love the fact that Ruffalo did his own motion-captured performance as Hulk. Tom Hiddleston steals every scene as the villainous Loki, evolving his character from the lost prince of Asgard we saw in Thor, into an utterly unstoppable and menacing force of hatred.Unfortunately, just making a film 'work well' doesn't raise it to instant 'classic' status, but what is really incredible about Avengers is how utterly flawless it is. There's nothing particularly special about the film, but it's just fantastic watching these characters share the same screen. When appreciated for what it is, Avengers is an entertaining ride, not taking itself too seriously whilst focusing on thrills and fun, incorporating emotion and character development into the mix. I look forward to re-watching it.",8,3,8,10 August 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," In Shallow Waters
","It's been a few years since we last saw Jack, and many including myself have missed these films. But alas, Pirates of the Caribbean has returned in a fourth instalment! The last two films were not exactly hugely popular when compared to the masterpiece of the original film, so naturally this film had a job to do in order to win the hearts of thousands of fans. Personally I liked the first and second films equally, the third film a little too dark for my taste. As for film number 4? Not bad at all.In case you are new to the franchise this film picks up where 'At World's End' ended, with Captain Jack in search of the Fountain of Youth, but this film can easily appeal to the casual viewer, after all it is based on a book. In terms of the film's connection to the last three, the story is a continuation, but very few characters return. Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Mr. Gibbs are the only characters to actually return with Teague making a brief cameo. On the plus side, the film introduces many brilliant new characters, including new antagonist Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and love interest Angelica (Penelope Cruz) who are far better than the bitterly annoying Will and Elizabeth.On the acting front the film was flawless, with Johnny Depp giving his usual outstanding performance as Jack Sparrow and Ian McShane giving an original, non-eccentric and fantastic performance as Blackbeard.As for the plot, the film was not flawless, with the story taking second place this time around with the main focus being on the characters. This isn't a bad thing, however the film did suffer for it. The main story-arc focuses on the characters Jack and Barbossa in search of the Fountain of Youth. During Jack's journey he soon discovers that Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica are also in search of it, though the reasons for this are not memorable nor will audiences care come the end of the film. As for Barbossa's motives in this film, you do find out, but not until the third half of the film making his journey a little pointless from the perspective of the audience. And as for the ending? Well, my lips are sealed, but it felt like a bit of a cop out to me. These few flaws aside, the film takes some interesting tolls, introducing us to Zombie Pirates, Mermaids, a wild chase through London Town and a rum-fuelled ride on the whole. It's a fun journey while it lasts, but at times a bit of a boring one and the film did drag on a bit come the final act.All I can say, to the casual viewer this film deserves no more than a 6/10. But, being a generous and loyal fan of the 'Pirates' franchise, I'm giving this a decent 7/10. Entertaining stuff if a little shallow.",6,0,0,9 June 2011
Source Code," Time Twister
","Being a fan of high-concept films, I was always going to see this film and I am 100% glad I did.At it's heart Source Code is an easy concept to understand; A train will explode in eight minutes. The protagonist must find the bomb. If he fails he can try again, as he is in a machine called the 'source code' simulating time travel. Simple enough? Things get complicated as the plot takes unusual and exciting twists and turns. Just what is Source Code anyway? Is it really time travel? Where is the protagonist in reality? And. of course, the challenge of finding the bomb and the bomber in eight minutes every time. It's great fun that will keep you on the edge of your seat for every minute.What I really loved was the fact that the audience knows no more than the protagonist. In the opening scene he is flying, then he is in a train. How did this happen? Neither the protagonist or the audience know the answer. It really is a fun journey of investigation and action.The acting was completely believable, this real-life setting giving the film great strength in terms of helping the story continue. There are some great unexpected moments on the train, where just as you think you have found the answer, the film knocks you on your head. Great stuff.The film also has some great cinematic moments, featuring a scene where everyone on the train freezes for a few seconds, greatly impacting on the emotion of the scene itself as well as satisfying the audience with what is clearly a fantastic film.I'm sure anyone can enjoy Source Code, providing they get sucked into the story (not hard to do). If you get a chance, do not hesitate to watch this. It will surprise and entertain you.",8,0,1,26 April 2011
Iron Man 2," Entertaining watch, mediocre movie
","The original Iron Man was well-received and paved the way for future instalments. Director Jon Favreau and most of the original cast return to create a film aiming to fix the flaws of the original, attempting to create a genuinely superior sequel and a great Iron Man movie. Whilst I walked out of the movie feeling thoroughly entertained, I was somewhat underwhelmed by the film itself. Despite its attempt to fix the original's flaws, Iron Man 2 is a heavily flawed film. I criticised the first film for its lack of a coherent story to drive the film itself. The sequel aimed to fix this problem by introducing a new multi-layered plot, wiling to tread into darker territory whilst remaining true to the film's fundamentally light tone. This was undoubtedly a great direction to take the sequel, but ironically enough it becomes the films biggest flaw. The problem with the story is that there isn't one. Instead we are given far too many sub-plots without an actual main plot to drive the film. When trying to consider what the main plot is, consider the sub-plots. The story begins with the concept, following on from the ending of the first film that the world knows Tony Stark is Iron Man, and he has subsequently been drowned in fame and glory. On the other hand, the government wants to take the Iron Man armour, which they refer to as a weapon and Tony refers to as a suit, in a court scene which is entertaining but takes its toll. During this time, Tony is aware that the 'arc-reactor' in his chest is killing him, and as a result of this the film is given an excuse to turn our leading character back into an egotistical, arrogant playboy, touching on the theme of alcoholism and taking an unexpectedly darker tone, practically defeating the purpose of the first film. This is also fuelled by Tony's past returning to haunt him, in the shape of his father, and Tony coming to terms with the fact that he never had a loving relationship with his father (this giving the film further excuse to go into unwanted dark territory) as well as the film's central villain, Ivan Vanko, played by Mickey Rourke. Vanko is a Russian physicist with a personal vendetta against Tony, blaming the Stark family and Tony's father for betraying his father and leaving the Vanko family in extreme poverty. On top of this, we are introduced to rival businessman Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell, who is essentially a 'Stark-Wannabe', and is intent on helping the government take Tony's suit. The film simply struggles to make sense of all these sub-plots, and while none of them are bad, it's the fact that there are simply too many sub-plots for the film to handle. As the film progresses, these sub-plots peak at the mid-point and the film crashes under its own weight, unsure what direction it is going in. It was at this point I actually felt bored and quickly began to lose faith in the film, especially when it decided to introduce Nick Fury and Shield, bringing even more characters and storyline to an already overly-complicated plot. It was during this time the film turned into advertisement for the Avengers movie, making several deliberately-placed nods towards Captain America and Thor. Fortunately the film finds its footing, and picks up during the last twenty minutes, presenting us with an entertaining final battle sequence, though it did just feel like an extended improved version of the original movie's finale. Not only does it get lost in too many sub-plots, the film also treads into the same mistaken territory of so many sequels and introduces far too many new characters than necessary. One of the aspects of the first film I loved was the chemistry between Tony and Pepper; however Pepper is given a lot less screen time and very few scenes with Mr. Stark, and Scarlet Johansen's 'Black Widow' character seems, at points, to replace Gwyneth Paltrow on-screen, with a pointless and boring character serving no real purpose in the film other than to look hot and fight. This also gives Mickey Rourke's character, one of the few genuinely interesting characters in the movie, the bare minimal of screen time, spending the majority of the second half of the film sat in a warehouse building robots. If the makers of the film had taken a more mature approach and focused on the genuine points of interest, i.e. fleshing out the central villain Ivan Vanko, and sticking with the concept that the government wants to take Tony's suit, it would have been a much better film than it currently is, however they insisted on taking the overly-ambitious route, desperate to make the film a superior to the first, and as a result it is no way near as special. On a more positive note, all the performances were just as impressive as the first film (save for Scarlett Johansen), though even Robert Downey Jr. was not able to stop Tony Stark being a rather unlikeable character in parts of the film. Personally, I felt the villains of the film to be the most impressive aspect, Mickey Rourke giving a subtle and realistic portrayal as Tony's nemesis and Sam Rockwell stealing the show as an naive, whimsical and utterly irritating (but in a good way) business-rival Justin Hammer.There is nothing 'bad' in this movie so much as the fact it is far too ambitious and becomes drowned in far too many sub-plots and characters. Nonetheless it was an entertaining ride, feeling a lot more like a blockbuster superhero movie, contrasting the gritty tone of the original. It's not as special as the original, and a less-is-more approach would have been a better direction, but as it stands it is an entertaining sequel and well-worth a watch.",7,0,3,9 August 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautiful masterpiece that restores my faith in film
","Guillermo del Toro has created a masterpiece that has not only re-energised my love for film, but made me realise that films are, first and foremost, the telling of a story.Despite its story of a girl discovering a secret world, Pan's Labyrinth is an adult movie, and this fact should not be taken lightly. Whilst there are fantastical elements, the film is set during the Spanish Civil War, and contains some shockingly dark scenes that genuinely frightened and unnerved me for some time, fully unveiling humanity at its darkest. This is not a film to be seen by children, so take the 15 rating seriously.Pan's Labyrinth tells two story's parallel to each other. One tells the story of the young protagonist, Ofelia, living with her violent and authoritative step-father alongside her pregnant mother, the other about Ofelia accepting a number of tasks given by a fawn to prove she is the re-born princess of a hidden fantastical world. Neither world feels more realistic than the other, the scenes set in the 'real' world focusing on the theme of human nature at its darkest, the fantastical world presenting terrifying creatures through incredibly realistic means, the film presenting some of the best makeup and special effects I have ever seen. The costumes and makeup used for the creatures, particularly the chilling 'Pale Child- Eating Man', are truly award-worthy masterpieces of art, combined with Doug Jones' beautifully physical performances as the Faun and The Pale Man.When discussing the film with others, some actually criticised its simplistic story, finding it 'lacking in drive' and, in one case, 'boring'. These are very naive criticisms of the films, both being entirely ignorant of the films deliberately mythical-styled story, the film being a fable as opposed to a story. Once this is accepted, you will experience a beautifully written, perfectly presented, artistically driven masterpiece. What really is astounding is just how flawless the film is. I cannot recall ever watching a film that has caused every emotion in my body to rise, let alone present itself as a work of art.There is not a bad word I can say about this film and it's undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen and one of my personal all-time favourites. If you personally did not enjoy the film, that is fine, but there is nothing here to criticise. The film is genuinely entirely wonderful, remaining a master of artistic direction and emotional qualities. I can now say my love for film has been re-energised, and I will gladly sit through the increasingly high levels of rubbish Hollywood has resorted to, knowing that films like this are possible.",10,5,10,10 August 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Marvel's Surprise Disappointment
","With the previous two critical and box office hits released by Marvel, Thor and X-Men:First Class, and with The Avengers coming up, it would seem Marvel is back on form. Whilst this fact may still stand, Captain America is now a rare exception. 'The First Avenger' is far from being named a bad movie, it just isn't a very good one. Understandably, this is very disappointing. With a unique concept (superhero's in WWII makes a refreshing change to the bland modern day urban setting), and with a strong cast, this had so much potential. So, just what went wrong? The film starts off strong, audiences being introduced to a likable protagonist with a mysterious and threatening villain. Both Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving provide their best performances, but are sadly limited with a script that refuses to give the characters any room to develop. Once pumped with super-soldier serum, Captain America's character turns into a generic two-dimensional hero, and as the film progresses seems to become less and less interesting. The character started off brilliantly- a man desperate to serve his country- and ends with him still not satisfied. Hmm. As for the villain, 'Red Skull', he was scarier before he ripped off his 'face'. A sort of sweet irony. In truth, there are no actual flaws with this film other than it's refusal to go bolder and take greater risks in order to make a better film. This is hardly a failure, (Green Lantern), but it seems stuck in the past with mediocre superhero movies. That said, both fans and casual viewers should enjoy this on the whole, and if the end scene doesn't make you feel emotional, you must be made of stone! Plus a preview of next year's 'Avengers' at the end of the credits is a lovely treat. For now, a rental only.",6,0,4,9 September 2011
Watchmen," Rorschach's Journal: Saw awesome movie today.
","Being a fan of graphic novels I was introduced to 'Watchmen' by a friend and read it almost immediately. Needless to say, it was fantastic. I was aware that this had the potential to be a great movie, but if not done properly it could go very wrong.Fortunately, Zack Snyder knew what he was doing.'Watchmen' has a powerful opening that is only seen in the graphic novels as a series of flashbacks. Followed by a beautiful introductory credits sequence showing off the main focus of the time: The cold war, Watchmen continues this excellent pacing to the end.I am aware that this film has picked up a lot of criticism, but the truth is basing a film of a graphic novel was always going to be extremely challenging, and considering this Snyder does an excellent job. Yes, the film may feel a bit too similar to the book at times, but it balanced this out with clips not seen (or not fully explored) in the graphic novel. To be honest, I think it is unfair to compare this with the graphic novel at all.The film retains a dark tone throughout the film, so don't expect to walk out of this in a good mood. It will get you down. This film is gory, sexual, violent (and I mean violent!) and contains bad language. Stuff Toy Story, your kids will love this! If you are someone who struggles to understand the story (this is natural as the story is fairly complex) then I recommend reading the graphic novel beforehand. Obviously you will need to be in the right mood to watch this.I felt that all the acting was perfect (especially Jackie-Earl-Haley as Rorschach), apart from Malin Akerman as Silver Spectre (she was not even trying to act!).This is an extremely dark movie that you will have to experience for yourself, and while it is not perfect, I highly enjoyed it.",8,3,7,5 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Where to they get those wonderful Tents?
","Being a Potter fan since childhood, I'm not exactly looking forward to seeing it end, but would still not have missed this for the world. At the same time, I do not let my love for the franchise affect by judgement of the film.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' is by far my least favourite book in the series. It's the only one I actually disliked having loved every instalment before (especially Goblet of Fire). The book dragged on for far too long, and the ending was predictable and dry. Fortunately, the film put some punch into the first half of the story, creating a tense and emotional adventure.This film is by far the darkest in the series, which I felt suited the story very well. It begins with the characters in a clearly hopeless situation, and ends with even less chance of success. The beginning was powerful, with a heartbreaking scene of Hermione being forced to erase herself from her parents' life, and a brilliantly chilling scene involving Voldemort and his followers. The cinematography is very advanced, and the series has come a long way since it began. I felt it was a beautifully made film, and if they had gotten every element right, the potential to have been the best in the series.In terms of acting, Daniel Radcliffe has improved greatly (never been a big fan), but his acting still felt wooden and too different to the character of Harry in the book. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson played their characters perfectly, and the chemistry between them is a joy to watch. There was absolutely NO bad acting here. The performance that stood out the most for me was Ralph Fiennes chilling portrayal of Voldemort. He completely out-did himself in this film, creating a villain actually superior to the one written in the book.But, the pacing of the film was fairly poor. The first half-an-hour was perfect, but the film felt very unstable after that. A problem I had with the book (the camping sections) were toned down in the film, but still a problem. Until the ending of the film, the characters really had no idea what they were doing, and most of their successes were from sheer luck. There was a beginning, but the middle and end did not seen to exist. I appreciate this is Part 1, but the lack of completion is a hit to the movie. I was not particularly overwhelmed by the film either, despite the fact that this is the finale.But there was plenty I loved. The scene in the ministry of magic was very funny and entertaining, the few scenes involving Voldemort and the Death Eaters were chilling, the acting was excellent, and the action sequences and CGI were well-done.Deathly Hallows Part Two arrives in Cinemas summer 2011, and I have faith it will improve on the pace and quality of this decent but slow beginning.",7,0,1,6 April 2011
District 9," Science Fiction Matserpiece
","The first genuine science fiction masterpiece I have seen, as many critics have already said, District 9 really is the unsung hero of our time. With Avatar having stolen the sci-fi hot spot, while it is still a brilliant movie, Peter Jackson's District 9 is in every way a superior film.The first half of the film incorporates an extremely realistic documentary-like feel, all about the fact that aliens have taken refuge on earth for many years. The second half is more focused on the main protagonists, Wikus and Christopher Johnson, but retains a realistic feel and has a larger emotional feel. Despite this divide in the style of the film, it all felt natural and the documentary-style was done seriously and added to the suspense of the main plot, creating a unique kind of film I have never seen before. It adds a grittiness to the world of the film, even to the point where I believed the events of the film were very possible.The story itself is outstanding. Peter Jackson intended to show human beings in a truthful light. Upon their arrival on earth, rather than giving the aliens temporary shelter and help them leave the planet, as humans would the government became obsessed with alien technology and intended to harness their superior weaponry for warfare. As for the aliens, or 'prawns' as they are nicknamed, they were given relatively comfortable homes for several years. But the story opens with Wikus (the protagonist) being assigned to evict the prawns from District 9, into a concentration-camp-like area where the prawns would be isolated from humans. Harsh? Oh yes, and the events of the film kick off from here. Iwon't reveal anything as it really is a film you have to experience, but the pacing of the film finally picks up as the main story begins. The story tackles the issues of corruption, trust, betrayal and cruelty as well as the emotional struggle Wikus is forced to deal with. I loved the fact that the second protagonist is a prawn named Christopher, as well as his young son, who have been planning something for a long time. As for the special effects, the film truly is perfect. The prawns are 100 per cent convincing as creatures, as well as the technology and prawn space craft. With some beautiful shots of South Africa, District 9 is in the shadow of Avatar. It deserves to be in the light.",9,1,3,5 May 2011
Unknown," Taking the Unknown Identity.
","Having loved Liam Neeson in Taken I would have been mad to have missed this. Having seen it, it's not hard to notice the film felt like a mixture of The Bourne movies and Taken. Despite this, the film stood firmly on it's own two feet as a solid and enjoyable action movie.Prior to seeing this I was worried Liam Neeson would play the part of the protagonist (Dr. Martin Harris) too similarly to the one he played in Taken, but this was not the case at all. Although he still plays a character who has excellent skills in combat, Martin Harris is a victim who has lost quite literally everything and must fight in order to take it back. Neeson clearly depicts this to the audience, making you sympathise with his desperate situation and personally I wanted to help him find out what happened.The film felt like a journey of steady progression towards finding the truth behind his apparent memory loss, but it is far from an easy journey as whenever Harris comes to some sort of logical answer, he is tripped up either by armed henchman breaking down the door and chasing him through the streets, betrayal, and unexpected turns in the plot. It is understandable if some viewers would become frustrated by this, but I found it increased the tension building towards the end of the film.The ending itself was not too surprising, but rather a logical answer that made sense. I am glad, however, the writers chose this approach over a far more confusing and possibly over-the-top ending. I felt satisfied with what I had seen and believed the approach to be necessary, even if it was not over-whelming.With some great shots of Berlin, tense and fun action scenes it is a solid experience, even if this concept has been used before. I don't know much about the making of the film, but it is likely they used 'The Bourne Identity' as a starting point. But don't let this put you off this brilliant entertainer!",7,1,4,5 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," It's not Inception, but it's pretty good.
","I've always been a fan of high-concept films, Inception being my favourite of the lot. I love the originality and brilliant new ideas the script writers put forward. The Adjustment Bureau puts forward a brilliant idea that raises questions, but the film's story does not quite live up to the potential of the brilliant ideas put forward.The basic bulk of the story is a simple but satisfying love story. The real fun begins when a group of mysterious suit-wearing gentlemen show up interfere in the life of the protagonist. Their arrival raises questions as to how much choice we really have as human beings, if history is written, and even goes so far as to suggest the existence of god. In the end, who or what the (adjustment bureau) are is a matter of the audience's opinion and interpretation. My only real gripe with this movie is just as it starts to get deeper into the concept itself, we are still left wondering, with only a few questions answered.As for the acting, I thought Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both played their roles perfectly on screen and the chemistry between them was great. In fact, I personally couldn't find any bad acting here.It's well worth a watch, and 7/10 does feel a little harsh. I just really wish I could have discovered more about this mysterious organisation....",7,1,2,21 March 2011
Thor," 'I'll take one of those large enough to ride'
","Well, you don't need me to tell you Marvel movies have been on pretty good form lately. The Iron Man Movies were successful, and the new X-Men looks promising.As for Thor? Hammer Throwing goodness! Now, this movie is just pure entertainment. From an ancient battle on earth, to the towering city of Asguard, Thor has some very impressive background settings.The film is strongly inspired by a mixture of Roman and Viking civilisations, creating Asguard and Thor's species the Asguardian's. It is an interesting mix of alien and historic cultures, and compare's our culture to one of strict rules and responsibilities.The storyline is simple, but will keep you entertained. It is understandable if fans will see the ending as a bit of an anti-climax,but the main bulk of the film is a good mix of comedy and action, although it does have a few flaws when it comes to a slightly cheesy and unrealistic romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character Jane. Speaking of which, I felt Natalie Portman had a slight absence of dialogue and her character seemed more like a background character rather than a secondary protagonist.Chris Hemsworth and Antony Hopkins both had outstanding performances (Hopkins goes without saying) and if the story fails, the relationship between Thor and Odin will surely keep you watching.With some nice references linking the film within the same world of Iron Man, and an ending that begins to set up Thor's relationship with Shield, I look forward to his return in the Avengers.Fan of Marvel or not, this is good old fashioned summer blockbusting.",8,4,8,19 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A satisfying conclusion to a classic trilogy
","What is fundamentally the most impressive thing about The Dark Knight Rises is that director Christopher Nolan approached the project with the intention of creating a satisfying conclusion to the story built up in the previous two films, and that is exactly what this film is. The film fulfils its very goal, and is an incredibly satisfying ending to the story. If you are unwilling to accept this before seeing the film, you probably won't enjoy the film as much as I did.Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight Gotham is enjoying a period of peace built on the lie which is 'The Harvey Dent Act', a lie which has eaten away at Bruce and Gordon for the last eight years. Gordon has been left to clean up Gotham without Batman's help, and Bruce has become a physically and mentally traumatised hermit living within the rebuilt Wayne Manor, confined to using a cane as a result of doing nothing for all that time. What is an instantly recognisable change from the film's predecessors is the speed in pacing, the film beginning with a brief speech by Gordon, moving on to an impressively visual and ambitious prologue sequence, then swiftly moving to a celebration at Wayne Manor in which the film introduces a number of new characters. Despite this fast-pacing and new-cast onslaught, the story felt like it was moving far too slowly, and I wondered when something was actually going to happen. Fortunately, both of these flaws can be explained, my instantly negative reaction to the fast-pacing being a negative in human nature as opposes to the film- this unforeseen change actually serves the movie well, allowing Christopher Nolan to make three hours fly-by. The slow-start soon picks up, and I understand it was a good, realistic decision to hold off on putting Bruce back into the bat-suit too early in the film, as the film's premise is questioning whether Batman should return, and what consequences this action will have. The onslaught of new characters does feel like they have been forced down the audience's throat, and non are given any real affective role to play, however the final resolve reveals all characters are fundamental to the plot. In other words, patience whilst watching this movie will pay off.My personal enjoyment of the film was not derived by the film itself so much as certain aspects of the film, namely Tom Hardy's outstanding portrayal as the villain Bane and the character in general. I had high hopes for Bane, being a fan of Hardy's work prior to watching the film, but being confident the character would not be as successful as Heath Ledger's untouchable performance as The Joker. Having watched the film I found Bane to be far more intriguing than I previously predicted as well as being just as quotable and thrilling to watch as The Joker, though Bane is a completely different kind of villain, the focus being on physical intimidation, sheer intelligence and his level of control over people. Though Hardy's performance is not at the same level as Ledger's and his performance is restricted by a mask covering half of his face, but his performance is anything but restrictive, an emphasis on physicality, conveying intimidation through body movements and emotion through his eyes, as well as a wonderfully memorable and unnerving voice, which has unfortunately been over-edited in post production. As well as the performance, Bane's origin story, or at least what little we learn from the film, is very intriguing; however I would have liked more emphasis on the character's origin , as Bane is, like all Batman's villains, a version of Batman himself. Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle can also not be commended enough, giving the best Selina Kyle/ Catwoman to date, her performance perfectly fitting in with Nolan's realistic vision of the character, her feisty yet sexy performance stealing each scene with elegance as Hardy steals it with intimidation.Previous speculation and hype have given great expectation to the film being a revelatory masterpiece in terms of storyline. I always felt this sounded like a risky approach, and whilst there are moments of plot revelation, the film is never pretentious of itself, Nolan keeping true to his word of creating a story-based final instalment. Like the previous two, The Dark Knight Rises is an art-house movie posing as a summer blockbuster, the real focus being on the script and story, the action aiding the storyline- the exact opposite of a Michael Bay film. The film never insults the intelligence of the audience and, like Inception, expects the audience to keep up. In other words, Nolan has so much respect for his audience that he created this film with the idea that the audience is as his intelligent as himself. It is a wonderful story-based film, not overly-pretentious of itself whilst keeping viewers on edge the entire 2 hours and 45 minute run-time. Personally, I found this flew by, and would have gladly sat through at least another hour.It has its flaws, and though I hate to say it, is not above criticism, but when truly appreciated for what it is, The Dark Knight Rises is a great film, and a poetic but satisfying conclusion to a classic trilogy, an emphasis on story as opposed to a revelatory-filled epic. Nolan has created not only the best 'Batman' movies ever made, but a classic trilogy that should be viewed first and foremost as art-house movies, secondly as Batman movies. The final chapter will leave you emotionally drained, but satisfied by the conclusion, as opposed to feeling exhausted by an overly-pretentious epic finale.",9,4,9,9 August 2012
Iron Man," Adrenaline-fuelled fun and a pleasant surprise
","Typically Iron Man is not the type of superhero movie I would enjoy, the only 'light' superhero movies I have genuinely enjoyed in the past being the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. With Christopher Nolan's dark realistic Batman movies paving the way of example to other films in the superhero genre, director Jon Favreau embraces a realistic tone whilst keeping the movie far lighter and more humorous in tone than Batman. And like most, I was pleasantly surprised with Iron Man, and despite its notable flaws, the film has made its way to being one of my favourite superhero films of all time. The film is, first and foremost, a long title sequence telling the origin story of Iron Man, the film's key fundamental theme being about realisation and – for past sins. In this case, the sins of billionaire playboy Tony Stark, played by the perfectly-cast Robert Downey Jr. Tony Stark is an arrogant, but made very likable due to Robert Downey Jr.'s fine performance, who is kidnapped by terrorists using the weapons he created, and imprisoned in a cave where he is forced to build a deadly weapon- The Jericho Missile- to help the terrorists in their plot. During this time, Stark is given a wake-up call in which he realises he must take responsibility for the power these terrorists hold, having previously been blindingly ignorant to what is being sold on the black market. There is a bittersweet irony in, not only the realisation that the terrorists gained power through his creations, but the fact that Tony's heart was injured by one of his own weapons- an injury which requires him to wear a power cell-like 'arc reactor' to keep him alive for the rest of his life. This makes not only for an interesting story, but a great motivation for Tony Stark to fight this evil, and a motivation the audience can feel equally enthusiastic about. As the films progresses and Tony returns to his home in America, the story continues the same concept by revealing more about how Stark's company has supplied these terrorists with weapons, but refuses to go in any other direction. For a summer blockbuster the storyline is lacking in fuel to keep itself going, the current story- that feels more like a concept, designed as an excuse to put Tony in the Iron Man suit and place a few action scenes in the film- wears down quickly, leading to a messy Transformers-like climax which feels out of tone with the rest of the film. The action scenes themselves were impressive, with incredibly realistic CGI on the Iron Man suit, beautiful cinematography and were genuinely adrenaline-fuelled fun, with exception to the clunky finale. However, the scenes were rationed throughout the films, appearing as a quick 'rush' in the film's pacing, before reverting back to a regular movie. Appreciating Jon Favreau's comfort zone and experience lies in the field of comedy, it was a good safe decision to ration the action scenes like he did, but the fact that they were so fun to watch and well-shot left me wanting more.The strength of the film really lies in Tony's physical and metaphorical transformation into Iron Man and the chemistry between the three central characters- Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villainous Obadiah Stane. All three give top-class performances, and prevent the movie's pacing from falling flat. Composer Ramin Djawadi's score for the film is also highly commended, giving a suitable mixture of modern and orchestral, reflecting the film's swapping between Tony Stark and Iron Man/ smaller scenes and action scenes. Ultimately it feels very special, adds a good dose of humour and enjoys itself whist taking the core themes seriously, features great acting, but really could have done with a better ending than two people in suits engaging in a fist-fight.",8,2,3,8 August 2012
Casino Royale," Bond returns, so does quality
","A fresh start in the 'Bond' series, Casino Royale takes Bond back to his roots in a story based on Ian Fleming's original novel. Having never been a fan of the previous Bond movies, which are famed for their focus on gadgets and an incredibly suave, almost fantastical portrayal of Bond, I was impressed to hear Casino Royale would return to Ian Fleming's original vision of a tough, cold, brutal and more realistic Bond.Not only is the film a success, but it has converted me to being a fan of the series. What makes Casino Royale so successful is its loyalty to Fleming's original vision and Daniel Craig's outstanding performance as Bond. Whilst all the previous actors to play the part have all been great in their own ways, Daniel Craig portrays the real James Bond, realistically playing a cold and brutal character whilst keeping the audience invested and interest in the character on an emotional level. Not only is he great in the role in smaller, more acting-oriented scenes, but he is incredibly entertaining to watch during the ambitious action sequences the film boasts, and it is easy to tell Mr. Craig is more than comfortable in the shoes of 007.At its core, Casino Royale is Bond at the very start of his career, and as the film progresses Bond goes through several learning-curves. The film makes an impact in the sense that you feel the pain Bond goes through, every fight feels brutal and painful, the action feels genuinely real and you are always aware of the incredible threat surrounding Bond. There are scenes dedicated to the aftermath of Bond's fights, and you really sense this is a human character going through very human emotions, and allows you to gain more of a sense of who Bond is. Personally, the film gave me the impression that the character is punishing himself, despite his straight-faced talks that killing does not bother him. That is another thing I found made the film so successful- all the mystery of the character remains, yet we understand more about him than ever before.Speaking about the film itself, the entire piece boasts incredible landscapes that have always been unique to the Bond films, utilising the various settings to be incorporated into stunning wide-shots, camera angles and action sequences, all to their full capacity. Two prime examples include a section in which Bond is chasing a bomb-maker through Madagascar, the climax of the chase taking them to a top of a tall crane overlooking the island, another being an action sequence taking place in Venice within a sinking building. It is undoubtedly a very ambitious film, trying to remain true to the classic exciting action-sequences of the classic films whilst not crossing the line of 'over-the-top'. Fortunately, the film balances it perfectly, making all the action sequences thrilling but believable. Performance wise the film was top standard, particular credit going to Mads Mikkelsen who portrays the films chilling and iconic-looking villain, Le Chiffre. Judi Dench reprises her role as M (ignore her previous portrayals, this is a new story) distorting the time-line, but the film would feel incomplete without her strict presence. Eva Green portrays Vesper Lynd, the 'Bond-Girl' of the story, with a key difference- she is the woman Bond falls in love with, and is ultimately the reason for his coldness towards others.For the most part, the film flows brilliantly, which is an achievement in itself considering this is a film centred on a card game. Even if you are unfamiliar with the rules of 'Texas Hold 'Em', the film makes short work of making it engaging, overcoming the challenge of making a card game feel exciting to the audience. As I said, the film is entertaining for the most part, however I felt it dropped dramatically during the film's third act and actually felt slightly bored as the film started to trudge its way towards the end. Though I am aware this part of the story is necessary in the continuity, paving the way for Bond's future behaviour, but it just felt out of place in a Bond film. With no real flaws, Casino Royale succeeds in achieving its goal: Bringing Bond back to his routes whilst making a great film. Daniel Craig portrays the way Bond was always intended to be seen, whilst staring in an incredibly engaging film. Credit must be given to the film's focus on Bond's pain and the ambitious action sequences, however be prepared for a rather average final act. Not to worry though- the classic 'Bond Theme' is played in the credits!",8,3,5,16 August 2012
