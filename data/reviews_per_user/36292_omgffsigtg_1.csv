Deja Vu," Another one of Jerry Bruckheimers unpredictable, brilliant films.
","Deja Vu had me on the end of my seat throughout the entire duration of the movie. I get right into CSI, Cold Case and all those crime scene dramas which is why i enjoyed this film so much. If you like this genre, this is the film for you.One of the most attention wrenching factors that this movie possesses is unpredictability. Denzel Washington does a great job playing his part, however the woman he is trying to save, Claire, seems a little experienced with the general shock a normal person would have.The general prospect of traveling back in time seems a little far-fetched, however Jerry Bruckheimer does a great job disguising the 'fantasy factor,' and makes it seem very real. The excitement you feel overshadows this, therefore you tend to forget about it and concentrate on what's going to happen next.There are several twists within the movie that are not foreseen. At the end, something happens with such a magnitude you think the movie will finish, however once again it ends with a brilliant unpredictable twist that leaves you feeling almost disorientated with excitement. 10/10.",10,0,1,28 January 2007
