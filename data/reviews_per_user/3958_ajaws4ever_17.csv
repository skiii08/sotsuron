Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible III. Five words: The Best Of The Three!
","Usually the third movie of a series/trilogy is horrible. Examples: Halloween III: Season of the Witch, Friday the 13th: Part III, A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. And so on and so forth. But Mission: Impossible III is the best of the series! Examples of good third movies of any series/trilogies: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. And so on and so forth.This movie stars one of the best male actors in the world: Tom Cruise (War of the Worlds (2005), Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, The Last Samurai, Eyes Wide Shut, Interview with the Vampire). It also stars Philip Seymour Hoffman (Oscar winner for Best Actor in a Leading Role: Capote (2005)). Philip starred in these movies (Capote, Twister, Cold Mountain, Red Dragon, Along Came Polly, When A Man Loves A Woman).Mission: Impossible III also stars other well-known actors such as: Ving Rhames (Idlewild, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Mission: Impossible, Mission: Impossible II), Michelle Monaghan (Constantine (scenes deleted), North Country, The Bourne Supremacy), and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead (2005)).How can they keep thinking of ideas for Mission: Impossible movies? They're still so good! The movies are still so good! And the action just keeps getting better and better and more intense! Speaking of the intense action, it really makes your heart thump really fast. The action is almost non-stop. And there are no cheap love scenes that make the movie boring and uninteresting. That's one of the beauties of Mission: Impossible III.See Mission: Impossible III. You won't be disappointed!

Coraline," Simply amazing!!
","I have read the book multiple times and I have to say I haven't gotten tired of it. It has a magnificent and totally original storyline.And so does the movie. But, I have to say, that I'm 14, and even though it was rated PG, I STILL was creeped out a little bit. The friends that I saw it with were creeped out too. I would say 12 and up... not for children.But back to the review. I LOVED IT!! I didn't want it to be over!!!! Almost nothing was changed from the book, except for some events that happened and different times (like when Coraline receives the stone with the hole in it), AND for the Wybie character, which wasn't even in the book at all, and I thought there was really no point to it. And why the crazy old man was blue I'll never know....The animation was almost perfect!!! For a stop-action or stop-motion (whatever it's called) film, the flow of it was seamless. I loved the movie. Everything about it. If it got off track from the book, it somehow found a way to get right back on track. This movie was a visual masterpiece. I still can't believe someone actually made this into a movie, seeing as the book wasn't so popular, so a huge thanks for the people that made one of my favorite books to one of my favorite movies =].I think this movie definitely deserves on Oscar!!!! 10/10.",10,1,4,21 February 2009
The Hunger Games," The most faithful book-to-screen I have ever seen!!
","Just came back from a midnight premiere, and I must say I was rather impressed. Normally, when my expectations are very high (as they were with this one), I tend to get disappointed. This film struck me with that rare instance of satisfaction. This knocks the first Harry Potter out of the water, and needless to say it tops Twilight by a million miles. I was actually a fan of the hand-held shots, even though most hated them. I thought they added a sense of realism. I will admit though, that the hand-held shots during the action sequences blurred out some stuff and made it hard to see what was going on, but I'm sure that was necessary to hold the PG-13 rating.Speaking of which, the film was actually quite violent for its rating. Yet, at the same time, it still could've been more violent. Not necessarily more gory, but I would've liked it to feel more gritty and raw. It didn't quite capture the intensity and peril from the book.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both did FANTASTIC with their roles. Excellent acting from each. Donald Sutherland (Snow) was a wonder to watch as well. Elizabeth Banks (Effie) and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), also did a wonderful job, bring some comic relief at times. Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) and Wes Bentley (Seneca) were also well acted. The rest however... let's just say their performances were average, and I wish some tributes had more screen time, damn it!My main complaint, though, is the sheer lack of character development. The reason why this film will probably only get an average rating of 6 out of 10, is because the people who haven't read the book will NOT connect with Gale, or Rue, or Katniss and Peeta's relationship. They won't have any idea what is going on, and they won't feel any sympathy for certain characters' deaths.But, all in all, this film and the next two (or three) are in good hands. Apart from a few minor things I would have liked to see get incorporated into the film, this is as close to perfect as a book adaptation gets.9/10",10,2,18,23 March 2012
Shaun of the Dead," You won't see a better horror/comedy ever again.
","Shaun of the Dead. Wow. That name really rings a bell. Surprisingly, I didn't get the name until like two days ago, and I finally realized that it meant, 'Dawn of the Dead'.In spite of my stupidity, this movie is so funny! British humor is the best kind of humor there is. This movie stars some unknown actors: Simon Pegg (Mission: Impossible III, The Reckoning), Nick Frost (Kinky Boots, Penelope), and Kate Ashfield (Crime and Punishment, The War Zone).Not only does this movie bring nonstop deep-belly-laughs, it's also deliciously gory, as every zombie movie is. But it's really not that gory, there's just a scene where a zombie falls on a pole, and a huge fountain of blood spurts out of her body. And there's a couple more, but I can't think of them at the top of my head right now, sorry.What's better than zombie's invading a town and then leaves two sloppy and lazy friends, Shaun (Pegg) and Ed (Frost) to kill them all? What's more of an unbeatable combination between horror and comedy? What's better than totally unknown actors bringing hilarity to people? Nothing! There is nothing better than a zomrom com (the nickname for a zombie-comedy).See this movie! It is so worth your money!

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The second best movie ever made! The best movie ever made was its sequel, Dead Man's Chest!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, includes a definite top-notch, all-star, brilliant, and outstanding cast that includes Johnny Depp (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Secret Window), Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings trilogy), and Keira Knightley (The Jacket, Domino), and Geoffery Rush (Finding Nemo, Munich), one of the best casts I have seen, well, ever.The acting was pitch-perfect in this film. In fact, the acting was so good, it couldn't get any better! The special effects were spectacular. The make-up was awesome. The editing, the music, the story, everything was just fantastic! Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer definitely did a good job on producing this film! Not only was this movie totally filled with action, but there was a lot of humor in it, too. Johnny Depp did a great job with the acting and the funny humor and the hilarious disgusted or happy facial features. You'll have to see the film to get what I mean with the whole facial feature thing.Anyway, I recommend not letting any child under the age of 8 to see this film. There are a lot of scary images of rotting flesh and undead corpses.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl definitely deserves a 10 out of 10 starts. Even better.Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Action/Adventure ViolenceMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Intense Sequences of Action/Adventure ViolenceMy Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence",10,0,3,30 August 2006
Constantine," Pretty good movie. Keanu Reeves rocks!
","Constantine is a pretty good horror/thriller flick with Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, whom won a best actress award from The Mummy, 1999. What a pair! The whole movie is about a man named John Constantine (Reeves), who has literally been to hell and back. Because of the life he has chosen, he will never enter the gates of Heaven. The only way he will get into the Gates of St. Peter, is self-sacrifice. Instead he tries to bring so-called 'half-breed' demons that came into earth, back into hell.Shia LaBeouf, Djimon Hounsou, and Tilda Swinton also star in this movie. Shia was the only one who brought comedy to the movie, but also the worst acting. Djimon Hounsou was great, and so was Tilda.The special effects were awesome! And so was the editing. I guess this is a good movie to buy on DVD, and is passable to watch a few times, but then it gets boring. It's still a pretty fun movie.But this movie has the most mild R rating. It would've went well with a strong PG-13 rating. The demonic images weren't really all that demonic or scary, and the violence was as bad as Mission Impossible violence. In my opinion, it should be rated PG-13 for violence, disturbing images, and thematic material. That's it.Constantine is a definite 6 out of 10. Pretty good. A border-line must-see.Violence/Gore: 8/10, Sex/Nudity: 2/10, Profanity: 6/10 (a lot of F and S-words), Drugs/Alcohol: 5/10Original MPAA rating: R: Violence and Demonic ImagesMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Violence, Disturbing Images, and Thematic MaterialMy Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Coarse Language",6,0,4,28 August 2006
The Prestige," The best movie of the year! (minor spoilers)
","The Prestige is awesome! You have not seen a better movie in years! Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are going to win some awards, let me tell you. And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is! Robert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE! Oh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, 'BOOM' of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.Sorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment. I don't get any people who agree with my comments. I would greatly appreciate it.My MPAA rating: PG-13: Thematic Material, Some Very Startling Scenes of Violence, and Disturbing Images My Canadian rating: 14A: Frightening Scenes, Mature Theme, Violence",10,15,26,30 October 2006
The Number 23," WOW! OMG! This is an awesome movie!
","I just saw a sneak peek of this movie at the mall yesterday and I couldn't believe it. I thought this would be an awesome movie since the first time I saw the trailer, but I was wrong. The Number 23 was not an awesome movie...IT WAS UTTERLY FANTASTIC! And it was scary, too. The plot line is very well thought out and unsettling, and the characters are very complex in their own ways.The Number 23 is about an animal control officer named Walter Sparrow, that receives a birthday gift from his wife, Agatha Sparrow. The birthday gift is a book that's called, 'The Number 23'. But the first word he reads from the book changes his once placid existence into a whirlpool of psychological torture and mayhem that could possibly lead him to his own death and the deaths of his loved ones. 'The Number 23' book Walter receives is a chilling murder mystery that seems to mirror Walter's life in dark and uncontrollable ways. The life of the book's main character, a brooding detective named Fingerling (also played by Jim Carrey), is filled with moments that copy Walter's own history. And as the world of the book starts to come alive, Walter becomes infected by the most frightening part of it: Fingerling's dark obsession with the number 23. This obsession permeates the book, and soon the book begins to control Walter in dark ways. He soon starts to see the number everywhere in his own life and becomes haunted by the fact that he is damned to commit the same horrific crime as Fingerling--murder. Now Walter is on a dangerous quest to understand the mysteries of the book. If he can unlock the dark power of the number 23, he may just be able to change his future.Anyway, this movie is awesome. The use of colors: reds, browns, and blacks really set the hazy and unsettling tone of the movie. Also, the Fingerling sequences were really hazy and dark and they make you seem as though you're floating in the depths of hell.Joel Schumacher, the director, finally did something original, and this is a movie that is way better than his badly directed, 'Batman and Robin'. He finally made an improvement. And this is his 23rd project...just wanted to say.Virginia Madsen (Agatha Sparrow, Fabrizia) got better than her parts in Firewall and Candyman. Her acting in Firewall was better than in Candyman, and her acting in The Number 23 was better than both movies.Everyone else was quite good, too.Oh, and, the opening credits were unbelievably unforgettable! The music is so unsettling and creative. The opening credits for 'The Number 23' is the brother of the opening credits of 'Se7en'. Absolutely awesome!All in all, a really creepy and unsettling (and funny, for the first half of the movie) that gives you the chills after you walk out of the theater.Official MPAA rating: R: Violence, Disturbing Images, Sexuality, and Language My MPAA rating: R: Violence, Disturbing Images, Sexuality, and Some Strong Language My Canadian rating: 14A: Violence, Mature Theme, Sexually Suggestive Scenes",10,347,694,30 January 2007
Ghost Rider," A thrilling thrill ride that's...thrilling.
","I saw this movie at a special sneak peek at our movie theater yesterday and I could not believe it! 'Ghost Rider' is the best action/thriller movie of the year so far.Nicholas Cage's performance is absolutely incredible. His performance (and the movie) is stunning. The special effects are awesome. And the motorcycle scenes (especially when it's riding on the skyscraper, as seen in a trailer for 'Ghost Rider') would be great in IMAX. I can't believe they aren't releasing it in IMAX. It would look so cool! I think this movie will be a great hit when it comes out in theaters. I'm hoping the box office for 'Ghost Rider' will be at least $150,000,000.Like I said, the special effects are awesome. The way the creators made Ghost Rider is so cool. I love the design for the Ghost Rider character.And the climatic fight between Ghost Rider and Blackheart is absolutely stunning. The sequence kept my heart racing and my pulse throbbing. 99 out of 100 people will not be disappointed with that sequence between the two characters.The movie is a furiously quick movie that seems to go by in a half-hour, although the movie is 114 minutes (1 hour and 54 minutes).When I walked into the special sneak peek at our theater, honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I was just expecting a clichéd comic book thriller that would be a cheap, cheesy, B movie that would last in theaters for at least two months, but I was wrong. This is not a clichéd comic book thriller, and it's not a cheap, cheesy, B movie. It will last at least four months in the theaters...I hope so, anyway.All in all, an awesome movie with cool special effects and awesome performances.This is a must-see!

The Illusionist," Edward Norton IS the Illusionist
","Wow! This movie is spectacularly amazing! Edward Norton's performance was so mesmerizing that I literally got hypnotized. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. When my mom and I saw it in the theaters, we both applauded at the end, as everyone else did. Some people even whistled loudly. Some people even sat through the entire credit reel.Edward Norton practically IS the Illusionst. He plays the role so well. I am astounded at everybody's performances. I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD.I never saw the ending coming. It was so shocking. My mom sort of knew, though.Here are the stars: Edward Norton (Red Dragon, Kingdom of Heaven), Paul Giamatti (Lady in the Water, Sideways), Jessica Beil (Stealth, Cellular), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan and Isdole, A Knight's Tale).Philip Glass's music is hypnotic. I love the way he uses violins and violas and cellos and basses in his music, it's so beautiful. He also made the music for Secret Window, The Hours, and Candyman.The Illusionist is everyone above the age of 10 should see this movie. I say 10 because there is some sex and violence in the movie, and the violence is somewhat mildly disturbing.Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Sexuality and ViolenceMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Sexuality, and Violence Including Thematic Elements.My Canadian Rating: PG: Violence, Sexually Suggestive Scene",9,3,4,8 October 2006
Paranormal Activity," Scary as hell.
","I walked into this movie knowing that it was going to be scary, because I had read all the reviews. But I never get scared of horror movies. Or any movie. NEVER. So I just walked in thinking this movie wouldn't affect me at all.I was dead wrong.I went to see it with a couple of my friends, and after the first half of the movie, we were holding on to each other practically crying. Don't get me wrong, we all loved the movie, but I texted one of them when I got home and she said that she could not fall asleep. I didn't either. I couldn't. I was so terrified.This movie sticks with you for hours, possibly even days, after you see it. It leaves an imprint on your psyche that's very hard to get rid of. It's possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen, even scarier than Texas Chainsaw Massacre or High Tension.I'm probably one of the few people that loved the ending, probably because it scared the hell out of me. But it's just so disturbing. How they shot this movie for $15,000 I'll never know, because the effects are so convincing and are just absolutely brilliant.I'm seeing this movie again this weekend with more people that are dying to see it, so hopefully I won't get scared again... which I probably will.See this movie. It will blow your mind, and shatter your senses, and fry your nerves. Guaranteed.10/10",10,3,8,28 October 2009
Mission: Impossible II," The worst of the series, but still okay. The twist at the end will totally shock you.
","Mission: Impossible II is the worst of the series, but it's still actually pretty good. 6/10. The only reason this movie isn't a 5/10 is because it has AWESOME action and a HUMUNGOUS twist at the end.The twist is so surprising! My mouth was open throughout the rest of the movie! That's about 20 minutes! It was also quite startling and disturbing, so don't let any young children see this movie! Not only is this the worst of the series (but still pretty good), but it is also the most violent. There is a lot of intense chase scenes and sequences of punching and fighting and stabbing and rolling around and gunshots. Like I said, I would not recommend letting any children under the age of 11 see this movie.And, there is an EXTREMELY hot chick that you can't take your eyes off of. Not only is she pretty, but she's a trained professional thief. There is also a cheap love scene between her and Tom Cruise in the movie, but it doesn't affect the interest of the movie all THAT bad.Also, she injects herself with something I can't tell you about...you have to see the movie...and it's very sad. But I think she lives at the end...I haven't seen Mission: Impossible II in a while.See the movie, but don't expect to be happy. The beginning is somewhat slow but the middle just keeps dragging and dragging and dragging on and on and on. But when it comes near the ending it gets better and better, so I give this movie a 6/10.My MPAA rating: PG-13: Intense Sequences of Violent Action, Language, and Some Sensuality.My Canadian rating: 14A: Violent Scenes, Coarse Language, Frightening Scenes",7,1,2,8 November 2006
Mission: Impossible," The second best of the series!!
","Mission: Impossible is a really great action movie that won an award for best action sequence for the helicopter chase (see the movie to find out what that is).It stars Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible II, Mission: Impossible III, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, The Last Samurai, Interview with the Vampire), John Voight (National Treasure, Glory Road, Holes, Zoolander, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor), Henry Czerny (The Pink Panther (2006), The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Clear and Present Danger), Jean Reno (Flushed Away, The Da Vinci Code, Godzilla (1998)), and Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible II, Mission: Impossible III, Idlewild, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Entrapment).The action was amazing! It's so intense! And the music, wow! It has an extremely catchy, jumpy, and awesome theme song! Danny Elfman rocks! See Mission: Impossible! You won't be disappointed!

Saw," The best horror movie of the decade--no wait, the best horror movie EVER!
","Saw. What an amazing film. Not only is it grisly, but it's also very psychological and very disturbing. You should think twice before you do something bad to yourself...Jigsaw might be waiting.Saw stars Leigh Whannell (writer for Saw II and Saw III), Cary Elwes (Twister, Liar Liar, Ella Enchanted), Danny Glover (Angels in the Outfield, Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2, Lethal Weapon 3, Predator 2), Ken Leung (X-Men: The Last Stand, Vanilla Sky, Red Dragon), Shawnee Smith (Saw II, Saw III, Carnival of Souls), and Tobin Bell (Saw II, Saw III, Black Mask 2: City of Masks).Oh, my God! This movie is so scary! It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be before I watched it, but it was still so frightening! I almost peed in my pants when this film was finished! Like 'Se7en', there is a bloodcurdling twist at the end which forces you to let your mouth hang open for the rest of the week. You can't move. You can't think. You can't even breathe. But, since my friend ruined it for me and told me the ending, I wasn't as shocked as I would have been....Cary Elwes was good and bad at the acting. Like when he cried to get his wife and child back from Jigsaw, he was so horrible at acting! That was a huge disappointment, because Cary is an excellent actor. But, otherwise, he was very good, along with everyone else.I can't tell you the plot without giving too much away, but I can tell you that it is very well thought out and very tense. Like, you know something is about to happen...but you just don't know when.This movie is very grisly and graphic and is exceptionally disturbing. Saw is definitely not for children under 15. Fifteen years of age and up can absolutely see this movie without an adult. But fourteen and under absolutely need to be accompanied by an adult if they want to see this movie.*****MINOR SPOILERS***** Saw also has very nasty sound effects and frightening images. For example, we see a brief glimpse of bloody intestines. We see a man trigger a tripwire, which activates four guns hanging on the ceiling to shoot a man in head, making several splatters on the wall and a bloody torso. We don't however see the man's head when he gets shot. We only see his head after he gets shot in photographs.*****MINOR SPOILERS END*****Overall, this film is the best horror movie ever made (so far). Followed by Saw II and Saw III, and Saw IV hopefully coming out in 2007. See Saw!

The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code....WOW!
","I haven't read the the book yet, so I can't compare it to the book yet. But, I can say that this is a good movie that will be more effective with surround sound and in complete darkness.Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, The Green Mile, The Terminal) and Audrey Tautou (Nowhere to Go But Up) are absolutely perfect. They really make the movie seem real. Also Ian MacKellen (X-Men trilogy) and Paul Bettany (Firewall, A Beautiful Mind, A Knight's Tale) are also brilliant. Bettany's performance is absolutely mesmerizing and hypnotic.The beginning was kind of disturbing, when Silas (Bettany) was doing some ritual (I forgot what it was called)...it was pretty graphic. Also, the discovery of the secrets of Da Vinci's paintings were pretty amazing. Are they just coincidences? Or are they real...? The middle was also thrilling and amazing, which was the part where the secrets of the paintings were revealed. But after the middle part, the movie just got kind of boring and somewhat confusing, which is why I gave this an 8, and not a 10.All in all, a great movie that is very thrilling and hypnotic...all up to it's thrilling surprise ending...you won't be able to take the eyes off of the screen!Violence/Gore: 7/10, Sex/Nudity: 4/10, Profanity: 5/10, Drugs/Alcohol: 3/10 My MPAA rating: Disturbing Images, Violence, Some Nudity, Mature Themes, Language, Brief Drug References, and Sexual Content My Canadian rating: Violence, Mature Themes, Disturbing Content",8,1,3,4 January 2007

But the third one had nothing to do with Michael Myers, and nothing to do with the Halloween plot. It was SO stupid! But this film wasn't. No, no. This film is the best horror flick ever made.

Casino Royale," The best Bond movie EVER!!!!

This is the best Bond movie that has ever been...and ever will be.This movie stars Daniel Craig (Munich, Archangel), Eva Green (Kingdom of Heaven), Mads Mikkelsen (Pusher, Pusher II), Judi Dench (Chronicles of Riddick, Chocolat), and Jeffrey Wright (Syriana, Lady in the Water).Whenever I hear or think of James Bond, or 007, I think of Casino Royale (2006). This movie is amazing! It really brings a message that evil never overpowers good.The action is amazing! The stunts are awesome and breathtaking! And the lovely sex scenes are sexy, too! The dialogue is just entertaining and fun to listen to! The movie can really drag on when there are no action scenes involved, but it's still really entertaining to listen.Daniel Craig gives an Oscar-Caliber performance! He is absolutely amazing! The acting, the action, and the stunts! All tyte! He really helps make the movie become a whip-lashing roller coaster ride! And it is. Casino Royale (2006) really is a roller coaster ride.The special effects are totally awesome. They look so realistic--since most of them were computerized. But the explosions and the construction site scene and the crane fight scene were absolutely fantastic! The torture scene was somewhat stomach-churning, but that's what makes Bond, Bond! MINOR SPOILER BELOW! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO! BUT YOU MAY READ AFTER IT SAYS, 'MINOR SPOILER ENDS' The torture scene is very stomach-churning.
