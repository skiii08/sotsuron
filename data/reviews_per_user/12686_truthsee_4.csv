Blade Runner 2049," Mish mash
","The music wasn't placed like the original, yet Denis the director promised he spent a long time getting the music right. Where was it... I saw small bits of the music here and there.I got too well antiquated with boring stuff like his boring apartment... yes inside I was screaming lets move on. So many sequences which just seemed overly blank. The close up feel of the first Bladerunner was replaced with pull back long shots throughout the 2049 sequel. So add to that the lack of music and at times the blank pregnant pauses and over length of this movie had me wanting to scream 'come on' at the screen.There were some really odd continuity errors like Edward Olmos looking younger in his appearance than he did in the original - which made no sense. The Rachel scene scene was hacked together because if all they needed was for Dekker to procreate with the clone, why not just take his sperm and do it without his consent, so why kill Rachel. Mindless storyline. This had some really sucky lame brain ideas which didn't follow through. If you can stand the 2hr30 mind numb and can see it on the cheap then great but the 3d was really flat - so not a good one to see in 3d... and honestly I'm questioning all this Â£15 cinema ticket lark for hack jobs like this one. I wouldn't say I hated it - just it wasn't 1 out of 10 compared to the original.",5,18,40,7 October 2017
American Sniper," Boring
",I watched this movie expecting something which was going to have a magnetism. The moment came and went in the first 15 minutes - when our hero was forced to shoot a child. This was his first ever kill. From there it got very boring as we go through the motions of watching person a kill person b. person c defend against some bad guys. It unfolds just as any war/action movie would but just in a cold slow manner. I nearly gave up and stopped watching. The whole thing dragged on way too long and then as soon as it had started it ended in an abrupt way which suggested to me that director Clint Eastwood had run out of ideas.I know this review will disappear amongst the tirades of positive patriotic outpourings - but I go with the reviewer who called this film Team America. Its all about how the US can go into someone else's country and flatten it under the false premise of weapons of mass destruction which were truly false and then take the moral high ground. The main character felt compelled to go to war because of the WTC attacks. I thought it was Saudi Arabia that planned and paid for all of that. Yuk in my book.,2,74,155,17 January 2015
Black Panther," Why the hard to understand accents?
",This movie was ruined for me by the hard to understand accents which then went on to make the acting club fisted and woody. I honestly dont know why people said this was a good movie - its plot holes and cheese was immense. I fell asleep and had to try to finish watching it three times... it really was that bad. If the Lion King could have easy to understand accents then why not movie. Do they no da wei?,3,3,5,12 March 2018
Lucy," A mash up movie thrill ride with cinema only special effects
","Lucy I gave it 10 out of 10, this review contains no spoilers.It has a tongue in cheek air whilst paying homage to many great films over the years... 2001, Contact, Matrix, Transcendence, The Time Machine, Inception mixing in car action scenes on a level I have never seen before.It has a kick ass pace and is an eye candy fest. I felt particularly moved by it and was sad it had to end but just like the Maxtrix it leaves a lot of unanswered questions and you just want to know more. I hope they leave those questions unanswered because sometimes a story works best when your imagination has to delve into the possibilities a movie like this can put up. For those who were expecting deep answers from this movie you will be disappointed but for a thrill ride with a lot of wow moments this movie definitely delivers. I hope there is a special edition with more footage because I feel it could have been longer but apart from this a nice little number. Watch in the cinema - it was very impacting on the big screen.",10,8,20,10 September 2014
