First Man," Loved the film
","This is about Neil Armstrong not Apollo not NASA not the US or the 60's and it was well done and well thought out. I grew up during the 60's as a young boy and like all of us from that era was fascinated by Apollo and the whole space program. This film filled in holes for me and told of a man who suffered much loss and tragedy throughout the period. I am glad I watched it and I would suggest anyone who loved Apollo to not miss this film. The crap about the flag not being shown enough is just that crap, and misses the whole point of the film. The director even said he didn't want that to a controversy but again it misses the point of the film. If you are looking for some fast paced film with lots of action then it wouldn't be a movie about Neil Armstrong he wasn't like that in real life. And don't miss the whole point it's about Neil and his life, how he approached it, how he dealt with it. Over all Fantastic Movie glad I got to see it ....",10,0,2,23 January 2019
