"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Funny, but Stupid
","The film is basically a near two hour feature of a man trying to get back with a girl whom he leaves at the alter by running a marathon. And somehow it works! If I had this man's persistence and luck I would be a rich man.The movie is extremely dull and quite frankly stupid until the end. The ending shows a lot of motivation and inspiring scenes. The story final comes truly alive and the film is enjoyable for a few minutes.Overall, a decent film. 6/10",6,1,1,1 September 2018
Cube," Interesting
","Cube is an interesting film. It is very unique and has a lot of elements you would not expect from a low-budget film like this. However, this unique aspect of the film is not a negative thing. I believe it increases the affect the film has on its audience. Decent film. 7/10",7,8,10,1 September 2018
