The Avengers," Avenge Marvel
","From the beginning off this movie turned one completely off. The choice of a bad guy was horrible, a pure hype machine of a movie. Robert Downey is a good actor but his trite portrayal of being charming grows tiresome. Marvel movies have alway's lacked depth and true heart. However this movie engages than cruises by fast, a popcorn movie full of great marketing. A movie like this deserves one view, but really easy to forget its poorly written, acted due to all the hype. Its time for Robert to hang the the suit up. The first Iron Man was the only good one, the character is now dull and annoying. Liam as Thor has no on-screen like ability or charisma. Chris Evans plays a somewhat convincing role but he couldn't act his way through Fast And Furious. Mark Ruffalo is the only saving grace of this movie The Hulk will always be a hard hero to get right, he makes it work on all levels. All in all this movie has become pop culture thats all ;a dumb popcorn movie that works until it starts and ends. Another mediocre Marvel movie pretty much this leaves nothing to the imagination.",4,5,11,29 July 2012
This Is the End," This is the movie
","Most comedies that have this amount of hype and talent rarely come through. So what the main story consist's of is James Franco has a party and invites a bunch of celebrity friends over or so called to come over for a party. What happens is The End of The World occurs and the interactions of how these celebrity's see themselves is the real joy. McBride and Franco's hate for each other is good fun; Mcbride overall steals the movie. Jonah Hill is the only one who doesn't get much laughs despite his effort,he is better off being a sidekick than a random character being out shined.Chaos ensues, actors egos get inflated and bloated. A lot good laughs at their outlook on each other whether true or somewhat true, a good comedy to go in or movie and shut the mind off. For a good time in year of bad blockbusters this is the movie.",9,2,6,13 July 2013
American Sniper," American Propaganda
","From The start Chris Kyle's story is sad but no sadder than any death from this Iraq BS war. Remember this only a opinion. The movie as a whole is great at sucking you in and feeding you nothing. Good popcorn but not artall Hollywood. Clint's films can do that at the best or worst. The question is this is not a heroic war and yet the amount of kills seem to be more known than the stupidity of this war. Sad yet unnecessary war and a waste of lives. Regardless Cooper does a good job not Oscar worthy...this film is very one sided with America as the good guy as always. Any point of view should ask the harder questions. The real great impact war movies are never this patriotic and over-hyped. Better directors with heart would do Chris Kyle's story and all Iraq vets justice. Clint is out of touch. As a whole the story is vague with Kyle being a humble about his kills, in his book he brags and was competitive with his legend status. As a whole besides being sucked in.yet not being a sheep. I pulled the wool over American Snipers eyes pure propaganda.",5,8,25,27 January 2015
Django Unchained," Too long unchained.
","As entertaining this movie and the performances are with Waltz,Samuel and Dicaprio. The moments that are great are what stands out but this movie is way too over hyped and being Tartantino,thats expected as he has always been able to draw an audience.Having said that the movie pacing and story telling seemed forced in too many scenes and felt too dragged on. Waltz is really on his game and should get an Oscar nom for his, ever so watchable performance. Jamie Foxx was the weakest it felt anyone could have played Django. Leonardo finally was a character actor and it was the first time I saw him as it. This is best performance since Whats Eating Grape.What Can one say about Samuel L Jackson,if only his character showed up early.He most likely will get his first Oscar.This is a typical Tartantino format in especially in his last few films tones of gore and dialogue but this is his weakest and predictable. The pace of movie again drags with few too great moments but it is satisfying for a Quentin film.",7,2,7,8 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Dark Knight raises
","Every Batman movie Nolan has done raises the bar from a comic book or film making aspect. Despite the flaw which there happens to be a lot. There are no scene stealing performances but a lot of great acting from the Bale haunting Bruce Wayne which is the core of Batman. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine gives one of there heart felt performances. The characters are great third dimensional portrayals.Nolan's theme like the first delves into the psyche of Bruce,the pain is at its core the main story of how the Batman and Bane are so entwined. The movie goes by and yet is feel like as a viewer you missed something whether it be obvious or not. Its also had a good sense of humour about it without becoming contrived, Robert Downey take notice.The Dark Knight rises shows no fear in making you like or dislike it given the length,plot holes,and overall hype. The world you enter may seem like a cartoon but so emotional complicated that being invested in that becomes a fitting way to end. Easily all comic book or film makers can learn from Nolan he and this amazing film and cast blow all competition away.",10,2,5,29 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," generic film for a generic audience
","Micheal Bay is the king of typical bad structured film making and yet he delivers from a visual aspect. Where the movie failed is how boring it is and the constant rehashing from bad pun to another. The movie had no part in trying to recreate history thats what worked for The Watchmen, really a pointless first half and why couldn't this be the first movie?The biggest surprise came from Malkovich and Tudyk the both came off very naturally and I'll admit that alone was worth the admission other than that Shia's character has always been the weakest for comedy relief. He will always be typecast. Its like a bad sitcom and the canned laughter is there. He constantly yelling and come off as contrite,whiny,malcontent douche bag. In a million years what guy gets a bombshell of a girlfriend without a job; that was the biggest slap in the face towards the audience right there.The movie was predictable and went on way too long during the second half,there was too much unnecessary action like Optimus gets caught in a crane but they show Shia's character fighting for a good 30 minutes until Bay shows Optimus again. Oh Btw Why did Optimus not get his trailer back he said he needed it?There's too much flaws and if you like a movie same as the last yet less annoying. I say watch it. However if your a movie fan you'll find it boring, same generic speech Optimus always seems to give,same bad toilet humour other than Tudyk and Malkovich and if your was in high school I would enjoy this. Its a shut your brain off movie simply that.Bay should do the movie world a favour and retire, I always liked transformers as kid and all three of these movies he did ruined my childhood. A great director like a Nolan or Matthew Vaughn is needed for character development.",3,10,22,7 July 2011
