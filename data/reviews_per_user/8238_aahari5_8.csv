Requiem for a Dream," The Downfall of Us All...
","As director Darren Aronofsky's second feature film, Requiem for a Dream is also his best. Through its graphic and hard-hitting depictions of drug abuse, the film also serves as a lesson on the American Dream and the impossibility of ever truly achieving it.The story of Requiem for a Dream revolves around four addicts living on Coney Island. The first is Sara, an elderly woman who has been selected to appear as a contestant on her favorite game show. Determined to lose her stout figure for the show, Sara becomes addicted to weight loss pills that cause her to slowly lose her grasp on reality. Her son Harry, along with his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone, is a heroin addict who becomes a dealer in order to feed his addiction and to help Marion open a fashion store. The three of them run into innumerable problems, however. Harry's arm becomes horrendously infected due to the repeated use of unclean needles. Sara looses her mind completely. Marion descends into prostitution to continue her worsening addiction and Tyrone is caught in the middle of a gang shooting which he barely escapes. By the end of the film, which I won't go into too much detail, the four have lost everything they hold dear.As I had previously stated, this film acts as a metaphor for the elusive American Dream. Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion all had a dream of their own that they ultimately failed to achieve. Sara wished to be grand prize winning contestant on the game show, but her addiction became so severe that it drove her insane. Harry and Marion wanted to settle down together and open a store together, but their addictions drive them apart and they finally descend into depravity. Tyrone simply wants to make his mother proud, but his actions end up costing him his freedom. The events of this film suggest that, whether ones actions are good or bad, the American Dream is something that can never truly be achieved. Every choice that we make has a consequence. It is not only drug dependency that hinders ones success, but also issues of money, power, violence, and racial, gender, and sexual tolerance that contribute to the death of our dreams. Perhaps this is what the title of the film, Requiem for a Dream, stands for.Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly powerful, moving, and haunting film that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled. The film's performances, particularly Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto as Sara and Harry, are all top-notch and unforgettable. Keep in mind that this film contains some very unsettling and grim situations and imagery, but those who can bear through it will love the film as I do. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time.",10,0,1,26 May 2014
Oldboy," 'Even though I am worse than a beast, don't I have the right to live?'
","One of the many metaphorical quotes featured in Park Chan-wook's haunting masterpiece. I'm not entirely sure if it is correctly quoted word-for-word, but you get the idea.Oh Dae-Su, the protagonist, is a spiteful drunk when he is first introduced to the viewer. He is a man who is so far gone that we cannot feel any significant shred of sympathy for him. One night he is kidnapped after missing his young daughter's birthday due to his drunkenness and is confined in a shabby motel-like prison. After fifteen years he is released and is given less than a week to discover why he was imprisoned.During his, 'motel stay' as I will call it, Dae-Su slowly re-evaluates his life. He begins keeping a journal of sorts, comprised of emotional letters to his daughter. He acknowledges his wrongdoings and becomes a wiser man, allowing us the audience to begin to empathize with him and giving meaning to aforementioned metaphor. By the time he is released, he has become a nobler and stronger man, driven intensely by revenge, and is now a character whom we can fully understand and identify.Another metaphor used in this film is, 'be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they both sink equally'. I believe that, essentially, this means that what goes around comes around. At one point in the film, it is revealed that Dae-Su and Woo-Jin Lee, the antagonist and the culprit behind Dae-Su's imprisonment, attended the same high school as teens and that Dae-Su discovered a secret about Woo-Jin and then committed an act that left him with deep emotional scars and greatly impacted his life. During the final confrontation between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin, the latter reveals that Dae-Su's capture and release was carefully and precisely orchestrated so that an event would later occur with him in the same vein as Woo-Jin's dark secret. By doing this, Woo-Jin has gained the upper hand and has acquired an, 'eye for an eye'.Overall, I think that this is a truly excellent and memorable film. The underlying themes of redemption and karma hit hard and left a great impact on me as a cinemaphile. Be warned, although this film is not graphically violent, it is still brutal and what is implied off screen is usually quite disturbing. That being said, this film is not to be missed. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time.",10,3,7,12 April 2014
Interstellar," This is Why We Go to the Movies.
","Christopher Nolan's latest film, Interstellar, might just be his magnum opus. It stands out as one of the most visually beautiful films that I have ever seen and contains all of the intelligence, realism, and emotion of Nolan's previous films. It serves as a refreshing reminder of why we go and see films.Kip Thorne, an actual theoretical physicist, worked as a consultant on Interstellar. As a result, this is one of the most scientifically accurate films that I have yet seen. It has been proved that a wormhole in space can alter the flow of time and physics, and possibly lead into other dimensions, and the way that it is handled in the film makes it all the more believable. The wormhole depicted in the film is spherical in appearance and is large enough to allow the crew to pass through it without experiencing any physical repercussions. It should be noted that, during production, Thorne advised Nolan to avoid creating any plot elements that would deviate from the established laws of physics and that any questions the film raised should stem from science. The advice paid off, as the finished film is nothing short of brilliant.Another important aspect of the film's plot are its themes of love and hope. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is forced to leave his family behind when he is sent on the mission. His daughter Murphy is devastated and heartbroken by his departure. She is later shown as an adult, played masterfully by Jessica Chastain, working to save humanity from extinction as her father is. Cooper's ultimate goal is to make it back home to his children and while Murphy feels angry and abandoned at his absence, she eventually realizes that he isn't technically gone (the details of which I won't go into here). Perhaps the film's overall message is that love is the only force that can evolve and persevere through time and distance.Interstellar is a masterpiece that boasts an outstanding cast and a plot with fierce intelligence and emotion. Anyone who loves film needs to see it. It is unmatched in quality and is a perfect example of why we go to the movies.",10,2,7,23 November 2014
Apocalypse Now," The Horror... The Horror...
","Apocalypse Now is director Francis Ford Coppola's best film, dare I say even better than The Godfather in a very close victory. The film is a harrowing and mesmerizing tale of the slow descent into madness and the effects that war can have on one's mind, and it also has the absolute best cinematography that I have ever seen. It is a film that has held its own despite a hellish production and it has become a masterpiece of its time.The production of Apocalypse Now is well known to have been a complete nightmare, with such problems that included Marlon Brando's uncooperative demeanor and weight problems, Martin Sheen's near-fatal heart attack, sets being destroyed by multiple storms, and ever increasing production costs. Production took well over a year to complete and millions of feet of film were edited down to the final product. Despite all of these setbacks, however, the end result is a wonder to behold. The story is uncompromising and harsh and we the viewers can feel Captain Willard's grip on reality slowly fade away as he carries out his journey to find Colonel Kurtz. The masterful cinematography makes the nearly-four-decade old film look and feel brand new. Coppola truly suffered for his craft, but the end result was well worth all the trouble.The film's antagonist, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, is a very intriguing character despite his short time actually on screen. He is a highly regarded and honored military figure who has gone mad and formed his own kingdom of sorts in the jungles of Cambodia. He has become so powerful that he is even feared by the US military. When we are finally introduced to Kurtz, we learn that the horrors he witnessed and experienced during his time fighting in the war are what created his grim views on human nature and civilization. Kurtz has an almost god-like air about him. The way that he operates and commands his militia throughout the film without his physical presence gives him a mysterious yet powerful quality that make the character feel omnipresent. His back story and his influence over the lead characters even before they come to meet him creates the impression that he is somehow watching and controlling their every move and thoughts and that by the time they finally reach him, he already has some control and insight into their minds. Kurtz is one of the most interesting characters on film that I have yet seen.Overall, Apocalypse Now is truly unforgettable and is one of my favorite films. The philosophical messages of insanity and man's breaking point haunt the viewer for some time, perhaps forever. This is a film that has to be seen to be believed.",10,1,2,20 July 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," A Heart Breaking and Beautiful Film
","Calling The Fault in Our Stars a teen flick might sound a little bit stereotypical. Yes, the primary target audience of this film is young adults, but there are so many heavy emotions and relatable themes that it can even appeal to an older audience as well. All of the issues that the film covers are real and tragic and we as an audience can feel for the characters and even grow to love them.Watching Hazel and Augustus cope and struggle with their terminal cancer diagnoses feels so powerful that it appears as though it is really happening. Their love for each other grows even as their conditions worsen. You can feel the pain that they feel and the deep bond that they share.As I sat in the theater with my girlfriend next to me in my arms, I realized that life can end at any given second. She is to me what Hazel was to Augustus. Perhaps the greatest lesson that I learned from this film is that if you love someone, let them know it. Spend every second you can with them and make them the happiest person in the world, because tomorrow it could all end. The relationship between Augustus and Hazel did not feel real... because it was real. There was no acting. It was genuine and heartfelt and we could feel the growing sense of sorrow and pain as Augustus' health began to rapidly decline. We grew to love them as human beings, not characters, and were torn apart when the ending of the film arrived.I love this film. I love it because of its heartfelt lesson that life is beautiful and that one should love it as they love the person that they wish to spend it with. This is a film that needs to be seen because of its sheer power and its message.",10,0,1,12 July 2014
12 Years a Slave," A Harrwoing Masterpiece... One of the Greatest Films Ever Made
","Director Roman Polanski once said that when making a film, 'you have to show violence the way it is. If you don't show it realistically, then that's immoral and harmful. If you don't upset people, then that's obscenity'. His quotes applies to Steve McQueen's honest and terrifying indie film in every way. This film doesn't sugar coat the brutality of slavery by using quick cuts or flashy editing, and thus we the audience are forced to see everything from whippings to lynchings and even the rape of a slave.Compared to other larger, more mainstream Hollywood films, this film does not take pride in its violence and has something that many modern films, especially if they are aimed at a larger audience, lack... humanity. The depictions of cruelty hit much harder than an average Hollywood film where the violence would normally be edited or shown off screen or even be shown in a glorifying manner, and through these images the audience is able to feel for the characters. To experience the pain and hardships that Solomon Northup endured in a dark time in American history firsthand is emotionally draining but at the same time it awakens us to the reality of an evil that still occurs today in many countries. We want him to succeed and we feel his pain.Within all of the film's depictions of intolerance and cruelty, there is also a strong message of the perseverance of the human spirit. Solomon Northup maintains his will to live despite all of the horrors that he is forced to endure and remains a strong character throughout the film. It is a relatable message, that one can survive the most grueling odds through the force of willpower, and it is one that rings true even today. Whether it be poverty, illness, bullying, or any other obstacle, one can survive and conquer the odds through their will to live and succeed.12 Years a Slave is a harrowing, masterfully crafted film that should be viewed by everyone at least once. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important film because of its emotional, humane, and even educational values. I greatly admire this film because of its messages of perseverance and humanity. This is one of the greatest films of all time.",10,0,1,21 April 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Modern Shakespeare at it's Finest
","Birdman Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is without a doubt the best film of 2014. Its original and relatable plot and innovative cinematography create an astonishing work of art and paints a vivid intellectual portrait of the desire to regain one's relevance and to prove their worth. The film feels like a new and refreshing take on the works of Shakespeare.The films that I enjoy the most are the ones that I can relate to. Seeing Riggan Thomson as he struggles to distance himself from the schlocky superhero franchise that he is widely associated with and prove his greater talent as an actor feels similar to how I have progressed in life. As someone who faces very different yet all to similar challenges (i.e. depression, anxiety, learning difficulties), I have continually battled to achieve some degree of success and I try to accomplish my goals in spite of my obstacles. Perhaps the biggest question that is brought forward is how does one stay relevant in a changing society? Riggan struggled to maintain his popularity after leaving the multi-billion dollar franchise that made him a success and wants to stage a comeback though his Broadway production. He knows, however, that his play will likely be a disaster and that he will really only be remembered for his past role as Birdman. The message that I have interpreted from this theme is that true art, whether it be film or music or the like, does not usually get the wide attention that it deserves and that popular crowd will almost always be attracted to the flashier and more fantastical (but typically of lesser quality) fare. This makes a good statement on the superhero genre as well... it will either make an actors career or destroy it entirely.The struggles that are faced in this film can be compared to Shakespeare's writings, particularly that of Macbeth. Riggan himself is Macbeth, ambitious and willing to go to any length to fulfill his goal and strives to prove his true artistic talents. Birdman, who inhabits Riggan's consciousness like a separate personality, is like Lady Macbeth, taunting and manipulating Riggan at every turn. Everyone from the critics to cast mates and even Riggan's own daughter have little faith in the production. The play itself seems destined to fail, but in the end, which I won't spoil too much, Riggan does succeed in some ways. How does he do it? Well, that is for the audience to decide.Birdman's complex themes and amazing presentation form a masterpiece of cinema art and left a lasting impression on me as the viewer. The film could even have worked as an audio book or even as an actual stage performance itself. The film recently won several Academy Awards including Best Picture, and rightfully so. All of the film's aspects including its script, cinematography, and performances make it one of the best films in recent memory.",10,6,14,26 February 2015
Her," Love Transcends All Else
","A few nights ago as I checked out from my daily work routine, I decided to look through RedBox for a film to watch. I chose the film Her, after a minute or so of sifting through the selection of movies, as it had been something that I had wanted to watch for some time now. When I arrived home, I turned the film on and watched. In short, Her is a very touching, emotional, and surprisingly realistic film. It has left me feeling deeply moved and has showed me that love exists in many different forms.Theodore Twombly's struggle with heartbreak and loneliness is an issue that I strongly identify with. To be alone and not have someone to share your love with is devastating and isolating and it destroys the sense of purpose. Samantha, the operating system who comes into Theodore's life, is a very real and human character despite a lack of physical being. She possesses human knowledge and emotions and the love that she shares with Theodore changes their lives. They share what is perhaps the most moving and loving connection that I have yet seen on film.The journey of Samantha and Theodore is greatly symbolic, from my perspective, of my own journey that I share with my lover. Theodore is lonely and withdrawn until Samantha comes into his life, as I was until my girlfriend came into mine. They soon become friends, as did we. They become very close and eventually find love in each other and become inseparable, as did her and I. Theodore learns through Samantha that there is a limit for despair and self-loathing, but there is no limit for love, a lesson that I too have learned from my lover.I identify with the story of this film more than any other. Theodore's journey strongly parallels that of my own. The love that he finds in Samantha is the love that my own lover has given to me. The film's ultimate lesson is one that should be common knowledge; that love transcends all else.",10,0,1,23 September 2014
