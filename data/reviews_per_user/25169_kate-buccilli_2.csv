Captain Phillips," Fantastic movie - Great acting!
","This movie is one of the best movies I've seen across all genres.The acting is fantastic (especially one of Tom Hank's very poignant final scenes) and the movie itself was captivating, exciting and based on a true story. It was great that the director was able to portray the pirates ('bad guys') in a way that made you hate them, feel sorry for them and hope for their survival all at the same time. The story is portrayed really realistically and you're able to stay captivated throughout.Definitely would recommend, I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.10/10",10,2,4,17 June 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Favourite book adaption to date!
","I am an avid book reader and I'm always skeptical about watching movie adaptions because they never really seem to do the book justice.The Fault in Our Stars, on the other hand, was an incredibly poignant and inspiring movie that did the novel every bit of justice it deserved. The director was able to make the right moments incredibly sad (to the point of tears) other parts witty and funny without effecting the overall mood of the movie. As a viewer, you are able to develop a deep connection to the characters and feel their emotions as though you're on the journey with them. You're able to fall in love with Hazel and Augustus and experience another take on dealing with disease from the perspective of a teen realist. It'll leave you wanting to watch it all over again!10/10",10,0,2,17 June 2014
