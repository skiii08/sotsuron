Hereditary," Disturbing with some original scenes
","I'll be generous and give this a '7' based on the fact that there were some extremely creepy and/or disturbing scenes that felt unique to the horror genre. Toni Collette and the young male actor were also powerhouses. As for the story, it doesn't make a lot of sense. After I watched it, I read the articles analyzing and breaking it down, and that's all fine and dandy, but I don't feel like I should have to read a long article to understand what happened in the movie I just watched. '3' for story. '8.5' for scares. '10' for acting.",7,0,1,7 February 2019
