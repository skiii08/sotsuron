The Incredible Hulk," Yes. This is Hulk
","If someone was waiting for a film that really shows a Hulk as it is, then I must say that this is the movie that always wanted to see about this character. 'The incredible Hulk' has many qualities that make it off completely form the stylized and a little boring Ang Lee's version, who although isn't a bad movie, but it didn't meet the expectations of an adaptation more serious of this comic. What are the differences that make this film better than its earlier? Lets start from the beginning. This version of Hulk resume, in its initial sequence of credits, everything that someone who does not know anything about comics should know to understand the story. This movie didn't deny the Ang Lee film, actually takes up the fact that Bruce Banner has fled to a place in South America and from there begins the story as a kind of sequel. Another success is that strips the movie completely of greater existential reflections and makes it what it is par excellence, a ribbon of pure entertainment, with big action sequences, chases and fights between giant monsters that make this version of Hulk more like the comic, but also has its romantic side and the human and painful part of Bruce Banner, but not focuses only one hour on that.Visually the Hulk design compared to that of Ang Lee is much more stylized, less coarse than the last and most rugged, looks even stronger than the Lee's, while the FX are used much more stylized and harmonics, they are more precise, which results in sequences, like the battle of the university, that are really spectacular. Finally the choice of players compete much with the casting of the previous movie, but I think that is better the choice of Norton than Bana, and more beautiful Liv Tyler than Jennifer Connelly. Excellent choice of William Hurt and Tim Roth as 'the villains' and much better even the preamble to 'The Avengers' with Tony Stark.For these reasons, this is for me the real Hulk.",8,3,5,15 July 2008
Spartacus," Only a simple man
","Any qualifying adjective that can be put to this movie will be short. This is not the epic film that many current generations are accustomed to see, but if it is for the time that was made even if it is ahead of his time and even if it break with the way it is accustomed to making this kind of movie, turning it into something more crude, more real, more visceral. It is not a moral analogy of the story of a man as Ben-Hur, nor are the downsides of a gladiator became a hero who defeats an empire, as in the film of Scott, Spartacus is not like any other genre movie or 'Roman-Christian' theme is the vision, somewhat limited by the studios, of a simple man who revolutionized the movies with his magisterial work (Kubrick), which tells the story of another ordinary man who was not done for its time. Without so many claims Spartacus addresses the issue of freedom trough a clear way, it does so with the intent to make us believe in that principle, not transform us but yes to realize that the whole struggle is not in vain. It does not give hope, or provide answers, but if advised and drew the common man as the most important piece that should start to change in order to find the goal sought. Spartacus, said the prologue, was ahead of his time, like Kubrick and his esthetic and narrative style that can be found in each frame, his struggle as a creator of art is reflected in every scene. Kubrick is the Spartacus of movies, which advocates freedom of style, gender, leaving the stereotype and show something different, something innovative. Spartacus is Kubrick, and that is reason enough to consider this movie as a beautiful work of art ... Or there is another way to call it?",9,2,4,16 April 2008
I'm Not There," An ideological, mystery and enigmatic travel across the Dylan's life
","I didn't know anything about the Bob Dylan's life only a few songs that I had heard of him once. But even so, for me it was a film well done, each of these episodes-characters shaped Dylan's personality, all his dreams, concerns, afflictions, obstacles, that converge into one point: the myth, the legend.This dream's touch that has the story for many is the biggest hit to mix it with each of Dylan's songs, but it is also true that this is the characteristic that makes keeping the viewer, more often, on the sidelines because we are not able to go depth to the outcome of each conversation, phrase or episode submitted by Haynes's direction who knew how to summarize, simplify and splitting a story without beginning or end, as must be the life of any myth.Technically the film is a visual delight. The frantic editing that combines a story with another through a photography that uses the white and black's mysticism and dark colors's melancholy that make the film easily advance, even its incomprehensible moments, as all human life, but beautiful for being exactly the same thing. The performances achieved are perfect too, especially Blanchett and Ledger that performed someone closer to a Bob Dylan.At the end of all the movie is a journey through a legend that never met, a character who is on the screen but isn't the original, which is set by all the stories but that doesn't belong to any. This is the story of a man who rather than a man is the lyrics and chords of a song.",7,2,3,6 July 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Good end of a pirate tale
","Long time after I finally culminated to saw The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, and indeed I think it was a good way to finish the story. To be honest, this latest film isn't as spectacular and successful as the others, but we must admit that it has good performances and excellent special effects, that are carried to the limit in a classic epic battle in a whirlwind, but even this the story itself alone, in other words, viewing the film as a single movie, it doesn't work and doesn't propose anything new rather than closing all questions made in the previous chapters.For many this is the most boring of the three films, since they focused much of its story in the love triangle and history of Turner-Swann-Sparrow, which is actually good as we move further into the motivations of the characters and know closer his 'human' side. To others this is the movie that puts less emphasis to pirates fights, but the battles here are much more striking than in previous deliveries and the effects much more detailed, the reality is that the film works well and fulfills its mission.I was satisfied, it isn't the great film that I hoped but meets my expectations, especially given this kind of end to the film, something totally anti-Disney, because is a 'happy' ending but not the circumstances that makes it in a sad way to finish the story, thanks to screenwriters Elliot and Rossio we can say good end to a story of pirates. I can only add, and warmly I wonder now, what's next?",8,0,1,9 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," From envy, admiration and worse
","This is not the classic western. If anybody had ever asked what were the motives that led to Robert Ford to commit the murder of Jesse James, this movie is the answer. This isn't the story of a murder is the story of an introverted, fearful, nervous, somewhat gay, silent and little smart man that admired another man who was quite the opposite and that once this admiration wasn't reciprocated, like Robert Ford had wanted, then came hatred, revenge, resentment because he wasn't, not like Jesse James, but Jesse James itself.This film is an analysis of how admiration for a person becomes an obsession to be what we are not (this story reminded me somewhat of The Talented Mr. Ripley) Does Robert Ford wants to be as Jesse James? The answer is no, basically story shows us that Ford was looking for what Jesse represented, an admiration by the people, an applause, but what he found was exactly the opposite by not realize that the only real applause isn't from cowardice, or vile acts, but it is to exploit what we are, what makes us be us.This story whose message transcends beyond an historic landmark is also gratifying for any person who likes movie due to its technical details are extremely impressive, it is necessary to highlight the photo, that undoubtedly, they choose a number of perfectly frames that get making plastic each scene, at times actually seems we are seeing a painting by the way in which natural light becomes an essential element. Just include the value that music gives the scenes since served as a catalyst for emotions to give a touch more melancholic to some moments.Perhaps the only things that could bring as defects are the abuse of the blur effect in the lens only to highlight what is at the center of the image, and the rhythm a bit slow but justified wonderfully with the editing and photography. In short this is a really beautiful film.",9,0,2,23 July 2008
The Lives of Others," Beauty from the simple
","I was approaching to this movie without wanting to see it. Despite all the awards and the criticisms I had read, I didn't believed to have reflected the truth about its quality. So I began to see the movie and before the twenty minutes I realized I was facing a tape unique in its actions but especially nourished by a script that shudder to any human being, not just as impressive history but by the ode towards humanity that the director accomplished through every frame.Rather than delve into the depths of story and in criticism of socialism, there are more profound and subtle details that attract the attention of the viewer. The characters are ordinary people, and it is this simplicity that draws the attention of Wiesler, which makes their love for their work becomes an unconditional love to people's lives and their small details that give meaning to their existence.So an argument, a birthday, a sexual relationship, an ideal, a love of art, causing Wiesler admiration of the relationship of Georg and Maria, an envy of experiencing the same simple pleasures in his gray life, that leads to defend, to risk for them to be like the God of their small existence that manages to retain the balance, so the end (or the last 15 minutes) prove to be a blow to the liver of any spectator, that everything goes free fall and the fragility is present.I decided not to re-try before know. Now I understand because Pans Laberynth not won that Oscar and it is because this film seduces with its beauty from the simple.",9,0,0,30 March 2008
Across the Universe," Good, but something was missing
","Only The Beatles's music could be capable of cause a musical odyssey like this. If Yellow Submarine and A Hard Day's Night were an adventure that led to reflection and especially the delight of every song, Julie Taymor gives with this film a universal, romantic, historic, epic and unique magnitude to many of the Beatles's hits.All the movie it's a journey, an adventure. Jude is looking for his father, his identity, his freedom and at the end for Lucy, she instead tries to lived, love, fight for what she believes, an find Jude at the building's upper. All reduces in the look for love, because if all you need is love it is good to go Across the universe to find it. And so the ideas makes sense, value, a universal weight where everyone are one, like Dr Robert said, and The Beatles before: I am he as you are he and we are he all together.But even after all the film's beauty, all the songs, the choreographs, the ideologies and the rhythmic edition agreement to the era's portrait both historically and culturally, something was missing. After all still a vacuum that made us feel something was missing, maybe a Lucy in the sky with diamonds more justified or an endless list of songs that were omitted by a lack of time. We were also waiting to know more about Prudence, Sadie, Jojo, more about their lives, their philosophy.Even with all this the real magic about Across the universe isn't overshadowed, these minimal details that were missing or that made fail the intentions of what was trying to show, all they are forgotten behind the beauty of their images and with every note and verse of songs. And is worth to stay mounted on the dream of love.",8,0,0,4 May 2008
The Dark Knight," A dark vision almost perfect
","While I write this I'm still immensely impressed with the forcefulness of this film, there are really few action or adventure movies that will create what 'The Dark Knight' gets in just a few minutes, and that is to bring the climax of emotions with a script that is strengthened in each of its lines and with an edition that frame after frame doesn't exist any wastage. Anything that we had heard about this film before its premiere, all these positive comments that the criticism launched after having seen it, all the positive references are true, very true. To begin with, the action sequences are a visual choreography, in each one's emotions are as much as possible, because not only are loaded by a perfect use of special effects, explosions and an audio editing forceful, but also because Bale, and Heath Ledger above all, build two characters who represent two sides of the coin and their clashes are so catastrophic that makes everything a witness from the edge of the seat. And is that really the performances are at the level of what anyone could expect, but definitely this is the film of The Joker. Either that, including me, thought that no one could deprive the best interpretation of this murderer to Jack Nicholson, really we have our mouths open to the strength, vitality and terror that manages to combine Ledger villain in this, I confess at times was too crazy up to me, and that is what succeeds, it succeeds really that you think that this man is a man without any kind of moral questioning, everything for him is a macabre game. So Joker works well because it also has a dramatic, dark and vertiginous screenplay that unfolds quickly to each of the characters and at the same time, for that speed with which everything happens, forcing the viewer to be attentive to each of the sequences, each of the planes, and the richness of this script is that even if it is full of action is also an ode about a moral antihero, that make you think about the various faces of good and evil, and leads to comic character to a much more psychological level, reflected whenever Joker and Batman exchange lines, and which culminates with a hopeful end even when circumstances suggest quite the opposite and balance between the two sides of the coin has been broken. That's because the script is really something worthwhile, for all Batman, The Joker, Harvey Dent and James Gordon mean and represent. The film is not an idealistic and beautiful portrait of a hero, is a dark film about a man who loads a weight of being a hero that nobody wants, is the battle of a man in front of the chaos, is the fascination of anarchy and violence and hope that lies even after the cataclysm. Yes, it has its errors of continuity, some holes in the plot, but not all opaque this marvelous film. This is a great film in a genre in which there seemed no room for maturity, for the visual beauty that has made the best Batman film.",9,5,11,18 July 2008
The Happening," Where is the director of The Sixht Sense?
","Someone said that hit the first time and you will hit twice, and in most cases, this is one hundred percent true, but in the case of M. Night Shyamalan something happened along the way and the result wasn't what generally would give this equation. After 'The Sixth sense' I expected from him only masterpieces but it wasn't, well 'Unbreakable' is more or lees good, I can even say that I liked, like his next movie 'Signs' but I must admit that during these three films not only the quality was lost in some directing aspects, also the scripts became increasingly incomprehensible, with several plot holes, his moral questionings becoming less solid and its ' screw turns' very forced, giving by result mediocre endings. If we didn't want to believe this with these first three examples 'The Village' and 'Lady in the Water' completely sealed the belief that we had.For 'The Happening' everything seemed to be changing. From an ad campaign that showed little or nothing about the story until a trailer that only anticipated an apocalypse film, the assumptions began to run and we thought that Shyamalan was returning; the star director-screenwriter of 'The Sixth sense' is back. But it didn't. I can summarize what I think of this movie in two words: Great disappointment. Why? Because even though the premise of nature vs. man was interesting and the beginning of the tape, with that single number of suicides, that impacts any, like the story line advancing becomes more predictable, unbelievable and culminate with a very bad ending, so messianic, the couple protagonist survive through a coincidence of fate (where love also has something to do). Because the moral conflict that facing the players is irrelevant, the woman who refuses to mature and the men that can't understand the needs of his wife, in some point of the movie it disappears like a breath of air. Because the performances are appalling, one of the worst Wahlberg roles, you don't believe him absolutely nothing because the majority of his lines are stupid and lacking in naturalness, and neither Zooey Deschanel do a good work, in fact, Does anyone believe her character?. And because, Does anyone remember the end of '28 weeks later'? Yes, France too.To summarize, the movie isn't good because it is not what is expected of someone that made a great film the first time. OK, I must admit, it was beginner lucky.",5,1,5,12 July 2008
Love Actually," All you need is love
","First of all this isn't a simple and silly romantic comedy, and that is its greatest charm. The film itself is an x-ray, an analysis of what is love actually and its beauty lies in the fact that it remains today, you could see it a lot of times and its essence continuous fresh thanks to a series of stories that show us the different faces of love and above all, by a spectacular cast for one single movie, in which none of the players is lost and each make their best effort to give a more real interpretation.To be honest the biggest hit of the movie is the script and the direction of Richard Curtis that with subtlety builds a beautiful story that can move from comedy to drama without any complication because, at the end of all, is there a suffering or joy more great that love? In addition, photography and art design also contribute to create warm atmospheres, yet despite that the film takes place in winter, where the characters make great performances and show us more intimate sides that help achieve greater identification with some of the stories.Another detail is that, definitely, if this story will develop elsewhere than London and at another time than Christmas, we would probably face a silly movie about love, but these factors combine to give a more consistent, as a wink toward anything that moves us the heart. But not everything is happiness there are also some details that are bad for the film especially with some stories that have a very open ending, like the case of Sarah and her love for the graphic designer, which makes it unnecessary.In short, is an excellent film to see if you are in love but also if you don't, perhaps you will find here some love.",8,1,3,21 July 2008
The Queen," A great woman's portrait , a regular queen's movie
","'The queen' has three things in its favor where lies the value of the film: the direction of Stephen Frears, the excellent and superb performance of Helen Mirren and an actual script, although measured in many parts it risks showing a historical fact with real characters who still remain the same office like in the film. These three points achieve this movie to be a compelling drama despite its failed edition (at times it seems to me a BBC's television production) and some characters representations are little faithful to the original (as Prince Charles and Tony Blair), whose physically aren't the same.The plot focuses on the death of Lady Di and its impact on the people of England as well as the royal family, but it is also true that what is most interesting isn't these consequences, most important results how the queen thinking and acting, so this intimate drama helps us to visualize perfectly a character emblematic of the current worldwide monarchy. Their feelings, concerns, the coldness with which she reacts to what her people want and the disjunction between pay tribute to the woman who attacked his reign or lose the acceptance of people but not betray their principles, all this make the interpretation of Mirren a faithful portrait of a woman who holds a great weight on her shoulders and still goes ahead, and that is what most impresses and impacted the viewer. The rest are just circumstances.",7,0,1,23 June 2008
Iron Man," More than I thought
","During the last years we have been witness of an endless number of comics's adaptations to movies. Most of them have resulted films more or less entertaining or achieved. Only characters like Batman on Nolan's hands or even Reimi's Spiderman or Singer's Xmen have been the most redeemable, others like Hulk or Fantastic Four have been good for forget it. Just when I thought that Iron Man would fall on this kind, I took a big surprise.This Marvel's hero adaptation destroyed all my expectations. And is that from beginning to end Robert Downey Jr. completely takes the entire film. Tony Stark's character is perfectly accomplished and makes that everyone believed his performance. But if that weren't enough Iron Man is surrounded by and endless number of characteristics that makes it appealing to all levels.This adaptation remains faithful to comic's story, the action sequences are well distributed along the plot, the romantic tension between Downey and Platrow works all time, the Bridges evil dazzles as their performance and the cynicism of most of the sequences makes story fresh and specially striking. But to this should be added the historic contextual framework because fits perfectly with the currently world situation and specially United States that lives in this crossroads between the peace with weapons or without them.Iron Man is entertaining from beginning to end. Nobody would believe that this could be the best summer film but I can assure you that if the majority of movies that will come has the same quality that this: wow, this could be the best summer talking about movies. Because definitely the film's end leaves you wanting more, and this is just starting.",8,1,3,4 May 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," And I didn't feel anything
","Right is to say that this Elizabeth's delivery isn't so perfect or lovely like the last one making by Blanchett-Kapur couple. In fact,the film doesn't have great techniques faults (planes are useful and them are coordinated with a shaking edition) and also has good performances that getting capture from the very beginning, each player did a good role, but even this qualities it doesn't exists a feeling or something that causes audience being in contact with story.I don't know if the problem was the freedom about history that takes Kapur at the time he writes the story or the turn that takes the script during the presentation of facts of the battle between England and Spain that converts the film in a noir movie full of betrayals and with a story of love that makes incredible and less coherent the Elizabeth's role that had shone a lot with her innocence and love affairs during the last movie.Only a last thing I have to say. After this frustrated history try, but good show of technique, I came out of cinema thinking about I had seen a really well done film but it didn't made me feel anything and this is his worst fault.",7,0,0,2 May 2008
