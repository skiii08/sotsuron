The Sound of Music," A Girl Asked Me to Take Her to See this Film on a Date. I Broke the Relationship.
","One commentator has said: 'When I was young I used to picture the audience for this film as slightly deaf old women in surgical stockings and bad hats, and my attitude still holds.' Does he know how close to the truth that statement is? I remember as a kid being dragged to see this film by the family. I had already heard some of the music from this film on the radio, and it was so sickly sweet that I had to continuously fight the urge to vomit. So I was dreading to see the film.So I sat in the stalls of the Dominion in Tottenham Court Road with the family, which included the aunts in the surgical stockings and bad hats, some of whom had seen the film as many as six - yes, six - times and had somehow resisted the urge to throw themselves off Charing Cross Bridge into the murky waters of the endless mighty Thames.All my worst fears were confirmed. This film was as bad as I thought it would be.From the moment that Julie Andrews first appeared on the screen singing that sickly song, and having to endure the shrieks of the Reverend Mother, we are introduced to the dysfunctional Von Trapp family.It did have one benefit. I began to grow up fast after that, so that I would be big enough not to be dragged by the family to watch Von Crapp like this.Judging by some of the later parts played by Julie Andrews, I got the impression, rightly or wrongly, that even SHE realised she had made a mistake in appearing in this film, and was taking on ever more raunchier roles to compensate.Apart from the story, the dialogue, the lyrics, the conception, there is nothing technically wrong with this film. But if you have any intelligence at all you will not bear to watch it. As to those who have seen it many times, they all have one thing in common: they are all Roman Catholic. Many of them even think that this is a religious film. (Oh, they do. They do.) Finally, to those who have read my summary above, and who do not believe that I turned down a date with a good-looking girl because she wanted to see The Sound of Music, I can say that that is what happened. Literally. I like my women to have something upstairs. This girl clearly had not.",1,24,78,8 June 2005
Casablanca," I'll tell you what this film is about.
","What is this film about? All sorts of explanations have been put forward. It's a romance, a melodrama - even the intriguing explanation that it was the representation of a love triangle involving the director, a notion which falls flat, because the director did not write the script. In fact, it is a good old fashioned war propaganda film. Why should the Americans enter the Second World War?Although the film is set in North Africa, all the principal characters are either American or from somewhere in Europe. The Americans are from a country that is 'neutral.' Most of the others, the French, the Czech with the Hungarian name etc, are embroiled in the war somewhere.Among all the turmoil in Casablanca Rick Blaine has built himself a little neutral island. It's cosy, with his chess set in his little office, with Dooley Wilson at the piano, and Sasha the Russian barman. The turmoil can go on but Rick Blaine, like the USA, is strictly neutral.But Rick cannot remain neutral for long, and sooner or later, the second world war - in the shape of Ilsa and her boyfriend - turn up at his door. Rick must now take an active part in the war, just as the USA have to join the fighting.The final scene show the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the reluctant collaborator of a Frenchman and his American ally.The film may have been a message to the people of America or even a message to the President (casablanca is Spanish for white house). But the message is there. It's 1942, and it's off to war for the USA; because it is inevitable that the USA are going to get embroiled in this one way or another.Those who have read some of my other reviews know that I am quite capable of slitting the throats of sacred cows. In this case I am quite happy to give it 10 out of 10, because it IS a good film; and it is not the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you it is a good film; it is the ordinary filmgoing public who will tell you. It is heavily layered, well acted, competently directed, and Orson Welles is nowhere to be seen!There are some reviewers who say that the acting in this is bad. When did Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains or Conrad Veidt ever act badly? They couldn't if they tried.No other director but Curtiz could have directed this. Interesting is the scene where two factions sing against one another, a device he has used in at least one other of his films. For this film, Curtiz won an about-time-too Oscar for best director.Another great thing about this film is that it is so rich in content that you can play it again, Sam, as often as you like.",10,1,3,5 July 2005
Citizen Kane," The Hyperbole of Genius
","All the pseuds say it; all the polls of the 'greatest films ever made' say it: this is the greatest film ever made. Orson Welles, in between mouthfuls, shows his genius once again.But things are never quite what they seem.Take all that brouhaha about 'The War of the Worlds.' All those people thinking that the Martians had really landed. Or did they? I have heard this play twice, and I have to say that I cannot see anybody being taken in by a radio play that is not particularly good. Indeed when you dig up the contemporary newspapers, you can see a distinct absence of named people; and the articles smack of having been written before the broadcast even went out. At the time, the Mercury Theatre was being threatened with the termination of their radio series: they were that bad! What better to keep them on the air than the biggest load of hype in entertainment history. It is reckoned by some historians that not a single person headed for the hills as a result of this radio programme.But surely Orson Welles answered his critics in 'Citizen Kane.' Didn't he?Well if taking the story of Hearst, blackening the reputation of Marion Davies, and pinching unusual camera angles from other directors, like Michael Curtiz, is genius, then Orson Welles is a genius and 'Citizen Kane' is indeed the greatest film ever known.It just goes to show that if people go around shilling Orson Welles as a genius, the pseuds will be stupid enough to believe it.But don't take my word for it. See The Adventures of Robin Hood, which predates Citizen Kane. There you will see all the unusual angles you will wish to see. Curtiz even has a couple of shots taken from the fireplace, the difference between Kane and Robin Hood is that in Robin Hood, the fire is lit. Also in Robin Hood you will see moving camera shots a-plenty, especially in the opening scene in the great hall at Nottingham Castle, which means that the often repeated statement that Orson Welles invented moving camera shots in Citizen Kane is utter drivel. I will repeat it just in case the pseuds miss it yet again: Citizen Kane is NOT the first film to use moving camera shots and Orson Welles did NOT invent this technique.If you want to call Michael Curtiz a genius, I have no problem with that. He certainly has more right to that appellation than has Orson Welles.But I can be wrong. And I have been proved wrong. I once said to a friend of mine: 'Is it just me, or is Citizen Kane the most overrated film ever made?'He replied: 'You are wrong. Citizen Kane is a great film. whenever it is shown on television, I never sleep better.'As someone who has fallen asleep in front of Citizen Kane myself, I just had to admit that I was wrong.And all those people who stayed at home instead of going to the cinema, making Citizen Kane a box-office flop. They were wrong, too. Or were they?",1,41,81,24 May 2005
The Football Factory," It Almost Gets to the Essence of Soccer Hooliganism
","There are one or two things that this film does not get right. The 'firm' of Chelsea receive the news that they have drawn Millwall in the cup. For those who do not know much about English soccer, let me tell you that Millwall fans have had a reputation for violent conduct since as far back as I can remember (the mid 1960s), and Chelsea fans have been known to get into a brawl or two on occasions! Here is a minor point. We have the Chelsea fans liberally using rhyming slang, (from London's East End), whereas Chelsea's supporters are predominantly from North London, where I have never ever heard rhyming slang used in my eighteen years living there.The other thing I found wrong with this film is that there were no scenes at the matches. (This may have been caused by budget constraints.) And no one seems to talk much about football: they only talk about taking on Millwall's firm. This reinforces the popular misconception that football hooligans care nothing about football, and that they are not real fans. They ARE real fans. They DO care about their team and about football.Those minor faults aside, I found that the motivation for hooliganism - that it is fun and there is an adrenaline rush - was absolutely correct.Dudley Sutton was great as always, and the star of the show was Frank Harper. (Yes, there really are hooligans his age.) I found the practical jokes funny All in all I would recommend this film and have given it a high mark.If you are wondering what a 'sigh' is, as in Frank Harper saying to other characters, 'You SIGH!', I am reliably informed that it is short for 'Simple Simon.'",8,0,1,27 February 2007
The Last Emperor," A Unique Film
","This is a unique film because it is a unique story. Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi (also known as Henry Pu Yi) was the last emperor of China, who spent most of his early life as a puppet of others. He was then re-educated into an ordinary citizen (He worked as a gardener) in the People's Republic of China. The exciting thing from our point of view is that Henry Pu Yi wrote an autobiography ('From Emperor to Citizen'), and it is largely on this book that the film is based.The colourful pageantry in this film is superb - utterly unforgettable. Unfortunately the characterisation is not so well thought out. Only as the cheerful gardener does Pu Yi become anything approaching real - which may be the truth anyway. Otherwise the film becomes a series of historical events, which could well bamboozle anyone who does not know their history, since it is often not quite clear what is actually going on. Having said this, the tragedy of Pu Yi's life - and it was mostly tragedy - comes through well. As well as the end, that although stripped of title, riches, wife, etc, Pu Yi the gardener, the citizen of Red China, is now a free man, comes through well, too.One can find faults with this film - or to be more exact, what one would think are faults - but to list these would prove nothing. This film treads new ground. It is difficult to make, with three actors playing the same person. You have to watch this film, because it will improve the way you view other people, and you will see the tragedy of monarchy: that the monarch himself becomes little more than a specimen in a zoo - rather like the cricket kept in the jar underneath the throne. It will also whet your appetite to read 'From Emperor to Citizen' which contains much information that the film could not show.",9,17,18,11 September 2005
The Graduate," A Sixties Art Film
","This film faithfully follows the story of the novel by Charles Webb.During the mid to late sixties art films were being produced by Hollywood as the family stayed at home watching television. Some of these films were appalling: some were excellent. The Graduate is one of the latter group. So you go to university, you get your degree, and then? Your parents have a nice house with a swimming pool in the garden and can afford to give you a sports car for your birthday. What do you do with your life? Well, there is always the wife of your father's business partner...There are some memorable scenes such as the ones shot through the scuba gear; or when Benjamin, complete with shades and cigarette, takes Elaine to the strip club for their first date; or when the landlord tells Benjamin, whose face is all lathered up: 'I want you out of here!'Hoffman looks suitably dejected and confused; and Anne Bancroft turns in a good performance as Mrs Robinson. Also superb, in a bit part, is the guy who plays the desk clerk.On the downside, the hallmark of Charles Webb's works is that two people can be talking to one another and yet not communicating at all. This is missing from the film version, and the film is all the poorer because of it.",7,1,3,8 June 2005
Singin' in the Rain," It's Good but I Have One Proviso
","It would be a waste of time for me to reissue the same old superlatives about the musical numbers, so I will have this to say about the film that has not been said before.This film handles the transition from silent films to sound films. It has a very light-hearted attitude to this. It makes light of the fact that one leading lady can no longer function because she cannot sing and she speaks with a heavy regional accent. In reality, that woman was made redundant because of circumstances over which she had no control. And the termination of her career is about as funny as factory lay-offs. Such things, I am afraid were all too real. Jack Gilbert and Clara Bow were just two of the big stars dumped (there's no other word for it) by the Hollywood studios because their voices did not match their screen images. Emil Jannings and Vilma Banky were on the liners back to Europe because they struggled with their English. On this side of the Atlantic Mabel Poulton's star career was finished because she didn't talk posh enough for a gentile leading lady.So next time you hear Lina Lamont's thick accent, just remember the real people whom Lina Lamont represents.Not so funny now. Is it?",9,1,4,15 August 2005
Where Eagles Dare," absurd
","There is nothing technically wrong with this film. The effects, direction and acting performances are wasted on a story that stretches incredulity to beyond its limit.I have read the novel by Alastair MacLean, and one can see where the nonsense comes from. The novel is just as silly, and even has the squad going into a kneipe, order dark beers all round, and not arouse an iota of suspicion.If you really believe that the Germans are stupid, and that a squad of Allies can walk among them speaking German without their accents giving them away and then take on the entire German army and win without incurring a casualty to speak of, then this is just the film for you.If, however, you live in the real world, try watching something else.",4,16,36,17 June 2005
From Hell," We need another Jack the Ripper Movie like I need a hole in the head!
","Here we go again. Another Jack the Ripper book offering 'the final solution' comes out, another costume drama is released utilising its contents.Johnny Depp and Robbie Coltrane play real life cops Frederick Abberline and George Godley. Some odd accents here: Abberline has a very lower class accent for an 19th century inspector, Sussex man Godley speaks with a Scottish accent, and Long Liz Stride has hyper-sensitive hearing - being able to hear the sound of Bow Bells in her native Sweden.There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that Abberline took laudanum, although many people at the time did.We have a few sub plots involving a love affair between Abberline and Mary Kelly. We have the royal physician, the Duke of Clarence, the Freemasons.And what was it all about? Well, the Duke of Clarence married a Catholic girl in a Catholic church, and the girls who are being bumped off were in the church. The royal establishment are quite willing to use murder to cover the whole thing up. Sounds like a great idea, BUT, in those days Catholics had to be married twice: once in the Catholic Church, and again in an Anglican church. Why? Because the Catholic priests were not registered to marry legally; so, in the eyes of the law, a Catholic marriage had no legal standing. So we are talking about a film with a busted plot.That aside, the film is well shot, well atmospheric, and has appropriate music.Another problem is that the conditions the girls of Whitechapel are living in are too sanitised. In reality, these folk lived in utter squalor.How many more films are we going to get about Jack the Ripper?",3,3,6,26 June 2005
Hoosiers," Bring on the Clichés
","A coach who used to be good, but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hopers; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy who gets kicked around scoring the winning basket; the whole town against the coach (all except for the leading lady). It's the old story - right out of the British comic books, where a team of speccy geeks and fatties take on the Brazilians at soccer and win.This film, admittedly well put together, is full of these clichés. The only part I didn't predict was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. No reason was ever given. It seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy.Gene Hackman plays a locker room Popey Doyle. I am sure that an actor of Dennis Hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey.All in all, a film full of clichés that might have been done a lot better than it was.",4,2,12,11 June 2005
Titanic," A film that just can't win.
","Judging by some of the comments I have read about this film from others: I would say that the makers of this film cannot win. If they did not try to get the get the actual historical facts right, I would be complaining. If they do, then the scriptwriters get it in the neck for not being imaginative enough.For my part, I thought that the rich girl/poor Irishman story was wonderfully woven into the plot. Through the eyes of these two lovers, we are given a wonderful history lesson. We are introduced to the British caste system. We know that there were motor vehicles aboard, because they consummated their relationship in a car. When the ship is sunk we know that people were stuck in the water for far too long before the lifeboats came to rescue them; and, that, as a result, survivors at that stage were very rare. People who castigate all the literary devices used in this film should really lighten up: they are educational devices.There may be a few things about this film that are historically incorrect. For instance in the trick photography scene, where the captain's cup of Russian tea turns into the ship itself, there is smoke coming from all four funnels, even though everybody knows that one of the funnels - presumably the one that capsized - was a ventilator.The only bit of real criticism would be the music. It might have been better if the music were more timeless rather than the transitory voice of that Canadian singer whose name I have forgotten already.",10,2,4,4 June 2005
A Beautiful Mind," 'You're still talking to me, soldier!'
","So says Ed Harris, the MIB-style figment of Russell Crowe's imagination, when the latter screams: 'You're not real! You're not real!'This is a biopic of Nobel Prizewinner John F Nash, the mathematical genius who thought up the Nash Equilibrium, a major contribution to Game Theory. Poor Nash became afflicted with paranoia-schizophrenia, a condition he suffered from for about two decades until the symptoms abated.Cleverly, Ron Howard introduces us gradually to Nash's unreal world.The effects - such as an umbrella star constellation and magazine pages that light up etc, are wonderfully done.On the downside, the historical facts are played around with, when the facts would probably make a better story. (For example, the Equilibrium was not instantly accepted,unlike shown in the film.)Russell Crowe's performance is not particularly good. Jennifer Connelly's is much better as the just-too-good-to-be true girlfriend, then wife.At the pen-laying ceremony at the end, I was expecting Ed Harris to come and lay his pen, but I suppose that is just the way I look at the world.",7,0,2,11 September 2005
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Disgraceful Insult to the People who Died and Survived the Real Railway of Death
","It was my late father, who was a Far East Prisoner of War, which included a stint on the Kwai Bridge, who pointed out everything that was wrong with this film. And EVERYTHING is what is wrong with it.The bridge was bombed by the Americans, and that is why the two inner spans of the current bridge are of a different shape to the outer two. Note again, the bridge was bombed from the air, it was not blown up by Alec Guiness's dead body falling on the plunger.The notion that the Japanese would have been swayed by a British officer who sweated out a week in the cage is utter nonsense. My father said they would have beaten him till he submitted, and if he happened to die...well, too bad.My father also pointed out that the notion that the Japanese engineers didn't possess the know-how to build a railway bridge to cross the Kwai River, and had to rely on British engineers is utter drivel.If you can bear to insult those who died on the Railway of Death by watching this film, do not take the film seriously. It's rubbish!",1,42,83,17 June 2005
Braveheart," Fantasy not History
","Where shall I start? How about the French princess? She was only 12 years old at the time. And it is ludicrous that William Wallace was the father of Edward III. The Irish could not have changed sides at the Battle of Falkirk for the simple reason that they were not there. Edward I did not order his archers to shoot his own men in the back. They had already discharged their arrows before battle was joined. And that final wild charge by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn, when everybody knows that the Scots fought defensively arranged in schiltrons armed with long spears.And the English armour? Some of it looks more like birdman costumes. The archers have better helmets (basinets) than the infantry, while their bows are just branches with the bark stripped off and a piece of twine attached. Looks like the film makers reached the bottom of their purse with the archers, because they couldn't kit out the English army's Gascon crossbowmen, who are conspicuous by their absence on Falkirk field.The English may have been guilty of some atrocities, but prima nocte was not one of them.I could go on, but I won't.But I suppose Shakespeare took liberties with history too. And they call him a genius!Having said that, Mel Gibson makes a believable Scotsman, and James Cosmo is terrific as Campbell, and I liked the princess's oversexed maidservant. Also brilliant is Patrick McGoohan. His scene where he throws that guy out the window is the best bit of the film.I know this film stirred up a bit of Scottish nationalism. I don't have any problem with that, but if you are going to get worked up, get worked up over the facts.I should know: it's MY country. It belongs to ME.",2,35,75,10 June 2005
