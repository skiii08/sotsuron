The Hangover," Very Good not as many very funny jokes as i though there would be
",I though that the trailers should be something to go by which is true but the jokes in the trailer get kinda old by the time you have seen the trailer for like the 3rd time in which mike Tyson sings Phil Collins and punches the guy in the face and when he sees the tiger in the morning and when they get shocked by stun guns which were the main 3 bits in the story that i seemed to hate to see because i knew what was going to happen which isn't good when your seeing a comedy although there is funny bits with heather Graham and how red the groom is at the end when they find him sun burnt on the roof of the casino and there of course other funny bits but i expected it to be a kind of laugh a minute comedy,9,2,4,19 June 2009
Public Enemies," Very good, action scenes are cool and great actors
","i went to go see this on the first day it came out and i though it was very good and the action scenes looked very realisticbecause of the way it was filmed although some words johnny depp says i cant understand but i was really annoyed due to the fact that a week before i went to go see it i was watching high fidelity for the first time and in it, it reveals that john dillinger was shot outside a cinema i was very annoyed but the film was very cool some scenes dragged on a bit or got kind of boring but other than that it was an excellent film probably not the best film ever or the best film this year but still excellent i just wish it would have subtitles so i could understand some of the mumblings of johnny depp",8,1,2,1 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," why is this crap popular
","i have not seen new moon but my sisters have a they said they really enjoyed it which is why i KNOW it's crap because they think 2012 looks good and they have seen Twilight and i saw it a few weeks ago and it was awful usually in vampire movies there are staples people follow like vampires cant go out in the sun because they will burn to death but in Twilight if that idiot looking Edward goes out into the sun he SPARKLES gold what the hell what i find even more funnier is that my sisters said they didn't like twilight because it had terrible actors and it wasn't directed well but they enjoyed new moon, WHAT they are desperately confused they only see the film because they have read the books and if the first one was and the second is being directed by the guy who did Golden Compass maybe it isn't a good idea to see it because you will know it's crap my friend is going to see it but in his defence he said he couldn't care less about the film because he is going with a load of girls. The only thing i agree on with my sisters is that the actors are terrible Kristin Stewart throughout the film keeps talking about death and cold things and then Edward and i just wished her character had died in the movie because that probably would have cheered her up and Edward is even worse because he is as spaced out as a drug addict and his eyes are always wide as if he is shocked and the baseball scene in Twilight was horrible a lot of CGI and crap actors.",2,5,9,22 November 2009
Paranormal Activity," Not That Scary As The Trailer Shows
","i watched the film with my friends and we were laughing through most of the Movie because it was just funny, they leave the door open, the girl doesn't realise she is being dragged off until the 'beast' pulls her on the floor and she hurts herself. The only people that screamed in the cinema and the cinema at that showing was basically full and the only people who screamed were 4 girls on the very back row.It looks real but at the same time if i was her boyfriend i would have left her for dead obviously the demon isn't going to if it is after HER if he leaves it might lessen the beasts attacks and the boyfriend as stupid as he is decides to 'borrow' a Ouija board and then they go out and LEAVE it wow real smart I'm glad he died at the end i don't care that the demon possessed her and I'm weirded out by the fact that she stared at him for so long while he lay asleep i don't know how this shocked America so much but i don't think it will shock many people in Britain definitely not me and my friends who are (some of us) horror fans",5,0,0,28 November 2009
The Dark Knight," Send me to Gotham and lock me up in Arkham
",brilliant i have seen batman begins and though that was the best batman film but i suppose i have been proved wrong heath ledger is amazing i love how he makes that pencil disappear you will have to watch that and i have seen godfather and i am only able to watch it for say half an hour because it is so boring and dull and old i think the dark knight deserves 1# spot on the top 250 list its time for a film to take that prize for being brilliant and people bash the dark knight because heath ledger died after it finished and they said that they were using it as publicity those people who liked heath ledger enough to see his last piece of work would have seen it anyway if he had been alive and most people went to see it because they wanted to see if Mr Nolan could follow up batman begins and i think he did an amazing job with it and it is not yet seen whether there will be a third but well have to see if he wants to try and break more box office records I'm sure that it could be done,10,2,5,26 July 2008
The Happening," SO BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING don't go see it
",i looked at the trailer and though wow that looks like it could be a really good movie and its by the director of the sixth sense and unbreakable (thankfully i had not seen lady in the water although i had heard it was meant to be bad) and when i actually saw the happening i though god he really is not building up the suspense enough to make me scared i actually laughed at the part where all the bodies start falling of the building its just stupid because you think shouldn't they run not just stand there and look at all the bodies falling i also hate that it only happens in America it seems and then at the end it moves to Italy and although millions of people must have been killed because they must have been travelling in groups mainly just three months later everything thing seemed to go back to normal and all the millions of people who died suddenly seem to reappear and no one seems to be scared at all that the same infection could happen again,1,3,8,18 June 2008
Moon," Brilliant low budget sci-fi thriller
","I had to travel from cheadle to Manchester just to see this film but id say it was worth it, it was amazing Sam Rockwell is a brilliant actor and Duncan Jones should be getting more work as a director now that this film is out the effects although low budget looked better than some of the crap CGI effects they put in most films now and this films should also be the re-start of a few low budget sci-fi movies that hopefully be released over the next couple of years to give new directors a chance at being famous and hopefully making good films the only bad thing is that its pretty easy to see that they clone the guy before you see the end but its still a great movie all the same",9,11,20,1 August 2009
