The Longest Yard," Better than Waterboy, but still unremarkable
","Paul Crewe (Chris Sandler) is a former American Football Player who fell from grace because of cheating. After violating a parole order, he is sent to jail, to one of the most brutal and most corrupt prisons which would not be found in any government or UN chart. After taking a few beatings from the guards, Crewe announced his plan that would bail him out of prison: He'll form a team made of Convicts that will rival the Guards. With the help of a Con known only as Caretaker (Chris Rock), He sets up a team that is totally unskilled, unfit, and inexperienced. But with the help of former Am. Football player Nate Scarabourgh, and a Con Basketball squad led by Nelly, this ragtag team becomes a force to be reckoned with.Unsurprisingly, Adam Sandler is recognised for creating films that audiences love and critics tend to dislike. This formula is still intact. It was a nice thing to include Burt Reynolds--who played the main part in the 1974 original-- in the cast, which gives the film some style and substance. Sandler and Rock also give impressions with their adequate sense of humour that fit the movie perfectly well. Rapper and 'Bad Boys' star Nelly also contributes to the franchise as a the captain of an unofficial Basketball team who joins Sandler's cause, and his scenes are some of the best and the funniest of the movie.But there are several drawbacks: the movie is so full of clichÃ©s that people tend to feel a bit frustrated. The slow motion Rap walk of Nelly's squad and the transsexual cheer-leaders are just a few examples. The supporting characters are basically flat and one dimensional and are there just to serve the leads' purposes of making a Dream team. The play scenes are usually fun, but they are so commonplace--and also so aggressive-- that you feel like you're watching a BMW or Toyota commercial.All in all, this movie is better (and currently more successful) than the critically-unacclaimed Waterboy (which was a surprise hit) and improves on some that movie's flaws. The relentlessly fast pace and rush, as well as the Sandler-Rock-Reynolds trio make this movie stand out from your average sports comedy. I'm satisfied with one viewing of this film (I saw it in the US, since it won't hit the UK until October 2005).**1/2 out of ****",6,0,2,5 June 2005
Madagascar," it's amusing, but not satisfying
","Madagascar is an attempt to re/create the magic of Toy Story-- this Christmas season marks the 10th anniversary of that movie's release--, and attempts to do it with the casting of some of the wittiest and in-demand stars, including Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, that pull of their usual gags and fast-paced jokes {but it still works}. No offence,although this movie guarantees a few laughs which will make you break a dozen courtesy rules, it is seriously miscast and the story just doesn't make any real sense.Here are a few examples:1- How would a Zebra, which stands on four legs, would build a bloody house in 5 bloody minutes? Tom Hanks on two legs could not do that in 'Cast away'2- There are hardly any human characters that have any importance. Apart from the annoying police officers and a Central Park lady announcing the withdrawal of the animals to the wild. Do they serve any purpose? 3- The acting here is measured by the celebrity status of the actors themselves rather than their ability to play the part well. Robin Williams would've done a better job playing the Zebra than Chris Rock since he learned some Drama lessons in his career. Why not, even Hayden Christensen could play the leading role better than the black comedian!There are more, but I shan't get to them to avoid disappointing the kids and my nephew back at home, who plans to watch it when it commes out on 15 July.But there are advantages: The movie is, by no means, boring and it does guarantee a good time and is a good choice to send your children to the movies, due to a shortage of family films this summer {Episode III and the Longest Yard as well as other releases are rated PG-13 in the US or 12A here} and the 'Move it, Move it' mock video in the film is definitely an amusing scene for people of my generation and above.In the end, this Movie is Better than the mediocre {but nevertheless successful} Shark Tale and the Longest Yard {which came out on the same day as this one}, but, like those two movies, this one is also burdened by an incoherent screenplay, lack of a real plot, and a cast that is inappropriate to perform the emotional scenes.Lesson Number One, Children: DO NOT hire Chris Rock or Ben Stiller to do Drama scenes!",6,0,2,30 May 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," Brilliant film!
","Bridget Jones is not only one of the best date films of all time, it-s a work of art. To tell you the truth, it's better than most of the chick flicks I often watch with my girlfriend. I've read the book so I know the plot {again, many scenes have been omitted and others, like the fight scene, added in to give the movie some feel}.The movie is about a modern-day young woman living in London... actually, about a woman in her early 30s... with no serious relationship, unmarried, overweight-- her weight often resembles that of a man's--, and someone who simply spits out whatever she thinks about, regardless of the consequences. But this year is the year in which she finally experiences love, and also ends up in a dilemma: She must chose between her charming boss {superb performance by Hugh Grant}, and the far more reserved barrister Mark Darcy {Colin Firth give an equally great performance}.Although I'm disappointed by the fact that many scenes have been omitted from the book-- those who didn't read the book I shan't reveal them--, This is nevertheless a movie with a great plot, performances and charm.All of the three leads steal the show in his/her own way. Zellweger--being an American-- seemed an unlikely bird to play a typically British character, but She makes it very believable that those who never heard-- I knew from watching JERRY MAGUIRE years before-- of her thought she was a Brit herself. I couldn't imagine anyone playing Bridget, not even Winslet, who was one of the leading bets-- who almost got the part but was dropped because she was too young, 24 at the time, for the role--. Hugh Grant gives charisma to the naughty Daniel Cleaver, and sidesteps his usual characters. Colin Firth gives a comeback to familiar ground-- I remember watching PRIDE and PREJUDICE in 1995, in which he became a star in the UK-- as the solicitor Mark Darcy with no problems at all.For anyone who plans to strike a relationship or is in one already, this a perfect film to put and it is More than just a 'date movie' or 'chick flick'. TO end it, it is by far one of my favourite films that is amusing all the way.",8,1,2,24 May 2005
Independence Day," Crude, but highly entertaining summer film
","A series of large alien spaceships move to planet Earth and destroy the largest cities of the world. After the invasion, Earth, led by the United States, has no choice but to fight back. their first attempts failed, but the presence a computer virus renews their hope for survival as the countdown for 4 July-- US Independence Day-- begins.Super-lick, witty sci-fi movie pulls out all stops. The all-too-familiar Alien Invasion plot is revived with a series of twists thanks to the eye-popping, Award-winning special effects (the spaceships are flawless!). The 3 leading characters steal the show and make the movie fluid and likable. David Arnold's unforgettable and sweeping score also contributes positively to the film's atmosphere (leading to nominations in a number of institutions). Randy Quaid is hilarious as the alcoholic Vietnam vet volunteering in the fight against the invaders. It also manages to sidestep Sci-fi clichès since there is NO single leading character that show the way to battle the Aliens.But there are flaws as well: the human stories are very dumb and sometimes nonsensical; the movie is overlong and takes a while to get started, and the over-the-top patriotism in this movie sometimes gives the movie a slightly cartoonish feel. There is a high number of needlessly stupid and flat supporting characters.Despite of that, the movie became the most successful movie of 1996, earning more than $300 million in the US and over $500 million worldwide. A must for sci-fi fans. *** stars/****",7,0,1,11 June 2005
Batman Begins," Holy spectacular recovery, Batman!
","Just like it happened in Episode III, I entered the film theatre with caution, since I vividly remember the diastrous Batman & Robin 8 years ago which put the franchise on life support for such a long time. I have heard about the great reviews it got, but I never believed it until I saw the movie. (I saw it the day it came out in the UK, on 16 June).And, like Episode III, this movie truly blew me away. The critics are there for a good reason and I believe they're correct. Batman Begins is a TRULY great film. It has a very good story that is comprehensible and clear to everyone, not just fans of the comic book (90% of the public, most of whom have not read the comic strips, applauded as the credits rolled). The movie has a dark theme, but is coherent and logical, in contrast with the nearly black-and-white Batman Returns and the showy, neon-filled Schumacher pics. The cast is perfect, with the highly versatile Christian Bale was born for this role, and is the best Bruce Wayne/Batman since Michael Keaton, showing the two sides of the person in equal amounts. Liam Neeson shines in a familiar role as his mentor and trainer and the rest of the supporting cast make characters that are realistic and multidimensional. The special effects are great, and they serve justice to a juicy storyline. The Batmobile (some assume to be the prototype of the black car in 1989) is a wow and its scenes are worth a watch. Christopher Nolan is surely made to direct this film, and does a better than even Burton in making the movie dark, realistic, and also appealing. And YES, the hero has a bigger spotlight than the villains, and Bruce Wayne is portrayed interestingly in the same style of the Spiderman films.The only two things that make this movie short of being flawless is the extreme close-ups of some fight scenes (you can't tell who's hitting whom or what) and fans of the original series complain that there are more villains in this movie than the previous films and none of them, save Ducard and the Scarecrow, have much screen time, which might cause some confusion.Despite the fact that you won't see the Batsuit until about an hour after the film starts, it is well worth the wait. The 140 minutes of the film will never let you out of your seat, not even for a single moment. To make things short, it is the best Batman film of all time, even better than the 1989 original.",9,0,0,21 June 2005
The Dark Knight," The best Batman movie EVER made.
","Some time has passed by since the events of the last movie; the Batman (Christian Bale) is taking care of business as usual, scoring a feat by capturing The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). Meanwhile, Gotham City has fallen to a recent, unprecedented crime wave by a group of men disguised in clown masks. Following a successful robbery at the bank in broad daylight--outside of Batman's working hours--, one of the disguised double-crosses his partners and reveals himself: no alias, no name, it's the JOKER (Heath Ledger), a psychotic criminal who takes delight not in killing his victims, but rather spreading fear through his 'jokes'. A game of cat-and-mouse ensues, in which the Joker is clearly leading, planning and improvising virtually every detail in ways that would impress even the most outstanding General, planning even his capture and his escape from prison. Batman, Commissioner Gordon, Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent, the Police as well as the Mob become, in one way or another, pawn's to the Joker's vicious game.I came into the movie theatre with already high expectations. After watching Batman Begins 3 years ago, which revitalised a franchise that was on life support since 1997, I had a firm conviction that we're in perfectly good hands with this director. My convictions turn out correct. This movie makes everything that made 'Begins' a masterpiece such as shrewd storytelling (this movie is more like a crime saga than a 'Batman' movie), and solid performances from the entire cast. Oh Yes, Heath Ledger's performances as the Joker is as good as everyone says, and actually even better; he did everything that made the Romero (1960's) and Nicholson (1989's) Jokers great and surpassed them. Aaron Eckhart breaks new ground as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, an unusual role for a 'comedic' actor. Oh yes, the fight scenes are improved and the choppy editing of its predecessor is gone.There is nothing I can complain about the movie that did not work,not even its length. Sure the movie is 152 minutes --the longest Batman film--, but it doesn't slow down for a moment. PS= Ledger, you will be dearly missed!",10,2,5,20 July 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Good Chemistry in an exaggerated all-star vehicle
","Upgraded as of 4 August 2008:Brad Pitt plays Mr. Smith, a professional engineer who is apparently happily married with his wife Jane for 5 (or 6) years and live in a lavish house in a New York suburb. But things are not always what they seem. Both are first-class killers who pull of their jobs and keep them in secret... even from each other. Until the moment comes when the two, who come from rival organisations, end up facing... each other and... they fall into a trap.Surprusingly good all-star vehicle in which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt show off their chemistry to the full, which is so close to real life (even though they denied it at first). The two make very good performances and really light up the scene with their witty quarrels and word-trading. Vince Vaughn is a nice addition to the film as he adds more to its saving grace of humour. Doug Liman creates some very good action sequences, without the cliché Matrix-like shots and keeps the movie with the right pace.However, the film becomes more over-the-top and exaggerated towards the end (where the two Smiths take out an entire elite squad in a supermarket a lá Matrix) and moves on to a corny and abrupt conclusion. Also, the lack of a central villain (or villains, since there has been an alliance between the two companies to pick off the Smiths) cripples the somewhat crude screenplay, all this undermining an otherwise first-rate action-comedy film.But the movie doesn't hesitate to get started, and the two leads will make this an adequate date film.**1/2 out of **** stars",6,1,6,10 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Great summer blockbuster like ID4
","War of the Worlds has been a very popular franchise since its release as a book in 1898, since it became one of the pioneers of what is now known as Science Fiction. It also served as an inspiration for countless films, such as Star Wars and Independence Day. All 'War of the Worlds' movies, radio shows, ans so forth have been widely popular and successful, and this movie is no exception.Set in modern-day New York, Tom Cruise plays Ray, a divorced, working-class father who is rarely there with his children, Rachel and Robbie. but when a series of surrealistic disasters and earthquakes have begun to take shape, the trio is forced to move away from the suburb as quiclky as possible as massive tripods begin to surface from underneath the pavement cracks.Sharp and fast-paced adaptation of the H.G Well's novel gives a franchise a more modern face-lift. Director Steven Spielberg gives some terrific scenes which will keep people on the edge of their seat (I don't remember anyone walking out on the movie, not even for the bathroom), which give the movie a psychologically scary feel, without being explicit. The film's special effects are amazing, and they not obstruct the film's story line, in contrast with the many effects-laden summer blockbusters of today. All of the actors make rather great performances-- for a sci-fi film--, and that includes Tom Cruise, who is always been viewed more on his good looks and financial shrewdness than for his acting skills. Dakota Fanning shines in her role as his daughter, and plays an essential part in the film's storyline. Tim Robbins make a good, although brief, appearance in the film as a former doctor gone mad. John William's music is as good as ever, and gives the movie the atmosphere it tries to characterise, and Spielberg's direction make this movie a more realistic 'what if' disaster scenario than ID4.But there are still a number of flaws: like ID4, it is burdened by having relatively dumb human stories, flat and one-dimensional supporting characters, as well as for being over-focused on Ray and his family. The movie ends rather abruptly for a big-budget picture (117 mins. long), and purists will complain about its differences with the book (it doesn't tell where these aliens come from), and it slows down around halfway, where the trio must face a cat-and-mouse game with the aliens, and a ship's searchlight a la 1953 version.Nevertheless, War of the Worlds is a fun movie, and you'll never be bored for not even a single minute of it. It's run-time is rather short than what most people expected, but it is worth 1 hour and 57 minutes of your time.*** out of ****",7,2,6,2 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of George Lucas
","I was one of the lucky ones to see on opening night in Leceister Square and I was willing to spend 250 quid or so for the ticket (my girlfriend also paid for hers).We proceeded with caution. After watching the mediocre Episodes I and II, I was fearful of how this one would turn out to be. I am a big fan of the saga but the previous two outings were slightly icky for my taste. The special effects were the main star, and the somewhat shallow plot and wooden acting (especially from the younger actors Christensen and Portman). And JAR JAR BINKS! I hated that bugger SO MUCH that I dreamt of stabbing him with my lightsabre! Little did we know that this film was at last the one we've been waiting for! We came out with awe that this movie was easily the best of the prequels and also unseats Return of the Jedi as the third-best of the two sagas.There are many reasons: the special effects are more developed, but also more contributing to the story line instead of being obstrusive, Hayden Christensen is more comfortable with his character and you can see it there (there's still a degree of thickness, particularly in the romance subplot, but such moments are rare), and, for the first time since Jedi, there's a real plot that shows the way. The first 20 mins, which are action-packed, are just a sweet and vital introduction for a film whose tone rapidly gets darker, and this feeling is what makes it interesting (it has a host of references from Greek tragedies like the Oedipus trilogy, among other things). The veterans Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee gives the movie more colour with their evil revelations (although the latter one is in it only briefly...), Samuel L. Jackson, a Star Wars fan himself, makes a great job as Mace Windu as he makes the character meet his fate as a hero. Ewan McGregor makes a very believable performance as a wiser and more experienced Obi-Wan this time (remember how he played the young man in Episode I?). I admit, Hayden Christensen has also done a very good job as the more mature Anakin whose insecurities promote his temptation to go to the Dark Side. The movie has a very strong emotional pull that fits the standard of movies like the Godfather, and in my case, I almost ended up crying after the film's tragic conclusion.The actions are well-staged and imaginative, and give the story movement and excitement (the Skywalker-Kenobi final fight at the volcanic planet Mustafar is a wow!). I must warn, especially the children, that this film is EXPLICIT and GRAPHIC in comparison with the rest, but its rating-- whether be PG-13 in the US, 12A here, M in Australia, FSK-12 in Germany-- makes the movie even MORE INTERESTING. The dialogue on some scenes-- particularly the romance sub-plot-- needs improvement, but again, it's nowhere as near as corny as the Phantom nor Attack and these two flaws-- the first being Natalie's mediocre acting-- are more like observations than real criticisms, and they are of no consequence.People either love it or hate, but this movie will remain as the the best movie of the saga since the Empire Strikes Back. And it's going to be the undisputed winner of the summer season and of the year. It's just a matter of time of who'll reach second and third. The series ends with a dark tone, but also with a bang! George Lucas finally enacts his Revenge on the critics. The Force is strong with this one.***1/2 (out of ****)",9,6,10,20 May 2005
Fantastic Four," Appealing, but dumb comic-book yarn
","Following the recent wave of comic book films that began with 1978's Superman, Fantastic Four is another product of this fad. It is about a group of scientists going on an experimental voyage, which is standing in the way of a cosmic radiation storm. A few days after the accident, all of them discover that they have powers. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), the leader, has the ability to stretch his body. Sue Storm, has the ability to be invisible (Invisible Woman), Johnny Storm becomes the Flame, and Ben Grimm evolves into a muscular, rock-like creature knows ans the Thing. Together, they have to unite in order to combat Doctor DOOM, who, having witnessed the blast, becomes driven by greed as he discovers his ability to absorb electricity and metals.The movie is entertaining, with very good special effects, adequate doses of humour, and likable lead characters. The action sequences are well-placed and creative. But it is rather unoriginal by anyone's standard, a screenplay that borrows heavily from other previous Marvel films, and is rather dumb in content. This summer blockbuster leaves hardly anything to think about afterwards.The movie will never bore audiences and manages to stand out a bit from other contemporary releases. Summer 2005 has become a season where dark, violent action movies movies have become predominant-- i.e, Revenge of the Sith, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds--, .But nevertheless it lacks the authenticity of either such co-horts as well as previous comic book movies like the X-Men and Spiderman. Let's hope its sequel improves most of this movie's mistakes.** out of ****",5,0,1,23 July 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Fetchez la vache
","I also recommend anyone to see this film, otherwise, I will 'fetchez la vache', which is among my favourite lines of the movie. I saw it first when I was a kid but I didn't really get it-- obviously, you don't understand what social critique and mockery are when you're 9 years old. But when I saw it again recently, I just bursted out with laughter, from the deliberate errors in the opening credits to the French Guards to the killer rabbit and so forth. For 90 minutes, Me and my flatmate laughed out so loudly that Sarah, one of our neighbours, almost called the police on us-- I didn't see any reason why she should. She didn't do it because she eventually went along and laughed out loud, too! I dated her for that 3 days later!",Null,13,19,4 December 2004
