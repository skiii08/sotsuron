The Blair Witch Project," quality!
","I have just seen Blair Witch and heard all the hype for months on end (as it has just been released in Australia), yet I was still very much impressed.For those of you complaining about a 'low budget film' and 'poor cinematography', I have these comments... I think you have totally missed the point with this film.  If you don't believe that good art can be made without mega-budgets then you cannot fully appreciate art... many painters, writers, and musicians have created amazing art since the beginning of time in this manner (without state of the art resources)... if you think ****** **** is preferable to a poor, undiscovered yet talented musician creating real and challenging music or art, then I can understand your comments. But for me, give me Tom Waits, give me Stereolab, give me Rembrandt or Vincent Gallo - artists who don't need (or didn't have) fame and money...",8,0,0,12 December 1999
Life Is Beautiful," not necessary
","I found this film to be an average an unneeded look at World War II.  What a unique idea - let's do a film on the holocaust of World War II - it was unoriginal, unrealistic and draining.I love most of Roberto's earlier films like Down By Law and I was wanting to enjoy this, but I couldn't.",3,2,5,22 August 1999
