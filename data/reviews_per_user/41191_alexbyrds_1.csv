Requiem for a Dream," Fake movie, fake life
","Two handsome guys waste their lives with dope and heroin and many other drugs, a young beautiful girl becomes a dirty slut, a lonely mother becomes an amphetamine addict whose only perspective is to survive in some electric impulses on a tv screen ???? This is the falsest movie on addictions and drugs ever made, but it's easy to understand why young people are appreciating it so much.",1,4,11,4 December 2000
