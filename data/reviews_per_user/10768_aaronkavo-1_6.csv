National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Not as good as the first one but still very good
","The first National Treasure set the bar for adventure films. The sequel is not as good but is very close. Both movies contain historical monuments as well as learning. Now this itself may confuse younger kids if your planing to bring them. This time around it focuses on the death of Abraham Lincoln. This time Mitch Wilkinson (played by Ed Harris) is trying to convince everyone than Ben Gates' (played by Nicolas Cage) great-great grandfather hired John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Both Ben and his father are annoyed. For some reason Abigail Chase (played by Diane Kriger) has broken up with Ben(there is a reason but I won't spoil it). Riley Poole (played by Justin Bartha) has written a book about what happened in the first movie. In case you haven't seen it, Riley is still very funny as before. I don't wanna give away anymore of the movie but it's very good and awesome go see and this action movie is up there with The Goonies, Radiers of the Lost Ark and the original movie. Go see it and enjoy.",9,0,4,15 February 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie was nice!...NOT!
","Okay I'm all for comedy. I loved Ali G. But this is stupid. When a lot of people said ' This movie is awesome' '10/10' 'I couldn't stop laughing' 'Best movie ever' etc... I thought 'Wow, I've gotta see this!' After 20 minutes into the movie well... ever have a hangover and there's someone there playing the drums? That's better than Borat! If I didn't see Epic Movie I'd say this is the worst movie I ever saw. You know what? This can't even be called a movie. You go to the movies to be entertained not bored. Borat should be called 'Boring' ! I know he got a lot of awards for this piece of you know what but he didn't earn them. And I know a lot of people (mainly Sacha) is going to deny this, but I say it was scripted.",1,2,6,12 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," I liked it
",Well first of all I'm glad they gave J.K Simmons and Bruce Campbell more time on screen. I also liked they way the mixed scary scenes and comedy into the movie. Venom's might be the scariest thing in this movie. Although I'm sad Venom only came at the end the good thing about that is he didn't scream all over the movie. There is a reason they put Sandman in this movie but I won't spoil it. The casting was great. I was unsure about Topher Grace playing Eddie Brock/Venom because I thought he'd be to much like Eric from That 70's Show but after 2 minutes you forget it's him. One problem about this movie is there is not that much Spidey it's more about Peter and MJ's relationship that being said it's over two hours so your going to get what you came for. Anyway the movie's great make sure you see it.,9,0,0,21 May 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," To much talking not enough action. Just read this if you like this thing.
","Whoever gives this movie a 10/10 are fan boys. Now you to action movies for action not talking. And when action starts to happen it ends as soon as it starts. Whoever say's Harry Potter ripped of this is talking BS. Harry Potter is much better than this. Of course you wan't a plot but Peter Jackson (Who's work I hate) drags the plot out for 3 hours. That's not so bad but the plot is this ring is awesome we have to destroy it end of story. But Peter said 'No, that's not good enough. Let's make a crap movie and make everybody thing it's great a make millions so much that if anyone says it's bad they'll get attacked by fan boy's. And that's what happened to me. I made a comment saying how made it was and a group of mindless zombies who liked this movie was all like 'Hey your stupid' etc... I was giving my opinion but this director who spends more time on special effects than a story has geeks and nerds attacking me. This rating is a fair one and you know it.",1,2,6,27 September 2007
Back to the Future," Why didn't I write a review on this before?
","Back to the Future is one of the best movies of the 80's. One thing I should mention before I write my review, when you watch this movie today, it's weird to see Michael J. Fox jumping around like a mad man while today he suffer's from Parkinson. Just something I thought I should mention. Anyway, for the movie. Marty McFly is the first character you see (well his feet). He hooks a guitar up to an app and blow's him away. Then he get's a call from the Doc telling him about his new invention. Even if you only know the plot and this is your first time watching the movie, you basically know what the invention is. You get some back story about Marty, his family and his town, Hill Valley. When you get to see Doc, you sorta know what's coming next. But then he get's killed by terrorists who chase Marty around the JC Penny's parking lot. After that where in 1955. You get to see George McFly in Lou's café and I will let you see the rest. Overall, this movie has a great mix of comedy, drama, suspense and action. It's also good to see cursing in kid's movie. Yay! Buy it if you can. Hell, two week's ago I got the entire trilogy for 12! See ya next time!",10,2,4,14 July 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Go see this.
",The Simpsons have been around now for about 20 something years now and the TV show has gone downhill a little but the movie makes up for that. Homer and Bart have most screen time in this movie. But before I talk anymore about the movie I wanna talk about the rating. This movie is rated PG by the IFCO. I have to say that is a fair rating. Sure there's somethings in this like Bart's private area and Otto smoking a bong but beyond that it only should get a PG rating. The movie gets a little boring when the Simpsons move to Alaska but after and before that it's great. Go see it if you like The Simpsons but if not don't bother. I gave this a 9/10 it's very good.,9,0,1,28 August 2007
