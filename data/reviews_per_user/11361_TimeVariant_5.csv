The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great message in a fairly good package
","Perhaps this movie appeals only to some, and perhaps only at certain times in your life. Are you down and out? Need to get back to what you once were? Then there may be a message here for you. It could be that I am in a cynical phase, but I just saw 'There Will Be Blood' and was not blown away. A linear progression toward an anticlimactic finish. Here too there was no magical revelation in one powerful scene, and certainly no real golf lessons. But I did get something deep out of it. The blurb suggests it will make the spirit soar. Your mileage may vary, but expect true inspiration as a minimum. If it doesn't make you feel, it will make you think. On the plus side, Redford has created beautiful cinema with this golf-centered and Depression-era story. Anyway, I'm done with watching it, Charlize trying to re-ignite passion for an old flame, to profess her love. But I wonder still if that's all there was, or how it all fits in ...",9,0,1,31 December 2008
Lion," Scores 10 on the tearjerker scale
","Hugely impressive movie that connects you to your innermost emotions with a simple yet heart-wrenching story. Sunny Pawar definitely deserves a Best Actor award, with Priyanka Bose coming in a close second. Surprised to find that Dev Patel's role was more limited than expected, and also that his stellar performance occasionally lacks expressed emotion. The long wait to go back home is definitely worth it.",9,0,2,28 April 2017
The Dark Knight," Good acting, but film does not live up to expectations
","Christian Bale does a good job as Batman. All the other actors from the previous films are here too, and live up to what I expected. Heath Ledger's performance is simply superb. And yet, if you've seen the other Batman movies, this one seems like more of the same and the scenes are almost repetitive after a while. Batman Begins? Now that was great. I'm still puzzling over this movie's super-high user rating. Each actor does a good job, but the story is ultimately unconvincing. There are pieces of Bond. There is the touch of Superman. You've seen the vehicles. The flying. The awed citizens of Gotham.But what is unique in this story? What sets it apart to be both memorable and new? Hard to say.My explanation for all the hype? Batman's large following of true believers. So if you're a wide-eyed kid, or under-30 anyway, have your fantasy!",7,4,8,31 January 2009
Les Mis√©rables," Great Story, Good movie, Ho-hum singing
",The title says it all! The only thing to add is that as a movie it's good but since the 'musical' part of it is unconvincing it's about an hour longer than it should be.Don't expect Chicago or the Sound of Music!I have to admit that I haven't compared this to the old (1998?) version of Les Miserables (starring Uma Thurman?) so I will have to do so some day and update this review when I do.The good thing is that it has motivated me to go read some more about the French revolution - when did all the kings come and go exactly? How much of what is shown here is historically accurate?,7,1,3,26 December 2012
The Nice Guys," Great fun!
","Ryan Gosling and his on-screen daughter Angourie Rice give great performances, while Russell Crowe delivers at least the minimum we expect from such a great star.Let me correct or rather add to what I just said: this is the first time I've seen Angourie Rice in a movie, and as you might think I had no expectations from a young person acting beside two big names, and therefore her brilliant work was all the more impressive - will definitely be looking for more movies from her.Having lived in LA in 1978 I can say that this period piece is pretty accurate. The movie builds up an engaging story full of action, with some erotic scenes - only reservation is that some editing would have helped, especially towards the end.",7,2,5,4 September 2016
