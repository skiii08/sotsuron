Spartacus," Good movie which could need an update
","Spartacus is a movie with a good and interesting story. I think the main theme in the movie is the 'fight for freedom'. Spartacus was born as a slave, but he dreams about being free.It is impressive with all the soldiers in this movie, it is before the time of computer technology, and the battles seem real.A problem with the movie is that some of the scenes are made in a studio, and it looks very fake. I don't understand why they have made these outdoor scenes inside a studio. Also other scenes in this movie look very fake, and I think that Spartacus loses one rating here.The overall impression is 7/10 - I think it would get 8/10 or maybe even 9/10 if Hollywood made a new updated version of the movie.",7,4,12,8 January 2002
Training Day," How could this movie be interesting?
","I watched this movie, and how could it get 7.2?'Training Day' was boring from the first minute, and the next 119 minutes were just as boring as the first. There wasn't a real plot in this horrible movie, and I can't find any interesting angles in 'Training Day'.Watch this movie if you like to get bored, but I can't recommend this. I will rate this movie 4/10.",4,26,53,30 December 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Highly overrated
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has been regarded as the best film this summer in the US, and many IMDb users have praised the return of the pirate genre.With this in mind I went to the cinema and watched this movie, and once again I disagree with the IMDb users and possibly also a lot of critics. The story had a lot of potential with ghost pirates and stuff like that, it is a pirate movie and you can accept things like this, but the movie fails to impress me for several reasons.First of all the cast was not chosen wisely. Johnny Depp is without doubt a great actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for an old pirate. He does not look old, but according to the story he should have been captain on the same ship where Geoffrey Rush was chief officer. The rest of the cast was chosen more wisely, but I never liked Orlando Bloom's character either.One thing that really annoyed me was that almost every character should be funny, it was very annoying and at some points unbearable to watch. First we have some stupid English soldiers, later Johnny Depp has to be funny, and we also have to watch some funny ghost pirates all the time. Suddenly all characters have to be funny, and the ghost pirates are just comic sidekicks in this movie, they are not scary at all. The idea to make the English soldiers stupid has also been seen so many times before, and I really dislike it.If that was all of it, then I maybe would not be that grumpy, but that was not all of it. The whole idea of immortal pirates was actually not good even though I accept stuff like that in this pirate adventure genre. I can ask a simple question, why do people take a fight against these immortal pirates? There is absolutely no point in doing that because the outcome has already been decided. Am I the only one who is asking these simple questions? Hopefully I am not.After having criticised the movie I also have to point out some of the good sides. The movie is well done in both sound and picture. The effects are good and the ships can fascinate most people. Anyway, the movie does not deserve a good rating, because the plot is too thin and all scenes have to be fun, which is a disaster in a 143 minute movie. Beautiful scenes and a few laughs however make this an acceptable picture, which should not be treated as an memorable movie of year 2003. - Rating: 6/10.",6,1,2,16 September 2003
12 Angry Men," This movie is excellent build
","I must say that this movie is really well written, directed and performed.The movie starts with evidence that looks like a clear case, but one juror is not sure. It would be wrong, if I said more about the story, but it develops in a very interesting way.Each of the jurors have their reasons for finding the accused guilty or not guilty. You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons. This is perfect character building, it was really made in an impressive way.The concept is very simple, 12 men discussing a case in a room. It does not sound interesting, but it for sure is. The actors perform excellently, each actor creates an unique character, it is simply just amazing to watch their discussions. I think it would be unfair to mention one actor, because all of them do a fantastic performance.You could say that it does not require a good director to create such a simple movie, but that is very wrong. Director Sidney Lumet really understood how to focus on the right discussions at the right time, he builds the characters with the camera, he did an excellent job.'12 Angry Men' is an impressive movie. I have rated 454 movies, and only 11 movies have been rated 9/10 or above, and this is one of them. I will rate it 9/10, it's one of the best of all time.",9,2,3,7 April 2003
Troy," An acceptable movie with some wasted potential
","Troy is extremely loosely based on Homer's writings, so do not expect a movie based on the book. Instead Hollywood have made a screenplay the Hollywood way, and I am so lucky that I have not read the book, so I was not disappointed about the characters.The movie has a huge budget and I am sure that the producers expected to make an epic movie like Spartacus, Ben-Hur or Patton, but they failed to succeed on this level.An epic movie needs to be big in every sense, and not all directors have understood what makes a big movie big. Battle scenes with huge armies are often a good way to make the movie big, and Petersen understood this very well. You can enjoy the visual part of the battle scenes, I can only say that the battle scenes are impressive.An epic movie should also have a good story, and this is one of the weak points in this movie. I am sure the story has a lot of potential, but it does not work that well in the movie. It is maybe because the movie is too short with less than 3 hours. Ben-Hur is almost 4 hours long, and I miss 30 minutes or more of Troy. Some scenes were simply too short, which often is a bad habit for modern cinema.The casting should also be right in an epic, and I am not sure that the choice of Brad Pitt was right. He would be credible, if Achilles was presented as a god, but he was not. Instead he was presented as a great warrior, and I cannot see Brad Pitt as a legendary warrior. The other actors worked better with Eric Bana as the best. Sometimes I felt that Orlando Bloom was more Legolas than Paris, when he was using his bow. I think it was a bit dangerous to choose an actor who just has been a main character in a recently released trilogy, but this will maybe change over the years. You do not think that Indiana Jones is Han Solo today.Still I feel that the movie was not that good. As a part of the audience I felt that some parts of the story were not really explained, instead the movie continued to the next phase, where I was sitting back disappointed that some part of the plot was not explained more in details. This is not the feeling I want to have, when I watch a potential epic movie.The movie had the potential to be legendary, but something went wrong during the production. I do not think it is Petersen's fault, it is more likely that it was the script. I think the movie was acceptable and maybe a bit more than that, but it will possibly be forgotten in 10 years.7/10",7,0,1,31 May 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good action without the atmosphere from the previous Terminator-movies
","Arnold is back as the Terminator, but this time it is not with the same success as the previous.I liked the first two movies, and I also like the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Anyway, I feel that three people really have created the Terminator universe, and these three people are Arnold, Cameron and not at least the composer Brad Fiedel. The last two were missing in this third movie, so I was very sceptical of this one.The movie was entertaining though, so maybe I should not complain, but I was not impressed. Kristanna Loken did an acceptable job as TX, but it was not as good as Robert Patrick as T-1000 or Arnold's previous performances.A thing that I did not like in this movie was that the Terminator was made a bit comical. It was fun to watch some of the scenes with the Terminator where he did some funny things, but it was more like a take-off of the old Terminator. It created a dilemma, I was entertained, but at the same time I was a bit frustrated, that the movie was not serious like the old Terminator-movies by Cameron.Compared to the old movies this movie is not like them. The movie does not have the ideas of James Cameron and the music of Brad Fiedel, I missed them both. A last thing that I missed was Arnold as the Terminator, I did not feel he was a cyborg/robot, maybe he missed the instructions from James Cameron.I may sound very disappointed, but that is not quite true. The action was maybe the best ever filmed, and the story was acceptable. The atmosphere from the old Terminator-movies is however missing, and you will not get the same feeling when watching this one.I would rate it 6/10.",6,0,0,23 July 2003
The Patriot," He is not a patriot
","I watched this movie and was a little disappointed. First of all is the title completely wrong. Mel Gibson does not enter the war because he is a patriot who loves his country, he is doing it because he wants revenge. The title should be 'The Avenger' - not 'The Patriot'. I was also disappointed by the way Mel Gibson and his two sons killed more then 20 English soldiers, it would be impossible in reality. - I give this movie 5/10 because of the action!",5,1,2,28 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Big stars, big budget, big disappointment
","I thought 'Ocean's Eleven' would be a good movie with stars like George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, but I was wrong.All the stars in this movie get some attention during the movie, but it would be much more interesting to follow a much smaller group where you get to know the actors/characters.The story wasn't that interesting either, and the big stars don't save the movie from a disaster. Talented actors can't turn a boring story into an interesting story, and this movie proves it.I believe that the production companies should learn that a big budget and some big stars isn't the same as a good movie. This movie should be much better with all these talented actors, but I have to be fair and give it 4/10.Most IMDb-users disagree with me, but I need a good story rather than big overpaid stars.",4,0,1,1 March 2002
Resident Evil," If you don't like the Matrix you'll hate this
","'Resident Evil' is one of the worst new movies I've watched this year.
I got to admit that I'm not a big fan of 'the Matrix', I don't like the story and I don't like the special effects with slow motion and people running on the walls.The story in 'Resident Evil' is a bit similar with computers taking control, and the special effects have also been used. One of them is the bullet being fired in slow motion - we have seen it before, and don't want to see it ever again.I also think that the director has been inspired by 'Aliens', which is a much better movie than 'Resident Evil'. 'Aliens' is a much more scary movie than this poor movie, and you don't know when the situations will occur. While watching 'Resident Evil' you'll know whenever something will happen, there is nothing unexpected throughout the whole movie.Do you like 'the Matrix' you'll maybe also like this one. If you just want to watch a movie where machines/computers take control, then you should watch the Terminator-movies.My vote for 'Resident Evil' was 3/10.",3,0,0,24 July 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," A mixed experience
","I went to the cinema this evening to watch K-19: The Widowmaker, and I had mixed expectations.The reviews were mixed here in Denmark, but I was willing to give it a shot, I always look forward to watch a Harrison Ford movie.One of the things I have read about was the Russian accent, and I just think you should ignore this. Americans can't talk like Russians, and that is just something you have to accept as a watcher.K-19 was a slow starter movie, and I thought it would be a disappointment after the first half, which was too long with not much happening. In the second half problems occurred and the movie developed in a positive direction. I can't say much because it would spoil the movie for you.The performances by the actors were good, and the movie was also well directed. You felt inside the sub when watching the movie, and that was the whole idea. K-19: The Widowmaker is an average movie because of it's length, I would rate it 6/10.",6,0,0,5 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A good disappointment
","It is not easy to interpret my summary, and I actually have the same feeling after watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1.I had very big expectations to this new Tarantino movie, I had hoped it would be just as good as Pulp Fiction. It was maybe a bit much to expect, but you should not expect less from such a talented director.The actors chosen for this movie are chosen wisely, I really like Uma Thurman, she has 'it' as Bobby Bowfinger calls it. It is hard to describe what it is, but it us a combination of personality and talent. The rest of the cast was also good, but Uma Thurman is especially a fantastic experience.The action is good too, but it is actually a problem. Tarantino seems to be obsessed with impressive fight scenes, so he forgets to get flow in the story. At the same time I must admit that I am not a fan of the fight scenes used in 'Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', I prefer fight style ala Indiana Jones with fists, it is much more cool. It is maybe not as artistic, but it is how fight scenes should be.Another Tarantino obsession is blood, and I actually like the use of blood as in Pulp Fiction or the Verhoeven style, but the use of blood in this movie was more like the Monty Python style, and it does not work in the long run in this movie. I could laugh a few times because of the extreme use of blood, but it could not keep the comical element for all 111 minutes.As you can read from my review, I was not as pleased as I had hoped. The movie was without doubt beautifully made, but the plot was maybe a bit too thin and the story moved too slowly. Despite all this the movie deserves 7/10, but do not expect this to be a classic like Pulp Fiction.",7,0,0,10 November 2003
Total Recall," Great movie by Verhoeven
","Director Paul Verhoeven did a really good job when he made Total Recall. The story is very interesting with some ideas that maybe will be real in the future, and this movie shows the dark side of brain-manipulation. I think that the movie was one of the best visual movies at it's time, and I still think it is beautiful even today.Yesterday I watched Scorpion King (what was I thinking?) and I complained about how censored the movie was, and it was great to watch this Verhoeven-movie with all that blood, he is not afraid of showing the audience blood. I'm really a fan of non-censored movies, we see too many 'correct' Hollywood-movies in these years.Total Recall is the best movie Schwarzenegger has made, it is even than Predator and Terminator 2. I also like the role Sharon Stone has, she makes a nice performance and looks really amazing.This movie is real good and is definitely worth watching, I will rate it 9/10.",9,0,1,21 July 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Not that good
","I expected a pretty good war movie when I decided to watch 'Enemy at the Gates', but I didn't get that.The movie does not have long interesting scenes, there are actually only a few good scenes in this movie. The good and interesting scenes are the ones where Ed Harris is present, I must say that his performance is very good. I'm not a fan of Ed Harris, but he is really one of the best actors in Hollywood, he really deserves some credit.The rest of the cast were about average and didn't impress, but maybe they suffer from a boring script. Compared to other war movies like Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, 'Enemy at the Gates' doesn't deliver the same quality.I will rate the movie 5/10, it's mainly because of the sniper scenes with Ed Harris.",5,1,3,8 March 2002
Signs," Highly overrated
","I saw Signs yesterday in the cinema, and I was disappointed.The first half was nice with some thrilling moments and some funny scenes. The second half where you saw the aliens was on the other hand very bad. I really hated the end.I would like to point out some of the things that I didn't like in the end.*Spoiler* - The movie paid tribute to God, is it important in a movie? - The movie paid tribute sicknesses, 'it is God's will'. - The highly advanced aliens were more primitive soldiers than the Egypts. - The highly advanced aliens found it impossible to open a locked door. - The highly advanced aliens knew that water was dangerous, because they didn't land near it, but they couldn't make water protection suits.This movie has a very poor ending, I think that the movie only deserves 5/10.",5,1,1,1 September 2002
The Matrix," Stupid movie with good action
","I have just watched 'The Matrix', and I was very disappointed. I had heard it was a real good movie, and it was placed as #40 at IMDb, so I had some expectations.After watching the first half hour I could see that it wouldn't be one of my favorites. It was more likely that it would be the most disappointing movie ever, but the action in the second half of the movie was pretty good made, so it saved the movie from being a complete disaster.The story in The Matrix was so stupid that I considered stop watching the movie, but I had to watch it all so I could rate it here on IMDb.
Normally I like movies with 'the chosen one' like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but The Matrix was so stupid. The actors constantly repeated 'he is the one', I think it would be enough to say this three or four times.I really don't understand how The Matrix could be in the top-250 at IMDb, but some people like movies with stupid stories if just the action is good. This movie does not deserve more than 4/10.",4,2,4,8 February 2002
