The Blair Witch Project," NOT Pointless. Just beyond your level. NOT A waste of money!
","What is there to say about this one-of-a-kind movie?This is one of the best thrillers I've seen, although, it isn't for everyone, some people think the movie was pointless, but it is just that this movie was beyond their level! I think that the most interesting thing about this movie was the curiosity of it. I mean, the writers took a big risk, you may be thinking, but it didn't cost them, but still, it was a big risk to leave you hanging.When something would get to me and I wanted to see what was here or there or in there, I would get up from my seat like if I was there.A lot of people are complaining that it was like a home video, that is a lie, the only reason they made it like that was to make it reach you more, there were although some rough parts in the movie, but it is just to help you get into it.The thing about this movie isn't the movie itself, but your own imagination. The movie isn't what is as 'SCARY AS HELL,' but your mind. After you see this movie, I suggest you discuss it, it will add to the suspense. It should be part of the movie.This movie is for only few. Some people simply don't understand.",10,1,2,30 July 1999
Captain Marvel," It was great!
",Enjoyed it! Everyone was fantastic and story was fun. Pacing was great and I never felt like it was bored or overcomplicated. Nostalgia was fun and apparently very popular lately. No major qualms other than it's not quite up to the same level as other Marvel films. But how about we enjoy it as a separate film and not spoil it by giving it a lower rating than it deserves.,9,3,11,9 March 2019
Hero," Visually stunning, oddly fresh
","This film is spectacular. The fight scenes are magnificent and the special effects are state-of-the-art. The arrows being repelled in the beginning of the film is amazing and the choreography in the fight between Snow and Cloud is enticing; not only is the fight choreographed, the leaves, colors, sound, music, and general environment all mold into a spectacular five minutes of pure genius. The acting was nearly flawless. Though I did see the film subtitled, the expressions and movements said as much as the words typed on the bottom of the screen.Not to say the film had no mistakes. I believe 'Ying xiong (Hero)' had much in the way of story though had it not been for its excellent fight scenes, spectacular acting, and infinite energy, the writing would have more clearly been noted as flawed. Imagine a film like this one; written in English where the fight scenes were mediocre. In scriptform / bookform it would be entertaining, though I believe in cinema people may even walk out. Entertainment is about tension and release, this movie built up tension and in many cases failed to release because of the writing. Note: that I'm trying not to give away any spoilers. I personally did not enjoy the idea of showing the artificial stories like they really did occur and then returning and showing another one. However, I must admit, it definitely is fresh. I would have preferred a more timeline based story with artificial stories only being told, not shown. And more present action, not past memory.However, these are very minor style details that I myself am questioning. Sometimes these kinds of movies just shouldn't be messed with. I give this 9.25/10. -.25 for writing disagreement and -.25 for flying martial arts (keep it realistic) and -.25 for an awkwardly placed love scene (forgot where it was).",Null,0,0,1 September 2004
