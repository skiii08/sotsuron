It," A fantastic retelling of the story -- Creepy and believable!
","Just saw Stephen King's It (2017) and it was fabulous! ðŸŽˆ The music and sound were perfect in setting the mood and building the tension. The story was really good and the characters were believable. The CGI was awesome as well.From the very first note, I found the music pulling me into the story and enhancing the creepiness/scariness factor. Kudos to Benjamin Wallfisch for an excellent score!When I watch a movie, one gauge is how often I say, 'THAT wouldn't happen!' or 'Why would he do THAT?' or 'REALLY??' When the believability suffers, the whole movie suffers.At most, the new IT had one small moment like that, but it was very small. Overall, I give it an A! ðŸŽˆ",10,5,10,15 September 2017
