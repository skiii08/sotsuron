Moneyball," You REALLY have to be familiar with pro baseball to keep up...
","Or else you won't know what's going on watching a lot of scenes of managers negotiating with scouts and signing agents as a strategy for creating a winning pro baseball team on the cheap.It's a strategy movie and it's very well made and acted, but I have to warn you that you may get lost if you don't know a thing about baseball. You really have to pay attention to phone tag sessions tricking people into selling one player and canning another and why that's a winning strategy and a brilliant one as you will see. It changed the way pro baseball did business in a way that will get you scratching your head on how it was done. It's basically centered around buying and positioning players in the field based on what they accomplished or ended up being good at on the field statistically despite their quirks, not based on their specialization, popularity and price tag. I liked the characters and the realism, ambiance and mood depicting the business of pro baseball. It was enjoyable given I knew very little on the subject of the movie but it's not deserving of 10 out of 10 in my opinion.",8,0,7,25 September 2011
Shutter Island," 'Jacob's Ladder' and 1965's 'Mirage' are more believable and entertaining.
","This is the kind of thriller Scorsese tried to make where the viewer is lead through the plot from the trauma induced, delusional perspective of the main character, only there's too many flashback distractions to make any sense of it all. The flashbacks are what gave away the end for me. I knew it pretty early on in the movie.However, the premise is fascinating from another perspective they only touched upon which is the idea of how anyone could be brainwashed into thinking and doing anything if given the proper support system much like what happened in 'The Manchurian Candidate'. I actually thought that was where it was going.What's not explained in the movie is from where the main character is deriving his delusions while participating in the mental hospital's roll playing therapy experiment. What induced the delusion to roll play as a US Marshal? Why choose to be a US Marshal? Was this his occupation before the actual trauma occurred that caused his psychosis? What was the seed of information that caused him to delude specifics like imagining finding a former doctor hiding out in a cave whose escaping a delusion of her own. Why would shooting your wife for drowning the children cause you to make up all that stuff? Usually in movies there's a seed of reality and logic that starts the spiral downward toward paranoid delusional psychosis this guy was experiencing. To many holes in the logic for me to suspend my disbelief.Great idea for a movie, though. It's just clumsily executed.",5,5,11,21 February 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Keep track of names to know who did what to who and when
","...or you'll get lost as to what is being investigated in such great detail in a 40 year old missing?/murdered? person who done it case.Didn't read the books but it did remind me of a really good Agatha Christie novel I used to read back in the late '70's in high school except without the sadistic torture and provocative sex scenes.You'll appreciate the dark, cold and cozy ambiance of the entire movie that gets you to want to curl up in a warm bed with a hot toddy to read the very great mystery novel you're now watching as the movie unfolds to get you to focus on every character's quirky behaviors as a means of finding out who done it. Pay attention to the sidetrack hacking shenanigans presented as a clever way of getting back at someone through their bank account. Pay attention! It's really cool how it's done!This movie also has that sophisticated European foreign film feel that's so unlike the pacing of American movies. I kept asking is this what it's like in Sweden? Geez! Their welfare system really sucks as well. You'll see what I mean.This movie DOES take you to an alternate unsettling world of daily dysfunctional and abusive family life in another country with a history dealing with its own serial killer who's never been found for 40 years.I'ld have to say without a doubt Rooney Mara's performance is on line with Batman's Heath Ledger's 'Joker' in the way they completely and totally become another person never seen before but is made to look quite real and unsettling. They both out do Brando and Dean in this respect. It's fascinating to watch an actor go that deep into a character with such realism. Don't know how they do it. Just watching that is worth the price of a movie ticket on top of the surprise ending to the who done it mystery.",9,2,7,26 December 2011
Inside Out," I walked out about 30 minutes in. Kept falling asleep.
","I can't believe I'm saying this about a movie made by an animation studio I've admired since John Lasseter's first computer animation short 'Luxo Jr.' back in the '80's.But I had to see this movie from all the positive reviews plus I'm a big Lewis Black fan. But the story amounted to what appeared to be a high end PBS type educational public service announcement about getting to know the workings of the mind and emotions but in the most micromanaged, compartmentalized, explain the obvious so much it distracts from the real story and that being a bit sappy and contrived one at best. 'Implied' was not on the screenwriter's mind when they penned this story.I mean I had to struggle keeping track of the differences of short term memory vs long term in the form of glowing orbs distinguished by various colors. I felt like I needed to take notes on the symbols representing stages of childhood emotional growth such as the 'goofy' stage. YIKES! Everything that was explained lost its entertainment impact that I was left wondering why or which I should pay attention to, the story? the characters? or how the brain works? I chose none of the above and walked out of the theater.",2,189,408,26 June 2015
Get Out," A film that asks...'Why Does The Groundskeeper Run?'.
","See the movie and test yourself. I mean really, as seen in the trailer even I didn't figure it out till after the ending credits. There is an ingenious reason for that but you'll have to listen carefully to the dialog from start to finish because almost every aspect of this movie including the title has a race based dual meaning depending which racial stereotype one leans toward. For instance one may think 'Get Out' is referencing a racially exclusionary threat toward another race when it's actually the exact opposite made brutally evident at the horrific end of the movie. That's the bizarre and clever way these social issues are approached and questioned from a racially sensitive perspective that flows effortlessly throughout the dialog without being obvious. A well written script that attempts to make the audience choose what race based lens they interpret the duality of each stereotype... upscale white liberals who admire African American abilities and strengths? Or African Americans who view that not as a compliment but as stereotyping? It addresses each race equally without being preachy balancing out the humor and racial uneasiness with an unexpected final solution at the end more horrible than the issues created by each race's differences.It puts you in it from both perspectives where the humor acts as a release from the unease created from unjustifiable stereotyping by using them as jokes that left me nearly on the floor busting a gut laughing.All in all I have to say 'Get Out' was a thoroughly original and entertaining movie.",10,6,17,1 March 2017
Drive," If Steve McQueen played De Niro's part in Taxi Driver, well sort of...
","Only 'Steve' (Ryan Gosling) along with his cool and controlled under fire demeanor shows his closet psychopath in some scenes which shocked and then confused me as to what kind of guy Gosling's character really was. Another mismatch that confused the hell out of me is the 'Driver' character shows great skills at driving and working on cars but terrible reading when a person's about to kill him.Sometimes the 'Driver' acts like an innocent, lost boy in some parts of the movie, switches to nerves of steel and genius behind the wheel, then stomps the hell out of guy's head and uses a claw hammer on another. But then didn't we all think that of Deniro's 'Travis Bickle' in Taxi Driver excluding the '70's 'French Connection' and 'The 7-UP's' car chases?Or maybe he's so crazy he doesn't know who he really is or doesn't care to know and just rolls with whatever is thrown at him and adjusts his state of mind accordingly in order to cope. I know the complex situation he's put in as the plot unfolds would probably make me act like that as well. The plot is pretty brilliant on its own which actually does most of the driving in this movie and supports Gosling's character's multiple personalities.Don't you think it takes a very well made movie to get someone to wonder about a character's intentions like that and have that conversation even after viewing the movie? And that's why I gave it 10 out of 10. It's a very smart movie with minimalist acting (similar to Bruce Willis' stillness style used in 'The Sixth Sense') that complements the action and violence sequences you never see coming. The tension craftily built up in the movie is just incredible.",10,1,5,20 September 2011
Insidious," Scarier than The Ring, The Exorcist, Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity.
","What else can I say. At 51 there's not much that scares me in the way of movies since I've seen about every scary movie that's been made, but 'Insidious' raised the bar and did it with a lot of heart.I can always be reassured of the entertainment value in a movie based on the caliber of actors who choose to be in that movie, and since Barbara Hershey signed on I knew I was in for something with depth and meaning as well as a unique way to tell a ghost story which this movie is and much more. It's how I chose 'The Black Swan' another of Barbara Hershey's which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Smart actors like Barbara and Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman and others of the same caliber have never disappointed me in the movies they've chosen throughout the years they've been around.Let me just say this movie's portrayal of the paranormal is so uniquely creepy, tense and realistic in ambiance, timing and photography that it's a big notch above Paranormal Activity. I constantly got chills over my entire body literally with how its presented. And the plot is so unique with a great surprise ending.",10,5,14,2 April 2011
The Artist," A long walk for such a short black and white story. An Oscar?! Are you sure?!
","Yikes! I was expecting something more to the plot from such an Oscar winning movie. Sure, they nailed the look of old B&W movies of that era but that novelty soon wears thin with the simplistic story line I had to endure with four others in my small town local theater. I mean the 'Munsters' TV series nailed '30's era B&W with better plots told in 30 minutes.'The Artist' only ran one short week in my small town Texas theater ONLY AFTER it won the Oscar for Best Picture before it was quickly replaced by newer releases. The long wait and heavy media buzz may have unrealistically raised my expectations but I don't think so even if it is considered an homage to the history of cinema which is sort of ironic since silent movie's had to rely heavily on a well written story with intricate and compelling relationships and plot lines to keep audience's attention for over an hour. Just read some IMDb story lines to a number of Lon Chaney flicks they could've borrowed from like 'The Unknown', 'Unholy Three', and 'The Penalty'. They're more involved and complex than what's shown at most Sundance Festivals. 'The Unknown' left me dropped jawed throughout most of the movie because I couldn't believe the level of intelligence written into and acted out in the story line. There were some really smart folks writing and producing silent movies back in the '20's and '30's. 'The Artist' makes them out to be innocent dolts.You want to award an Oscar to a movie that pays homage to cinema? Give it to Scorcese's 'Hugo' which was a much better and more entertaining movie in my opinion.",3,10,20,9 March 2012
La La Land," Should be titled after the hit song 'City Of Stars' since that's all they played.
","Don't get me wrong I really liked this movie but it's not as brilliant as it's been hyped. I'm not a big fan of musicals. Just wanted to see the results from Ryan Gosling teaching himself to play improvisational jazz piano and I wasn't disappointed. He was brilliant. So brilliant that they didn't give him enough material to do his skills justice. I mean how many times can you play 'City Of Stars'? Jeez Louise, give it a rest will ya'?! I was getting sick of hearing it and I love that song! I didn't care to compare this to 60 year old musicals, but I do remember them having more than one hit song like 'Singing In The Rain' and 'West Side Story'. Even 'Camelot' has a treasure trove of memorable songs if not hits. Oh, and don't forget 'The Sound Of Music'. Did I say I wasn't a big fan of musicals? OK, I kinda' miss their innocent charm, set design, ambiance and poetic improvisational expressionism through dance and song.'La La Land' touches upon these attributes with gorgeous photography, but it becomes pretty obvious the filmmakers were paying homage to musicals of decades past that it seemed to overshadow the motivation of the actors in how they were telling a more modernized story about following one's dreams no matter the cost. Pretty clichéd plot but that's what most musicals were built on anyway. Keep it simple.I did like the naturally relaxed delivery of Ryan and Emma's dancing and singing. Frankly, Emma's facial emoting on screen was more believable and gut wrenching than Barbara Streisand's 'Funny Girl' or any other actor in a musical for that matter. And Emma can really belt it out with the best of them.And Ryan's singing style reminded me of the 'Velvet Fog' Mel Torme. Just wanted to hear more of his jazz improvisational piano that shines in the Christmas holiday scene in the restaurant. It was amazing!",7,1,7,16 February 2017
Don't Breathe," Felt like I lost over 5 pounds just from the relentless tension, twists & turns.
","There's no gratuitous violence, gore and disturbing behavior even though the plot demanded it because every violent, gory and disturbing action/reaction made complete sense according to what one would expect from a home invasion of a blind Iraq War veteran with possible PTSD who also lost a loved one.And that's the worm that constantly turned in my head figuring out who to sympathize with...the invaders? or the blind veteran? That, along with the slowly increasing disturbing behavior of the blind man and strategic cat & mouse maneuvers in a small, old house, put me right in the middle of it to where I thought I was gonna' go mad.And just when I thought the good guys? bad guys? home invaders were going to get away scot-free, they're thrown right back in it with even more unexpected bizarrely life threatening results that make both antagonist? and victim? up their game and reveal what they're truly made of physically, emotionally and morally. I mean a video game inspired just from the cleverness of the escapes and captures would make for an exciting thrill ride.And finally this is a movie that sets up a believable plot twist at the end for a possible sequel that makes complete sense. A sequel I greatly look forward to.",10,12,25,2 September 2016
In Time," A brilliantly written alternative commentary on society.
","On top of that the cinematography is just gorgeous to look at especially in digital theaters. It puts you in a very realistic parallel world that resembles ours but just not quite the same in a strange and unsettling way.The social commentary of the plot line reminds me of the '70's Charlton Heston movie, 'Soylent Green' except time is the valuable commodity instead of food.I think the 'Occupy Wall Street' folks will see and appreciate the similarities between the two class societies portrayed. At the end of the movie I was so outraged for some reason because of how close to home the similarities were. It's definitely a sociopolitical movie that doesn't pound you over the head with it. It just makes you see what's going on from an intelligent, inert and quite lyrical point of view. It ain't the Matrix but it does give you something to think about with a different perspective. I liked the movie very much because of this which is why I gave it ten stars.",10,4,11,6 November 2011
The Happening," Life's a boring movie and then you die and there ain't anything you can do about it.
","That's pretty much the clearly unintentional plot line of The Happening. Boy! I wanted to like this movie, but I had too many mixed feelings about it. The premise is sheer genius, but becomes buried, obscured and confusing within the thin disaster film type drama and shock value of the character's reactions and interactions of what is happening to them.It's like the movie Village of the Damned. So what if kids are taking over the minds of the adult community and making them do their bidding. That gets old after a while. We want to know WHY, HOW and WHERE it could lead. That's why I never thought that movie was that scary. If you're going to mess with the psychology of the human mind, you'ld better direct the mind accordingly. The Happening suppresses this.I would've opened the movie straight off before the credits with the Einstein quote about the disappearing bees that is briefly and obscurely shown on the teacher's blackboard a little ways into the movie. I completely missed this due in part to the second rate soft focus print of the movie I viewed at my local theater. This would've immediately set the tone to allow the audience to suspend their disbelief since it's a real quote from a respected scientist and addresses a very real, ominous and mysterious situation we live in today. But no, I was left with too many contradictions as to what exactly is causing people to commit suicide. Nature taking revenge by producing hormones that secrete psychotropic, suicide inducing chemicals into the wind like a bad cold front to fight its enemy-humans? Genius! I believe it! But then why are some humans spared and others not? OK, I guess nature is selective? Show us why it's selective. OH! I know! It spared people who were in love! That's it! NO? This is all I thought about through the entire movie. And then it ends so cheesy and anti-climatic with no explanation. So I guess life's a boring movie and then you die and there's nothing you can do about it.Note to Mr. Shyamalan, could you remake this movie, please. There's a masterpiece in there somewhere.",5,1,6,14 June 2008
Steve Jobs," High dialog density along the lines of 'Death Of A Salesman'
","Felt like I was watching a play from all the 'Willy & Biff Loman' styled arguing back and forth on how to sell new and sophisticated technology for its time to the unwashed masses while obsessively being on time for each Apple release conference from '84 to '98.Couldn't tell if the movie praised or demonized Steve Jobs from all the jump cuts to the past and present of long winded philosophical arguments on the inner workings of Apple and how Steve Job handled his personal life. Still didn't get a sense how much of it was true vs an interpretation of history.It got very tiresome trying to determine if Steve Jobs was an autistic, obsessive compulsive sociopath with low self esteem or one of the most clever business and marketing strategist the world has ever seen especially when the movie implies how he used NEXT to embarrass or motivate Scully who had fired him from Apple. It will require a second viewing to be sure. At best the movie made it appear there was some weird business mixed with personal politics issues going on at Apple.But I'm of the sort that likes speaking and learning truth of the dead but I'm not sure I got both in this movie because it covered too much history in order for me to keep up.I was hoping the movie would've recreated and conveyed the magic aura I felt seeing each new Mac release four of them I bought since '98, but focus was placed more on interpersonal relationships within the company.Oh well. I would've done better financially investing in Apple stock in '98 than buying their computers. I still haven't figured out how to make money with them.",6,1,5,23 October 2015
Arrival," 'Arrival' Just confirmed I'll never trust Rotten Tomatoes reviews
","100% on Rotten Tomatoes? WTF?! I'm a big sci-fi movie fan especially if its story is quite philosophical and cerebral which IS the case with Arrival, but it got bogged down in the complexities of showing how humans would communicate with a superior alien intelligence amidst a distrusting and violent Earth society. Figure out how to communicate quickly enough with the aliens in order to prevent war is the main premise.I got confused. There are dream like flashbacks that at first don't make sense, combined with a lot of Amy Adam's long drawn out ogle eye'd tearful stares of bewilderment morphing to fear bordering on amazement as she attempts to communicate and build a vocabulary as a translator with the alien entities. Yes! Great visuals and audio to keep me interested in how this was done.But this movie relies heavily on building tension this way from an audience with high expectation and anticipation of what's going to happen next with a pay out that is a bit of a let down, drawn out and confusing to keep up with. I actually was struggling to keep from dozing off, but that may be from my trying to beat the anticipated crowds (going Rotten Tomatoes 100% review) at a midnight viewing the day before Friday release. There were just a handful in the audience that night.Besides I was expecting something more profound than Jodie Foster's 'Contact', a much better movie at relying on audience expectation and anticipation from experiencing a unique imagining of what it would be like to communicate with extraterrestrial alien intelligence that also explains how they overcome the limitations of space travel. 'Arrival' doesn't even go there. But it's still a well made movie.",5,44,95,11 November 2016
The Purge," It pays to wait 2 years to see a movie hobbled by public expectations..
","I passed on the Purge back when it was first released just from the bad reviews here. Mass public opinion and expectations can do so some weird psychological mind games on decision making. I'm not even sure I can trust online reviews anymore. Over 500 of them and most see this movie as garbage. Do these people have a central nervous system? I just saw it on FX TV channel tonight and I was thoroughly entertained and jumping out of my seat yelling instructions to the characters on how to get away from the bad guys. It was like watching a boxing match. I couldn't sit still.The whole premise and concept was as intriguing and compelling as the Twilight Zone's 'Monsters Are Due On Maple Street' and that episode got a 9 out of 10 IMDb rating. But the Purge was just more socially jarring and violent similar to Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', but played out in an overly bucolic, laid back American suburb. There's an air of tense foreboding calm that made me nervous.This movie is tightly paced and moves along quickly with no long drawn out explanations for the reasons for the Purge. They go right into it and make it pretty simple. Humans by nature are violent (more than animals) so give them an outlet. Saves on future war and crime but then who survives and who dies gets into some sticky social class deterministic vs moralistic concepts I personally had never considered until I saw this movie. It's quite disturbing in an unforgiving way with uncomfortable implications for the cause of the recent shootings in the news lately.Boy I'm glad I waited to see this movie on TV. I really enjoyed it on a whole different level than I expected.",10,1,2,6 September 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," I Came away exhausted, mesmerized & thoroughly entertained. What did I just see?!
","I was dropped jawed throughout the entire movie. WHAT A RIDE! Gorgeous, incredible and original looking visual effects and set, costume and vehicle design. The car & motorcycle chase scenes & stunts were paced and timed perfectly so I could see all the detail. IOW no frenetic, jarring quick cuts that left me asking what just happened. Where did that come from? I missed something! It all made sense as if I was watching it live.Special effects has really improved in the last 5 years. It's all very realistic and seamless. 'Prometheus','Gravity','Mad Max' & 'Ex Machina' are now four that's left me scratching my head in amazement. Usually in the past I could see signs of off looking CGI but now I can't tell fake from real. Where are they teaching people how to make this stuff? Only complaint is Mad Max was ear bleedingly loud. I actually felt I was getting nauseous just from the high energy intensity of the visuals and sound. Or maybe I'm just getting too old for these types of movies. I felt I lost some weight watching it.",10,6,16,19 May 2015
