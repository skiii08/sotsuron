The Lobster," I hated it
","I saw this film a long time ago. I stayed to the end but I wish I had walked out.I tend to enjoy unusual films and this certainly qualifies in that category.The reason for my hatred was the disturbing scene near the end. Not what was actually being shown, but simply the idea of what was happening.The animal cruelty mentioned by others didn't bother me at all as I realise that no animals were actually harmed. Knowing that no actors would actually be harmed was strangely no help to me at all.",Null,2,4,14 March 2018
Yesterday," An okay rom-com
",I was very disappointed because I was expecting more music and less romance. Lily James was really wonderful though.,6,1,3,2 July 2019
1917," Just what I expected
","I found this unbelevable, silly and predictable. The attempt to make it look as if it was made in one single shot was distracting.",5,12,31,23 January 2020
Parasite," A real roller-coaster of a film
","This was intriguing from the start, but I was worried that the different cutural values might prevent my enjoyment. My concern disappeared as the film became more and more bizarre; I was completely caught up.",9,4,8,13 December 2019
