10 Cloverfield Lane," J.J. Abrams has done it again!!
","10 Cloverfield Lane has raised the bar for suspense. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was anxiously engaged in the movie and concerned for the characters. In watching this movie I found myself cheering when something good happened and stunned when things took a turn for the worse. I was trying to figure out if I was in a theater or a sports arena rooting for my team at times. The story will keep you guessing, in awe, and confused from start to finish. The story is a weird one and your opinion of the situation will change throughout the movie. The unpredictability is probably the best factor of the movie. This film will make you wanna lean in, be attentive, and sometimes even reach out to grab someone or something. This isn't a movie you want to wait for. Go see it today and if possible before it leaves theater's.",9,2,5,7 May 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Don't wait, go see it!!
","Captain America: Civil War was a phenomenal movie. It's perfect blend of Action, Comedy, and Adventure made for a great story. The key to this film was the perfect combination of the plot and all star lineup. Many movies lack a good combo of both, however this movie is an exception. The story of the movie will keep you guessing, laughing, and wide eyed the whole time. My fear was that it would be hard to follow for a person who hadn't watched the previous movies. This is a movie where previous knowledge will help, but isn't completely required. The movie is enjoyable for anyone. The cast complemented each other well and the new additions (hint hint) were great. For action i give the movie a 9 on a scale of 1-10. For the comedy aspect I give it a 10. A 9.5 would be more accurate for the rating. For my recommendation i would have to say........ go see it ASAP! Don't wait for it to come out on DVD, go see it in the theater and enjoy what I believe is the greatest movie of the year thus far!!",9,11,23,7 May 2016
