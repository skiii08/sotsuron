Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," At best, an average film
","I ended up seeing this film three times primarily because my husband is a big star wars fan.  When I initially read the reviews last year, I was bracing myself for a horrible experience.Truthfully, the film is NOT bad.  It's not all that great either. The movie certainly didn't live up to the obscene amount of hype it received.   I really hope that Lucas wakes up and gets a clue and does not allow the second film to be hyped this much.The best description of this film is AVERAGE.  It's got great special effects, wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, a passable story, the acting is fine, the characters have potential and it is fun.   However, it could have been so much better.  The biggest element missing to this film is 'heart'.It feels really mundane and churned out in so many ways. There's really not a lot of imagination or creativity to it.  The actors are treated like cardboard cutouts which is a shame since they could be so exciting and the actors have the potential to bring good performances.George Lucas really also needs to work on the awful, truly banal dialogue. Some of it made me cringe.  Certain parts were a little bit unbelievable as well - the Anakin character was way too young - how believable is it to have an 8 year old pilot like this and have any romantic notions at all?  The clorimiridians and the 'Jesus' immaculate conception reference is flat out weird and unnecessary.And Jar Jar stinks.   It's like Lucas went to the viewers and said 'Here, (PLOP) is your comedy relief'.  There is no cleverness to this character at all and he is stupid even to young kids.  For clever comedy relief, look at the banter between R2D2 and C3PO in the first films.I really hope EP2 is a lot better.  It has to be at this point with all of the attention paid to these films.  Star Wars should not just be a kids movie - it should be for both kids and adults like truly good films are.There's my two cents - I'm sure I've repeated what others have said but adding more in never hurts!",7,0,1,13 June 2000
Memento," Really neat flick - don't let it get away!
","This was a very intriguing, original movie.  I loved the way they put together the story once I could see what they were doing - it was like solving a jigsaw puzzle!  The acting was uniformly very very good.  Guy Pierce really played his very complex character very well.  I also enjoyed Carrie Ann Moss.This movie is one of those rare movies that make you think about all of the pieces and the story after it's done.I'm really glad I saw it.",9,0,1,31 May 2001
The 13th Warrior," Ordinary action film
","This was an okay movie for an action flick but not as exciting as the trailer suggested.  At times it was easy to get lost on what was exactly happening. It also was a bit sluggish (especially in the beginning).I'm not exactly sure what was unique about this story. Part of the problem was that the essential story was so pedestrian and redundant that it wasn't as exciting as it could have been.The acting was okay - Antonio Banderas seemed to do a lot of staring, though.  The only problem I had with it is that the Vikings were not very accurately portrayed!  Check out books or see the current exhibit in the National Museum of Science (DC) on vikings to see for yourselves.",6,0,0,27 August 2000
Billy Elliot," Passionate, engrossing story overcomes cliches
","I'm not sure why this film is being compared to the Full Monty other than the fact that it involves folks from Northern England.  The films are quite different.  Billy Elliot is a movie just chock full of cliches but instead of being a bore, it's a wonderful film.  The main reason is that the passion and sincerity behind this film is amazing.  The acting by Jamie Bell is outstanding and is one of the main reasons to see this movie. 
I was completely engrossed in this film even though I knew how it would turn out and the characters are pretty stereotypical in many ways. 
Just goes to show you how long you can go with a fundamentally good story, great acting, good direction, and actually caring more about the film than making money.",8,0,0,29 October 2000
Chicken Run," Cute kids' movie
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and thought it was one of the better ones so far this summer (however, that is not saying a lot!!).It was more of a kids' flick than I expected, though.  Even though it had some adult-type references and the humor was good for all ages, it seemed more geared for a younger audience. I didn't think this film was quite as good as last years' Iron Giant which really did appeal to all ages.It was a 'cute' film and I'm glad I saw it.  It didn't quite meet the expectations I had based on both users and critics reviews but it beats 'Gone in 60 Seconds' any day.",Null,0,0,10 July 2000
X-Men," Fun summer flick
",I saw X-Men mainly for an escape from reality and I was not disappointed. It was not the most original and substantial movie I have ever seen but it was fun and the characters were neat.  I just wish it didn't seem like a lot of other action type stories and had more originality to it.  I liked the relationships between the characters and the visuals were fantastic.  I think I'll see the next one (There has got to be a next one as far as I can tell) but I hope it gets more of a story line.I gave it a '7'.,7,0,0,6 August 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Fun and Theatrical
","I knew this version was not going to be like any version I am used to and I knew it was going to be an 'art' film.  Even with the Shakespearian dialogue in the modern setting, I thought this film worked.  It is a bit hammy and overracted at times but it still is a lot of fun and really reminded me of being in the theater. 
This is definitely not a version that is to be taken literally.  If you go with the flow, you'll find yourself enjoying this film and yes, learning a little bit more of Shakespeare along the way. I could easily see any English teacher picking this tape up to show to students - it really can make Shakespeare more accessible.  I think this movie version (funky as it is) is yet another testament that great works by Shakespeare will never fade.I basically enjoyed the performances. I was glad to see Pete Postlewaite and I thought Leo and Claire Danes made a really sweet and affecting Romeo and Juliet.  I felt that all of the characters made the Shakespeare dialogue more understandable and put it in excellent context. I just had to realize that it's not altogether a BAD thing that the male lead is far prettier than the female one!This same director is coming out with another movie that is similar to this one called 'Moulin Rouge'.  I'm looking forward to it coming out.",Null,0,1,19 June 2000
Armageddon," That was bad, really bad
","My husband and I kept muttering the same phrase over and over again for a few hours after seeing this movie - 'That was really, really bad'. I mean, we were numb.  Our brains felt like they had been transplanted.One of the worst films I had ever experienced.  Bad acting, trite plot, and just plain annoying.",1,3,6,21 August 2000
U-571," Good old fashioned war movie
","Finally got to see this movie and was surprised that it was still in theatres here.  I keep forgetting I live in Houston, though....I thought this was a good film with lots of edge of your seat suspense, good twists, and just a solid story. This is not to say that this story should be taken as historical fact.  There should be a disclaimer that comes with this movie that states any resemblance this movie may bear to what really happened during WWII is purely coincidental.  They actually do have script at the end that states some actual facts. Facts that tell the viewers that it was primarily the British who had the most to do with getting the Enigma code from the Germans.  I'd be curious to see if these end notes were there during the original screening of this film.  I know this is just Hollywood but I don't like seeing history distorted in any fashion - it makes for bad storytelling at the end.  I'm just dreading 'The Patriot' for this reason.Historical inaccuracy aside, this movie was still a good one and it honestly had elements to it that made you feel like you were in a U-Boat during WWII. It was a bit predictable in places (I knew immediately who was slated for death) and of course you know the good guys will win no matter what the odds were.  I don't mind suspending some disbelief and I felt for the most part this story was believable enough to enjoy.I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,18 June 2000
The Patriot," Strong epic story
","I'm genuinely surprised at the number of people who didn't like this film. I didn't find it too sappy (definitely not nearly as the better rated Frequency) and there were far less historical inaccuracies in this than in other recent films - notably Gladiator and U-571.The story was well done and the cast was extremely strong - there were good performances all throughout this movie.  It was also an interesting tale set against the backdrop of the American Revolution.  The film had a lot to do with revenge but in the end if you pay attention 'the cause' is what comes through.  One of the many things I liked about the film was that the main character was definitely a flawed hero - he could be as cruel as his enemies and he was weak enough to exact his vengeance.  To me, that showed he was human. Mel Gibson portrays his hero with great depth and makes him real - this was definitely his film.The film touches on a lot of real issues in the Revolutionary war.  One of which is that there were a number of 'Loyalists' among the colonists and that there was a great deal of in-fighting amongst them and the patriots. There was cruelty - on both sides.  However, it is not inaccurate to show one mad British officer conducting acts of brutality. This did not reflect on the entire British army or the British people - it just reflected one sick individual. I don't blame the British for being genuinely annoyed at such inaccuracies in U-571 where their accomplishments were ignored and history was distorted.  But I don't think they should have as much issue with the Patriot if you look at the history of this war and yes, it is told from the American point of view.  The issue of slavery was not touched upon much here but then again the revolutionary war was not primarily about this issue.  African Americans were never granted their freedom by Brits and in many cases inhumanely treated. The film does show some of this cruelty and prejudice on both sides.  An infamous example is that the British often infected them with small pox that would then spread among the colonists.  This is a real, historical fact - The Brits would be REALLY up in arms if that had been portrayed.This film is worthwhile to see if you enjoy good epic stories with excellent acting.",8,0,1,23 July 2000
Moulin Rouge!," Silly, campy fun that could have been a lot better
","Well, I definitely didn't hate Moulin Rouge like I feared but there were times I felt like hiding my head with a blanket. In all honesty, if you get through the first 15 or so minutes and see what they are doing, you find yourself getting into this rather silly but still fun flick.I had a few complaints though - the frenetic camera movement (particularly in the beginning scenes), the really absurd added touches such as a fake moon smiling and others, and the inability to slow down to see the characters create the story rather than have to narrate what is going on. 
This is absolutely not a film for everyone.  I can see where the novelty of the film is a real positive and the special effects were amazing. Sure, the story has been done a billion times but it's a good story if a little saccharine.  I don't mind mush as long as it's honest mush - this film struck me as being honest mush.I liked the acting overall but this is the sort of film that didn't really call for heavy acting from the leads which was a little disappointing.  Jim Broadbent has been one of my favorites for a while and I thought he did a great job.  I've always found myself impartial to Ewan McGregor and I just enjoy watching him on screen period.  I thought both he and Nicole Kidman had 'okay' voices but I think if you took away some of the echoing and effects, they would have sounded a bit flat.   It almost looked like Kidman was lip-synching in a few scenes which I'm sure she was. 
I give it an 'A' for effort and I loved the originality - parts of the film were quite memorable and good.  But it just wasn't enough to sustain an entire film and it sort of missed it with the frenetic editing, the over simplified story, and too silly, cringeable touches.",6,0,1,8 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Not as good as the first one
","While this was not a painful movie to watch, it certainly disappointed. It also had some extremely annoying aspects such as trying to be stylish or artsy by slowing a scene way down for no apparent reason. The result was cheesy and cliched.Actually, the whole movie could be described as cheesy and cliched.  Sure, there were lots of COOL explosions, Sydney looked gorgeous and Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise.  It could be called mildly entertaining but it missed in so many ways.  The dialogue was insipid, Thandie Newton carried this love struck cow look on her face throughout most of the film, there were a lot of unbelievable parts (how convenient that the bad guys happened to have a land cruiser on hand to chase Cruise with)and it wasn't nearly as clever as it tried to be.  I hope they don't go for MI III in this vein.  Hopefully, it will be more creative next time.",5,0,1,31 January 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," I enjoyed this movie
","I finally got a chance to see this movie on video and I'm glad I did.  This was a really interesting movie on a fairly difficult topic.  I thought the story was a good one but the biggest asset to this film were the performances.  Jolie delivers a charismatic, involving performance of a confused and complex mentally disturbed young woman.  Ryder is excellent. She gives a highly moving, intelligent, and affective performance as Suzanne Caisson. She really allowed me to relate to her character. I'm sorry she didn't get an Oscar nod for that performance - she certainly deserved one. All of the supporting cast were outstanding as well - the girls, I mean - the two boys were a little disappointing. Whoopie Goldberg was also excellent and makes me wish she'd appear in films more often.Definitely a good way to spend an evening.",8,0,0,11 June 2000
The Mummy Returns," Silly, campy, over the top but still fun
","I really enjoyed the original Mummy a few years ago which was the main reason I came back for the sequel. While I'm not sorry I saw the sequel, I was disappointed in that it wasn't nearly as clever or as well done as the first.The producers of 'The Mummy Returns' didn't even bother to fill in all of those tiny little plot holes. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Like, how did the Maji character manage to make it to the temple and escape the little pygmie creatures that nailed everyone else?  They also never really explained the full Scorpion story very well in the very beginning.I wasn't expecting to think very deeply about this movie since it's just pure, silly entertainment at its most mindless.  Mummy Returns still retains its old fashioned action film appeal and I still enjoyed it enormously.  I even liked the campy one liners that I might have found annoying in another movie. Brendan Fraser helped a great deal in making 'The Mummy Returns' a fun experience.  The special effects are great and the movie still scares.  I was surprised to see so many young kids in the audience with a PG-13 rating.I'd recommend it but I hope it won't be the best of this summer.  I'm betting on either Shrek or AI for that honor.",6,0,0,20 May 2001
Shrek," Good, silly fun
","So far the best movie of the summer in my opinion.  I really enjoyed Shrek since it was fun for both kids and adults.  Not too many animated movies can be really good for both kids and adults.  Shrek was an excellent parody on Disney, had lots of gross stuff for kids (and twisted adults like me), cool references (the best one was the reference to Bogart/Bacall film - if you need me, whistle), and just a wonderful story where everyone lives happily ever after in the end.HOORAY!",9,0,0,20 June 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Starting the year off right
","I'm so glad I finally got a chance to see this film before it got away. It was a movie that was lots of fun and greatly entertaining.  Not a movie to take seriously but you can still see the parallels between it and Homer's Odyssey. It's a pretty broad parody on southern life and the 1930's.  The actors even act like they are 1930 type parodies.  Clooney was just great - totally unlike I've seen him before.There were a few plot holes but not anything that you would count against this film. The movie really drew me in and I kept wondering what was happening next.All in all, a lot of fun.  I hope they make more movies like this one.",9,0,0,14 February 2001
