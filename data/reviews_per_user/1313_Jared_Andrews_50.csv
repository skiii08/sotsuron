Blade Runner 2049," A Visually Striking Sequel that is Well Worth Your Time
","Visually the movie floored me. There's clearly so much intentionality and careful effort and planning that went into making that world. Villeneuve blended call backs to the original while still making this his own vision. I'll see anything he makes because I always feel like I'm in good hands with his movies, right from the opening scene.The music had a similar feel to the visuals in that they blended old and new. The iconic 'Tears in Rain' melody receives a much-deserved return in a delightfully appropriate moment. I'll give the movie serious props for providing a comforting level of nostalgia without ever feeling that it pandered.Joi (Ana de Armas) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) were fantastic in their own very different ways. Joi, who plays Gosling's love interest of sorts, is essentially Samantha in Her, except she is a holographic projection instead of only a voice. Luv is Jared Leto's favorite replicant assistant and a total ice queen.Gosling was cool and dutiful, though kind of lifeless, which I guess was on purpose since he plays a replicant (or does he?) Juxtaposing him with Harrison Ford really made the subtleties of Ford's performance stand out in a way that was absent for Gosling. But Gosling was still very handsome and that worked well with the rest of the movie, which is striking and beautiful.Even though I didn't feel bored during any of the 164 minutes, I often felt like nothing was really happening. Even at the end I wondered what was the point. I know it was a character exploration of K (Gosling), like the first was of Deckard, and he clearly grew during the story. Still, the movie overall came across to me as heavy on striking visuals and light on substance.Perhaps I'm demanding too much. While I enjoyed the heck out of the movie and would watch it again in a second, it fell slightly short of the profound best picture level movie that I hoped it would be. Somewhere in the two hour and 44 minute runtime is a great two hour movie trying to emerge.All things considered, it's a pleasing complement to the original and is well worth a night in the theater.",7,8,14,16 October 2017
First Man," Excellent Understated Biopic
","The opening scene will take your breath away. I don't think a single cell in my body flinched for a solid five minutes as I watched Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) fight to keep his craft from floating away into space. The scene is spectacular visually and in every sense of filmmaking execution. It's also a bit misleading. The rest of the movie, aside from the moon landing, is remarkably tame. It's quiet. There are virtually no loud outbursts or emotional speeches. This story is about people doing their jobs, completing their missions. Gosling understands this and plays to Armstrong's stoicism perfectly. He is often an understated actor, choosing to let his subtle facial movements and glints of the eyes do as much talking as what actually comes out of his mouth. Neil is much the same except even less outwardly expressive. He clearly comes from a generation that did not display emotion. They suffered in silence, which no doubt frustrated many family members, especially spouses. Armstrong's wife Janet (Claire Foy) is a classic case of a spouse desperate to glimpse beyond his emotional shield. She restrains for the most part, but her building frustration is apparent throughout. When she finally does unleash her emotions, it's startling. Her outbursts stand out in such stark contrast to the silence that we see from the other characters. Foy is smart and measured with every choice she makes, and she never comes across as unhinged or overly supportive to a point of unbelievability. She's strong as a quiet devoted partner and strong when she senses the need to speak up. Look for her to add another award nomination to her resume come that time of year.For as great as Gosling and Foy are, Damien Chazelle is the star of this movie, just like he has been the star of every one of his movies. I don't mean this as a bad thing. They guy is simply so skilled at what he does that his impact stands out among all the other standouts in his movies. He doesn't take the conventional approach to a space movie, which is to hammer viewers with showy visuals and action sequences. He's careful not to overdo it those areas, instead focusing on Armstrong's psyche and life outside the space shuttle. Chazelle crafts a personal, intimate film and shoots it in a creative way that uses a variety of framing choices so the closeups never feel stale.This is a giant story told on a deliberately small scale. The choice to focus on Armstrong's objectively less captivating homelife rather than the moon mission is risky. Only the most talented of filmmakers, which Chazelle is, could pull it off. 'First Man' is another showcase of Chazelle's mastery. He's one of the best directors currently working. The fact that this film may eventually be considered Chazelle's 6th or 7th best and is still this excellent, is a tribute to his talent.",8,129,197,16 October 2018
It," IT Delivers the Scares and Humor in an Endlessly Fun Ride
","Don't overthink it. Don't overthink IT. That's a plea from the novel's author himself, Stephen King. He didn't want anyone to delve too deeply into analyzing this movie, so respect the man's wishes. He knows his work better than anyone else possibly could. After all, he wrote it.I understand the temptation to explore the layers of IT. We see the themes of community, transitioning to adulthood, bullying, racism, friendship, yada, yada, yada. I'm telling you—don't fixate on that. Focus on IT. And by IT, I mean not only Pennywise the Dancing Clown, but also the embodiment of all your worst fears, everything that IT can be. Because that's what this movie is really about above all else—being afraid. This 2017 adaptation of IT provides a litany of reasons to be afraid, not the least of which is Bill Skarsgard's terrifying, devious, vicious performance of the infamous clown. This is very much of modern version of Pennywise, equipped with special effects to illustrate his shape-shifting abilities and showcase his considerable power. There's nothing cheesy here. Pennywise is only ever funny and charming as a means to lure children. The humor is intentional when it hits. The most brilliant element of IT is its self-recognition. The movie (or its writers) understands that stories of this ilk (i.e. an unstoppable monstrous figure is killing people) are inherently kind of silly. Take Michael Myers, for example. Sure, his is scary, but he is also partly ridiculous and silly because it's ridiculous and silly to believe that a human child would ever turn into an unstoppable killing machine that has no reason for killing and also cannot be killed by gun shots or fire or seemingly anything else. The movie makers understand this and respond accordingly by embracing the silly: they make the unstoppable killer a dancing circus clown. Now, I understand that to many people clowns are terrifying even if they aren't killing anyone. That's fair. Clowns don't really stir up those fears in me, but I find dolls endlessly creepy, so I get it. The fact remains that Pennywise most commonly takes the form of a clown, and clowns are silly. So, the movie also contains some appropriate silliness. The kids make crude jokes. A lot of them. Some of the things that Pennywise does blur the lines between silly and scary. Certain scenes, or at least certain moments within scenes, can be perceived as either scary or silly. The movie navigates this blend of silly and scary brilliantly. The scares begin early and strike with ferocity. The jump scares come only as necessary; they do not wear out their welcome. There's also a satisfying sprinkle of disturbing images and prolonged stints of dread to deliver frights. Many of the scariest moments contain no surprise element. The movie simply presents a terrifying image then shoves in down your throat until you gag on the creepiness. If this sounds uncomfortable that's because it is. After moments like those, the silliness provides a much-needed dash of comic relief to ease the tension. Other times the silliness lulls the audience into a false sense of security before slapping them in the face with something horrifying. This makes for an unpredictable and endlessly entertaining thrill ride. Entertainment is the primary goal of this movie, perhaps the only goal. With that in mind, don't think too much about how absurdly useless or villainous the adult characters are portrayed. Don't think too much about the one-dimensional and token nature of many child characters. Most of all, don't think too much about how this movie is different from the book (books and movies are separate entities; of course they are going to be different!). Don't overthink this movie. Just sit back and enjoy the silliness and scares. From the spectacular opening scene to the warm and comforting conclusion, this movie aims to entertain. It delivers.",8,12,26,9 September 2017
Hereditary," It'll leave you haunted well after you leave the theater
","You may have heard that this is the scariest movie since The Exorcist or that certain images are upsetting or that it will haunt you for an uncomfortably long time. None of that is hyperbole. 
It's all true.Hereditary builds slowly, patiently. It starts as a family drama circled by an aura of mystery about what has been passed down through their lineage. At first it seems to be movie about mental illness, then the movie is gradually revealed to be something else. And that something else is most horrifying movie in many, many years.The grandmother of a family has just died. Her adult daughter (Toni Collette), son-in-law and two grandchildren have varying reactions to her death. Grandma was a manipulative, mettlesome and disturbed woman, who had been largely estranged from the family. The only family member close to her was her granddaughter. After the grandmother's passing, strange occurrences take place. The grieving daughter's sleepwalking returns. The granddaughter has dark visions. So does the grandson. Then something tragic happens, and then everything escalates. The second half of the movie is pure nightmare fuel.I won't go into any further detail because the mystery and uncertainty of the plot is integral to the rising eerie vibe that engulfs this movie. The audience learns as the characters do, peeling back layers to uncover disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface. I can't say enough good things about the acting. Toni Collette deserves an Oscar nomination, Milly Shapiro hits a homerun in her film debut and Alex Wolff does laudable work as well.Director Ari Aster is a master at capturing emotion of the characters and enforcing those emotions on the audience. We don't just see their confusion and fear-we feel it. He brilliant constructs frames that leave something shadowy, possibly sinister, lurking in the corner. We think we see it but aren't certain. That uncertainty is unnerving. I imagine most of us will find ourselves checking the corners of our own homes for some time after witnessing this film. It imprints a haunting feeling that's tough to shake.Aster's willingness to let scenes linger allows his performers to reach the proper emotional levels. Collette and Shapiro are incredible at this. They emote so much with mere facial expressions. In many instances, their reactions are as chilling as the images themselves. This is a horror movie with very few jump scares. Instead, it builds skin-crawling discomfort through eerie music, creepy and ambiguous images, and devastating scares delivered at our most vulnerable moments. If you scare easily, do NOT watch this movie. It will haunt your dreams and waking hours for quite a while. If you like scary movies, this is an absolute must see. Just know that you're in for something disturbing. You've been warned.",9,47,91,13 June 2018
Detroit," Nails the What But Leaves Out the Why
","Director Katheryn Bigelow does a wonderful job of creating a great deal of tension. She does so by cutting from one tightly framed slightly wobbly shot to the next. Each character's face floods nearly the entire screen after each of these cuts. This makes the movie deeply personal and almost claustrophobic at times. The slight wobbles of the camera as it focuses on a face, adds to the uneasiness and unstable nature of the situation.What I'm saying is the movie is expertly directed. That's evident early on and remains that way throughout. The issue holding this movie back from becoming one of serious best picture caliber is the writing. The story felt a bit underdeveloped.The brief on-screen text explanation of the tension between the Detroit Police and the city's black residents could have served as a helpful addition to a setup that followed in the movie. I would have had no problem with that. But after the movie plays for 20 minutes or so, I realized that the text was the sole source of setup.That's a classic case of telling instead of showing. Movies are a video medium. Use that. Don't casually display the text on screen. This choice may have been made for the sake of time, but I think the filmmakers would have been wise to focus more on the setup aspect. The text explanation felt like an inconsiderate means of storytelling.After the opening text, the movie meanders for a while, eventually introducing the key characters and providing an appetizer of their personalities, foreshadowing their upcoming behavior.Moments like these showcased strengths in the writing. The writing did not completely ruin the movie; it simply was not an Oscar-contending performance, like Bigelow's work.The movie overall is well made, thanks in large part to Bigelow's deft direction, but it's not without flaws. One that I already mentioned is that I wanted the actual movie (not solely text) to better set the stage of this city that's on the verge of riot.The second criticism ties into the first. Because of the lack of stage setting, this becomes a movie that expertly depicts the what, but fails to fully deliver on the why.I see the riots. I see the emotional toll that police misconduct had on the abused citizens. I see the guilt that certain uniformed personnel felt for standing by and allowing the abuse to take place. What I didn't see enough of is why all this happened. I wanted a more personal detailing of what led up to the night shown in the movie. The actions are clear and powerful, but the motivations are vague and weak.I came away from the movie wondering what message the filmmakers hoped to convey. While the title is Detroit, the story has a much narrower focus. Were the clear majority of Detroit City Police Officers upstanding in their behavior, with only a few tragic bad apples? Given the choice focus on only a few officers and a select group of citizens, should I assume that these officers' misconduct was the norm or the exception? Perhaps it was not the filmmakers' intent to answer these questions. Maybe they only wanted to tell this specific story, without greater implications, which is fine. I just personally wanted to see a broader depiction of the city's atmosphere leading up to, during, and following the riots.",7,48,79,10 August 2017
A Star Is Born," A Remarkable Achievement
","Sometimes weighty expectations can crush a movie before it has any chance to pop. With 'A Star is Born,' a moving trailer and excited murmurs from film festivals, created seemingly unreachable levels of hype. Then, somehow, it reached them.In Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, he manages to instill life and a reasonable degree of freshness into a movie that had already been made three times previously. He clearly has a knack for capturing intimacy, and he uses that skill to make a movie that is deeply personal to himself, to co-star Lady Gaga, and to the characters they portray.It's a remarkable achievement that this movie works. Cooper certainly deserves heaps of credit for his directing acumen and committed acting performance (he worked with a vocal coach for months to lower his speaking voice a whole octave). His voice is low, rumbling, and worn. He sounds like someone who has just finished coughing for four and a half days straight. It suits the character, Jackson Maine, who struggles with drinking and drug use, all while still managing to perform nearly every night in front of thousands of fans who adore his music.One night he stumbles drunk into a bar and sees Ally (Gaga) performing. She wows him with her talent and inspires him ways that we sense he hasn't felt in years. In an approach that vacillates between creepy and romantic, he woos Ally by accepting her as she is, not who she thinks others want her to be.The next night when she attends his show, he whisks her on stage to sing the song they wrote together. The crowd goes berserk and soon the two are touring the country together. As her level of fame rises, he warns her that she must dig deep into her soul to create her art or she will lose everything.They each fight their own battles, his with drugs, alcohol and demons from his past, and hers with not letting fame change her. Cooper's character has more to work with, but it's Gaga who shines brightest on screen. We're all well aware of her immense musical talent, and now we know that she's also an exceptional actor, one who could find herself seriously in award conversation later this year.She may not be the only one from this film in the award conversation. Cooper's acting and directing will rightfully garner consideration as well. He aptly handles an ambitious, emotional story that does not hold back in any way. Its lack of humility should probably cause its downfall, but that's not the case. Credit both Cooper and Gaga for pulling this off. It looks like two stars have been born.",8,32,61,8 October 2018
Wind River," Taylor Sheridan depicts another dilapidated region of America
","If you've seen any of Taylor Sheridan's previous work, you probably noted that he has a certain style. He tells stories about ways of life in dilapidated regions of the country. He blurs the lines between 'good guys' and 'bad guys,' instead framing the status of the selected region as the truest villain. What's right and wrong, considering all the unique variables of each story, is not always clear. At least, that was case in Sicario and Hell or High Water. In Wind River, the region is still presented with all the strain that is causes on the lives of its residents, but a much more obvious villain is revealed before the movie is over. Hell of High Water frames the crumbling economy of a certain Texas region as the real source of evil, rather than any characters. Whereas in Wind River the source of evil is definitely the rapist. I mean, the rapist attempts to blame the cold and silence, but his actions were clearly much worse than bad weather. Sheridan's previous films also left doubt about who were the heroes, who the audience should be rooting for. This time it was much less ambiguous—they were the people searching for the rapist.An emerging theme in Sheridan's movies appears to be Tarantinoesque eruptions of violence, sometimes near the conclusion. They don't always reach the levels of the Django Unchained shootout, but Sheridan clearly isn't shy about showcasing the unforgiving damage that can be inflicted by firearms. Complaints, I have a few. On more than one occasion, I legitimately could not understand what a character had said, so I was left wondering if I missed something important. I'm not sure if this manner of speaking was a choice made by the actors or if this was a decision made by Sheridan to establish a certain tone. Either way, I could have used less mumbling. The other complaint that I have, and this is more serious, the middle third of the movie felt like it contained a lot of empty moments. This may or may not have been related to the times that I couldn't understand what a character said. Still, the movie could have used a bit of its fat trimmed. It wasn't as crisp and clean as Hell or High Water and Sicario. And I know I keep comparing this movie to Sheridan's others, but that's bound to happen when a writer sets the bar so high with two gems.On the whole, I consider this a success for Sheridan in his directorial debut. I'd happily watch another story of his about justice and an overlooked culture.",7,81,120,30 August 2017
The Babadook," A Haunting and Brilliant Unconventional Horror Classic
","So many modern scary movies follow the same patterns. They introduce a killer—sometimes a person, sometimes a supernatural being—then the killer proceeds to wreak havoc on the main characters. Most of the frightening content comes from jump scares and violence. It's all very procedural and drab.The Babadook breaks all the standard conventions. It does so right from the open.Typically in horror films, the opening sequence takes place a night, in an isolated location, with a lone female. She meanders about without a care in the world then boom! The killer strikes. Then the title flashes on screen.The Babadook begins much the same (except the lone female is with her young son rather than being alone). But no killer strikes. A purposefully framed shot lingers on screen, clearly foreshadowing something. Exactly what is not certain. Then the title flashes on screen. Viewers are left furrowing their brows and wondering, 'why that shot? I don't get it.' That's the point. You aren't supposed to understand. Not yet.Unlike most scary movies, it does not immediately make clear who or what the monster is. The monster isn't even introduced until nearly 30 minutes into the movie. It doesn't appear on screen until 20 minutes after that. By movie's end, it remains cloudy what exactly the monster is or if this monster is a real, tangible entity.As an enthusiastic scary movie fan, I cannot express how refreshing it is to see one that respects the audience's intelligence. Nothing is clearly spelled out. The mysterious nature fosters an eerie vibe that builds throughout the story. This causes the viewers to think and wonder, which is a vastly underused technique in scary movies. One of our greatest fears as humans is that of the unknown. This movie plays on that fear.This mysterious style, along with the creepy lifeless color scheme in the house, establish an unsettling tone. Some of the best scary movies ever made opt for tone as the main method of frights over the traditional jump scares. Setting and maintaining a tone takes far more effort and skill, which is why fewer movies choose that route. Appreciate this tactic. You won't often see it executed better.One of my favorite ways to judge the effectiveness of a scary movie is by how it sticks with me after it ends. In this case, I felt as much unease in the two hours following the credits as I did in those preceding them. The Babadook has a haunting brilliance that sticks with you. That's the sign of horror classic.",9,21,34,28 June 2017
Knives Out," Pure Entertainment
","2019 has blessed movie fans with an impressively strong finish to the year in film. Among the excellent movies released in the past few months, 'Knives Out' is perhaps the most purely entertaining. The star-studded cast pairing with a virtuoso director of consistently compelling movies served as powerful ingredients in the recipe for an entertaining movie, and the dish was prepared to perfection.Despite what a few angry Star Wars fanboys will tell you about Rian Johnson and his sacrilegious creation, 'The Last Jedi' Johnson is one of the better writer/directors in Hollywood. In my humble opinion, Johnson's Star Wars movie is perhaps the best in the saga.Nevertheless, Johnson's latest romp should please all audiences. This film boasts one of the most impressive casts in recent memory, each member of which plays against type in a delightfully over-the-top fashion. Leading the pack is Daniel Craig (James Bond himself) playing a brilliant investigator named Benoit Blanc and flashing the same accent he would if he became the new KFC Colonel in the latest commercial. Yes, his southern drawl is comically exaggerated, but that is completely intentional. Many the best lines in the movie come with an implied wink at the camera, letting us know that everyone is in on the joke. Even Chris Evans (the beloved Captain America and the perhaps more beloved Twitter voice of good) plays a loathsome spoiled child of an entitled upbringing, who ruthlessly insults his family and hates dogs. I'll let you decide which of those traits is worse.As a whodunnit, the movie is effective in ways you might not see coming and in plenty of ways you will. Even though the events leading to the death are revealed 40 minutes into the movie, Johnson manages to subvert expectations and remain steps ahead of viewers until the very end. I dare you to guess every twist and solve the puzzle before Blanc. The character often looks to be underwhelming as a detective, but that is also intentional. He eventually reveals himself to be multiple steps ahead the entire time.Raw humor, suspense, and caustic social commentary combine to elicit one of the best screenplays of the year, one that deserves serious Oscar consideration. When the dust settles and mystery has been solved, the end result is a charming and satisfying mystery/comedy. We all deserve more movies like this, and we can thank Johnson for giving us one.",8,45,100,16 December 2019
Deadpool 2," An Infusion of Fun New Characters Makes DP2 better than the First
","The first Deadpool received much acclaim for being bold and unique. Viewers loved that it did and said things other movies were not willing to do or say. That's an issue for Deadpool 2 because it's a sequel and, by definition, cannot be as bold or unique because it is, by definition, similar to the original.  Many fans raised this concern about Deadpool 2. They worried it would be a rehash of the first film. I'm here to tell you that those fans are wrong. And they're also right.  Sure Deadpool 2 hits many of the same beats as the original. Hearing the notes a second time ring stale in some situations, but other times the writers tweaked the gags just enough to make them feel fresh. 
 One of the simplest and best ways to make a sequel feel fresh is to add fun and interesting new characters. Mission accomplished. Domino (rising star Zazie Beetz) announces her arrival loudly with a scene-stealing performance. The movie cleverly pokes fun at her possibly fake superpower, luck, while still empowering her enough for her to easily be the coolest character in the movie.  Josh Brolin also joins the cast for the sequel, making this his second villain role in a major superhero blockbuster this summer. Once again, he's terrific, settling once and for all the debate over 'can Josh Brolin succeed as an actor without a fake purple chin?' Yes, yes he can.  The weak link among the actors is Julian Dennison. He plays the powerful and troubled teen, who call himself firefist. It's a terrible name and a mostly terrible character. It's not all Dennison's fault. He is not given much to work with in this part. The best thing he does in the whole movie is point out that no superhero or sidekick or remotely powerful person in a superhero movie is anything except exceptionally fit. He's right. Why not include one chubby friend who happens to have psychic powers? Or something like that. Be creative. Firefist's relationship with Deadpool, along with some other event that I won't mention, provide the emotional stakes of the movie. My question: why is a Deadpool movie creating emotional stakes? Deadpool's entire gimmick is making fun of superhero movies and all their silly tropes, yet Deadpool 2 falls face first into those tropes. This is supposed to be an action-comedy about a smart-mouth anti-hero. It doesn't need emotions. It rolls its eyes at emotions. The entire effort felt disingenuous. The determining factor in this whole equation of movie's effectiveness is Ryan Reynolds. If you like the guy and find him charming and funny, you'll like this movie. If his schtick wears you out after a while, this movie will do the same. He rattles off what feels like nearly ten jokes per minute. Reynolds brand of comedy is an acquired taste and a potent one. A little goes a long way. Overall, this movie works. It has just enough humorous moments, new material, and truth in its characters to accomplish the goal. It's a funny, self-aware, different type of superhero movie. It manages to match, or perhaps even exceed the level of the original. That's an achievement.",6,19,38,6 June 2018
Ready Player One," An Entertaining VR Movie that Ignores Real-World Problems
","If you are just looking for a fun movie with expertly directed action sequences, wow moments, and beautiful effects, this is the movie for you. If you are the type of person who cannot help but analyze every movie you see, Ready Player One will cause you some problems.  Spielberg is a master of wow moments. He knows how to capture characters in moments of awe, and he knows how to make the audiences respond with dropped jaws and bewildered expressions. That's why the guy is one of the most financially successful filmmakers of all time. Watching this particular film of his makes it easy to see, even if you weren't already aware of his reputation, that Spielberg works the camera like few others can. That said, this movie is not perfect.  The premise, at least on its surface, seems wonderful. A teenage boy (Tye Sheridan), named Wade Watts (because it sounds like a superhero's alter ego) in the near future plays an ultra-version of a virtual reality game to escape his grim real-world existence. Everyone in his world does. And we can see why. The VR world (The Oasis) is awesome.  Wade spends his time obsessing over a contest in The Oasis left behind by its now deceased creator. The winner of the contest claims a kajillion dollars (or something like that) and control over The Oasis. With a prize like that, Wade is obviously not the only person trying to win. So, one day he meets a girl who uses the player name Art3mis (a charming Olivia Cooke) and joins her group. Together they try to win the contest before the evil company does and puts ads in The Oasis (which doesn't seem that bad). Then blah, blah, blah. You can imagine how this all turns out. If not, great, you'll be surprised. This all seems fine and fun until you dissect the movie even a little bit. The message the movie sends is that this is all about friendship, which is total BS. Friendship is important, sure, but in this world, there is more at stake. Wade and much of the country live in terrible poverty, and a couple mega-businesses control the state of everything. It's a miserable reality with problems that we see today, except amplified by 100.  It's irresponsible and insulting that the movie pretends that this future world will be okay as long as The Oasis doesn't have ads. People still live in poverty. The world is still in shambles. What I'm saying is, the movie has a problem with stakes. The stakes of this future world are enormous and dire, but the movie chooses to ignore them. That doesn't sit right with me.  One other issue, and this one is minor, is that this movie seems like it's made for kids, but it makes a bunch of 80s nostalgia references. Does that make sense? I don't think today's 14-year-olds care about Duran-Duran.  Even looking past the social blinders this movie chooses to wear and the confusing nostalgia choices, the third act drags horribly. I spaced out for a good ten minutes and didn't miss a thing.  In spite of all that, this movie has moments of ecstasy. If you are going to see, and I'm not sure if you should, see it in a theater. If you can avoid analyzing the movie and simply enjoy it from a pure entertainment standpoint, you may love it.",6,98,176,11 April 2018
Molly's Game," Sorkin and Chastain Flourish in this Fun, Fast-paced Ride
","As is the case with all Aaron Sorkin movies, Molly's Game (based on a true story) pummels you with sharp, rapid-fire verbal jabs. Sorkin confidently dances circles around you, dizzying you with repartee, occasionally dropping your jaw with powerful verbal combinations. His scripts come at you aggressively. He hopes to leave you dazzled by the speed and impact of the dialogue, and he succeeds. As a first-time director, he delivers the same speed and ferocity with the creative camera work and cuts in the opening scene of Molly's Game. The sequence is a whirlwind of clever explanations through narration and visuals. Immediately it becomes clear-this guy knows what he's doing behind the camera. The remainder of the first hour zooms along in a similarly spectacular fashion. Jessica Chastain shines as Molly Bloom, the poker princess. She exhibits the class, composure, and tenacity required of someone who ran the most elegant poker games in the country for billionaires, athletes, and actors. And, most importantly, she smoothly rattles off all the light-speed Sorkin dialogue in a natural-sounding cadence. The movie doesn't work without the perfect actress playing Molly. Chastain is perfect. While Chastain delivers her powerhouse performance with swagger, Idris Elba (playing her fictitious lawyer), falls a bit flat. I don't blame Elba, who has consistently proven to be a more than capable performer. His part feels underwritten. As skilled as Sorkin as with dialogue, he does not always create the most compelling or complete supporting characters in his stories. Elba does deliver one devastating speech with great earnestness. It's a touch preachy, but he says what had needed to be said the entire movie. I was grateful.The poker scenes bring a lot of fun to the table (sorry, it was right there). Each character represents a real-life celebrity or rich guy or at least an amalgam of a few real-life players. I had great fun guessing which character was which celebrity as I watched. Then I looked up the names later (obviously). That part was fun too. At some point about halfway through, the movie hits a lull. It drags. It's never boring, but it doesn't hit with quite the same fury. Not every scene feels necessary, so the length becomes noticeably extensive. The movie definitely needs a trim.After regaining its footing, the movie seems to be on the way to a satisfying conclusion. Then a bizarre ice-skating scene leads into an unwatchably awful three-minute therapy session. I nearly covered eyes and plugged my ears. Tough to forgive that one. Despite the one horrendous moment, the movie offers far more good than bad. It's fun. It's smart. It's a commendable directorial debut from a long-time writing superstar, Aaron Sorkin, and it's one of Jessica Chastain's finest performances to date.",7,14,23,3 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee at his best
","Spike Lee's talent never left. As is the case with great filmmakers, his perspective, his style and his vision have been present in all his work. As is also the case with great filmmakers, some of his work simply towers above the rest. 'Blackkklansman' is one of those towering achievements. The film is difficult to classify because it transcends a single genre. At various times it's funny, dramatic, suspenseful, provocative. Often, it's many things at once. The one consistency of this heterogenous mixture, is excellence.The story revolves around a college graduate, Ron Stallworth, who becomes the first black person to work for the Colorado Springs Police Department. Playing Ron is John David Washington, who, like his father, Denzel, carries himself and speaks with composure and power. He has a way of calmly making his presence felt without ever posing a threat, which is why the police chief believes he can command respect and handle the abuse he will surely take from the racist civilians (and fellow officers). Ron quickly wins a chance to go undercover at a speaking event for a former black panther leader. His task to learn if the speaker is looking to incite violence (he's not). After a successful first mission, Ron is assigned to undercover work, and, one a whim, calls the number for the local KKK that he read in the paper. Buttering up the Klan-or as they call themselves, the organization-with fake white supremacist talk, he arranges a meeting. Since he's black, he teams up with a white officer, Flip (Adam Driver, who is spectacular in his role), to form the combined Ron Stallworth. It works like a charm because, as the real Ron says, 'with the right white man, we can do anything.' Spike Lee is fair in his portrayal of everyone. Within some of the Klansman, there exists a puzzling contradiction-they're polite, courteous, and charismatic, but they're also despicable racists. Klan national director, David Duke, gracious to all the people all the white people he meets, but also says things like, 'blacks are an in inferior race. It's a fact.' Topher Grace plays Duke, a challenging role, with nuance and something that resembles likability (aside from the racism, obviously). Duke and a couple other Klansman are the kind of people that you could meet without knowing anything about them, and you might describe them as gentlemen. That is, until they slip a racist comment into conversation. Other members of the Klan are slobbering, disgusting overt racists. Both types of people feel real, because they both are. The police are portrayed fairly too. Some are evolved, others are trying but not quite there, and others are just as appalling as the slobbering, disgusting overt racist Klansman. Spike Lee is at his best, as he typically is when working with material about race in America. Subtlety isn't always his strength or his intention, hence the mix of over-the-top and subtle racism. He opts to hammer home his message at the film's closing with some footage of last year's march in Charlottesville and the sound bites from a certain political figure that followed. Some viewers may argue that this footage wasn't needed. I think the film would work fine without it, but it certainly adds an extra punch.The film's narrative is so utterly fascinating as a crime story that the elements of race could be removed and the movie would still work. But, it's the poignant social commentary that elevates the project to best picture contention. There's so much going on that it's definitely a movie that needs to be watched twice. As great as it is the first time, I imagine that it's even better on the second viewing. In any case, 'Blackkklansman' is one of the best movies of the year and one we will likely be thinking about for a long time.",10,54,132,21 August 2018
Suicide Squad," What a Waste
","Suicide Squad is a total freaking mess. A colorful, yet bleak scattershot of stuff sprayed on a big screen. The movie is like one of those paintings where someone randomly splattered different colors all over a large canvas then called it art.The movie's greatest disappoint is easily The Joker. Granted that following Heath Ledger's iconic performance was going to be impossible for anyone, Jared Leto's character still fell short of even one's more reasonable expectations.Leto made some weird choices. Not weird in a good way, just weird. For one, his Joker played as oddly seductive. I suppose the movie had to give us some reason to believe he landed Harley Quinn, but this part of his persona still felt strange. Plus he wore diamond-studded earrings and flashed some bizarre metallic teeth. He looked half like The Joker and half like some unstable rap mogul.The worst part about The Joker in this movie, and the movie itself, is that he wasn't really necessary. With a small change he could have been removed from the story entirely. The writers just forced him in, probably to appease fans.Similarly, Leto's performance felt forced. His voice, his breathing, his expressions, they didn't seem totally convincing. Perhaps Leto tried too hard to distinguish himself from Ledger's adaptation. Whatever the case, this Joker let me down.Incidentally his love interest, Harley Quinn, highlighted the movie. She delivered an impressive performance and an even more impressive sex appeal. That alone kept the movie watchable at times. It's not really what I look for in a bad-ass superhero/super-villain movie, but if you're going to throw Margot Robbie's ass in my face 15 times in two hours, I'm going to watch.That's all for praise, back to the flaws.The soundtrack annoyed me greatly. To open the movie, each character is introduced, accompanied by a song that I like by itself but hate in the context of the scene since it doesn't fit. The filmmakers want us to empathize with the characters they introduce. We do not, save for Will Smith's Deadshot because he has a charming daughter to look after. Deadshot turns out to be one of the film's top two most intriguing characters (along with Quinn), thanks to Smith's fine acting. Seeing Will Smith in movies again makes me happy. I missed him. Just throwing that out there.After meeting the other baddies, we learn about Enchantress, an ancient spirit witch who has lived for over 6,000 years. She is a part of the suicide squad, or maybe she's not. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the one introducing the suicide squad, does not make this clear. It's one of many unanswered questions I had at this point of the movie, and still have after now long after the movie ended.Another, who is Amanda Waller and why is she the one assembling this team? Why did she put the bottle containing Enchantress's brother on her nightstand instead of a secure location? Why did the writers choose to make Killer Croc so uncomfortably racist? Actually, why is Killer Croc even a thing at all? After the intros, Enchantress frees her brother and the two wreak havoc on the city. Cue the suicide squad deployment. Big battle. You get the gist.Despite immense potential and the occasional epic moment, the movie's sloppiness overshadows the high points. I imagine it was hastily rewritten or re-shot a couple times before final edits, so that probably caused the film's scattered nature and often unfocused plot.As many flaws as Suicide Squad has, at least it's better than Fantastic Four.",3,9,16,7 August 2016
Interstellar," A visual and auditory marvel
","Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, 'we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.' For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",10,33,43,13 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Skywalker Saga Finale Falls Flat
","Please, hang with me. This is a fairly long review. I'm going to say some things that some readers will disagree with, some things they might find offensive, and I'm sorry about that. I adore Star Wars and hope that people who disagree can still engage in healthy, respectful discussion. My Star Wars fan friends disagree with each other about certain parts of the saga, but we always remain respectful, and we have plenty of fun and insightful conversations. Hopefully readers will use this review as jumping off point for conversations of their own.Here we go.It was doomed to fail from the start.'The Rise of Skywalker' creatives made a concerted effort to sweep away everything from Episode 8, 'The Last Jedi.' Many fans were ticked off about Rian Johnson's vision and execution of the film, going so far to call it Star Wars blasphemy.Writers of Episode 9 decided that charting a storyline that swiftly and starkly deviates 9 as the only way to appease angry Star Wars fans. It was this choice that doomed Episode 9. There was simply no way to successfully pull off the finale of the Skywalker saga given this chosen direction. Writers were forced to spend the first 40 minutes attempting to explain the reason for this sudden shift in the story, and the explanation does not go well.All the exposition in the first third of the movie is rushed, crammed, forced, and confounding. It's impossible to make sense of because there is little sense to be made. The writers would have been better off beginning the crawl with,'We would like to apologize to all the fans who were upset by Episode 8. This is our attempt to make you feel better. This first part of the movie will be confusing, but we believe the gobs of fan service will ultimately relieve your untamed ager. May the force be with you.'It's a real shame. The entire movie overflows with choices made out of fear of upsetting fans. There's zero courage, which powerfully limits the movie's capacity to produce compelling and memorable moments. Also absent in the film - in a saga renowned for its classic dialogue - are any lasting quotes. Likewise with all of its scenes and settings. The story takes characters so abruptly quickly from one unfamiliar planet to another that one can hardly recall the names of any of them. The memorable scenes are startlingly few and far between. At the moment, I can remember a couple Rey-Lo moments. That's about it.Ok, it's time for some MASSIVE SPOILERS.Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter. Why? Why do this? It doesn't seem to make much sense, or any sense, really. Perhaps it's done to explain Rey's power level, but that's unnecessary. She can simply be powerful. There's no need to reduce the limitations of powerful force-sensitive characters to only those who descend from Skywalkers and Palpatines.Since we're in this area, let's talk about why Palpatine is here. The choice to include him is an unnecessary one. Palpatine's presence here is essentially the writers' admission that they don't believe in the new characters they created. They're telling everyone that Kylo and the First Order aren't enough to be the 'big bad' in this movie. So, they brought back a previously effective bad guy back from the dead. It's deeply disappointing.Next up, I'll run through a few important moments that turned out to be entirely inconsequential.C-3PO has his memory wiped, which we all saw in the trailer. In the trailer it was presented as a sort of emotional climax. In the movie it absolutely was not. The movie plays it as a joke, as our shiny droid friend stumbles around making introductions to all his friends until R-2 gives him his memory back. Not stakes. No consequences. Viewers are led to believe the memory wipe matters and then the movie quickly reassures us that everything is fine. No need to get upset.Chewbacca dies. Then he doesn't. Again, fans are cheaply deceived, this time into thinking Rey's inability to control her power resulted in her striking a ship with force lightning, causing it to explode, killing the saga's beloved Wookie. At least until 10 minutes later when we see Chewie is alive. This reveal means all the stakes have evaporated. Instead of having a meaningful moment in which Rey accidentally kills a close friend and popular character among fans, we are again quickly reassured that everything is fine. Rey doesn't have a chance to consider her actions and the path she might be leading down. She can't explore the consequences because there are none. Sadly, the lack of consequences is a common theme throughout the movie.Okay, that's about all I'll say about this movie, or maybe I'm just tired of ranting. Episode isn't terrible, but it's certainly not one of the best Star Wars movies. I just wished The Skywalker Sage would have ended on a better note.",5,13,20,29 December 2019
Nightcrawler," A Hannibal-like performance by Gyllenhaal
","Jake Gyllenhaal carries the movie. That much is clear. His performance is chilling, yet charming. It is apathetic, yet humorous. It is disheartening, yet inspiring. He masterfully coerces the audience into falling victim to the charm of a character who is by all accounts unlikable. It reminded me somewhat of Anthony Hopkins' iconic performance as Hannibal Lecter. Relax. This was not quite the transcendent perfection that Hopkins displayed as Hannibal, but the characters had a similar effect.As the film opens, we find out just about everything that we need to know about Lou Bloom within the first five minutes. Lou is attempting to steal fencing and other metals to sell for scrap when he is caught by a security guard. The guard questions Lou, to which he retorts a number of lame lies. Upon spotting a sleek watch on the guard's wrist, Lou wrestles him to ground and flees with the watch and materials. He then attempts to sell the materials, negotiating skillfully and rattling off prices with expertise. After the sale is made, he attempts to finagle a job from the manager, who turns him down repeatedly. He then stumbles upon a graphic car accident, where he stares, sans any emotion. A man filming the scene informs Lou that he is a freelance nighttime news journalist (nightcrawler). From these opening events, we learned that Lou is sleazy, manipulative, ambitious, smart, and creepy.The remainder of the film serves only to provide further evidence to support our original impressions of Lou, and it makes a strong case. He is a fascinating character, one with many idiosyncrasies, the most prescient of which is his obsession with control. He seeks control constantly. He spends much of his time reading about tactics of management, conflict, negotiation, and communication. He is able to recite passages from readings with machine-like accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, Lou is very successful in his attempts to manipulate and control, and when something does not fit his rigid expectations, he does not like it. So he makes changes. These changes are often illegal, immoral, and creepy. He does not like people, mostly because they are undependable, and they ruin the control for which he thirsts.One person that he did like was a network station manager named Nina (Rene Russo). Initially, they get along well because he impresses her with his work as a nightcrawler. But then he inevitably tries to manipulate her while they are out at dinner. He makes a proposition that they begin a sexual relationship, which she firmly declines, making the scene awkward. The situation quickly turns droll when Lou seems oblivious to how uncomfortable he has just made Nina feel until she bluntly informs him. To alleviate the tension, he efficiently (his perspective) and rudely (everyone else's perspective) asks her to leave.Just as he did dinner with Nina, Lou often had a peculiar style for handling people. He operated very much like a robot that had been programmed through countless hours of reading articles online about controlling human situations. Thanks to his lightning-quick learning ability and his accompanying encyclopedic knowledge, he was able to recite textbook-style monologues and quips, which were darkly humorous, unnerving and charming if not intimidating all at once. This style of speaking contained brutal honesty and consistently succinct speech used for clarity, which were amusing given their perfectly machine-like efficiency and lack of any semblance of social acceptability. Lou operated negotiations and manipulations like a genius, but totally flopped at establishing personal relationships because he was so emotionally off putting. He clearly struggled to understand others' emotions, yet he anticipated the thoughts of others very well. A subtle and fascinating distinction.Lou's inability to understand the emotions of others is not at all surprising when we observe him constantly behave with complete apathy. He shows zero remorse for any of his sinister decisions, no matter how grave the outcomes. He manages to maintain a completely calm disposition throughout the entire film, aside from one scene that seemed out of place. In all other cases, Lou never lost his cool no matter how intense the circumstances were around him. The only emotions that he ever displayed seemed contrived, as if he was acting in that manner because he thought that people expected him to. Or perhaps it was all a part of his ever present manipulative tactics.In the film's final sequence, there are no redeeming moments for Lou or for any character. Lou never improves or worsens as a person during the movie. The events simply reveal in more detail exactly what a kind of person like Lou is capable of. Apparently in a chaotic nighttime atmosphere in L.A., people like Lou can do just about anything.",8,4,6,14 November 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Some good, but too much bad
","It's not Rami Malek's fault. Let's make that clear. He comes through with a fittingly outrageous performance and should be commended, especially considering all the mistakes taking place around him. His prosthetic teeth are cartoonish, but he pulls them off just fine. He also pulls off the voice, the posture and the curious wandering eyes that that make manifest his burgeoning sexuality that slowly becomes clear to him.'Bohemian Rhapsody' the movie's greatest problem is that there is no clear message or meaning. It's intentionally eclectic and mixed, but this concept works much better for the song than it does for the feature film. It never quite reveals what it's meant to say. If it only meant to pay cutesy fan service to the adoring Freddie Mercury and Queen fans of the world, then it's a job well done. If it meant to offer any other sort of statement about sexual expression or friendship or the creation of music, then it's mostly a miss.The movie's greatest failure is its insistence on submitting constant winking in-jokes about Queen. When Mike Myers' music executive character says that no one will ever sing along to Bohemian Rhapsody while riding in a car, we all chuckle. Or, at least, we're supposed to. The crowd around me certainly did, but I just rolled my eyes. Moments like are not as clever as the filmmakers believe them to be.The other greatest failures come from an inability to make moments believable. The lip syncing could be overlooked (even though it's awful) because no actor can reasonably be expected to make that perfect, but it's the director's issue for not choosing alternate angles to hide the mouths. Worse than the lip syncing is Freddie's relationship with his father. Dad is a classic conservative who disapproves of Freddie's lifestyle (the singing more so than the homosexuality, we're led to believe), and that's the entirety of their relationship until the cringeworthy resolution near the end. It's not even worthy of being considered manipulative because it's so weakly executed.Another thing: did Freddie really not know he was gay until Queen had been a smashing success for years? Everyone else seemed to know and accept it. That seemed to be a bizarre choice of the writers.If you love the music and absolutely adore Queen, you'll probably like this movie. But if you look to poke any holes at all in film itself, you'll spring a few dozen leaks. Freddie deserved better than this.",5,246,376,27 November 2018
Bird Box," Not worth the hype
","Bird Box has a fun concept and huge star (Sandra Bullock) that combined to make this one of the most streaming Netflix movies ever. It's memeable though not exactly memorable. In a year, how clearly will you remember the plot and the ending? How well do you remember it right now?The movie is fine for a night of mindless entertainment. That's about it.It features a problematic storytelling technique. The flashbacks remove some of what would have been the most suspenseful moments of the film. Instead of wondering what will happen and who will survive, viewers connect a few simple dots and figure out the answer. Suspense gone.Many moments lean too heavily into the blood and violent imagery for effect. These tactics work to an extent, but they elicit cheap reactions. They are not earned, and they are not lasting.Upon some reflection after watching, I found myself wondering, 'what is this movie about?' A woman unsure if she can learn to love her child? I suppose, but what does the end of the world have to do with her plight? I couldn't find a clear answer.",5,37,55,29 October 2019
Baby Driver," The Most Fun Movie in Many Years
","Baby Driver wins you over immediately.It opens with four people in a car. Three of them are about to commit robbery and the fourth is going to drive them away—that's Baby. As soon as the others leave the car, Baby starts jamming to his lucky robbery song and he does so to a cartoonish extent without an ounce of self-doubt. It sounds cheesy, but it's not, and it also kind of is but in the most charming way possible. Don't worry, it works.As the three others sprint back to the car after finishing their work inside, Baby steals the show. The police chase that ensues is the best one in many, many years. Baby's skills, along with those of the director, make for a dazzling display that will leave your jaw dropped. Keep in mind, this entire sequence is brilliantly enhanced by an absolutely perfect song for the occasion.That's a trend throughout the movie—the music maintains a steady flow of fun energy that always elevates the action, never distracting from it. Don't try to keep your toe from tapping or your head from nodding. The music will win. It's unstoppable.The opening scene provides both a seductive tease and a prescient indication of what will follow. It's all fun and games, even in the perilous parts.Remember how Jamie Foxx subtly stole the show in Horrible Bosses? He does that again here, only to an extent 10x greater. That's not to say he overshadows anyone. They each shine too brightly to stand in anyone's shade.Each actor stars in his or her own role. They thrive. The music thrives. The action thrives. And the Baby drives. Go watch the magic happen.",9,18,33,20 July 2017
Justice League," The Team of Heroes Deserves a Better Villain
","If there were a real fight between Marvel and DC superhero movies, the referee would have stopped it a long time ago. Alas, this is not a one vs. one bout-both can continue to win. DC movies continue to make money (somehow). So once again we watch another dreary Zack Snyder landscape in a movie that looks inappropriately gloomy for one that includes people who fly.  Mercifully, Justice League is better than a few recent DC movie disasters, such as Suicide Squad and Batman vs. Superman. It still falls far short of the exceptional Wonderwoman, but in relative DC terms it feels like a win. 
Part of that comes from actual genuine efforts to have fun. This movie has jokes. Sure, not all of them are funny, but at least one of the filmmakers (likely Joss Whedon) is trying to sprinkle in some joy.  Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) shoots his shot. He may truly be funny. It's just hard to tell because so many of his lines are not. He delivers them earnestly and with proper comic timing, but he's not quite a comedy giant who can will subpar material to hilarious levels by sheer force of charisma. That's not a knock against him. Few actors ever have possessed such talents. I only wish his co-stars on screen put in half his effort. Gal Gadot was fine, not sparkling like she was in Wonderwoman but fine. To the other superhero stars-I'm not at all impressed. You can do better. Perhaps they lost their energy after reading the script, which is littered with hacky dialogue and boring, predictable plot points. Something happens at some point, but it doesn't go well so the team seeks help from someone to calm down the other someone (that's my anti-spoiler phrasing). This entire sequence of something could be considered a surprise but only if you have never seen another movie before. If that is the case, welcome to movies. Many of them are much better than this one.The greatest flaw in the movie-and I know I'm burying the lead here-is that the villain is awful. Steppenwolf is the least complicated, least interesting villain in recent memory. He wants to acquire power because he wants to be powerful. There's nothing deeper or more complicated than that. The most interesting thing about him-he's tall. Cool.  That is essentially his only defining trait. No, wait. I forgot that he also carries an axe. That may be interesting to someone. The point is that he's about as deep as a raindrop, and an entire team of superheroes deserves a more compelling adversary.Stay with me, just two more nitpicks. One, I cannot stand seeing Amy Adams this tragically underutilized. She's a treasure, and this movie pays her a tremendous disservice. Two, this is second recent DC movie to blatantly exploit the most attractive female character's butt. For real, there are so many butt shots of Gal Gadot in this movie that it almost seems like certain scenes were filmed by a horny teenager. If you're a DC diehard or pathological fan of superhero movies (my group meets every other Thursday), you can see this movie and not completely hate it. Otherwise, I recommend giving this a hard pass. Instead, go see Black Panther. It's 1000x times better.",3,11,19,26 February 2018
American Beauty," Delivers a beautiful, lasting message
","When I first watched American Beauty, I was in awe. To many, this feeling was mutual. I, like most viewers, felt as if I had just witnessed the ultimate achievement in cinema—a film that actually changed my life. I thought it was the deepest, most profound film ever. I believed the message. I was ready to appreciate all the beauty in the world.Fast forward a few years, my view changed. American Beauty is creepy and pretentious and stomach churningly awkward and so over the top at times that it elicits eye rolls. I don't mean to rip the movie completely. Upon second viewing, I still enjoyed it immensely. It's aware and insightful, even if it's not quite as profound as everyone believed 15 years ago. In any case, American Beauty remains an Oscar worthy movie, in part, because of the flawless acting of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, who play two iconic roles even though they're essentially playing clichés, which is a super under-appreciated accomplishment. Seriously, think about it. They play a nuclear suburban couple in an ordinary neighborhood with an ordinary teenage daughter (despite what Ricky thinks about her) and ordinary family issues. Even the greatest sources of conflict in the movie (her affair and his mid-life crisis) are exceedingly ordinary. And still they manage to give extraordinary and lasting performances. Impressive work.All that ordinary really serves as the point of the film. Ricky, the kid who films stuff, sees things that most people consider ordinary and frames them in his mind as 'beautiful.' To an extent, he has a wonderful, enlightened perspective. Except for when he crosses the threshold into weird. Case and point: 'Ricky, why are you filming that dead bird?' 'Because it's beautiful.' That's an iffy assertion at best, Ricky. I'm all about finding beauty in everyday places, but I find many things a heckuva lot more beautiful than a dead bird. For one, a living bird.American Beauty has a worthwhile message; we've established that. But the message means little if not delivered properly. Thankfully it is.In fact the message delivery is the strength of the film. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to present this family living the American dream, a ubiquitous concept, while exploring it with a deep, multi-perspective approach.It deconstructs the whole concept of the American dream. We see the nuclear family—husband, wife and daughter. They live in a nice house in a beautiful neighborhood. The parents each work good jobs. The daughter attends a nice school. They should all be perfectly happy. Yet As we peel back the layers, we see the flaws. The daughter hates her parents and struggles to fit in at high school. Mom tries and fails to connect with her daughter while she also tries and fails at work. Dad seems to have lost interest in all things aside from lusting after his daughter's teenage friend.They are miserable.This all forces us to ask: this is the American dream? What's so great about this? As the story ultimately winds to its conclusion, it arrives at the restoration of hope in the form of a super weird and creepy character experiencing an epiphany. *NOTE* I'm talking about Lester (Kevin Spacey), not Ricky, even though he is also creepy and weird. I know I hit on this already, but it demands a second mention. Quite frankly Ricky is more than just strange. He's kind of a pompous tool who is largely responsible for taking the movie from profound to 'come on dude, it's just a plastic bag' levels of pretentiousness. It almost makes me glad President Snow killed him at the end of The Hunger Games 13 years later.How perfect is that role for him? When you picture Ricky 13 years later, can't you totally imagine him designing the layout of a game in which kids fight to the death? It makes perfect sense to me. He would probably think The Hunger Games are beautiful. *END OF NOTE* Anyway, back to Lester's epiphany.Lester turned his life around, in large part, due to his pursuit of a fantasy. But when he had a chance to live that fantasy, he turned it down. That was his epiphany. His real one, not the one he thought he had after smoking weed with Ricky.No, that night with Angela was the moment of his true breakthrough. He realizes that lusting after his daughter's friend is icky. More than that, he started to see things for what they really were. His fantasy girl was really just an innocent, vulnerable teenager. His daughter was really a special young lady he raised. His wife was really the woman he fell in love with.Being with Angela was not what he really wanted. He had what he wanted all along. Even with his current problems, he chose his reality over his fantasy. He had a wife, a daughter, a great life. Somewhere along the way he just forgot.I could probably ramble for another few thousand words about this movie, I better wrap things up.American Beauty sends a worthy message about appreciating the little things in life, the ones most of us take for granted. Experiencing the movie is like swimming through gorgeous ocean water in the Caribbean. It's wonderful, you just have to navigate through the seaweed of affairs and ignore the gross oil spill doubling as a 40 year old guy fantasizing about banging a high school cheerleader.If you can do that, you will take away something useful from this movie. And you'll have a fun time while you do it.",7,8,12,18 August 2016
Mamma Mia!," Quickly Loses Steam and becomes Exhausting to Watch
","I'm not opposed to musicals, as long as they are done well, like 'La La Land.' And though I would not call myself a huge fan of ABBA, I do enjoy a handful of their songs, many of which were used in the movie. Still, this is certainly not a movie made for me. If you love musicals and ABBA and cheesy romances, you'll probably love this movie too. If your tolerance for an absurd storyline and endless decadent musical numbers is low, you should avoid this one. At first, I didn't have to try-I just liked it. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried exude such bubbly energy and joy that it's all easy to enjoy. The plot is somewhat believable-a soon-to-be-married girl invites three strangers to her wedding, anyone of whom may be her father. She hopes to meet her father and have him walk her down the aisle. Her mother, who hasn't seen any of the men in 20 years, has no idea what her daughter has planned. One thing leads to the next, and one song leads to the next, and try as I did, I couldn't manage to keep liking the movie. The whimsy wears thin before long. Eventually, it all builds to a ridiculous bit of inconceivable nonsense. Then more reckless decisions are made and celebrated. The next sound you'll hear isn't music. It's the slap of countless palms hitting foreheads throughout the audience. Even before the troublesome ending, the movie just runs out of steam. Then it carries on for another hour. Evidently, it's difficult to construct a cohesive and compelling movie plot around a bunch of ABBA songs (no kidding!). And to anyone who isn't an ABBA superfan, the songs become exhausting. Song plugs feel forced, and actual non-song-related conversations disappear, as does any hope that the downhill slide can be stopped. What else is there to say? The beautiful island and mostly charming characters are not enough to overcome the weak and absurd plot.",4,1,1,19 July 2018
It Follows," Eerie, Atmospheric Style that Sticks with You Long after the Movie Ends
","Some movies ease into their stories the way you might ease into a warm bath. Others cannonball into a swimming pool. 'It Follows' takes the latter route.During the opening credits, you hear the sound of air being sucked in, like you're taking a long deep breath through pursed lips. Suddenly the sound ceases and the screen hard cuts to a serene tree-lined suburban street, lingers there for a moment, then slowly pans to an ordinary-looking house. It's a calming scene. For about 10 seconds.Then a young woman crashes out the front door and bolts down the block in her high heels, as thundering music floods your ears. She's clearly running from something, but we can't see what it is (listen closely and you can hear the front door open and close after her even though we don't see anyone come outside). She loops back to her driveway, hops in her car, and zips down the road. Next, we see her at a beach, trembling in the sand with the headlights facing her. She calls her dad and tells him she's sorry and that she loves him. She senses her time is nearly up.In the morning, we see her disfigured body lying on the beach with her legs bent in disturbing directions. Woah. That's when I was hooked.Director David Robert Mitchell cleverly plays off the trope that sex-having horror film characters must die. The invisible something that chased the girl in the opening scene is later revealed to be a curse that is passed from one person to another through sex. Once you have sex with the 'infected' person, the monster becomes visible to you (and remains visible even after you pass it on). It can take the form of anyone - a stranger or someone you know. Then it follows.Mitchell pays homage to horror classic 'Halloween' with scenic wide shots and a carefully developed eerie atmosphere. But make no mistake: this is a wholly original film. The music establishes the tone of ill ease throughout the film. Viewers are never made comfortable at any point because we are constantly reminded about looming doom. Mitchell sprinkles shots of a person slowly approaching from a distance, barely in focus. Is that the monster? We're never sure. We never feel safe. It's the exact horror facing each of the 'infected' characters - they never feel safe.Mitchell manages to scare us without turning to the comfortable, cliched 'boo' scares that populate so many lame horror movies today. Aside from one or two effective jump scares, the film relies on an unrelenting buildup dread to satisfy its horror quota. It's a much more impactful approach than jump scares, which last mere seconds. The scares in this movie stick with you.One of my favorite filmmaking choices in the movie is that when the protagonist, Jay (played with vulnerability and humanity by Maika Monroe) learns about the monster, she doesn't hide her situation. She convinces her friends to help her. Instead of separating the characters and letting them get picked off by the monster, Mitchell opts to show how they come together to protect their friend.If the monster is meant to represent an STD or sexual assault and the shame that follows, then the message is clear: talk to your friends about it. Let them help you, because this is not something you want to face alone.",9,9,13,5 November 2019
City of God," Good, but underwhelming
","The opening scene set the tone for what was to come in the next two hours. What should have been a jolting and gripping experience, ended up underwhelming. The events should have made for a dramatic and even suspenseful sequence, but the ancillary movie elements added little to the scene. A chicken is tied to a post. We can sense its fear. It knows it has no chance of survival in this environment so it flees from this world of death and destruction. The tormentors give chase and we see the chicken desperately seeking salvation through escape. The metaphor is not lost. This is a corrupt and loathsome place, and escape to the safety of an outside world is the only way to live. Beautiful. I want to love this opening, but something just isn't quite there. I can see and comprehend the message, but I just don't feel it. Then a young man emerges and stalks the chicken from behind as a group of gangsters armed with machine guns watches him approach their target. More armed gangsters appear, and soon the young man and the chicken are surrounded. The young man surveys the area and hesitates. My heart should be pounding, but I remain perfectly tranquil. The ideas and events are in place. This quality of this premise is off the charts. We can already imagine that this film will be about choices that lead people down different paths in life. We envision the different themes emerging, such as the unjust suffering of innocents, like the chicken. This movie should have me on the edge of my seat and on the brink of emotional eruption, but it doesn't. Not much changes during the remainder of the film. The storytelling is phenomenal, aside from a few over explanations via flashbacks. The acting is hit and miss. The characters entice, but fail to completely generate the attachment to them that I wanted to feel. In the word, the film was underwhelming. So much potential, not completely wasted, but not completely utilized either. A good movie that should have been great.",7,6,10,1 August 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," The Villain makes the movie work
","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony 'Mr. Stark' and Tony calls Peter 'kid.' There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him 'Vizz' is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.",8,14,25,5 May 2018
Gone Girl," Another Fincher Masterpiece
","The movie opens with a shot of the back of his wife's head as Ben Affleck's (Nick Dunne) voice-over describes how he would like to crack open her skull to let everything inside pour out to be examined.This narration perfectly sets up the rest of the movie by immediately implanting the possibility in our minds that Nick may have actually killed his wife. At dawn of July 5 (Nick and Amy's 5 year anniversary) Nick stands at the end of his driveway with a thoughtful expression containing an ambivalent combination of content and uncertainty—exactly the way we might expect a man to look if he had just killed his wife. Three minutes into the film and I am already hooked. A short while later Nick drives to a bar to chat with his sister with whom he owns the bar. He orders bourbon at 10am. Clearly something is weighing heavily on his mind and clearly that something involves his wife. Through flashbacks we are introduced to Nick and Amy and their seemingly charming yet complicated relationship. A couple hours later Nick discovers broken glass and turned over furniture in the living room. His wife is gone.The police arrive and run a sweep of the house and question Nick at the station. The next day the story explodes, launching a neighborhood search for the missing girl. Throughout every moment since the movie began, Nick's behavior has fueled possibility that he killed his wife. He appears aloof, distant and, frankly, unlikable. Nick cooperates and attempts to show a good face in public, but clearly many believe him to be guilty. The growing pile of evidence does nothing to erase the suspicion.Media coverage of the story continues to grow. Soon day time talk shows rant about Nick and imply his guilt. One talking head even purports an ignorant and hasty diagnosis of Nick as a sociopath. Eventually Nick is forced to hire a defense attorney as he fights to prove his innocence.Gone Girl is classic David Fincher filmmaking. The characters are all gritty, flawed. There are no heroes, just certain individuals who are less wicked than others. The lighting matches the morbid mood, and the only smile cracked in the entire movie is one by Nick in a foolishly taken picture with an attractive female at the search meeting. In spite of the perpetually solemn disposition of the characters, the dialogue adroitly sprinkles in just the perfect amount of dark humor to prevent audience depression. The music elevates the suspense and intensity of every crucial scene, yielding a seamless transition of the story from page to screen. Gillian Flynn should be proud.While the filmmaking by Fincher and story writing by Flynn tower above all else, the acting should not be overlooked. Affleck managed to turn in a respectable performance as the glum and annoyed husband-murder suspect. Rosamund Pike was remarkable in role. I am amazed that she has not had more standout performances, but those opportunities should come rolling in after filmmakers witness her marvelous work here.Overall, the film is simply spectacular. I have but one complaint. *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* Near the end of the film, there is a scene in which Amy is laying in a hospital bed as she recounts the details of her recent rape and escape to a room full of police and hospital staff. Completely ridiculous. I could not believe it as it was happening. I could hardly bare to look at the screen. Luckily, the final scene rolled only moments later: a return to the opening. Nick is looking at the back of his wife's head, continuing his narration. Now we understand exactly how Nick came to ponder those unthinkable thoughts about his wife. *END OF SPOILER* Final verdict: 8.5 out of 10.",9,4,10,1 November 2014
A Quiet Place," A bit Silly, but Entertaining and Intense
","John Krasinski (you know him as Jim from The Office) stars alongside his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, in a horror-thriller that Krasinski also directs. Husband and wife, Lee and Evelyn (Krasinski and Blunt) along with their children, struggle to remain safe and silent after mysterious creatures invade Earth, causing severe destruction and death. Through news reports and personal research, Lee discovers that the creatures are blind but have powerful hearing and attack any noise louder than a soft whisper.  Fortunately, Lee and Evelyn have a deaf daughter (a spectacular Millicent Simmonds), so the entire family knows sign language and can use that to communicate in complete silence. We witness the family do their best to get by in this challenging new world, despite the constant threat of the creatures and a strain in the family caused by an avoidable tragedy. Sitting through a completely silent theater for extended sequences is strange and unnerving. The sound of someone rustling in a seat or munching popcorn too loudly becomes alarming. Further, the family strife storyline is compelling enough to stand on its own, which is practically unheard of for a horror movie. With this combination of an original horror concept and an affecting family story, this movie could approach a masterpiece. But that's not quite what I experienced.It's sillier than I expected. I have a tremendous threshold for my suspension of disbelief, but this one tested me. Frankly, I didn't find the monsters terrifying. I found them ridiculous. They were much scarier to me when I didn't know exactly what they looked like. Keeping them mysterious made them far more frightening.I walked away from the movie with unanswered questions. Do the creatures ever eat people? It doesn't appear that way, so what do they eat?  Why do they attack sound? I considered, perhaps, that loud sounds hurt their ears, so they attack loud noises to stop the pain. But they could just as easily run from the loud sounds, so this theory doesn't totally make sense. I also took issue with the fact that they seemed somewhat easy to kill. If that's the case why did it take over a year to kill three of these things? It doesn't quite add up. I get the sense that if we pull the thread, the whole thing may unravel. Several odd decisions that the characters make or the writers made likely would not hold up under further scrutiny. Nevertheless, the good outweighs the bad. Emily Blunt's silent acting is breathtaking. She's stunning in this movie, and the two kids are also impressive. Noah Jupe has been in two other movies recently, one abysmal (Suburbicon) and one decent (Wonder). Although he was tremendous in all three, he's now finally a part of a legitimately good movie. John Krasinski does a fine job directing a challenging movie. Capturing the emotion and suspense and terror all in complete silence is occasionally spectacular. Though, I'm not sure I prefer something like this. Complete silence in an empty theater is fine for a moment or two, but it loses its appeal very quickly. I want my scary movie crowds to be rowdy.  Perhaps this movie would be better experienced at home in a silent house. The silence would likely play better in that environment. 
 
 Clearly, I'm picking knits. People like this movie, and I did too. It's entertaining, heartfelt and worth a watch in any setting.",7,10,16,13 April 2018
Coco," A Charming Depiction of a Beautiful Spanish-Language Tradition
","Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music. In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos. Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture.

The Graduate," Hilarious Story about Not Knowing What's Next
","The opening scene sets the stage for the remainder of the movie in a few key ways. First, the Simon and Garfunkel song perfectly suits the scene, which is the case each time one of their songs plays. Second, the main character, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), is filled with uncertainty and doubt, which is the case throughout the movie. Third, the scene takes place at an airport where people often look full of conviction and purpose but are secretly at least a little confused about where they are supposed to be going and are uneasy about going there, which again is the case for the key characters in most scenes throughout the movie.Ben knows exactly where he is going, but in a metaphorical yet much more real sense he has no idea where he is going. In the airport, he knows where to go. In his life, he does not. Paul Simon wrote 'people talking without speaking; people hearing without listening' and he could have easily added 'people moving without progressing,' but progressing isn't a lyrically fluid word, so he left it out. As usual, Paul Simon was right.  Here's the thing about Ben: he's kind of a doofus. A recent graduate (as you may have guessed), he excelled in college, won some prestigious award, everyone is so proud of him, but he doesn't seem to have a firm grasp of what's going on in the world. Ben is almost less a character and more a caricature of a recent college graduate who is not sure what to do next. 
 
Everything Ben does is awkward. He's not a bad guy (though he does some unsavory things); he's just filled with so much uncertainty and self-doubt that he sweats and stumbles his way through any and all things adult. It's an incredible comedic performance by Hoffman. He manages to make the movie hysterically funny despite the dialogue containing virtually zero jokes.  His interactions with the hypnotizing Mrs. Robinson (Ann Bancroft) are comedy gold. She's majestically cool and composed, while Ben barely has the confidence to order himself a drink. Their polar opposite personalities make her seduction of him a beautiful whirlwind of cringey, awkward hilarity that seems to last forever. But in a good way. At least in a good way for us viewers, since we aren't dealing with the awkwardness firsthand.  I cannot stress this enough-Bancroft is magnificent. As one of the first cougars in cinema history, she sets an impossibly high bar. She's sophisticated, beautiful and undoubtedly in charge. She uses Ben as her plaything. Though to be fair to her, he's no victim. He's a willing participant from the beginning.  The first part of the movie parallels Ben's life at the time. It's entertaining as can be but aimless. Then we meet Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross). She's as beautiful as her mother and as full of uncertainty as Ben. Mrs. Robinson insists that Ben does not take out her daughter on a date. Ben agrees. Then as soon as his parents pressure him to take her out he gives in because he's a pushover doofus.  Here things get interesting as Ben finally talks to someone who understands what he's feeling. He's completely enamored with Elaine. Or at least he thinks he is. He wants to marry her. Or at least he thinks he does. Maybe he's just latching onto these feelings because he finally found some sense of direction for the first time since graduating. He finally knows what to do next.  The ending is perfect. I don't say that lightly. The ending is perfect because it lingers just a little bit longer than most movies normally would. It looks like it's going to be a typical happily ever after fairy tale ending that we have all seen a million times. Then it keeps going. In those final 15 seconds we see the elated smiles fade, reality hitting, and doubt creeping back into the faces of the characters. The movie began with uncertainty, and it ends in uncertainty. Ben faces the same question that has plagued him throughout the story. Now what?",9,10,11,3 January 2018
Mission: Impossible," Stylish Spy Thriller
","I went back and watched this movie after seeing the most recent three M:I films. That certainly puts me at a strange perspective, since I saw the movies out of order and this one more than twenty years after it was released. No doubt, I have been spoiled by the excellent improvements in special effects and stunt execution in movies of the past 20 years. Going back to watch the old one is a step down in some respects. But, I was delighted to find how well this movie holds up. The action sequences and special effects still look excellent, and the thrills and suspense have stood the test of time.A lot of credit needs to go to director Brian De Palma. He makes this movie very much about style and momentum. The alluring vibe is the movie's strength, and it definitely takes the focus. This is only borderline an action movie. It's more of a cool spy thriller. Ethan Hunt has not yet become the famous super spy that we know in later films. Here he is very much a part of a team. At first, he is presented merely a grunt work man. His smirk and cocky jokes suggest that he doesn't take the matters all that seriously.Throughout the film, he slowly reveals himself to be sharp, acutely aware of his surroundings and smarter than everyone else in the room. Not until the third act do we fully realize how stellar Hunt is at this work. He figures out who set him up and how they did it, which is a miracle because this plot is largely incomprehensible. Ethan Hunt may be the only person in the movie or watching the movie to understand what the heck is going on. There are so many betrayals and double crosses that it's nearly impossible to know which characters are working together. And yet, the film still works. Viewers will eventually understand who is the hero and who he must defeat to save the lives of many innocents. Understanding the plot on that level, is all you really need.This movie seems to have improved with age, and I imagine the critic scores would improve upon a re-watch. It's worth your time.",7,3,4,31 July 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Lacks magic
","Before entering theater, I knew Emma Watson looked the part. Belle means beauty, and she certainly is that. With a movie that's highly concerned with pageantry, her looks are especially important. More so than simply supplying the necessary beauty to play Belle, she has the right look. She conveys intelligence, genuine concern, and a longing for more. It comes from her eyes. They tell her story. She expresses her thoughts and feelings clearly in every moment without saying a word.For the most part, I could take or leave the live action Disney revivals. This one felt like it had more promise to me, and a large part of that came from the apropos casting of Watson. As it turns out, she delivered. She does far more than look that part, she acts and sings it too. For anyone wondering, it really is her singing. Unfortunately, she and the other actors pre-recorded their vocal performances, which were subsequently dubbed over the visual scenes. That makes for the song and dance displays ring just a bit false, compared to the sincerity of those in La La Land. Granted, I understand that complaining that a movie doesn't live up to the standard of another movie that won six Oscars, is beyond finicky. If you were worried that the new voices wouldn't do justice to the originals, rest easy. Every singer delivers, especially Watson. What a voice she has. Who knew Hermione had golden pipes? The film doesn't wait long to unveil the real-life Belle's talents. She flexes her performing muscles as she glides her way through the quaint village brought to life. Everything seems great, just a little long. And that's the movie's glaring problem—it's too long. The filmmakers took the original's tight 1 hour 24-minute runtime and ballooned it to 2 hours and 9 minutes. Even Emma Watson's charm can only last for so long. I'm not saying the movie needs to trim some fat, but there's no way it would fit in Belle's dress. Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all article. As much as I've raved about Watson—and I strongly believe she deserves all the praise—the rest of the movie doesn't quite make it. At times, the spectacle wore off and I just felt bored. There were a few too many songs, and a few too many verses in some. I don't remember how long the original songs were, but I know that I never felt bored listening to them. For all the glamour and loveliness, something was conspicuously absent. The movie lacks magic. None of the songs bombed, but they didn't exactly floor me either. Another issue arose from the added scenes. I understand the desire to show us Belle's mother and the Beast's parents. Many children's movies omit parents, with the implication that they died, and that's it. An illumination of why the Beast (a prince at the time) so rudely turned away the stranger worked fine. But was it really necessary? Personally, I never had any trouble believing the spoiled prince angle. The dastardly daddy reveal didn't add much. Perhaps it was intended to give viewers more sympathy for the Beast. Meh. He earned my sympathy when he showed his kindness to Belle. I always thought that was the point. The enchantress cursed him for treating people poorly. That was his issue, not his dad's. The insertion of the dad story makes it seem like the Beast's reprehensible behavior wasn't his fault. I didn't like that implication. I was disappointed to see a few missed opportunities with the minority characters. A word of advice: don't bother including a black person as the bookkeeper if he doesn't have a chance to do anything. He's used as a showpiece. Nothing more. That's not progressive casting; it's condescending. Sadly, the movie's usage of gay characters felt even more insulting. Including a gay character is fine, even better than fine, if the character is represented appropriately. In this case, appropriate simply means not in an overtly theatrical and effeminate manner. The whole stereotypical portrayal was annoying. I'll end on a high note. Credit must be given to the unimpeachable Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Kline, Ian McKellen, and Ewan McGregor. They performed admirably. Future live action Disney films, should learn from Beauty. Casting is vital and so is keeping the runtime reasonable. Forever can spare a minute, but I don't have that much time.",7,13,18,4 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A Movie Filled with 'Whys?'
","The Guardians of the Galaxy 2 tried to one-up the first movie in many ways, which is great. It also failed to one-up the first movie in each of those ways, which is less great.I don't want to seem like I am simply dumping all over this movie because I genuinely enjoyed parts of it. To avoid that, I will discuss some things that I didn't like, followed by some things that I liked, and then I will end with a few things that I didn't like and give a brief recap. Sound good? Cool. Here we go.The Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is funny, but not as funny as the first one. The second one may have had more independent jokes that made me laugh, but the jokes didn't fit naturally the way they did in the first movie. I imagine I could probably pluck jokes from a given scene in Guardians 2 and place them in other scenes and they it wouldn't really change anything. They already felt out of place, so they wouldn't feel any more out of place if inserted elsewhere. Most of the jokes in Guardians 2 halted scenes in an awkward way that was especially noticeable when they failed to get a laugh. That wasn't the case in Guardians 1.The star of the movie, since Pratt was stolen by his dad, was Dave Bautista playing Drax. His laugh alone should win him some kind of award. He also had many of the movies best jokes and began a fun, if not unusual, romance with a new 'disgusting bug lady,' as he would call her. Shouts to Drax. He's the movie MVP. Sorry, Baby Groot. You're still adorable.Sequels are tricky. They need to walk a fine line between remaining true to the original without falling into the trap of cheaply ripping it off. Guardians 2 was not quite sure how to do that. It tried to add additional layers to the story by making the audience feel for the characters. It tried to make the one-dimensional characters deep and sympathetic. This isn't a terrible idea, but it resulted about 50 too many mentions of 'family' in the cheesy heartfelt conversations and an unnecessary overarching theme of daddy issues. Missteps like this make Guardians 1 ostensibly superior.I know I shouldn't dissect this movie so thoroughly. It's not meant for that. Yet I couldn't help noticing the movie's flaws.If you are looking for a zany, fun time at the theaters involving little to no thought, this movie may work for you. If you plan on asking questions or thinking about the plot, you should probably watch something else.",7,13,23,11 June 2017
The Disaster Artist," Not a Mockery, It's a Celebration of Two Men Pursuing Their Dream
","Going into the theater, I was under the impression that this was a silly James Franco and Seth Rogen movie that made fun of The Room, a legendary bad movie. That's not what the Disaster Artist is at all. Instead, it celebrates The Room. It celebrates Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, their passion, and their pursuit of a dream.  Sure, The Disaster Artist comments on how The Room bombed terribly; it had to acknowledge this. It comments on the utter lack of acting talent that Tommy and Greg possessed; it had to acknowledge this too. But it handles these details with such delicacy and care that I never felt that it was putting down the characters. Actually, it seemed that the film admired them. Even when the world told them to quit, they never gave up on themselves or each other. The message is surprisingly inspiring.  The movie becomes something more than mere mockery because of the way it handles the relationship between Tommy and Greg with such care and affection. The two genuinely liked each other and saw each other in ways that no one else did. Greg certainly did not understand all of Tommy's methods and decisions, but he understood Tommy's good intentions. Establishing this buddy connection is crucial later in the movie. After Tommy writes The Room and they begin filming, Tommy expresses his idiosyncrasies in full force. While the film crew sees him as a confusing weirdo, we know there's something more. Despite his utter incompetence in directing and acting and all aspects of filmmaking, we still root him. And we still root for Greg, ever the supportive friend. Tommy makes absurd and confounding choices that don't make sense to Greg and they don't make sense to anyone else either. Even one of Tommy's explanations was simply 'people do crazy things.' Still, Greg remains loyal. With as strange as Wiseau behaves, capturing his eccentricities would clearly prove challenging. Give James Franco credit for capturing Wiseau's weirdness in character without ever devolving into derisive mockery. Franco captures his gait, stiff shoulders, hunched posture, indeterminable and inconsistent accent, and his laugh. Watching The Room and hearing Tommy Wiseau laugh, I thought that it sounded completely fake. I chalked it up to another instance of poor acting. But after seeing Wiseau in interviews, I realized that it was his real laugh. To him, the laugh wasn't poor acting because that's what he thinks a genuine laugh sounds like.  Seeing and hearing Wiseau behaving as himself explains a lot about his behavior in The Room. He's just an interesting and very unusual guy. His acting and the acting of others in his movie is still atrocious, but it shifts from startlingly and confusingly bad to understandably bad. And more importantly, seeing the real Tommy makes his movie all the more fun.  You don't need to see The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. Would it help? Sure. Seeing The Room first makes many of the inside jokes made in The Disaster Artist funnier and gives a clearer sense of how confoundingly weird the movie truly is. Words cannot do it justice. To understand, you have to see The Room for yourself. I recommend seeing both.",8,169,198,24 December 2017
Love Actually," It's not Love Actually; It's a Cheesy Love Fantasy
","Love Actually is a lot like actual love---it's wonderful until it isn't. Then everything blows up, leaving you to pick up the pieces of your devastated reality.Relax. I'm only kidding. Love really is wonderful, even the struggles. The movie Love Actually, not so much.The first 30 minutes or so are downright hilarious, featuring a mix of charming British humor and broader appeal jokes as well. The setup of each storyline features likable characters in relatable situations. You root for everything to work out. You want all of them to be happy.Then, through no fault of the characters, you change your attitude. Instead of rooting for the characters, you become apathetic, at best. Why? Because the movie makes every story nauseating with irritatingly manipulative music, cuts to closeups of hopeful or gleeful faces to force viewers to elicit the 'hooray' emotions. It's all very painful and frustrating.The movie is called Love Actually (which is a great title, by the way), but so little of what occurs in the movie can be passed off as something that would actually happen. A more appropriate title would be Love Fantasy.Thirty minutes into the movie (again, the beginning shows promise and is mostly delightful), all the believable buildups have morphed into shameless fairy tale-like sequences. It's all a bunch of love at first sight silliness. Sorry if this sounds too harsh, but there is no love at first sight. The very concept is shallow and supposes a fundamental misunderstanding of what love is. There can be attraction at first sight, or lust at first sight. But not love.The most ghastly instance of using music to manipulate the viewers comes during a scene when two people, who have never spoken a word to each other because they don't speak the same language, develop feelings for each other. That is an interesting idea that could have been quite moving if handled deftly. Instead, the moment is a bit more blunt. The music indicates that the man develops loving feelings for the woman when she takes off all her clothes to jump in a lake. Viewers are led to believe that the man felt little for this woman until he saw that she looked good in her underwear, after which he fell in love with her.So, I guess the message is that you can love someone that you've never spoken to as long and the other person is attractive. It's basically a different version of that thing in movies when the dorky girl takes off her glasses then everyone realizes that she's beautiful and then the main guy character can love her now. The biggest difference between those two cases is that the dorky girl removing her glasses moment usually happens in a movie that clearly isn't taking itself too seriously, whereas Love Actually is posing as a movie that represents realistic love. That's sad to me because many viewers, especially the impressionable young ones, may walk away from this movie confusing attraction for love.Since I'm unleashing all my gripes with this movie, I may as well mention one more. This one didn't so much make me mad, as much as it confused me. It is also kind of funny in a way. I'm talking about the portrayal of the U.S. President (the movie takes place in England). It casts him as this arrogant, smug, woman harassing pig. Basically, he's a bully. So, when one of the British characters stands up to him, the music swoons once again, indicating to the audience that they should be happy that the American jerk couldn't push people around anymore.To be honest, I have no idea if this is the perception that people in England have of Americans. Perhaps it is, and the viewers from England really did applaud this moment. But I personally found it all to be laughably cheesy.That's a pretty accurate summary of my take on the movie overall---laughably cheesy. I'll just leave it at that. I recommend that you take a hard pass on Love Actually.",2,10,16,3 September 2017
Sausage Party," Crass, Crude, Vulgar, Nasty, Funny
","Before watching Sausage Party, I read a few articles about the movie, as I do before I watch virtually any new movie. What struck me most was my finding that the movie originally earned an NC-17 rating. I wondered how a movie about cartoon food could possibly accomplish that.As it turned out, I only needed to watch the opening few minutes before I understood. After the remaining 90 minutes passed, I wondered how the movie in its current form managed to escape with a mere R rating. I saw an abundance of reasons no one under 17 should watch the movie, including the avalanche of explicit sexual descriptions, graphic drug use (apparently food can use drugs, who knew?), and sins against humanity committed by a douche. And that's not all. Not even close.From beginning to end, Sausage party will disgust you. It will appall you. It will make you never look at tacos the same way again.The entire movie is a gigantic f*** fest. By that I mean verbal f-bombs are dropped left and right, and (minor spoiler alert, but who I am kidding—you should know what's coming) all the foods literally take part in a gigantic f*** fest.The filmmakers save this for the end, of course. In the final scene, the store's foods erupt into an all-inclusive, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, interracial (at least, as much as cartoon foods can have races) and wildly creative orgy that would make a progressive citizen of 2016 proud. Or just really grossed out.As repulsive as that may sound, the movie isn't all bad. Somewhere along the way as you view all that lewd, pornographic material (at least as much as cartoon foods can be pornographic, which as it turns out, they can be jarringly pornographic), you will laugh. Maybe it will only be a confused, disbelieving, uncomfortable laugh. But you will laugh.Even after reading this, the depths of unhinged sexuality in this movie will still surprise you. I laid out in no uncertain terms, what you should expect, and the sexual content will still surprise you. And that's not the only surprising aspect of this movie, which is a cartoon. Did I mention that? Even if I did, it bears repeating.The other startling aspect of the movie is the volume of racial stereotypes unleashed through the portrayals of food. At first, this struck me terribly distasteful and unfunny. Soon I realized that these stereotypes were so grossly exaggerated that they actually functioned as a sort of self-aware jab at racial jokes made in typical R-rated comedies.In fact, I'm just now realizing that the entire movie is essentially an ironic depiction of the typical R-rated comedy. They turned the sexuality up to 11 to poke fun at the other movies that fall back on obvious sex jokes to create laughs.On many members of the audience, this intention may have been lost. It likely only became evident to some of the most discerning movie-goers as they watched (it may also have dawned on some of the less discerning viewers days later as they wrote about the movie).So there you have it. I didn't bother addressing any specifics of the movie, such as, character names or plot lines. If you want that stuff, fine. One hotdog is named Frank and the foods freak out when they learn that humans eat food. Not quite as complicated as Inception.Anyway, if you're looking for a crass comedy to supply a few laughs, this could be the movie for you. If you desire something self-aware that takes a subtle jab at the average raunchy comedy, this movie could also be for you. (It's odd to realize that there's a subtlety to this movie, considering that most of the sexual jokes contain absolutely zero subtlety. It's a neat trick).Whatever your preference, just don't see Sausage Party with your parents. Even if you're thirty and have kids of your own, don't see it with your parents. I bet it would still be weird.",4,6,12,5 September 2016
Joker," A Punishing Viewing Experience
","'Joker' doesn't wait long to begin inflicting harm.In the opening scene, we watch Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) stare into a mirror as he pulls up the corners of his mouth, forcing a smile. It's an early indication of the unhappiness that has brewed inside Arthur all his life. It's also an early indication of the unhappiness we're about to endure for next two hours.'Joker' is a miserable watch. It's endlessly depressing, containing not a single ounce of happiness, humor or hope. Arthur's daily existence as a struggling performing clown consists of nothing but loneliness and grim thoughts, much like what I felt during my time in the theater. It is a burden to sit through this movie.The never-ending cavalcade of sadness and loathsome behavior we witness on screen does not contain nearly enough depth to be worthy of the debate that raged for months in advance of the premiere. The movie is flat out bad. It's derivative of better movies (namely, Taxi Driver & The King of Comedy), unnecessarily violent, and annoyingly over-the-top. But the movie's greatest flaw is that is boring.Nothing interesting or unexpected occurs. Some of the events could have passed for interesting if they had not been painstakingly foreshadowed by the previous hour of mundane bleakness.Every scene essentially delivers the same message: Arthur lives in a world of poverty, torment, and loneliness. Arthur is lonely at work, on the bus, in the elevator, while watching tv - every scene tells the same story. Watching the string of scenes one after another quickly grows tired and dull. It's all painfully repetitive and frustratingly one note. The presence one scene depicting an auspicious event, any reason for hope or happiness would have given a much welcome break from the monotonous misery.Sadly, that break in tone arrives in the form of explosive bursts of violence. Lost on no one is the fact that Arthur has a mental illness, which undoubtedly contributes to his violent fits of rage - this sends the message to viewers that these sorts of people are dangerous and frightening. It's a reckless and problematic depiction of a person suffering from mental illness, one that only serves to perpetuate an already damaging stigma.Any earnest exploration carried out by the movie into the lack of help provided to individuals with mental illness was too superficial to make a real impact. A potential tagline for the movie 'Society created the Joker' has about as much depth as the movie itself. Sure, that idea is lightly implied, but it's not unpacked in any meaningful way during the two-hour runtime.Any social issues aside, the main reason I didn't enjoy the movie is because it's simply not a good movie. All reports suggest that this movie is a one off and will have no sequels. I can only hope that's true.I suggest finding something else to watch, like one of the many superior films available in theaters or via streaming. If you don't, the joke is on you.",2,11,24,30 October 2019

Halloween," A masterclass in horror
","That mask. Wow, is that mask scary. The same can be said about the music. Even 40 years later it completely holds up in every way-it's iconic, it sounds great, it's scary and it's instantly recognizable. Amazingly, John Carpenter wrote and performed the music despite claiming that he cannot write a single note. Before we see any part of the movie, we hear the music. Instantly, we feel unsettled. Then, watching through first-person stalker cam perspective and through the eyes of a Halloween mask, we observe a young boy peep on his sister then murder her. Fast forward 15 years and this young boy, Michael Myers, has grown into a man while living in a mental hospital, never once speaking a word. As if summoned by some evil power, he breaks out and travels to his home town of Haddonfield on Halloween. After breaking out and encountering people in the outside world, Michael still never says a word. It's another inspired filmmaking choice. Hearing his voice would humanize him in some way, instead all we hear is his heavy breathing. Why Michael returned to his hometown is unclear, as is everything about Michael. That's brilliance of this movie-we never find out why Michael killed his sister, we never find out why he escaped the hospital and we never find out why he continues to kill. We don't need to learn his reasons. No motive is scarier. Also scary, he's human. He's not some monster with superpowers (if you ignore the sequels, like you should), he's just a severely disturbed person. Think about that. That means this story is something that could actually happen in any American small town. His victims were seemingly random, so they could be anyone. No one is safe. Although, as I just mentioned, his killings are random, he does seem to take issue with people having sex. This started the now famous horror trope that characters who have sex are as good as dead. This movie also popularizes the horror staple of victims who consistently make dumb decisions. Stop dropping the knife! Stop assuming he's dead! It's maddening. Another aspect of the movie that stood out to me is its surprising lack of violence. There's virtually no blood or gore. Michael mostly strangles his victims. He uses his knife too, of course, but the killings aren't terribly graphic. It's refreshing change of pace from the excessive violence in modern slashers.While Michael may seem invincible since he survives two stabbings and multiple gun shot wounds, he is not flawless. Upon my latest re-watch, I noticed how much he struggles with walking. Michael Myers is a hall of fame level killer, but he's a below average walker.This likely a deliberate choice by director John Carpenter. Not only does Michael's slow walk build suspense, it also lends itself perfectly to the first-person camera shots. The patient, measured movements give him an eerie feel. He's lurking. We see his lurking figure in many forms, each equally brilliant in its execution. Sometimes we see his outline as a shadow. Sometimes we see him ease into the corner of the frame behind a victim. Other times we see a distant shot of a house of character, then Michael partially steps in frame near the camera. Carpenter expertly mixes foreground and background in his shots to make Michael just far enough away that the characters don't see him but the audience does.The movie builds and builds and builds. It's definitely scary from the opening scene, but it grows continuously scarier as we see the extent of Michael's killing spree. All the while, jump scares are sparsely used and are never fake. What I mean by that is when the music jars viewers, it's because Michael appears. The music never blares for fake scares, like when a cat runs across screen or a friend knocks on a door, which is annoying trend in recent horror films. The only scary part of this film is Michael. Fortunately, he's plenty scary to carry the load. 'Halloween' is considered an ageless horror masterpiece. After re-watching it recently, I can clearly see why that is the case.",9,31,38,27 June 2018
Marriage Story," Simply Incredible (In a Beautifully Complex Way)
","The movie is called 'Marriage Story' because it's a more appealing title than Divorce Story. But that's what the move is: the story of a divorce.In the opening scene, the two leads, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, at the top of her game) and Charlie (Adam Driver, likewise) read from their lists of things they love about each other as we see beautifully spliced together examples matching the words. It's a charming, funny, and heartwarming open, and it in no way resembles the anger, frustration, and occasional vitriol these characters will spew at each other over the next two hours of the movie.It turns out the letters were written after a suggestion made by the couple's mediator. He explains that he likes to begin with a positive note because of the harsh negativity that soon will follow. Oh how right he is.The couple continues to reassure each other and themselves that they want to remain friends and keep this breakup amicable. They have no need for lawyers until they do. That's when the situation becomes volcanically contentious.The lawyers know how the divorce game works, and they're hall of fame-level players. They gather all possible ammunition from the party they represent, then they hurl them at the other soon-to-be ex-spouse like a box full of live grenades. It's brutal to watch. Clever framing from director Noah Baumbach displays the discomfort and pain this causes each spouse to see their significant other lambasted mercilessly in court. Neither of them wanted things to go this way.As gut-wrenching as many scenes can be, laugh-out-loud humor slips its way into just as many moments. Give credit to Baumbach's writing as much as his stellar directing. Surrounding all scenes, both crushingly sad and delightfully funny, is unceasing truth and fairness. Neither Nicole nor Charlie is made out to be the villain. They are both presented as fallible characters who are good people who happen to be dealing with one of the most challenging situations human beings can face. Divorce can bring out the worst in people and it does here. Which is what makes it such a miracle that Baumbach manages to keep both lead characters so empathetic. Baumbach's work is award-worthy in both the writing and directing departments, as is the acting of the two leads.Netflix has been searching for a best picture winner for a few years now, and it looks like it might finally happen. 'Marriage Story' is not only one the best movies of the year; it's one of the best of the last several years (and if this movie doesn't win, Netflix also boasts 'The Irishman.')I'm sure 'The Irishman' is fine, but I can't say for sure yet because I'm still too intimidated by that three and a half hours runtime. But I saw 'Marriage Story' and it was incredible. It's as good a movie as you'll see all year, in the theater or at home on Netflix.",10,27,48,11 December 2019
Black Panther," As Spectacular as Advertised
","This movie is awesome. Let's get that out of the way first. It's not the best movie ever, as some claim. It's probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it is at least worthy of that conversation, which is saying a lot.  Black Panther ascended to levels of hype and promise that seemed nearly unreachable-and it reached them. It's virtually unprecedented for a movie to live up to these outlandish expectations, but that's exactly what it did.  So, what is this movie that climbed all the way into the top five all time at the U.S. box office? Enter Wakanda, a fictitious African country posing as just another third-world nation, but it is secretly the technologically advanced nation in the world because it rests on a mountain on vibranium, the strongest metal in the MCU. Wakanda's king, T'Chaka, was recently killed in an attack, so his son T'Challa is set to assume the throne. T'Challa also fulfills the role of Black Panther, a cunning and powerful warrior featuring superhuman powers supplied by a Wakandian plant and stylish and functional suit made of vibranium.  Wakanda is fiercely loyal to its traditions and to its people. It opts to interact minimally with the outside world and lets in no outsiders, as to protect its secret wealth. This way of life is threatened by the resurfacing of buried stories from the past and the arrival of an outsider who believes Wakanda can no longer sit comfortably as billions in other countries across the globe suffer. T'Challa is forced to deal with the challenges of being a good man and a good king as he navigates the dilemma of staying true to Wakanda's rigid tradition or adapting to a more progressive philosophy.  Chadwick Boseman plays the role of T'Challa with exceptional poise, grace and an absolutely regal accent. He would have been the true standout of the movie if not for several other standout performances. 
Danai Gurira (Michonne of The Walking Dead) shines as General Okoye, the king's go-to warrior. Her love, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), though on screen less, plays just as significant a role, as he is one of the strongest voices pushing for change to Wakanda's international policy. And, of course, Kaluuya steals a few scenes with his remarkably expressive acting.  Additional shouts to Winston Duke for his role as an intimidating leader of a Wakandian tribe with a dark sense of humor, a low-key warmth, and a penchant for barking. And another one to Sterling K. Brown for playing T'Chaka's brother, a spy dispatched in Oakland who sees the struggles of people firsthand. The greatest standout of the all the standouts is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. His intense presence fills the room in every scene he enters. He exudes such charisma with his American street manner of speaking and swagger that I almost found myself rooting for him, despite his violent and murderous tendencies. Even in his worst moments, he is always sure of his purpose and his message, which is a compelling one. This message, paired with his backstory, make him easy to empathize with.Another thing: Killmonger is powerful and scary. He's more than a worthy adversary for Black Panther. At times he appears to the be Black Panther's better. Like Bane in Dark Knight Rises, an intelligent villain capable of physically overwhelming the hero, he feels like a real threat. We legitimately believe he can win. It comes as no surprise that his fight scenes with Black Panther will leave you breathless. The action sequences deliver all the thrills you would expect from a Marvel movie and from a Ryan Coogler movie (he's now 3 for 3 in his directorial efforts). But the deeper social themes and inner conflicts of the key characters are what elevates this movie to elite status. Yes, seeing a movie with predominantly Black actors and a Black director is also important. It's important to viewers, young viewers most of all, and it's also important to movie studios. Hopefully Black Panther's booming success will finally dispel the myth that movies with Black lead actors don't do well in the box office. Before I wrap up, I have to give credit to Andy Serkis for his rare non-CGI performance. The guy comes in and throws 100mph from the jump and manages to be hateable, funny, and fun throughout. And final shout outs to Angela Bassett, for playing the royal and majestic mother of T'Challa, and to Letitia Wright, for playing T'Challa's wisecracking tech genius little sister, Shuri.  Apologies to anyone I didn't spotlight. This movie is flooded with incredible performances, so I had to omit a couple mentions to keep this review to a reasonable word count.  Bottom line: go see Black Panther. If you already saw it, see it again. It's that good. It deserves all the praise, and I hope to see it next year at the Oscars.",10,24,55,27 April 2018
Creed II," Ryan Coogler's deft touch could have made this great
","The best moments of 'Rocky/Creed' movies are the ones that make you feel something. Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few.
Adonis 'Donny' Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series.
Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies.
On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out.
Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle.
Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason.
In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.",7,16,17,15 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Most superhero movies are fun, but not this one
","I always believed the point of superhero movies was to send a message of hope. The great importance of the heroes isn't only what they do, but what they stand for. They present the idea that one person really can make a difference, that goodness can exist in the world if we all do our part. We don't all have to be Superman or Batman, but we all need to follow their example to stand for what is right. We all need to stand for good.I didn't feel any of that after watching Batman vs. Superman. I felt the opposite—hopeless. The movie robbed me of my optimism. The movie darkened my outlook on life. It was bleak. But before I delve into that too much and depress myself all over again I want to present something else I took away from the movie Batman vs. Superman illustrates the dangers of millionaire millennial geniuses and their unpredictable, uncontainable exploits. This is one off the wall thought that I considered momentarily before laughing and dismissing entirely. I do not imagine that is what Zack Snyder had in mind. Whether he intended this or not, the movie is undeniably promotive of funerals. As other film watchers have already noted, it also places an emphasis on coffins. It's a very pro coffin film. The story begins and ends at different funerals with different coffins. Where there is death, there are funerals and coffins. Snyder clearly wants to endorse the coffins. Don't argue with me on this. I'm right.The rest of the movie (i.e. the parts between the funerals) doesn't change much in tone. It's gloom and doom. It's Zack Snyder doing Zack Snyder stuff. Batman vs Superman is essentially exactly what you expect it to be. If that's your taste, cut off a slice and chow down. You'll love it. If you're one that prefers movies that offer a little sprinkle of a spice called fun, you may want to steer clear. Personally my tongue and I fall into the latter camp.How can I like a movie that gave me absolutely no joy? It's ponderous. It's dull. The characters wore me out like JJ Watt wears out blockers (note to anyone living in a bubble containing only comic book material: JJ Watt is football player from a league called the NFL). Through its 2.5 hour run time, the movie somehow manages to feel rushed, yet laggy and littered with empty scenes. It's almost impressive if you think about it.In a more personal realm of analysis, the movie failed to connect with me on a level of preference. I disagreed with oh so many choices: Batman is psychotic killer who tries to kill Superman even though his only reason for doing so is flimsier than a car antenna. Bundy had better reasons for killing, or at least more interesting reasons. (Batman was afraid, that's why he tried to kill him. Yes, really, that's it. I know, it's lame, right?). Then suddenly in the moment before the murder, Batman changes his mind because their moms happened to have the same name? Get real. I rolled my eyes so hard the force nearly knocked me out of my chair.Moving on, I cannot comprehend the rationale behind the forced and inappropriately timed romance scenes. If my friends and I and everyone in the city were all in imminent danger of being brutally killed by a giant monster, I wouldn't stop to smooch and chat with my girlfriend. I didn't understand why Superman did that. I also didn't quite understand Lex Luthor, but maybe that was sort of the point. He's complex and zany. I can live with that one.I don't want to present the notion that I hated the entire movie. Not true. Certain moments reeled me in. My favorite element of movie, by far, was Wonderwoman.Wonderwoman rocks. Even her theme music, which is so absurdly disparate from the rest of the music that it's laughable, somehow still worked for me. Probably because the sound let me have fun for a second.The girl was totally badass. She was battling for her life against this abominable beast and she stopped to smile. Then I smiled. She had fun in that scene so I did too. She also managed to be likable as a person and as Wonderwoman, a critical foundation to establish in anticipation of her solo movie. In her own movie she needs audiences to care about both Wonderwoman and Diana Prince. I see now that shouldn't be a problem.That's the silver lining of this whole experience. Even if you didn't care for this particular movie, you know there will be others, and the others look ripe with potential. Aquaman looks like a mysterious beast with an intriguing backstory. Flash and Cyborg look equally intriguing, even if they're slightly less beastly. And I've already mentioned the enchanting Wonderwoman.I'm looking forward to the future of D.C. comic movies. Hope is restored.",3,6,10,23 July 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Very funny, though it falls short of what it could be
","'Jojo Rabbit' is a light-hearted comedy exploring dark elements. It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy growing up in Germany near the end of World War II. He's a lot like other boys his age, struggling to fit in and find his way, searching for group and sense of belonging. Unlike a lot of boys his age, he is a passionate Nazi who gleefully exclaims, 'Heil Hitler!' as he skips down the street to a camp for young Nazis-in-training. Accompanying him as he skips, cheering him on, is his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, himself.Hitler, played with uproarious levels of buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi, provides many of the film's early laughs. Sadly, the movie fails to deliver on its early promise. It doesn't crash burn - the end product is still respectable - but all the parts never totally come together in a completely satisfying way. We hope for more from a proven entity like Waititi.The title 'Jojo Rabbit,' as it turns out, is half the name of the 10-year-old boy and half the name of a cute, fluffy animal. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) becomes the begrudging recipient of the nickname 'Jojo Rabbit' for his choice to not coldly murder an innocent rabbit while at Nazi camp. An older boy makes a different choice regarding the rabbit, then callously chucks the body across the woods.Jojo doesn't fit in here. He doesn't want to be a Nazi. He just doesn't know it yet.Jojo lives with his loving, playful mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who secretly works for the resistance. However, she allows Jojo to follow his misguided Nazi ways, knowing this will keep him safe from party members who search the town for dissenters. Johansson plays the part with impressive layers of complexity. While appalled by her son's Nazi passion, she understands that now is not the time to reprimand him. She quietly does her work and continues to love her son dearly, which is precisely why she opts not to tell Jojo about the young Jewish girl she is hiding in her wall.When Jojo finds the girl (Thomasin McKenzie), he is shocked and horrified. But he quickly discovers that she isn't at all the way Jews have been described to him. 'Where are your horns?' He asks her sincerely.It's not long before Jojo begins to realize the girl he has been told is a monster is actually a friend, while his imaginary friend is the real monster. If you've seen any movies before, you know this is coming. Nevertheless, a few moments successfully tug at the heart strings. Another moment doesn't work quite as well and ends up feeling forced, even manipulative.The movie's execution winds up being a bit disappointing because of how much potential seemed possible in the opening act. The best moments are the funniest ones, usually featuring Hitler and Jojo, along with a few others that include the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who plays Jojo's friend.Despite the movie's success in comedic execution, the heavier material waivers, leaving the vision of the story a bit foggy. What could have been a best-of-the-year contender, winds up being merely an above average comedy.",7,68,127,25 November 2019
Casino," Overlooked Scorsese Crime Drama
","Martin Scorsese certainly has shown an interest in crime stories. He explores the gritty details of the worlds and the players involved in the games. This particular story focuses on a particular gaming world-the one found in the gambling mecca of the United States, Vegas. Appropriately, the movie is called 'Casino.' Throughout its three-hour runtime, it unpacks a great deal. The first 45 minutes or so lay the foundation. We're exposed to thorough details of how the gaming world in Vegas operates and what it takes to succeed in the business. It's fascinating. For a while. My philosophy is if a movie is three hours long, it better have great reasons for being three hours long. This one felt like it could have been trimmed in a few places, but that didn't happen. Scorsese likes to make long films, so we're left with this monstrously long creation. He takes his time, cuing up one Rolling Stones song after another, letting events play out at a leisurely pace. It's all interesting and well-crafted (because its Scorsese), but it takes nearly two full hours before the pivotal conflict arises. Before then, the characters' lives are bit too peachy, too easy. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play childhood friends who take different business avenues in life, each finding success and power that they find appealing. De Niro wants to play it straight and run a legitimate casino, and he should-he's great at it. Pesci seeks the illegal angle, becoming one of the most infamous mobsters in the world of Vegas. As I said, their lives run smoothly (for the most part) for too much of the story. Everything goes downhill when Pesci steps on one of the wrong gangster's toes, De Niro deals with legal issues over a gambling license, and the biggest doozy of all-De Niro's wife loses her mind. In a force of nature performance from Sharon Stone, De Niro's screen wife Ginger becomes the most compelling and despicable character over the film's final hour-this is when Stone really starts to go for it. No spoilers here, so I'll just say that her reputation as one of the worst movie wives of all time is well-deserved. As circumstances spiral out of control, Scorsese blasts a couple more Rolling Stones songs and opens up his bag of mesmerizing camera tricks. His catalog of film techniques can fill an entire book shelf on its own. His application choices don't always appear to make sense, but they certainly catch the eye, which may be the primary intention. I'm a big fan of Marty's work, so I'll see anything he has made. While this isn't his best, it's still an entertaining and worthwhile film.",7,1,2,27 July 2018
Heat," Classic Crime Film with an All-Time Great Cast
","'Heat' is a long, epic crime film that pits two iconic Hollywood actors against each other in a game of cat and mouse. In a nearly three-hour runtime, it explores myriad sides of crime-the criminals, the police work, the sources on the street, and the strain these lifestyles put on everyone involved. It's an ambitious undertaking in which director Michael Mann opens many doors and closely all of them successfully in a deeply satisfying way. Vincent (Pacino) is a workaholic police detective with a hard liquor habit, two failed marriages in his rearview and another likely in front of him. He doesn't want to burden his wife or anyone in his life that he cares about with the horrific events he witnesses at work on a daily basis, so he refuses to share particulars. But the lack of communication doesn't end there. He hardly shares anything with his wife, which makes her starved for attention and a deeper connection. Neil (DeNiro) is cunning criminal who spent time in the clink and will do anything to avoid a return trip. His life motto is, 'never get attached to anything that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you feel the heat getting too close.' A philosophy that makes him successful as a criminal makes him a failure in any personal relationship. He's alone.After a robbery gone wrong puts Neil on the police's radar, Vincent begins to investigate Neil and his team, looking to catch them in the act on their next job. As the two leading men match wits, it becomes increasingly clear that they're sharper than everyone else in the game. We get the sense that they're impressed with each other. There's a mutual respect, despite their obvious conflicting interests. DeNiro plays the part with a brooding, quiet confidence, while Pacino opts for a more boisterous and manic persona. They're both equally entertaining, and they take turns delivering classic one liners that you'll be repeating for years. These aren't the only actors of note in the film. This is a loaded cast that seems to showcase a new star every few minutes. Mann masterfully juggles all the pieces of the dense story universe he has created. The plot never drags, and the scenes are always memorable. Because of Mann's directing acumen and a lively script, the moments of conversation are as exciting as the action sequences. And, of course, every Michael Mann movie comes with distinctive, pulsing music.'Heat' deserves to be recognized among the great crime films of the past 30 years. Even 23 years after its release, it still holds up in every way. If you're a fan of the genre, you absolutely must watch this movie.",8,2,3,9 July 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," A complete lack of effort from Keanu and everyone involved
","I'd love to feed you one of those tired clichés along the lines of, 'if you liked John Wick, you'll love John Wick 2!' or 'even better than the first!' But those would be dirty, rotten lies.The truth is that John Wick 2 falls far short of the first, which I consider a fun, albeit mostly mindless, action romp. I can sum up John Wick 1 in 11 words: A retired hit-man unleashes vengeance on those who killed his dog. It's simple, which is fine. Its quality doesn't come from its premise; it comes from cool sequences of Keanu Reeves shooting and kicking and punching people.John Wick 2 makes zero effort to create anything unique from the original. The story is the exact same except this time John Wick is seeking vengeance on someone who blew up his house. I think. There seemed to be some other motivation for John Wick, which involved a guy asking him to kill someone, John Wick refusing, the guy blowing up his house with a bazooka, then John Wick trying to kill that guy and also kill a lot of other guys.It didn't make any sense to me that John Wick refused to kill one single person, but willingly killed dozens of others a short time later. However, it did make sense me that John Wick wanted to kill someone who just blew up his house with a bazooka because if a guy blew up my house with a bazooka, I would probably want to kill him too. So, I chose to accept that as his motivation.You might be thinking, 'well what made you dislike John Wick 2 so much if you liked John Wick 1? They sound eerily similar.' Rest easy, voice that asks me questions in the form of a convenient segue. I'm about to cover that.I put a huge heaping pile of blame on Keanu for this one. His lifelessness exceeded even his own personal record for lifelessness in this performance. His lifelessness baffled scientists by reaching levels of lifelessness previously believed to be only reachable by those who are actually without life.Keanu delivered each line with the enthusiasm of moody teenager talking to his parents about math class. Not only did he seem disinterested in what he said, he also sounded a little angry and confused every time he spoke. I'm not sure if that was an ill-conceived character choice or just terrible acting. Either way, his speaking moments made me cringe.Since I'm piling on, I'll mention Keanu's walk. I'm not sure if that's how he thinks a badass walks, or if he thinks that's how a beat up person walks, or if that's just Keanu's normal walking style, but I found it distracting. No one walks like that. Except for possibly Keanu if that is indeed his normal walking style. The incompetent aspects of the movie that I wouldn't blame on Keanu all come down to the ineptitude of his enemies. I'm not a hit-man, nor a gun expert, nor have I received anything resembling training in combat. I haven't even played Halo or Call of Duty. But even I know about the thing where you lean close to the wall then peak around the corner before sprinting out in the open. John Wick probably amassed 15 easy kills simply due to his enemies never once checking corners properly.If John Wick's enemies' only shortcomings were their corner checking failures, they may have been palatable. Unfortunately, they also had the worst aim in the history of terrible aim bad guys in movies. John Wick must have landed 30 headshots, yet the other guys landed zero. They also committed unconscionably stupid errors, such as attempting to kill John Wick with their fists rather than shooting him. They also hit him with their car then stepped out of the car to fight him rather than hitting him with their car again. By the way, John Wick shot all those guys.The one part of the movie that I enjoyed came when John Wick shot guys in that cool mirrored set of rooms. Kudos to whoever designed that place and whoever staged the scenes in there. The mesmerizing optics in that sequence made me forget all my other gripes with the movie for a while.I will hold out hope that John Wick 3 manages to instill that level of creativity and visual brilliance with greater frequency. If not, I'll be right back here, writing another scathing review for an action movie beloved by many.",4,11,25,16 July 2017
Annihilation," The Visuals and Sound will Take Your Breath Away
","Alex Garland loudly and impressively announced his presence in the directing world in 2015 with his debut film, Ex Machina. His follow up doesn't disappoint, as he once again showcases a talent for boldly bringing sci-fi to the big screen in a thoughtful and visually awing way. With that said... this movie isn't as clean as Ex Machina. It's clunky in its delivery of the film's message, which is foggy. I'm still not certain what this movie is about.Is it about the different ways that we self-destruct? What we do to hurt ourselves without even necessarily being aware of it? Or is it about life and change? What at first seems like destruction or annihilation is actually just an alteration or even an evolution. Again, the answer is unclear. But the good news is that didn't bother me. I enjoyed the heck out of this movie!Does every scene work? No. Are certain plot lines about main characters' relationship issues necessary? No. But none of the flaws mattered much to me because I found the rest of the movie to be so magnetic. The visuals and music attached to this magical, dreamlike place-the shimmer-sucked me in and left me in awe for extended sequences. Certain scenes, especially moments in the movie's second half, are so captivating that the flaws and underdeveloped aspects that make up the rest of the movie seem irrelevant. The movie takes your breath away in different ways. Sometimes it's terrifying. Other times it's spectacularly beautifully original. Other times it's befuddling. I enjoyed it all.That's why I look past the story's weaknesses. I've opted to focus on the mesmerizing depiction of the area/the shimmer. Bringing that to the big screen feels like a spectacular feat of filmmaking. The performances from the actors are all fine. Nothing wowing, which is a bit disappointing considering how the loaded the cast is. Tessa Thompson is an absolute comet. Natalie Portman is well-respected for good reason. Oscar Isaac crushes every movie he's in. He does an admirable job in Annihilation. All the actors do. I certainly prefer charismatic, sparkling eyes Isaac, but he flexes his versatility here by playing a spacey, confused dude. An odd moment worth mentioning: Oscar Isaac vacillates in and out of a southern accent in one scene. It's jarring and inexplicable. But most viewers probably won't notice that. There's a chance that I imagined the whole thing. This movie can mess with your mind (in a fun way). I consider this a must-see for sci-fi fans and anyone in the mood for an otherworldly experience but doesn't want to use hallucinogenic drugs.",8,89,180,28 February 2018
Incredibles 2," A satisfying sequel the whole family will enjoy
","Fourteen years after the original, writer/director Brad Bird returns to helm the second installment of The Incredibles. The movie landscape has changed greatly since then. Many moviegoers may not realize that The Incredibles came out four years before Iron-Man, which launched the 'Marvel MCU.' So, for any fans who love superhero movies, don't just thank Robert Downey Jr. for kicking things off. Thank Brad Bird. For fans who are tired of the oversaturation of superhero movies, still thank Brad Bird because The Incredibles is a truly wonderful film.The sequel doesn't quite reach the lofty standard of the original, which would have been nearly impossible, what with the originality and seminal nature of film, the characters and the exceptional villain. But Incredibles 2 does boast improvements to the visuals. I advise you to sit relatively close and take a good look at the detail of every scene. The lighting, the color, the movement-it's all immaculate. In a visual sense, this movie is a marvelous achievement. The weakest aspect of the movie is the villain. The villain is obvious, predictable and unclear in his or her ideology. I get the sense that all the necessary pieces were there, but the filmmakers couldn't quite put together the puzzle. Fear not, the villain's shortcomings are certainly not enough to spoil the movie. It has the appropriate blend of action, thoughtful commentary for the adults and silly jokes for the kids. I opted not to mention the plot at all because I thought, 'why bother?' The Incredibles have to stop a villain, and they also deal with other issues. Great, you get it. Now go see this movie.",7,68,156,19 June 2018
