The Blair Witch Project," Original and under-appreciated
","This film currently on IMDb gets 6.3? It's funny how the same people that slated this film like Paranormal Activity. A movie that would never have come to be had Blair Witch not reworked the genre, yet a film that is cheap in comparison in strength of story, characters and realism. You cannot deny the impact this movie has had on others. The character development is intriguing and filled with mistrust. Heather is annoying but true to life, people are irritating and annoying at times:)The sound effects are subtle and create an isolation. The film gathers momentum and the fear of the dark really affect the viewer. The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't have a typical formula. It doesn't provide the viewer with any relief (cheap scares, cheap jokes that relieves the tension). Instead it constantly builds fear in the viewer with atmospheric sounds, visuals and the impending sense of tragedy. Nobody could honestly say they knew how this movie would play out. What sets this film apart from others are the empty surroundings. There have been many Horrors shot in woodland areas(mansions,cabins etc) but few entirely in the woods. The subject of witch craft was skillfully mastered. This film worked with a low budget where others would have failed.",10,7,13,27 May 2013
The Avengers," Marvel at the stupidity of the masses
","This is a joke of a movie that's far from funny. I can't believe this movie gets 8.3 currently on IMDb? So this is on par with all those classic movies that score an 8.3? Those movies that people will enjoy for decades to come? I'm stunned how well this has been received. Anyone over the age of 7 that has given this film a good review should be ashamed. The absolute saturation of CGI is disgusting, and seems to be enough to forgive the many flaws of this movie. The action is as poor as the humor, which is brutal. I'm not against the Marvel characters, I grew up with them. I know you can't go into certain movies with a critical eye, all I expected from my trip to the cinema was to be entertained. Instead I was saddened, shocked and bored to the point of irritation. I seen the amazing Spider-Man recently, THAT was entertaining. The reason was because there was some thought and effort but into all aspects of the movie, as it should be, to the character and story. It had everything that the avengers lacked.",1,20,51,30 May 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Horrendously awful
","There hasn't been many films made more disappointing than this mess. The original Cameron Terminator changed Cinema,also launching the career of action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger.The main problem is this flawed installment is it doesn't explain anything!Clearly in T2 the years of research destroyed at cyberdyne systems(the microprocessor chip,arm,hardrives of research) were dismissed.We are instead given the ridiculous reason that it was always meant to happen.mmm.How? There is a reason one of the main characters played by Linda Hamilton turned down the script.When she declined they killed her off,said she had cancer and put guns in her casket.Need I say more?Arnie tells more jokes rather than acting like a machine.The villain or Terminatrix is a mute model that offers nothing.This film marks the start of the reboot,remake and rehash of classic movies.The sad thing is Cameron wanted to do it but wanted more time.His disappointment reflects the majority of fans including me.Anyone who liked it all I can say is I hope you enjoy transformers 4;)",2,1,3,27 May 2013
Apocalypse Now," An exceptional achievement
","What can I say that hasn't already been said? An epic masterpiece that captures the true insanity of war. Francis Ford Coppola's films dominated the 70's. The trouble with the making of this film has been well documented. As they say 'There is no true beauty without decay.' There are powerhouse performances from Sheen, Duvall and Brando. I think the sound and narration are perfect. I can't think of a film where a narrator has blended the story so seamlessly. The music by The Doors with the surroundings capture something truly special. It offers something different from the standard war movie. The sense of disillusionment and detachment from the war itself really stands out.",10,0,2,16 June 2013
Blade Runner," A Beautiful Masterpiece
","If you like science fiction it doesn't get much better than this. The lighting in this movie is exceptional. There are many versions of this movie, I would advise a first time viewer to watch the final cut. The acting, set design, wardrobe and cinematography is stunning. I would strongly advise a second viewing because it's a lot to take in. The film offers the deepest questions of self and what it really is to be human. It took a long time to get the recognition it deserved. Then again many great movies do. The film looks as good as anything you will see today visually. There are standout performances from Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford. The music by Vangelis is beautiful with 'Memories of Green' reflecting the true wonder of the movie. We are rarely treated with a movie with such thought that delivers. The visionary Sir Ridley Scott made something that truly captured the imagination.",10,0,4,27 May 2013
