The Avengers," A major success in the genre of superhero films
","So, back when the Marvel Cinematic Universe started up, every preceding film was leading up to this moment: the Avengers assembling. Every character had been fleshed out already (save for the fact that Hawkeye and Black Widow were only supporting characters in some of the films and the Hulk had been recast) and the stage had been set.The Tesseract from the first Captain America film is the McGuffin of the film, desired by Loki, who is portrayed brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston once again.In terms of the story, it's nothing groundbreaking or original, but it's still entertaining. This rag-tag group of heroes must band together and save the world from extraterrestrial threat, while trying to remain civil with one another.For the most part, this film is an absolute spectacle. Comic book fans had been dreaming for a film like this where these iconic heroes team up and save the day.Joss Whedon succeeds in giving us a memorable superhero film. Of course there are references in the film that will inevitably build up to future sequels, which in a sense gets a little tiring.Other than that, this film really is a testament to the effort of those involved in the MCU.",8,0,2,16 February 2017
Iron Man 3," Nice character development for Stark
","So after the critically panned Iron Man 2 (I didn't hate it), and the hugely successful Avengers, Robert Downey Jr returns in his third solo outing as Tony Stark AKA Iron Man.Having developed anxiety and PTSD from the events of the Avengers (which kinda comes out of nowhere), Stark becomes an obsessed fanatic building model after model of his Iron Man suit, fearing he will lose his loved ones.The demons of his past come back to haunt him when a mad scientist called Aldrich Killian (played by Guy Pearce, whom he humiliated in the past, vows to get revenge after he has successfully climbed the corporate ladder, working for a company called AIM, experimenting in cell regeneration only to result in disaster. Also, a terror threat is ongoing with videos in the style of Osama Bin Laden being distributed by The Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley, or so we think.AIM prove to be a formidable threat, nearly devastating Tony's life, as he goes through his own journey of self-discovery hoping to get redemption and retribution. He bonds with a young boy in Tennessee and prepares to deal with the Mandarin and AIM.This film presents a lot of twists and turns, some of which annoyed comic book fans severely. Me personally, I didn't mind. It's a solid film overall. It gives Stark a bit more depth, as opposed to always being the swaggering smart-ass genius. You feel the stakes a bit more as opposed to the previous Iron Man film, where there weren't any.It was more of a character story as opposed to your run-of-the-mill superhero films. It has the same story beats as The Incredibles but it's always fun seeing Downey playing Stark.An alright film.",7,0,0,4 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," We all know what's coming, but this film still delivers
","So, any Star Wars fan can pretty much connect the dots in deducing what takes place in this film. It's literally right before the original Star Wars begins so it doesn't take a genius to figure it out.We're introduced to an ensemble of entirely new characters, half of which, you'll forget their names as soon as you finish the film. To give you an example, here's my roll-call of the main protagonists without consulting Google: Jyn, Cassien, K-2SO, Blind Jedi Follower, Buddy and Asian Machete.So Jyn Erso has more or less lived through her developing years as an outlaw. You could argue that there are many parallels between her and Rey from The Force Awakens, even down to a complete copy of the scene where she takes down a team of assailants single-handedly while the male sidekick looks on impressed.While this is officially Star Wars canon, it takes a couple of new approaches, such as not having a title crawl at the beginning, travelling to several new planets and captions describing the planets. Even the traditional John Williams score is nowhere to be heard.Despite all this, it's serviceable as a film. One distinction is that it is considerably more darker than the traditional Star Wars film. Their use of CGI is both impressive and questionable. Trying to portray characters previously played by deceased actors is tricky, so I was unsure what to make of CGI Peter Cushing as Governor Tarkin. I wouldn't have minded it as much if he was a recurring character but there are numerous scenes where he appears and every successive time he appears, the illusion gets more and more broken. The same can be said about CGI Leia at the end. I know that Carrie Fisher was still alive at the time this film was released but it's just something haunting about the glossiness of CGI Carrie Fisher circa 1977.The action in this film is amazing, especially the space battle; clearly a homage to Return of the Jedi. A number of unexpected cameos appear as well, which is a complete surprise. If there's one aspect that could be described as a weak link, it's the character chemistry. I know that these actors are good (hell, Felicity Jones was Oscar-nominated), but the overall delivery isn't quite to that same standard. For example, Jyn Erso sees a hologram of her father, whom she hasn't seen for about 10-15 years and starts crying her eyes out. She meets her father in a later scene as he dies. No tears, just 'Noooo!' That didn't quite work for me.Also, no point getting emotionally invested because these characters all meet the same fate. K-2SO is probably one of favourite Star Wars characters now, though.This film also gave us the best Darth Vader scene ever, making me wish that we had more scenes to that degree.Overall, this film makes a great addition to the universe of Star Wars. However, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who has never seen a Star Wars film before, otherwise they would be completely lost.",8,2,4,25 January 2017
Captain Marvel," Not terrible, not amazing; just very underwhelming.
","Marvel's first female-led superhero film in the MCU, which media pundits never fail missing an opportunity to bring up. (Despite the fact that there have been numerous previous examples of female led superhero/action films, but of course they're willing to look the other way to suit their narrative)The media firestorm that culminated in a fanbase civil war, if you will, was overblown to hell. Divisive comments made by Brie Larson about gender and race disparities in film criticism served as ammunition for sceptics to kick up a fuss about the film prior to its release. It got to the point where Rotten Tomatoes had to redesign its website, removing the interest poll, as they believed that people were 'review-bombing' the film. This is not true, as they were not reviewing the film; they were simply expressing their interest prior to release, but again, whatever suits their narrative.But anyway, onto my actual review. We meet Brie Larson as Vers, serving as a bounty hunter for an alien alliance. Her team's objective is to eliminate a race of alien shapeshifters called Skrulls. In the midst of an ambush, she is abducted by a team of Skrulls who attempt to extract her memories. Vers has no recollection of these memories, but it would seem she lived a life as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot on Earth. In her attempt to escape, Danvers crash lands on Earth where she comes across Nick Fury and the early formation of SHIELD. The year is 1995, so there are a number of 'nostalgic' 90s references and songs. The story becomes a sort of buddy cop movie with Danvers and Fury as they encounter more alien interferences and a strange ginger cat. Without spoiling anything, good triumphs over evil, Danvers becomes Captain Marvel and Fury comes to view Danvers as a vital asset for his future Avengers Initiative.Now, let me be clear, the movie isn't god-awful but it is incredibly mediocre and forgettable. The script is chock full of pacing issues and plot contrivances, as well as the character development of Carol Danvers being frustratingly paper-thin. Larson is a competent actress but she is criminally miscast in this film. The story of Captain Marvel feels painfully shoehorned in simply to justify her appearance in Avengers Endgame. Apart from some rushed exposition and disjointed flashbacks, there's just not enough material to establish Danvers as a relatable character. Larson's delivery and performance feels very phoned in and it just seems like a cheap move to crowbar her into the MCU as a deus ex machina to take on Thanos in the upcoming Avengers film. There are also elements in this film that ruin the continuity of the film universe, having been fleshed out for over a decade.
Also, the revelation of how Fury lost his eye is shown here and it's such a disservice to his character. I wouldn't have minded this film too much if only it weren't for the relentless media propaganda, politicising Captain Marvel with the feminist narrative. Nothing is groundbreaking about this film. If anything, Marvel Studios are far too late to the game. They had every opportunity to commission a solo Black Widow film, which in my opinion, would've been far more compelling, given how fleshed out her character has become over the better part of a decade.A large number of the original Avengers are due to step down after Endgame, as their Marvel contracts are due to expire. The plan is to have Larson as Captain Marvel become the new leader, which I view as something akin to a novice new recruit taking control as CEO of a business after a short period.
Nothing against Larson, but she does not have the gravitas to accurately capture a conflicted superhero.",4,10,18,12 March 2019
Iron Man 2," By no means a flawless film but still entertaining
","OK, so this film is considered by a bunch of people to be completely terrible, and while I can agree that there are a bunch of flaws, I wouldn't define this film as god-awful.A lot of things are thrown into the mix only to be resolved by some sort of deus ex machina. To put it short, this is just filler leading up to The Avengers.Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for Tony Stark. He proved himself in the original Iron Man and here, while this film isn't quite as good as the first, he still carries the charm with him, even if Stark is caught in a battle of his own self-destruction.Sam Rockwell plays a tenacious, awkward and irritating rival to Stark in the form of Justin Hammer, another weapons developer, who tries to team up with Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, the son of Howard Stark's business partner(?) whose revenge stems from the Stark family taking credit for the creation of the arc reactor while his family is forgotten about? It's not developed enough.Meanwhile, Tony Stark needs to find a suitable replacement element for his Arc Reactor as the palladium core is slowly killing him. As well as that, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is shoehorned into the film, merely just to establish her presence in the Avengers, rather than HER OWN FILM, which even at the time of writing this, seven years after the film's release, there still aren't any concrete plans.The film is full of red herrings and subplots that get resolves so quickly, that it really makes you ask what was the point of including it in the film to begin with. Also, the action is very short-lived.Putting all that aside, it's cool to see Robert Downey Jr. just be himself as Tony Stark. Full of confidence and charisma that it seems completely effortless.",6,1,2,3 February 2017
Spider-Man 3," It has it's flaws, but it's not the worst
","So with the release of Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, people were looking forward to this film. We were going to be introduced to the Sandman and Venom, so what wasn't to like about that? Well, some people ended up hating this film because of its overcluttered plot and pacing issues, and while I have to agree with those problems, I wouldn't say I hate this film.So, the story. Peter Parker is finally going out with Mary Jane, who now knows his identity as Spider-Man. As well as that, Harry Osborn now knows about Peter being Spider-Man and is hell bent on revenge, still thinking that Peter murdered his father. Harry takes possession of his late father's Green Goblin weaponry and arms himself to eliminate Parker once and for all. However, he ends up getting concussed and this triggers amnesia, wiping his memories of Peter being Spider-Man and his father's death. Pretty convenient, huh? Anyway, along with that, Flint Marko comes into the picture; an escaped convict revealed to be the real killer of Uncle Ben, who gets caught in a particle radiation experiment, restructuring his anatomy, changing him into the Sandman. Also, a meteor falls to Earth, containing the symbiote that changes its host to Venom. It latches onto Parker, who discovers about Marko and awakens his darker side.ALSO, Eddie Brock is introduced as a rival to Parker, determined to beat Parker at getting a staff job at the Daily Bugle. He's kind of a snarky ass and from the get-go, is kinda unlikable. He eventually becomes Venom.Right, so even by the description, there is a lot of stuff going on. Peter feels the pressure of all the obstacles going on. His turbulent relationship with Mary Jane, his on-off friendship with Harry, avenging his uncle by confronting Sandman, and dealing with Brock. The overcrowded plot and supporting characters obscure the story quite a bit to the point where it gets messy.Peter struggles to balance his emotions, amplified by the Venom symbiote and as a result, we witness a number of cheesy scenes. When you picture Parker trying to overcome the influence of Venom, the last thing that comes to mind is a montage of him walking down the street and pathetically flirting with female pedestrians.The story beats are all there, but as I said, the pacing is all over the place, as well as the tone. The action scenes are decent enough though, so I have to give it that.A major step back from Raimi's first two Spider-Man films but it's not the worst Spider-Man film. I'll just leave it at that.",5,0,2,10 July 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Now THAT'S how you make a Thor film!!
","Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were among the weaker installments. They took them a little too seriously and they were a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction though. The humour throughout is pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of the motion picture. The lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friends is a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than being bogged down with Thor's forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from the previous two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the forefront as Hela, the villain of the piece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time of her life portraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki must put aside their differences and try to stop her. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes their dynamic more enjoyable.They end up getting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playing the Grandmaster (but really it's Goldblum playing himself) who forces Thor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gains the trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and from there, it's your classic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director, adding a lot of charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic is also great as well, a real '80s neon feel. And the music...the music was brilliant! Who would've thought that the composer for Rugrats would deliver such an awesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form for the God of Thunder!!!",9,51,91,25 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spidey's back!
","So, Spider-Man reboot no. 2....After seeing Tom Holland cameo in Civil War, a lot of promise was shown. He embodied the character of the nervous teen Peter Parker pretty efficiently. I was curious to see how they would expand on it in this film.Well, needless to say, they did a pretty good job. It ties into the narrative from Civil War seamlessly and does very well exploring the story of Peter Parker, desperate to impress Tony Stark so he will become an Avenger. However, he's still in high school and must deal with the stuff that comes with that.The villain of the piece is the Vulture, played by Michael Keaton. A salvage worker laid off after the events of the Avengers, he attempts to smuggle and steal as much alien/advanced tech as he can and manufacture enhanced weapons from it, as well as cause havoc in his mechanical wing suit.Essentially the meat of the story is Parker trying to gain significance. Being babied by Stark frustrates him and he tries to get involved in preventing more serious crimes, only to be reprimanded by Stark. It's an good dynamic, and also Holland may be my new favourite Spider-Man.So, it's a decent flick, although it does get bogged down by a lot of stereotypical high school scenes we have seen already from countless other movies. Social outcasts, bullies, love interests, popular kids having a party, etc. Also, the plausibility of the technology of Spidey's suit gets a bit ridiculous. I know Stark is a tech genius, but seriously, a spandex suit with JARVIS-like AI? I know it's a movie, but still...Other than that, this film was very entertaining and was certainly a breath of fresh air after the previous installment of Spider-Man on film.

Suicide Squad," Wasted potential
","So, I don't even know where to start with this one.Seeing as the script took just six weeks to write, the result is clear as day. An absolute disaster story-wise. Having to establish an ensemble of completely new characters to the uninitiated, with the use of distracting edits and literally spelling out who everyone is by use of stylized captions? Really?Sigh. This film is guilty of false advertising. The marketing and promotion lured the crowd in for what essentially was a dark Avengers flick. Boy, did they miss the mark?! This film fails on almost every level. The frantic pace in which they try to establish the main characters and the plot in the first half hour is just incredible. They try to make the characters relatable by utilizing fleeting flashbacks, desperately trying to make them seem relatable. It fails. Some characters don't even get the luxury of a 'backstory' and their motivations are simply explained through expository dialogue.The plot is about as standard as you can get with these superhero films. The only difference is that they're villains/convicts that get coerced into vigilantism. They have to defeat the antagonist and save the world. The execution is carried out so poorly though. Aside from Deadshot and Harley Quinn, character development for everyone else is just thrown out the window. I mean, for god's sake, they introduce a guy to the team who gets axed a few minutes later! And don't get me started on the Joker. Good God. Everybody was anticipating Jared Leto's interpretation of the character and for what we saw of him, he did alright, for what, the TWO, MAYBE THREE SCENES HE WAS IN?! I was a bit skeptical of modelling him after a pimp, with the teeth grille and velvet jacket. But at least use him a bit more if Leto is SECOND BILLING IN THE CAST!!! The utilization of the soundtrack sounded like it was mixed by some intern who first discovered the editing software. Back to back pop songs we've heard in the trailer for the first half and a criminal misuse of them at that.Look, I can complain about this film and what it did wrong until the cows come home, and upon first viewing, I was quite sparing in my criticism, saying it was OK. Upon re-evaluation, it's a disaster. A complete insult to the crowd who were enticed by what they promised in the trailers/marketing.",2,2,3,12 January 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Fantastic action but no lasting stakes
","So, after seeing Captain America in his first standalone film and then in The Avengers, I thought he was a decent character but wasn't completely enthralled by him.Well, things get taken up a gear in The Winter Soldier as Cap tries to deal with life in the 21st century. His old flame from the 40s is bedridden and senile, post-9/11 America starts to scare him, and ultimately he must learn to trust no one.SHIELD gets infiltrated, taking Nick Fury out of the picture, so Cap and Black Widow must fend off the Winter Soldier and the rest of the SHIELD double agents, later found out to be members of HYDRA. They must prevent Robert Redford's character; the corrupt leader of SHIELD from using heavily armed aircraft carriers to decimate the city.So, the Winter Soldier is revealed to be Bucky Barnes, Cap's childhood friend from back in the day, who coincidentally got frozen and experimented on with the same super serum as Cap. And I'm not gonna lie, he's pretty badass. The first scene we see him or when he's escaping from Cap after sniping fury, I get chills every time. He is more of a threat to Cap because of course, he is brainwashed and also, Cap doesn't want to kill his friend.Cap also befriends Sam Wilson or Falcon in this movie, and his debut entry with the mechanical wings on top of a skyscraper is possibly my favourite entry for a superhero ever.The action in this film is incredible. The pyrotechnics and combat are amazing to look at, but they're not done in a gratuitous way (like Michael Bay, for instance) The only flaw of this film is the overall lack of stakes. Yeah, sure, Robert Redford gets eliminated but that was kinda predictable. Nick Fury gets shot and is pronounced dead in hospital. Turns out he survived. Rumlow gets crushed by falling building debris. Oh no, it's OK, he's coming back for Civil War. Cap receives fatal gunshot wounds, gets beaten in the face with a metal appendage and falls about 500 feet into the middle of the ocean. Don't worry, he's fine! See what I mean? The one problem with these Marvel films is that you know deep down, they're always going to play it safe. These films are laid out on a conveyor belt after all. These actors have multi-movie contracts.Aside from that, this is my favourite Marvel movie. It mixes elements of spy thriller and action films into a superhero film and it works dividends. It has my absolute recommendation.",8,1,2,23 January 2017
Doctor Strange," An absolute spectacle. Apart from that, pretty standard
","At this stage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the standalone movies have become pretty predictable. The sheer frequency of these films and the existing knowledge that they're not going to kill any of the characters off because they need them for ensemble films is common at this point, so there are no major stakes.Also, after thirteen films in the MCU where they have more or less fleshed out the majority of these superheroes, suddenly now we're being introduced to a fresh face? Just a tad jarring. The introduction to Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is nothing we aren't used to. Typical fall from grace and redemption story.The cast are all respected thespians in their own right, but there are no Oscar worthy scenes here. Well, in terms of acting, anyway. The CGI, absolutely. The visuals in this film are so trippy and well done that it deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. It certainly took a few leaves out of 'Inception's book and the result is truly mesmerizing.Otherwise, it's just a pretty standard addition to the backlog of Marvel films. The villain isn't that impressive, the threat is easily stopped and it's pointless to get invested in emotional stakes.",7,1,2,3 February 2017
Interstellar," Very ambitious film, but it feels like you're in a science test
","Christopher Nolan has always approached intriguing subject matter in his films. His niche seems to be the 'thinking man's film' and Interstellar is no exception.In this dystopian setting, where mankind is enduring severe blight, Matthew McConaughey stumbles upon a team of NASA scientists and must part from his family to find a suitable planet through a wormhole for the human race to migrate to.When it comes to performance, McConaughey knocks it out of the park. Scenes like watching his family age before him as he sits through 23 years of messages after falling victim to drastic time dilation, it's heartbreaking.The visuals and concepts of this film are absolutely breathtaking. From depictions of wormholes to black holes to five-dimensional tesseracts, this film certainly takes us out of our comfort zones.The downside, unfortunately, is that every character has some preachy, philosophical soliloquy ready to go in each scene. The dialogue, especially when they get into space, is incredibly technical and scientifically specific. Your average punter wouldn't be able to keep up with the equations and probabilities presented here. Sure, they will be stunned by the visuals, but that's about it.Also, the very notion that the fate of humanity is saved thanks to the power of love? Seriously? In a film where they literally got assistance from a renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne to help them with scientific accuracy, the chorus of a Huey Lewis song is the solution? That affected my investment in the film big-time.Aside from this, this film is a spectacle to behold. It drags a bit but it's worth it just for the visuals.",7,0,1,27 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Damage Control - The Movie
","After Rian Johnson 'subverted our expectations' with The Last Jedi, in comes JJ Abrams again to hastily bring the ship that is the sequel trilogy back on track. What we're presented is glorified fan fiction that may as well have been written by a teenager.The over-reliance on nostalgia is pain-stakingly evident, with Palpatine and Lando Calrissian roped in once again, along with re-used story beats from Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi.This film is also cluttered with sub-plots that could easily be their own self contained movies. The frantic pacing of the film is off-putting at times. There's a clear sense of desperation, trying to tie up the loose ends of the story.Even the resolution is very rushed, in my opinion. There's no room to breathe, as the movie throws so much at you. The visuals are nice, though.",4,8,13,27 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Filler
","I regret to say that this is the first Star Wars film I've ever watched. Needless to say, I was downright confused by the end of it. It was only years later, after receiving the necessary context that anyone going into a Star Wars film needs, that I understood everything about this film. That being said, this should not be the first Star Wars film anyone should watch because the story is all over the place. It's a frantic attempt to put the characters through some conflict, building up to the rise of the Empire.This film completely ignores the rule of 'show, don't tell', as many characters engage in expository soliloquys rather than scenes being shown of the events they are going through. Anakin, once again, is horrendously miscast. This was Hayden Christensen's introduction into the Star Wars universe and in many cases, his delivery is just laughable. The amount of memes that have been generated due to his 'I don't like sand' line is ridiculous.There is one scene in this film, which in my opinion, is the perfect metaphor for this film. It's a scene where our heroes stumble upon an assembly line of droids being built. That is exactly how this film feels; like an emotionally devoid process. Emotion tries to be shown in this film, but the dialogue is incredibly stilted that it removes any human element present.The over-reliance on CGI is jarring to the point that it affects your suspension of disbelief. It really is a shame to see acclaimed actors like Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson act so robotically.This film only exists to fill in the gaps between the prequels and the original series. End of.",2,0,1,15 February 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Standard origin story with good morals
","So this is the MCU's introduction of Captain America. Some naysayers will say that this is just filler for The Avengers, and in a sense they're kinda right.Putting that aside, it presents to us the story of Steve Rogers, a puny weakling with a heart of gold, wishing to enlist in the US Army to fight in WWII. While his peers see him as worthless, a German scientist loyal to the US Army sees great potential in him and uses him as a test subject for a super soldier programme. Sure enough, he undergoes the experiments and emerges as a beefed up strong man. Joined with the US army, along with his best friend Bucky Barnes, his goal is to take down Hydra, a fascist regime similar to the Nazis and it's leader, the Red Skull, who has taken control of the Tesseract, an artifact powered by an Infinity Stone.So, putting aside the comments that this is just filler, it's actually a decent stand-alone flick. Rogers' patriotism defines him as a loyal and noble character. The sets and scenery make this a pretty good period piece, and it combines the genres of WWII and superhero/science fiction quite effectively.I wouldn't be gushing over this film going 'IT WAS AMAAAAAAAZZZZZZIIINNNGGG!' or anything, but it's still fairly decent. It introduces Captain America to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's all you need, really.",7,0,2,30 March 2017
Justice League," Entertaining but flawed
","So after seeing Batman vs Superman, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film. The trailer, particularly, with it's sacrilegious abomination cover of the Beatles' Come Together, gave me mixed feelings about it.DC have been playing catch-up with Marvel for ages, and it really shows. Half of the Justice League have already been introduced from previous films. The others (Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg) are given their proper debut here (no, I'm not counting their brief cameos in the other films) and the film does its best to integrate them into the story. The film is your standard 'evil overlord tries to take over the world' plot, with Batfleck trying to assemble the Justice League. The team have some funny lines occasionally, which I feel is thanks to Joss Whedon being one of the screenwriters, but once again, the Zack Snyder tropes come to the surface with numerous sped up/slo-mo action scenes. There were also a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe.The film overall is enjoyable but there are pacing issues. The villain of the piece is particularly forgettable. They try to build this sense of scale that looks grand and epic but ultimately it doesn't quite live up to the hype, in my opinion.If we're talking about wasted potential, how about JK Simmons as Commissioner Gordon? I really hope he has more time to shine in future films because he had no reason to be in this film other than establishing his presence in the DC Universe. Also, speaking of wasted talent/useless characters, Amy Adams as Lois Lane... I swear to God, her character development is halted in its tracks beyond simply 'I love Superman'. It's ridiculous.That aside, the main heroes perform well here. I particularly enjoyed Ezra Miller's interpretation of the Flash. Jason Momoa is just awesome in everything. Gal Gadot is great as Wonder Woman, yet again, Ray Fisher makes a good Cyborg (I found it ironic that his Dad was the actor who played Miles Dyson in Terminator 2) and Ben Affleck continues to be great as Bruce Wayne.Not terrible, not fantastic, but it's in the healthy middle ground for me.",6,36,73,16 November 2017
Dunkirk," An experience
","So anyone who has seen Nolan's previous films know that he has a particular niche, i.e. everything being displayed and shot on a grand scale, characters delivering sweeping philosophical soliloquys and so forth. He definitely has a formula.However, while the sense of scale is still present in this film, the character interaction is fairly minimal, which some people may view as a criticism but for me personally, it only allows you to become immersed in the setting that little bit easier.So, obviously, this film is set during WWII and tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, one of the events that took place during the war that was arguably instrumental in the Allies getting back on their feet and fighting back against the Nazis. As I said earlier, while the use of character studies takes a major back seat here, the film is compensated by its utilization of breathtaking shots and stellar sound design that really takes you into the moment.Between aerial dogfights, capsizing ships and the overall fear of the young British soldiers shown on screen, Nolan succeeds in showing us the general sense of peril and fear felt by those present during the battle.Once again, the casting in Nolan's film is excellent, although I have to say I was initially skeptical when I heard that Harry Styles was brought on board, thinking that he'd drop a new single mid-skirmish, à la Ed Sheeran in Game of Thrones, but I digress. Styles actually did pretty well in his role.It was also interesting that most of the characters, particularly the soldiers, are rarely, if at all, referred to by name. Even to the point where I watched the credits and saw Cillian Murphy simply credited as 'Shivering Man'. That being said, given that this was an evacuation mission to rescue around 400,000 soldiers, it's just as well, in a way, that they weren't bogged down in exposition learning hundreds of names.This film is merely about the event rather than any character story. The composition of shots and sound design pulls you in for the ride, and for me personally, it sucked me in to the scene very effectively.Definite recommendation from me.",9,0,5,9 August 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," The untold story? Yeah, right
","So after the mixed reviews of Spider-Man 3 and the aborted plans for Spider-Man 4, Sony decided to reboot the franchise with a new cast, new director and a 'new' story thread.Peter Parker is now played by Andrew Garfield, who is a decent actor but his portrayal as Spider-Man is kinda questionable. Once again, he is too old to pull off the illusion that he's still in high school. Also, the classic archetype of Peter Parker pre-spider bite is that he's a reclusive nerdy brainbox. This iteration of Parker takes a different turn, as Garfield plays the part as a hipster wannabe who is already handsome and charismatic.His love interest is Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone. Their chemistry is perfect together but Gwen's input to the plot is fairly minimal, other than her father being the Chief of Police, played by Denis Leary. Gwen finds out that Parker is Spider-Man and tries to keep the fact hidden from her father, who is out to foil him for vigilantism.So the promotional marketing tried to pass off this movie as the 'untold story' of Spider-Man, which turns out to be a complete lie as the origin story of Spider-Man is rehashed with the only different being a loose thread as to how Parker's parents passed away.Uncle Ben is now played by Martin Sheen who *spoiler alert* dies. Big shock. Parker tries to track down and confront his uncle's killer. Or at least 10-20 minutes of the film focus on his efforts to find the killer, but then that subplot is completely aborted and never referenced again. Instead, we get thrown into a hastily thrown together villain story about Curt Connors/The Lizard, a work partner of Parker's dad, played by Rhys Ifans.The motivation of the Lizard is an unfocused mess. An Oscorp professor with only one arm, specializing in cross species genetics, he gets his hands on an incomplete algorithm from Parker, based off his father's research, in which he tries to use lizard DNA to regenerate his lost limb. Things go horribly wrong when he mutates into the Lizard and then all of a sudden, he goes on a mad rampage attempting to infect the city of New York with the airborne lizard gas and turn everyone into lizard creatures.I gave this film a pass when I first saw it, thinking nothing of it, but in retrospect, it's kind of a mess. Parker's rarely likable, we've seen the 'story' before and there's hardly anything memorable. The only thing I bought into was the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Other than that, this film is a solid 'meh' for the entirety.",4,2,4,10 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Epic yet predictable
","So this film was hyped to death coming up to its initial release. One of the most anticipated superhero films, arguably on par with The Avengers.Now, the cynical viewer would easily point out the parallels this film has with Batman vs Superman (i.e. the government taking action against vigilantism, two superheroes and their rag-tag groups taking opposing sides of the same agenda, a sinister mastermind orchestrating the situation in which these characters oppose one another, and so forth.) However, while the DC cinematic universe have given us minimal source material of these versions of their classic superheroes, Marvel are about ten steps ahead, having fleshed out every character in the ensemble from previous films (well...bar two but we'll get to that) The plot seems a lot to take in. While the whole Sokovia Accords legislation drama is mainly taking centre stage, Cap must try to save Bucky from himself, as the ghosts of his past come back to consume him, figuratively speaking. Cap and Bucky try to stop the 'villain', Zemo from awakening a group of other enhanced assassins and try to evade the law enforcement in place after their successions at saving the world are misconstrued due to the collateral damage.The superhero subplot turns out to be a complete red herring as Zemo successfully lures our main characters into a Russian bunker and revealing that Bucky killed Stark's parents, which leads to the true battle between Cap and Stark.Overall, the movie is serviceable, even if the cast list does seem excessive. The inclusion of Spiderman and Black Panther doesn't feel too much like it was shoehorned in, but many would make the argument. The airport fight scene between the Avengers factions takes a while to get to but the drama is constant, meanwhile.Ultimately, you know that there aren't going to be any lasting stakes because Marvel still have a dozen more of these films to dish out. The cycle is getting a little repetitive, but if you're looking for good action, cool visuals and superheroes generally doing their thing, you're in luck.",8,3,6,12 January 2017
Avengers: Endgame," A spectacle
","A worthy follow-up to Infinity War with a lot of action, humour and drama. Couple of plot contrivances, but you can easily overlook them.",8,1,5,25 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Decent, but not worth the overwhelming amount of hype
","10 years and 18 previous Marvel films have led up to this moment. Some of the preceding films were better than others but the ensemble of characters have been established for us nonetheless.Thanos (played by Josh Brolin) is the villain of the piece, and against my expectations, he's actually fleshed out really well as a character. From the fleeting glimpses of him we saw in some of the earlier films, he didn't really leave much of an impression, which caused me to fear that he would be bland and one-note like a selection of some of the other Marvel villains. But, no, he's given depth, motivation and they make him somewhat understandable.So, as the title and premise suggests, Thanos is on an intergalactic conquest to acquire all six Infinity Stones to power his gauntlet so that he can decimate the universe, for the sake of 'balance.' Makes sense in a very twisted way, but he's still a madman.Meanwhile, the Avengers slowly but surely get made aware of the threat and band together, albeit in different groups, relative to their locations and circumstances. Each group have either the possession or the knowledge of at least one Infinity Stone, so Thanos dispatches his minions of the Black Order to retrieve them for him.Also, side note: Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw (Squidward), good god, he is brilliant!! Perhaps I'm biased because I'm also Irish and I loved him in Love/Hate, but he is such an underrated actor.But getting back to the topic of how the story is laid out, and this is one major gripe I had with the film: it is cluttered as hell!! Don't get me wrong, I know how difficult it is to incorporate 20+ main heroes into one film, but the constant jumping back and forth between subplots makes you constantly have to remind yourself what happened to the previous group.The characters work well off one another and there are a couple of funny lines, but some of our heroes were either underdeveloped or out of character. For instance, Star-Lord. I know that he's been shown to be juvenile and immature in a funny way in previous films, but he comes across as an insecure, impulsive joke here. There's a pivotal moment in the film where he single-handedly ruins a plan in motion, that could've ended the threat for our heroes. The action scenes are fairly decent. The Wakandan battle scene was very well captured, in my opinion. I've probably become desensitized to these superhero action films, merely because of the sheer frequency I've looked at similar looking battles, but for the first time, we're shown a Marvel film with ACTUAL STAKES! No spoilers, but for the last five minutes of the film, my facial expression was frozen to one of absolute shock, which is a first for me. They've given us a decent cliffhanger for the next film, at least.So yeah, generally, it's a competently produced film. The Russo Brothers continue to do a good job in the MCU. The drawback for me was the pacing and the jumping between the different groups. 
(Also, mild spoiler: What the hell was Peter Dinklage doing?! I full-on laughed at every one of his scenes. His accent as that character was ridiculous and kinda ruined my suspension of disbelief)Not the best Marvel film for me, but it's in my top 10, at least.",7,2,5,4 May 2018
Get Out," To quote Ron Burgundy, 'that escalated quickly'
","The storyline of the awkward encounter between a guy and his girlfriend's parents certainly is nothing new. However, in Jordan Peele's directorial debut, he takes it up a notch by having the boyfriend be black, visiting his girlfriend's old fashioned white family in a remote town.Peele nails it on the head with the social satire of subconscious uneasiness between Daniel Kaluuya as the boyfriend and all the other Caucasian characters he comes into contact with. He learns that something isn't quite right with his girlfriend's family, with their African-American 'servants', that raises a red flag.Things take a turn for the worst when he learns the truth about his girlfriend's family, and then, his main objective mirrors the film's title. Very simply, 'GET OUT!' From there, the film goes up a gear in tone and the atmosphere is unsettling to the nth degree.Peele captures the subtleties of uneasiness between White Americans and African-Americans in this film. It goes a little bit off the rails when you discover the girlfriend's family's true intent, but overall, it's a fairly decent film. Definitely has my recommendation.",7,2,5,25 April 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Major step back from Days of Future Past
","OK, so let me just say first of all: this film was not a disaster.However, compared to the previous installment in this series, this film fails in a number of areas. Most notably, tonal inconsistency and continuity.I'll just point out one thing for starters. This film takes place in 1983. First Class takes place in 1962. 21 years have passed in this timeline and no one has aged a bit. Well, they made McAvoy bald, but that's about it.The tone of this film is all over the place. For example, the school is about to be blown to smithereens and then all of a sudden, Quicksilver arrives and saves everyone in a whimsical fashion completely contrasting the gravity of the previous situation.When it comes to the villain, there is nothing remarkable about Apocalypse. He did not stand out for me at all. His 'henchmen' are completely forgettable and there was no impact at all.When it came to casting, I was incredibly skeptical of characters like Cyclops and Jean Grey being recast as teenagers. I'm sure people were excited to see Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark) as Jean Grey, but oh boy, her performance wasn't the best.Jennifer Lawrence is another actor whose performance I have to criticize. She was definitely phoning it in here. Her delivery was so monotonous half the time that the relatability was just out the window. She probably thought, 'I'm too big of a star for these silly comic book films'.The plot had no weight, ultimately because all these comic book films are so predictable these days, that you know they're just gonna play it safe for extra sequels. So no casualties, meaning no stakes.",4,1,2,9 January 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Missed the mark by miles
","I don't even know where to begin.This film fails on almost every level. The pacing is all over the place, the character arcs are underdeveloped, the story is incredibly inconsistent, and this movie clearly just exists to sell advertising.There are constant subplots that could have just as easily become self-contained movies, but nope! Sony crams everything in because they need to sell merchandise! And if that wasn't enough, the in-your-face product placement will certainly discourage you faster. Every TV and computer shown are Sony branded. No thought or care was put into making this film.Let's see: three villains, criminally underused in the film, and even when they are used, the narrative and dialogue are just disastrous. Also, Peter Parker's on-off relationship with Gwen Stacy takes up way too much of the running time. They try to give us closure as to what happens to Peter's parents, but the only problem is that nobody cares.Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon, an Oscorp engineer, who might as well have a neon sign over him saying 'NERD' because all the clichéd stereotypes are overblown here. He has no friends, nobody pays attention to him apart from Peter and Gwen. He forms an obsession of Spiderman because he got saved once by him. He gets electrocuted by electric eels after falling into the most precariously placed tank ever and becomes Electro, whose change of heart about Spiderman is so quick, blink and you'll miss it.Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborn, Peter's 'childhood friend'? The way this is written is done so poorly. They haven't met in ten years and automatically they're best friends? At least Sam Raimi's series was consistent. Basically, Harry is dying from a hereditary disease that killed his father Norman. For no adequately explained reason, he is dying at a more accelerated rate and is desperate for the healing factor in Spiderman's blood. Thanks to the 'logic' of Peter taking a picture of Spiderman meaning Peter knows Spiderman, Harry pressures Peter into trying to bring Spiderman to him. The motivations and character driven plots are executed so badly.Paul Giamatti plays the Rhino for about five minutes of the overall running time and the worst thing is, we have no idea what the actual conclusion of that fight was! There is no natural flow to this movie at all. It only exists because Sony wanted to build an expanded Cinematic Universe and they kept alluding to the Sinister Six. How arrogant do you need to be to think, 'Oh yeah, we don't have to put effort into this film because we're guaranteed a sequel either way!' Just as well there's no follow-up because, to be honest, where do you go from here?! Andrew Garfield is way too handsome and charismatic as Peter Parker. He's just a hipster, and kind of an ass, to be honest. In the opening scene, he prioritises his wise-cracks over the lives of civilians.I'm just gonna stop because this brings back Vietnam flashbacks every time. We're depending on you, Tom Holland. That's all I'm saying.",1,5,20,26 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Polarising
","I was very intrigued walking in to the cinema to see this film. I had avoided spoilers like the plague. I felt that now that we removed the 'training wheels' that was The Force Awakens, we would be opened up to something new and original.Let me put it this way, in some senses, they do something new, but on the other hand, there is a tonne of wasted potential. I really feel for Rian Johnson because he is caught in the middle between praise and hatred, aptly symbolizing the dark side and the light.The story beats of The Empire Strikes Back are here but they really try to bring things up a notch alluding to the First Order gaining the upper hand and showing that the Jedi are now redundant. Luke Skywalker has become disillusioned by the Jedi code and we watch him and Rey argue for the first half of the film, Rey trying to empathise with Kylo Ren, Finn has his own sideplot with newcomer Rose Tico, and the Resistance trying to escape the clutches of the First Order........very............slowly.......I will admit that a lot of the film is a bit of a slog to get through and while some of the shots are captured beautifully, there is a tonne of wasted potential.*******************SPOILER TIME*********************
No, seriously, turn away, if you haven't seen it yet.
***********************************************************OK? Shall I begin? Cool.WTF was the deal with Snoke? Why the hell would you build him up so much only to kill him, with us being none the wiser on who he is beyond leader of the First Order, where he came from, how did he influence Kylo Ren, how did Luke and Leia know him and how does he fit in to the story other than being the generic big baddie. Very weak as a villain in the long run and I felt very cheated by this.While we're on the topic, good God, Captain Phasma. What the hell?!! Yet again, she is built up hugely only for her to be brought down by Finn at a moment's notice.There was a moment where I was convinced Leia would be killed off to justify her absence in later films due to Carrie Fisher's passing, but she saves herself in the cheesiest way possible. I genuinely had a look of disbelief and confusion on my face during a number of scenes. Leia is incapacitated for the majority of the film, causing a new Admiral played by Laura Dern to assume command, who is really miscast here. Her incompetence causes a mutiny led by Poe, which is thrilling for a while, added to the continued chase, running from the First Order.The whole reveal of Rey's parents may seem like a copout but I'm glad in a way that they're at least trying something new with her, rather than connecting her to the Skywalkers. The shot of her in the cave with the infinite reflections was pretty cool.Finn and Rose's sideplot seemed like unnecessary padding but they had their moments together, kinda putting a dampener on the whole Rey/Finn romance dynamic.Also, this whole tease they have in the trailers, teasing that Rey or Kylo will switch sides, it amounts to nothing. They ultimately return to their respective sides and carry on.I felt that Mark Hamill did well as an older Luke and of course the shots of Skellig Michael (I refuse to call it Ahch-To) were great. I had mixed feelings about the Porgs though.*****************************************************************************I admire the film for the visuals and some of the acting, but some of the story threads really irked me and made me almost apprehensive as to what to expect in Episode IX.Mixed bag. All I can say.",6,0,0,18 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great breath of fresh air from the main Marvel narrative
","So when this movie was announced, I had no idea who or what the Guardians of the Galaxy were. I had never read the comics so the whole thing was a mystery. Also, I wasn't fully caught up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe either so any references would've gone over my head.So it was an incredible feeling watching this film, having every character introduced to you efficiently and effectively, and relating to them fairly well. The story is fairly standard. Gang of misfits join together to take on a space terrorist. All the story beats are there. But while the story seems kinda basic, the soundtrack is incredible, the characters are likable as hell and the CGI is phenomenal. This film will literally bring you to tears over a raccoon and a tree.The makeup is impressive as well. The amount of man hours it must have taken to paint several main and supporting actors different colours to make them aliens is incredible and the effort really shines through here.This is up on my top 5 list of the Marvel films.",8,2,4,25 May 2017
Logan," A fitting end to Hugh Jackman's tenure as Wolverine
","So the X Men films seem to get a bad time when it comes to criticism about its consistency. In my opinion, for the most part, they're pretty decent flicks.This film however, is easily at the top of the list. We get to see a darker, grittier perspective of the life of Logan in the near future. Aspects like his healing factor slowly fading and having to care for a senile and unstable Charles Xavier is a very different spin and it adds more depth to the story, as well as the fact that the mutants are all but extinct.Fox/Marvel were definitely taking notes after Deadpool because my God, this film is brutally and relentlessly violent! Not to mention crude. F bombs are being dropped left, right and centre, even from Xavier, which is a tad jarring but hilarious to watch.The main story revolves around Logan and Charles trying to find sanctuary for X23/Laura, a mostly silent little girl with Logan's abilities. Things heat up when members of this mutant experimentation organization try to capture her, and from there, it's essentially just a chase film.The performances here are top notch, with both Jackman and Stewart giving their A-game. Many people are saying 'Finally! This is the X Men film I've wanted to see!' In a sense, I agree with them, although the continuity is still a little iffy.Overall, Hugh Jackman goes out with a bang in his final performance as Wolverine and this will be a film remembered as a comic book gem.",9,0,3,6 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Weak attempt at fanservice
","This film is a perfect example of what happens when you're more focused on cramming in references and lead-ups to future films rather than having a cohesive narrative.The Avengers return to take on one of Tony Stark's mistakes: a defence technology gone rogue, taking control of his Iron Man suits and becoming sentient. That's essentially the plot. Also shoehorned in is foreshadowing and allusions to future films such as Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War and Thor: Ragnarok. Our heroes are caricatures of themselves here as very little character development is given for the majority of the film, save for a 'shock reveal' about Hawkeye.We are also shown the most 'out-of-nowhere' romance between Black Widow and the Hulk, which really only exists for people to make fanfiction.Ultron is shown less as an intimidating villain and more as a wise-cracking ass. Barely memorable and his evil plot was completely forgettable.Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson make their debuts as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver respectively, but since Quicksilver was already done by Fox's X-Men, Taylor-Johnson's multi-movie contract was made kinda redundant.The movie attempts to have character bonding scenes at the halfway point, but ultimately, it's just more foreshadowing. This film may have about as much depth as a kid's swimming pool but the visuals are certainly stunning. I think it was around this point where many people were succumbing to 'superhero fatigue', but it's definitely debatable.A lackluster sequel to the first Avengers, and the resulting cause of Joss Whedon's departure from involvement in the MCU.",4,1,1,13 November 2017
La La Land," Incredibly charming; beautifully shot
","Okay, couple of things to get out of the way:Yes, the unlikely attraction story is clichéd as hell. Yes, it's another musical with sporadic choreography and musical numbers. Yes, there are elements that look like any old musical we've seen.All that aside, this film is just beautiful. The music, the cinematography, the set pieces, and most of all, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone. It really strikes a chord to anyone who is passionate about the arts. The constant struggle of a musician or thespian is captured brilliantly here and the team behind this film deserve every ounce of credit.It'll be very interesting to see how many of the nominated awards this film will receive.",10,5,11,15 February 2017
Up," Fun, colourful and poignant
","While Pixar tend to gear their films towards kids/family audience, it doesn't stop them from kicking you to the ground emotionally. I am of course referring to the first ten minutes of the film, where we see our protagonist Carl as a child, meet his future wife, an eccentric energetic girl called Ellie, who bond over their love of adventure. They make a bond to travel together but life problems always get in the way. The opening montage is possibly the most moving, poignant piece showing them grow old together until Ellie dies, making Carl a widower.The film continues as Carl is now a grouchy old man, threatened with eviction as construction is due to take place where his house is currently situated. He manages to make his house airborne by harnessing hundreds, if not thousands of balloons to it and begins to make his way towards the spot himself and his late wife dreamed to live. He accidentally brings a boy scout called Russell along for the ride and together they encounter a series of zany characters along the way.So putting the first ten minutes aside, which in my opinion, deserves to be a standalone short film, the rest of the film is humorous, bright and ultimately shows us the journey of Carl becoming more compassionate over time, struggling to cope with the grief of his wife's death.It'll bring a tear to your eye and once again, Pixar's mastery over computer animation has not faltered.",9,0,1,30 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Definitely a spectacle, but not quite on par with the first
","I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy. It introduced a lovable band of misfits very effectively. Now, as we move on to the sequel, roughly carrying on where we left off, a number of things are occurring to me.A) Is this just going to be a re-thread of the first film, only with more quips and wise-cracks? B) Are we going to go more into character development? Will we know more about the characters motivations? C) Is this film going to contain more references to the MCU? The answer to A and B is yes. C, not so much. Guardians is very much in its own world, figuratively and literally.We're reunited once again with Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and (Baby) Groot, who bring Nebula along as well. Yondu also comes to the forefront and everyone gets more character development, which is fun to see because everyone works so well off each other. After an interstellar mishap, they end up crashing on a nearby planet and end up meeting Ego, Quill's father and his associate, Mantis. However, while Quill is trying to form a bond with his father, things don't stay cheerful for long. The Guardians figure something's wrong and they take care of it.So, overall, the film is entertaining, although I found it a little bit cluttered. The jokes were funny, don't get me wrong, and the visuals, once again, were stunning. However, some scenes didn't really mesh together tonally.The characters were great though. Baby Groot won the hearts of everyone, and Drax and Rocket were by far the comical highlights. Star Lord once again tries to win the heart of Gamora, and Yondu has a change of heart after being exiled.It's not the best film I've seen but it's definitely entertaining and action-packed. Definitely worth a look.",7,3,8,2 May 2017
Thor," Fairly standard
","So the MCU needs to build up its cast for the Avengers, so after two Iron Man films and a Hulk film, they give us a change of pace with Thor. We are introduced to the world of Asgard, to Thor, Loki, Odin and the Asgardians. As this is directed by Kenneth Branagh, there are clear Shakespearean overtones in the story.Thor ends up getting exiled due to his arrogance and is sent to Earth where he meets a team of wannabe physicists led by Natalie Portman, investigating spatial disturbances caused by Thor's exile to Earth. SHIELD intervene and take control of the operation, sealing off Thor's hammer that has fallen to Earth. It essentially becomes a fish out of water story as Thor tries to readjust himself and learn the culture and etiquette of civilized humans. Ultimately, Loki reveals his plans to overthrow the throne of Asgard, with Thor's exile being part of the plan and Thor must save the day.Overall, this film is decently made. Chris Hemsworth is charming as Thor and it's entertaining to see him learn the ways to behave rather than act all grandiose. His human companions are bearable, although Kat Dennings' character can get irritating. Not a film to praise to death although it's passable.",6,0,2,17 May 2017
The Disaster Artist," A fascinating memoir
","Greg Sestero published his book, 'The Disaster Artist' about three or four years ago, recounting his experience meeting and working with the human enigma that is Tommy Wiseau. What follows is the trainwreck of a production that later became 'The Room', known as the Citizen Kane of bad movies.In this adaptation of Sestero's memoir, with Dave Franco playing Sestero and his brother James playing Wiseau, it follows the bizarre journey Sestero takes after moving to Los Angeles in pursuit of becoming an actor. With producers and agents telling the duo that they have no future in Hollywood, they decide to make their own movie, prompting Wiseau to write The Room.The actual production is pretty chaotic and self-explanatory if you've either read the book or have seen The Room. But even if you haven't seen the movie, you kinda get the gist of it anyway.James Franco completely embodies the character of Tommy Wiseau; his impersonation and portrayal being pitch-perfect. Dave Franco's portrayal of Greg Sestero is also good, although he does come across as overly naïve. Seth Rogen is very funny as the script supervisor and the other supporting cast members and cameos are great also.While the general consensus would be that Wiseau is an overall grotesque individual, there is a great attempt of humanizing him through Franco's portrayal. You really see the development of an unlikely friendship between the pair and an idea behind how their production of infamy is still popular nearly 15 years later.Fans of The Room are going to love this and even the uninformed will enjoy it. Definitely has my recommendation.",8,0,1,11 December 2017
WALL·E," Haunting allegory of the near future
","Now, I presume the first thing that comes to mind in association with Pixar is whimsical characters, and family-friendly characters, and while this film also conforms to that, my God, the underlying setting is just incredible.A sentient garbage disposal robot roaming around a vacant Earth after resources have been depleted and mass evacuation has occurred? A really poignant setting once you analyse it properly.Once again Pixar have succeeded in anthropomorphizing non-human characters with each robot having a personality of their own. What I admire about this film is how much they rely on visuals rather than dialogue. For the most part, the robots take centre stage interacting with each other with minimal speech.The second act focuses mainly on the human characters drifting in space on board what is essentially a space Ark. Accustomed to this self-gratifying lifestyle where they're literally being served everything they want by robots, the obese human race have succumbed to a world of distraction, as it were, where they're surrounded by distracting advertisements and screens, which is a scary visualization of the future.WALL-E and EVE, the two robotic protagonists are very charming and the dynamic between them is adorable to watch.Thomas Newman's score just fully captures the environment, making you feel the weight of the setting. There's one musical cue that affects me on an emotional level, as pathetic as that sounds.Overall, this is one of Pixar's best films to date, despite the fact that the environmental message is a little heavy-handed.",8,0,1,13 January 2017
Iron Man," A promising start to the MCU
","Superhero films had become a bit lackluster around the time of this film's release. Of course, some would argue that superhero films are lackluster now, but after films like Spider-Man 3, some people had lost interest.Then Marvel had announced its own Cinematic Universe starting with Iron Man. This film has utterly transformed Robert Downey Jr's career, who at the time was considered a druggie burnout. This film marks his return to form, portraying Tony Stark, a self-proclaimed genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. The remarkable thing about his performance as Tony Stark is that it seems effortless. His confidence and charisma is ever-present as he goes through the film.Tony Stark, the successor to his father's business, Stark Industries has made his name selling innovative weapons. However, when he gets captured by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and learn that they have been using his weapons to terrorise cities, he has a change of heart and manufactures a miniaturized Arc Reactor to keep himself alive after sustaining life threatening injuries and also to power his latest invention, the Iron Man suit.His mentor and father's former partner Obidiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) strongly disapproves of the new direction Stark has made for the company and takes steps to remove him, in every sense of the word.Plot synopsis aside, let's actually review this sucker.The film has several strong points. For one, the character of Tony Stark exudes enough charm that you're always on his side. Sure, he's arrogant and conceited, but what's a character without flaws? Second, the special effects. For CGI that was made for a 2008 film, it still holds up. The MCU would continue to wow us with masterful effects so this was a great starting point. Also, the dialogue feels more natural as the characters are always talking over each other in conversation, as opposed to overly rehearsed and perfectly paced. It makes it seem a little more down to Earth, and yes, I'm aware that I'm making this point about a film in which a man flies around in a weaponized suit of armour.Overall, it's a very well made film and showed to us that superhero films can be really great.",8,1,2,27 April 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Completely forgettable
","Of all the films in the MCU, this is definitely one of the weaker installments, which I hate to say, because the film brings a bunch of ideas into the mix. The problem is the execution. Thor reunites with Natalie Portman and her scientist friends who witness random spatial displacements on Earth. Natalie Portman then gets possessed by the 'Aether', some legendary substance and the most forgettable Marvel villains, the Dark Elves try to overthrow Asgard.Tom Hiddleston returns in this film as the cunning Loki, which I'm thankful for, because he's easily the most popular Marvel villain. However, the story seems to go all over the place in terms of pacing and focus. And at the end of the day, you know there aren't going to be any lasting stakes because they need to produce more sequels at the end of the day.It's disappointing that the Thor films aren't quite to the standard of some of the other Marvel films, because he's practically a god. And yet the majority of this film is bogged down in a forced love story between Thor and Natalie Portman which is reminiscent of Attack of the Clones.The worst thing about this film is that it introduces one of the Infinity Stones, yet the way they handle it is so clumsy. You only find out what it is in the mid-credits sequence, for God's sake.Kat Dennings was quite unbearable in this film also. The awkward humour that comes from her character is cringeworthy at the highest degree. I know that Marvel films like to mix up the drama with a bit of lighthearted humour, but it really seems that in this case, the writers had all the drama established in the script and then at the eleventh hour, they realized 'Damn it! There's nothing funny here! Quick, let's make yer wan from 2 Broke Girls be the only source of comic relief!' To conclude, this film tries to be epic, and while there are interesting ideas and concepts here, it ultimately falls flat.",4,0,1,15 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fanservice brought to you by J.J. Abrams
","So when Disney bought Lucasfilms and announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films, I was initially skeptical. We had just gotten over the disappointment that were the prequels and it seemed like the originals were going to be tarnished.However, as time went on, the trailers came out and they seemed fairly promising. They announced the new cast and of course there was backlash from bigots over John Boyega's ethnicity. Any excuse for keyboard warriors to kick up a fuss.Then the actual film came out. At the time, I really enjoyed it, but as time passed, I came to accept that for the most part, it's more or less a complete 'copy and paste' of Episode IV.The First Order, under the command of Kylo Ren is desperate to retrieve secret plans hidden inside an astro droid discovered by a young Force-sensitive girl who teams up with a rag-tag team of heroes, determined to return the plans to the Resistance, to fight against a planet-destroying superweapon and track down the location of a wise self-exiled mentor. Hmmm, I wonder if that sounds familiar? OK, apart from the fact that this is a complete retelling of the original story, it has its charm. The new cast are a fine addition to the roster of characters. Daisy Ridley as Rey is compelling, and I'm probably biased because I have a massive celebrity crush on her (pretty sure I'm not the only one) but that's besides the point. John Boyega is an enjoyable character as Finn, whose comradery with Oscar Isaac's Poe is fun to watch. Old favourites, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C-3PO and R2-D2 return, handing over the baton to the newcomers.Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver is the new 'Dark Lord', heavily conflicted in his position on the dark side, inspired by his late grandfather Darth Vader. A former disciple of Luke Skywalker, he became seduced by the dark side by Palpatine 2.0, oh sorry, I mean Snoke, and is more unhinged than previous Sith Lords.As a movie, it's produced very well and is an enjoyable popcorn flick, putting aside the fact that it's mainly just on repeat for the entirety. Many people laid into the character of Rey, calling her a 'Mary-Sue', calling her too overpowered and simply labelled this film as feminist propaganda. Once again, keyboard warriors with nothing better to do.It's enjoyable for the most part, and is merely a love letter to the original series. I will say that I'm worried now that Abrams is directing Episode IX, just because it's just gonna be another 'copy and paste'.Another thing I'm worried about is, as I said earlier, tarnishing the original story, with Disney having plans to release multiple Star Wars films for the next 5-10 years at least. The oversaturation is going to ruin the series in my opinion, but let's just see what happens in the meantime.",6,3,5,4 December 2017
Deadpool," A humbling apology for X-Men Origins
","After Ryan Reynold's appearance as Wade Wilson in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Reynolds seemed determined to do the character of Deadpool justice and was gunning to have this film greenlit by Fox for ages, until the test footage was leaked, resulting in a mass reaction from fans.The film is an absolute pisstake and completely self-aware, with fourth wall breaks throughout, faithful to the character of Deadpool. Reynolds is having the time of his life as Wade Wilson, wise-cracking the entire time and taking swipes at himself, the X-Men series and Hugh Jackman.The story follows Wilson, hellbent on revenge after inheriting mutant abilities by the sadistic Francis, played by Ed Skrein. Deadpool goes on a manhunt to take out Francis and save his partner, having been kidnapped by the former. Acquainted with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who are dubious about Deadpool's actions, they face Francis and it's fairly self-explanatory from there.Despite technically being part of the X-Men series, this film is much more crass, vulgar and humorous, and that's part of the charm. It's Reynold's redemption as Deadpool and it's certainly not the end.A by-the-numbers but enjoyable flick.",7,0,0,4 December 2017
Click," Enticing concept but terribly inconsistent tone and pace
","So, I saw this movie when it came out in 2006. I was 13 years old. I thought the movie was pretty decent back then.However, as time went on, and I began looking at films from a more critical perspective and yeah, there is a lot to say about this movie.First of all, this story is anything but original. The man who was seduced by power? Yeah, I'm pretty sure every variation of that story has been done at this point.Basically, Adam Sandler's character is an overworked architect trying to satisfy both his family and his work colleagues. His boss, David Hasselhoff puts a certain amount of undue pressure on him to get his work done, putting Sandler's family plans to a screeching halt.Trying to make his life a bit easier, he meets Christopher Walken who is a retail salesman, who gives him a universal remote control that 'remote-controls your universe.' Sandler tries to accomplish his work goals thanks to the remote but it starts becoming self aware, skipping through chapters of his life quite literally and it suddenly turns all tragic.This is the main issue with the film: the tone. The first hour of the film is spent establishing the situation of Sandler's character and the humorous occurrences that take place once he receives the remote. Once it is discovered what the negative repercussions of the remote are, the film proceeds to skip ahead a number of years in the last few scenes, where the situation is explained with throwaway lines of expository dialogue, breaking the first rule of filmmaking: SHOW, DON'T TELL!!!! It's also quite jarring that it suddenly shifts in tone from goofy misadventures with a remote control to tragic heartbreak skipping decades of Sandler's life. No natural flow whatsoever and it takes away from the enjoyment of the film.The concept is intriguing, the only problem is that the material was not used to its full potential.",5,1,1,23 January 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Awe-inspiring story, gruesome realism of war imagery
","This film doesn't delay in informing us that this is a true story. In fact, they remind you in the opening titles.Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair and gives us this fascinating tale of Desmond Doss, the only conscientious objector to receive a Medal of Honor in WWII.Andrew Garfield portrays the pacifist Doss, among an ensemble of actors playing army soldiers. The film goes to great lengths to show just how much the prejudice the army has against Doss affects him, and it's done very well.In terms of the war imagery, it is incredibly graphic and bloody, which works in the favour of showing this powerful war story.Garfield performs very well along with the supporting cast (Hugo Weaving is fantastic as Doss' father.) Overall, the cinematography and performances are done very well, with maybe some of the Australian actors' accents wavering from time to time. (*cough cough, Sam Worthington*)",8,3,6,21 February 2017
Dodgeball," If you like people flinching in pain from having balls thrown at them, you're in luck
","So this is a very basic story. Struggling gym is about to go bankrupt, enters a dodgeball tournament to earn a cash price, and has to oppose Ben Stiller and his ego.See, who needs wordy essays? Not that this is a bad film, but really, most of the humour derives from people being injured by projectiles being launched at them at high velocities. That and Ben Stiller's character who is essentially Ben Stiller if he snorted a little too much cocaine.The characters have humorous backstories, apart from the token black guy who is just left to wisecrack half the time. Vince Vaughn plays the fairly laid back manager of his failing gym, taunted by Ben Stiller's character, a fitness obsessed lunatic who attempts to seize the property.Fairly gratuitous gags, but mildly entertaining. The gimmick gets old after a while though.",6,0,1,24 May 2017
