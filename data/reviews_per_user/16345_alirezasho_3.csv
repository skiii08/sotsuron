Hereditary," Overrated movie
",Maybe I was too generous with 4rating but I went with friends and we gotta good laugh at the ridiculous overdone 'scary scenes' which was just awkward and pointless.The film surprises at times but don't get it confused with true build up suspense with characters we care for or are slowly getting scared off. I would try to avoid film with this director/screenwriter in the future as my time is too valuable for this kind of crap,4,1,5,1 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," the most overrated film of 2019
","I love Q.Tarantino film but this one was a deal breaker, I forgive him taking great amount of liberty to alter historical events but thin but this....",5,4,6,13 February 2020
Heat," The beat bank robbery film ever
","The flow and elegance of storytelling by Mann in unmatched in this film, he could not have better top cast and how he gives all equal screen time to have their story told and overlap each other to the climax is masterly done",10,1,1,23 October 2019
