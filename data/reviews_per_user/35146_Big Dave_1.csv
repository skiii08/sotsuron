Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," New installment generally satisfying....worth the wait.
","I have seen it, and I am pleased.  I apologize if at some points, my comments seem a tad unenthusiastic, but the preceding hype help to numb the effects slightly of a brilliant first/fourth edition to a wonderful series of films. I dare say that die hard fans will find the basic structure of the movie quite familiar.   I argue that you would be correct in this assumption.Like 'A New Hope,' the 'Phantom Menace' serves to set the stage for an entire trilogy.  There is a plot, and some definite goals attained by our heroes- true.  However, the primary purpose of this movie is to introduce us to the characters that will be important for the rest of the trilogy.  We get to see young Anakin, and learn a little bit about how he started to use the force.  WE learn how Obi-Wan falls into this plan.  We meet the droids for the first time as well.  We also meet Palpatine at a much younger age as he begins his rise to power.  We also see Yoda and Jabba.In addition to the old favorites, we meet new characters, including the Queen (and her vast wardrobe), the wise and skilled Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul ( and the Sith organization), Jar-Jar Binks (pure comic relief in my opinion, and a tad annoying at times), Watto the gambling junk dealer, Boss Nass of the Gungans, and the Jedi Council.  All of these characters are well acted, with especial credit due to Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor.The effects are particularly nice, though they can only be truly appreciated after you think about them for a while, and the sheer magnitude of what it must have taken to coordinate them.  the space battle and pod racing scenes are extemely well done... and the CGI characters are masterfully inserted into the action.  (though I must admit that an occasional Jar-Jar scene is a bit jerky...)  The scenery and sets are magnificent... and I have to give a little credit to the freak that designed the vast wardrobe of the girl queen... they're at least 'different'All in all, he movie was very well done.  The dialogue is superbly written, and can be easily understood and appreciated by fans of all ages.  The story of the movie by itself is enough to keep the attention of the new fans, while much of the foreshadowing hidden throughout the film will greatly interest the die hard fanatic.  The effects, costumes, acting, and makeup come together almost flawlessly to form a great movie.  The soundtrack is pretty good, too.  I'm predicting a major tonnage at the box office this summer.  So, what are you waiting for, shouldn't you be in line already?P.S.  After watching the film, let me know if you don't think the closing scene is  at least vaguely familiar from somewhere.  I think you'll be pleased with the effect.",Null,1,2,6 May 1999
