Alien 3," The worst of the 4 but still good
","I think killing off Hicks and Newt and smashing up Bishop was a bad idea. Everyone is miserable and angry (even though they have the right to be miserable and angry in this movie); it wouldn't hurt to see a smile. there were moments of humor and hope in Alien and Aliens, but that's all gone in 3. Note: Dog lovers should not see original version. See the reedited version. Instead of a conscious dog, it's an unconscious ox. On a positive note, it's interesting to compare the standard alien to the one in this movie. Also, because this alien was supposed to be incredibly fast, there were a lot of cool CGI moments. Still, it's a very sad movie, seeing how the last survivor was a prisoner so he ends up going back to jail. Also, this is the reason people didn't like the 4th movie. And what kind of prison has no weapons? The beginning's a bummer, the ending's a bummer, but the middle is cool, except Ripley looks weird without her hair.",7,2,3,15 April 2006
