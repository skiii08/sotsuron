The Ring," Predictably Scary
","This film ran too long and it got a bit boring. Most of it was predictable and I knew exactly what was gonna happen next. It was creepy in some parts so I guess if you want to be scared a bit it's ok, but after watching it I thought 'so that's it, what was the point of all that?'. I wouldn't really recommend it.",1,2,7,17 November 2002
