Hereditary," Severely Traumatizing
","I watched this movie and I hate it in its entirety. First off the director had a child character killed in a very gruesome and upsetting matter and then he crossed the line by showing that dead child's head decomposing on the street. Things only get worse from there as there are no positive moments found anywhere in the film, the ending was absolute nonsense, and the characters scream at each other for half of the film's screentime. I was so upset and distrubed by this movie that I never ever want to watch it again and it is severely nightmare inducing. This film should have received an NC-17 rating for the way they killed off that child and she was killed while suffering.",1,1,4,7 April 2019
