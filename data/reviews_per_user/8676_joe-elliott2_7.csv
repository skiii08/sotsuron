Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Cultural Confusion in U S and A make glorious laughter for us
","I can think of nothing not to like about Borat. THis isn't some weak comedy held together by a central character, this is a GREAT comedy held together by a central character, and the best comedians of them all, the unsuspecting public... Every set piece from the Kazakh village to the glorious sunshine of California produces non-stop laughs and some of the most horrifically graphic VISUAL jokes (in the hotel(s)) I have ever had the fortunate to see in a hilarious film. I say this not as some sort of paedophile but as a comedy lover who truly fell over laughing at the innocent antics of the lovable Borat Sagdiyev (Kazakhstan's fourth most popular celebrity and don'you forget it!) COngrats to Sacha BAron Cohen(oh by the way, how can you be so racist to JEws, being one yourself. I'm not religious, its just y'know. I dunno if I could do that.) Still, a brilliant film 10/10!",10,0,0,23 December 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Good, all-round Action Flick
","The Bourne Ultimatum picks up after the events of the first 2 films, with Matt Damon, aka. Jason Bourne, tracking down a reporter who has been writing articles about him and he tries to find the man's source. After that, the film returns to the traditional 'Bourne' style, a long chase across a whole continent... Bourne Ultimatum packs more of a punch than its predecessors, the action is more intense and the plot is more developed. Jason Bourne again, is a mythical figure in the eyes of the authorities, 'My God. That's Jason Bourne!' and this time he fights the new assassins across half the globe. The acting is great, Matt Damon, perfect as the amnesiac assassin and the rest of the cast play their roles perfectly. The 'shaky' camera may not be to other people's tastes but it adds extra intensity to the fights. Of course, there is the traditional Bourne wit, the 'if you were in your office we would be talking face-to-face.' the gadgets and of course the action. The thinking-man's James Bond. No additional frivolity, just a simple plot brilliantly portrayed. 10/10",10,3,4,3 November 2008
Predator," The Essential Action Movie!
","Having not being born when Predator came out, the first I heard about any sort of Predator was the Alien vs. Predator franchise. Therefore I was never too bothered about seeing this movie. And what I was missing out on! I want to start by saying that this is, alongside The Terminator (also staring Ah-nuld Schwazenegger) this is probably the action movie of the eighties. Nothing comes close to the suspense and pure brilliance of this film. The Predator and the lack of it visually creates a genuinely terrifying antagonist who ruthlessly butchers his way through Ah-nuld's elite squad. Ah-nuld himself is brilliant as Dutch, the ripped leader in a film strewn with brilliant one-liners (knock knock!), Ah-nuld was perfect for the role as someone fighting on the side of good rather than the evil monster-type role. Everyone else has a great part and the characters are developed well in the opening scenes, before they're mercilessly butchered. Overall, the action movie to see.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Fantastic. A must see movie.
","Where do I start describing Terminator 2? Opening with a terrifying view of the robot-controlled future that sets the scene for the film, it doesn't slow down once. The acting was superb, the Terminator was tough, the T-1000 suitably creepy, John and Sarah Connor perfect as the crazed mother and renegade child. The dumb thugs, the violent bikers, the suffering police, everyone played their part perfectly. If it was possible for any film to surpass its original. Its this. The fight scenes were perfect and while not too heavy on the gore, the shocks are delivered very well, incuding one characters death, pinned to a fridge. Nasty. Also watch out for the brilliant Cyberdine building fight. Pity Dyson is killed. Ahh... well. He was a good actor. All in all, a brilliant sci-fi action thriller. A must see for any action fan. In fact, watch it anyway. You won't be disappointed. 10/10 if only 11 was an option...",10,1,2,30 October 2008
The Incredibles," Incredible! Best superhero movie EVER!
","I know it sounds lame but the Incredibles is a masterpiece of movie-making. OK so the Spidermans, Batman, Iron Man etc. are thrilling and epic and so on, but The Incredibles looks at the superhero genre from a different angle, superheroes are outlawed and forced to live normal lives. This is where the whole Incredible family comes in. They are 'accidently on purpose' called in to stop a crisis on an island somewhere that spread to, uhhh, a city somewhere. I forget where. The film is fantastic, 'acting' great, the plot to eliminate all 'supers' works well and every character is great. Watch out for Edna, a great character they should have developed more. Overall, a resounding 10 out of 10 Incredible!",10,0,0,5 November 2008
Bruce Almighty," Averages out to be pretty good
","Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10",7,10,11,5 November 2008
Casino Royale," Bond is Back!
","OK. So there was a lot of controversy over Daniel Craig's appointment as James Bond, 'he's blonde!' etc. But seeing Casino Royale,I can't see what all the fuss was about. Craig is Bond. He fits the role perfectly, tough but with a more emotional side seen surprisingly often. The whole movie, from the crane leaping start to the Venice sinking end, Royale packs a punch. The fight scenes are intense, realistic and brilliantly acted. Shame about no gadgets, but still. Nice cars, nice women, Royale still contains Bond trademarks, there is even a 'Bond, James Bond' at the end. This movie will become a Bond classic! 10/10 this movie deserves nothing less.",10,0,2,5 November 2008
