Deja Vu," Deja Vu is one of the best movies I've seen
","Deja Vu combines a thrilling movie with great actors/actresses. I love to watch action, romance, thrillers and sci-fi ... this movie combines the best all of these. Denzel Washington is absolutely great (best of the best - Hall of Fame Actor) ,,, ditto with Paula Patton (she's on her way to being a great actress. Val Kilmer is still proving to be one of my all time favorites. Deja Vu has a great storyline and the right folks to make it happen. I can't believe I'm reading mixed reviews on this movie ... some critics need to find another career field. Denzel demonstrated all that is best in an actor ... intelligence, passion, persuasion, leadership and charismatic appeal. I'm sure the ladies like his good looks too. The success of this movie was pivotal around Denzel. With that spoken, Paula is on her way to stardom ... she has all the best qualities. Val Kilmer's supporting role was really good ... he will always be one of my favorites.",10,1,4,13 April 2008
