Raiders of the Lost Ark," How can you not like it?
","How do they cram so much good movie in 2 hours? It's so incredibly well built, with great pacing and acting, and it's got the cheesiest fighting scenes, just how could I (and many others) not like it?",9,2,4,1 June 2018
Kung Fu Panda," Kung POW
","It's probably one of my favorites in the DreamWorks catalog, definitely one of their best. It's an all around well made movie, with a good message to boot. Hopefully they can make more good films like this.",7,1,1,1 June 2018
Meet the Parents," Cringe-fest Comedy
","A cringe-fest of every man's worst in-law nightmare, set to a comedic tone. BUT, In the last 20 minutes of film it delivers the wholesome message that in-laws should love new additions to their family as long as the couple is happy together. If that sounds like your jam, this is for you.",6,2,2,1 June 2018
Chicken Run," Fun for all.
",Ahhhh a claymation classic really. It's fun and good for everyone involved. Had some laughs in there,7,0,0,1 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Absolute Favorite
","This is by far the best of the 3 Thor films. It was different and had an interesting/unique vibe to it, but I think the risk they took on that paid off nicely. Soundtrack was great, the fight scenes incredible. I'd put this on the same level as Winter Soldier, and it's in my top 5 favorite Marvel films, as of 1 June 2018.",9,1,4,1 June 2018
Ready Player One," 'Reality is real.' -Gamers
","Been crap talking this since its inception into my brain with its pandering ads, but it's time for me to eat words: I was genuinely entertained. The pop culture was used tastefully, surprisingly. Gamer lingo was SUPER cringe, and the CG definitely could have been better but eh.",7,0,1,1 June 2018
Moana," Short and Sweet and You're Welcome
","It's your friendly neighborhood, well rounded Disney movie for sure. It's got some fun moments, with some nice catchy songs, and who knew that The Rock could sing so good? Got some beef with the large singing crab scene that I'll never be able to unsee, but it's Overall a great watch that kids and adults will love 7.5/10",7,0,1,1 June 2018
Tangled," Disney Re-imagines another beautiful classic
","A thought I've had a lot lately is 'A lot of key Disney films have roots in tales and folklore' and although it's true, they manage to create and re-imagine these ol stories into something creatively vibrant and fun, and Tangled is no exception. It's a good Disney Time, filled with that good Disney Charm",7,1,1,1 June 2018
Doctor Strange," Mind Blowing
","I've seen this one 3 times and I still have fun. There's great acting from Cumberbatch and the gang, not mention the truly incredible & stunning visual effects. It's also got a nice well rounded story. Excited to see Doctor Strange in the MCU, and I can't wait to see where they take his character next.",8,1,2,1 June 2018
Baby Driver," One of my favorite films in years
","That was a fun ride. HIGHLY Original and with good filmography to boot, it's not only what I believe is Edgar Wrights best pieces of work, but it's just overall an absolutely incredible film. You should be watching it.",9,1,3,1 June 2018
Justice League," Justice Machine Broke, Have a Terrible Week
","Justice League (2017) 2/5For a AAA film, you'd think it wouldn't be noticeable that the entire film was shot on a green screen but that was awful and took me out of the movie. Not to mention the bad guy was entirely CG which could have been better. App games have trailers with better CG. Makes me sickI feel like a lot of the plot and plot moving elements exist 'because movie'.There's some plot holes, and 'Deus ex machina' esque things that contribute to this that make watching it a little jarring.Snyder makes us fill in his weird small plot holes with our vauge assumtions #dontlikeThe actors tho did their best, and there were a few laughs. The Flash was my favorite part of the movie, but I'm not sure why they didn't use the actor from The Flash TV series... You know an already established series with a fan base? IdkTL;DR
Justice League is worth a watch, at a discounted price. The freeness of my ticket plus the few laughs made it a decent time, but I have no desire to see it again.Still think DC needs to think about replacing Snyder & friends because this movie doesn't live up to the potential that I'm sure die hard fans wanted.",4,1,4,1 June 2018
Face_Off," Face off, Face on
","Honestly the first hour is hilarious, but then it gets old. The entire thing is a ridiculous 2hr 15min ride. There's better Nic Cage movies out there, but this is perhaps the most unique of every one. At LEAST watch the first 45 minutes where Nic's performance is undeniably stupidly good and stupidly extreme. A nice watch with friends that can make fun of movies, that's for sure.
Overall, awful but good",6,0,1,1 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Mind Blowingly Good.
","Absolutely incredible and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. There's a few minor things about it that one could pick a fight about, but that can be easily over-sighted by how much of a fun time you're having watching it unfold. Also to note, is we have finally strayed from the Marvel Movie formula, and it feels amazing. Brush up on your Marvel films, and then watch this bad boy with some popcorn to be entertained.",9,1,3,1 June 2018
Frozen," Mostly Grown Male Review
","Having never seen it until 27 December 2017, I liked it. It's a good add to the Disney classics, and an even nicer add to their music catalogIf I watched it in 2013 tho I'd hate it for all the heckin obnoxious fan base lolBut I'd watch this again in due time for sure. Just, not obsessively, as it was back in its time...",8,1,3,1 June 2018
Ghost Rider," Ghost Movie
","Not my favorite Nic Cage movie, or favorite Pre-Iron Man (2008) Marvel film, but it was surprisingly coherent, and had some decent Nic freak-outs. It's overall kinda bland, and not super worth watching, even just to make fun of it.",5,1,1,1 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Blown Away.
","Wow. As someone who doesn't like most horror/thrillers, I'm quite amazed. The movie revolves around a smart family of characters that are expertly written and acted, the plot is new, & it feels fresh to modern cinema. I enjoyed its fun and wild ride, and you will too.",9,4,6,1 June 2018
Coco," Classic Disney Fun
","Definitely a kids movie, SUPER predictable, but I had a good time appreciating the fluid and fun animation of the skeleton people. And if it was true to Hispanic dia de los muertos lore, then I also learned a lot about that. Overall a Good time.",7,1,2,1 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Decently Neutral Review for Average People
","Definitely better than every prequel combined, unless we're laughing AT them.It takes a few risks by implementing some new lore, but beyond that it's a thrilling time that keeps you on the edge of your seat by trying some story telling techniques not known in the Star Wars universe.Some of the new techniques make it clunky and hard to like and result in plot holes for sure. Not to mention the lack-luster character arc of Finn that could have been something incredible.But it was overall fun, keeping me at the edge of my seat, landing a few jokes, and having some of the coolest battles in the franchise.In the end I'm glad that they pushed boundaries and dared to be bold in their choices, as I fear the art of the movie world is slowly dying, and being replaced by template genres, only out to make a buck so someone can get paid.",8,2,22,1 June 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Super Well Done.
","Even after seeing it 4 (or 5?) Times now, some of the jokes still land exceptionally well and give me a good laugh. Marvel really did a good one, and they even ended up breaking their typical 'Movie Model', and it's one of my favorite movies in the MCU.",8,1,2,1 June 2018
Men in Black," DANG CLASSIC
","Good acting, great world building, great and unique alien design, good pacing, freaking Will Smith, and it's just an overall fun imagining of the ol cryptid tales of the MEN IN BLACK. A must watch.",8,0,0,1 June 2018
La La Land," Perfect Distance from the Sun Issac My Boy
","Probably one of the better movies I've seen for a hot minute. Acting was good, original score had some catchy high points.The fish bowl lens was a little disorienting if I focused too hard, and the ending is kinda sad, in my opinion, but I'm kind of a sucker for the feelsBut I'd say it's close to a masterpiece",8,1,1,1 June 2018
National Treasure," Lay Not Up Your National Treasures In Heaven
","Ol' Tom Gates decrepit voice spoke ancient words of the Hoily Boible, but despite God's words, lil Nic vacuumed but one word into his ears and one word alone' T R E A S U R E 'And from that moment, lil Nic KNEW he had sucked the Bible dry.6/10Some good Nic Cage moments, and an overall decent story with sub par acting beyond Nic",6,0,0,1 June 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Eh, I'd Prefer the Original
","Not sure why a lot of people had massive problems with it. I thought the re-imagining was done well enough, and in the least was a good ode to the original. I still would prefer the original, and the prince could have been handsomer, the entirely CG beast better, and a few other nit picks, but all in all good to watch just once, then return to the 2D classic.",6,0,0,1 June 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Kong Beats Godzilla
","The first Kong movie I've seen. Honestly I think this was a great tribute to the monster movie genre. Everything was done well and it looked nice. I still don't remember any of the characters names, and that's my biggest gripe, but to be expected in a kaiju type film. The fighting was cool, and ultimately I liked it better than the 2014 Godzilla remake. Also Jordan is a fantastic director.",7,0,1,1 June 2018
The Waterboy," Classy 90's Sport Comedy
","I'm not a sporty guy, so this is the first sports film I've seen in a long time, and it was surprisingly okay. It had its quirky 90's humor that gave me a good chuckle, and the football competition of the movie was generally entertaining, but it more focused on character development, which was entertaining to watch.",6,2,2,1 June 2018
Black Panther," A Fun, Formulated Time
","It was a good Marvel movie with good story beats. I can definitely appreciate (some of) the CG and the unique conflict that's brought up in the film, but you don't have to dig too deep to see the ol' Marvel formula hard at work. But, it's overall a good time worth a watch (but was definitely over-hyped).",7,0,1,1 June 2018
The Greatest Showman," A Must See.
","Wow. A simple (mostly) positive story at it's core, backed with some seriously good catchy singing and dance, told through the beat of modern pop, this movie had me entertained till the end. There's something unique and special about it and you should watch it. And then listen to the soundtrack.",8,1,5,1 June 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Baby Steps
","Definitely below my standards for a marvel film, but I guess they've just gotten better over the years. There were some story beats that I really got into, and some plot holes from the 2nd Avengers that I missed since I never saw this. I'd rather you just look up the summary from the internet honestly, unless you're a major Thor fan, then go for it.",5,0,0,1 June 2018
The Truman Show," Is this real life?
","It's shot in such a unique way that you can almost believe it's the real backstory of Jim Carrey. It's an nice classic staple of film, that many people should be able to appreciate for its originality and also for it's meaty existential plot.",7,0,0,1 June 2018
Godzilla," Good for old fans, not for making new ones
","The first Godzilla I've seen, I definitely enjoyed the giant fighting monsters the best. The plot and the characters were not super great, and I definitely wished they kept Cranston alive and made him the protagonist, because all the stories of the human characters were a little bland, but I appreciate the focus on Godzilla. For what it was trying to do though, it did it well, and I can appreciate the art in that, even though it's not particularly my cup of tea.",6,0,1,1 June 2018
Jurassic Park," Incredible Journey, and a Must see for all
","I love how real the movie feels because of the minimal CG. There's something so magical about how everything comes together, and it's not perfect, but they tell a great story with good pacing, incredible set pieces, and posh acting, resulting in a great time. I'd prefer this over the reboot 'Jurassic World', which I saw first.",8,0,0,1 June 2018
