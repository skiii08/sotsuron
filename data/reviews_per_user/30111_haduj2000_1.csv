Sucker Punch," I really did want to like this...
","... but I just couldn't. Escapism? I love video games, fantasy, comics and all number of geeky things(including mindless viewing of naked women), but just couldn't escape how nothing really connected at all. One massive discombobulation! I was constantly being slapped in the face with reasons why almost every scene just did not work. Visually? yes pretty stunning, but when I realize what I'm seeing, its just irritating. The sound and dialogue were the worst next to the story telling and acting. Except for the Kid Rock(ewww)& Queen(yay) song mashing collaboration, all of the other numbers picked for the score were really good, originally recorded that is! These are some of the worst song covers I can remember, some of which were sang by the protagonist as well to insult your ears.I'm sure fans of this film will think that I just don't get the concepts, but the concepts are very very obvious.... impossible to even try and ignore, so its definitely not 'over my head' or anything. This is Eye candy, a visually overwhelming disaster that sounds like .... uh... whatever you don't like the sound of! Wish I could have just turned off the stereo at the movie grill and tried to enjoy it in silence.Surely individuals concerned about gender roles and sexism will be thoroughly insulted by this stew pot of total over sexualized murder, rape and abuse.PS its always a special tragedy when a great Beatles song is butchered, in my worthless opinion.",2,10,21,29 March 2011
