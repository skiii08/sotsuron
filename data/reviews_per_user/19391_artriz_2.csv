The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant in its originality, but hype lessens the chill
","I was told that I was about to see the most frightening film ever made--I wasn't.  The acting was superb-very realistic.  If I had been among the viewers at the Sundance midnight show, chances are that I would have been far more frightened.  But after months of hype on a Saturday afternoon it just wasn't that spectacular.  Of course the idea is genius, and the shaking camera shots made it seem like a spooky home video. The last shot is a great one, and if you're one that lets your imagination chill you to the bone, it's wonderful.  Be prepared for a lot of loose ends, but overall, A for novelty, B for chill factor.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice effects, but just a movie
","If I had gone into the movie with no expectations, I probably would have been pretty impressed, but as it was, there had been so much hype surrounding it that it was somewhat of a let down. The special effects were great, but the actual conflict/plot was weak. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were good, but some of the other actors were definitely not the cream of the crop.  Worth seeing, but don't expect to be blown away.",6,0,1,22 May 1999
