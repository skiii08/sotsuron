The King's Speech," Just not very good
","I admit I am in a minority, my friends liked it, but I found it a plodding, pedestrian and predictable story. Geoffrey Rush played his part well. Helena Bonham-Carter and historic Brtain looked nice, and I liked the shots of the radio broadcasting cabinets with all the country names on them. That's about it. I was totally uninspired by the climatic speech which sounded wooden and stilted. Maybe I just don't sympathise enough with the hardship of being in the Royal Family. I enjoy history, and my opinion of the film only sank further when I found out how historically inaccurate and misleading it is at parts. I can't be bothered to look further or describe that. The one thing I did agree with friends on was that it didn't feel like a 2 hour film.",3,16,36,3 February 2011
