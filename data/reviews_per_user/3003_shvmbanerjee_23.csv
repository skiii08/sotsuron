Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great comeback
","After the weak first, Kill Bill 2 is an improvement and an enjoyable flick.",9,0,1,10 October 2019
Hereditary," Horrible
","Hereditary, in short was one of the most absurd and ridiculous movies I have ever seen. I really wonder who funds and makes this type of movies. Waste of time and money.",1,6,13,3 January 2019
A Star Is Born," Boring as hell
","A Star is Born appears to be a modern way of advertising Lady Gaga's concerts through filmmaking.
The movie however fails due to its incongruous and nonsensical approach.",1,6,12,17 January 2019
Se7en," Best
",Se7en is one of the best serial killer movies I have ever seen. It's well thought and neatly made.,8,0,0,8 October 2019
Fight Club," A Out of the Blue movie
",Fight Club is totally a new concept with a variant ending.,9,1,1,8 October 2019
As Good as It Gets," Beautiful
",An incredible and provocative rom-com backed by a pleasant narrative.,10,1,1,19 October 2019
Captain Marvel," Stop the Hate
","Captain Marvel is easily a brilliant movie. How much have I doubted Brie for playing this role but this turned out to be just fine ! It's way better than The Dark World and easily on par with Captain America The First Avenger. The negative star rating is just people being upset with Larson, nothing else.",7,1,8,30 May 2019
World War Z," Disappointing
",World War Z is a thick-witted zombie survival movie which puts you under a constant burden of trying to make sense out of it. The war is not against the zombies but rather against your patience of wanting the good stuff to happen.,3,1,2,16 December 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Good
","Shaun of the Dead's dig at the particular genre is wobbly but certainly pays off. It is not great, but makes your time worth.",7,0,1,19 December 2019
Us," Garbage
","Only Jordan Peele understands what he writes and directs. This movie is plain stupid. There wasn't any horror and the plot was confusing and even fails to provide any answer in the end. As much as I disliked Get Out, I would say this is an improvement only due to the fun loving personality of Winston Duke's character. Without him I would've stopped watching half way through.",2,3,4,29 May 2019
Knives Out," Try Harder, Rian!
","Rian Johnson's Knives Out is quite hard to admire as an adult. If only this movie were to be targeted for younger audiences, it would've been a hit. But I wouldn't blame him. His directing skills are remarkable. But his story writing needs more work",4,2,5,4 March 2020
The Irishman," Did not finish
",I just couldn't finish this. I gave it multiple chances but after 1.3h I finally gave up. It was just not meant for me.,3,36,71,28 November 2019
Aquaman," Not Good
","James Wan certainly produced a better enjoyable DC film than the previous ones in the line. But however, it fails at a number of places. Firstly, the logic didn't add up, it was plain stupid. I know you don't need logic but this was pure stupidity. Secondly, Orm didnt really feel like a villain, he was weak and pathetic. Even Steppenwolf appeared to be a more challenging one than Orm was. I had keep Manta in the main villain but lets skip that. I do feel it was a bit rushed. There was a lot of plot holes and off topic or unnecessary scenes. Not to mention it became boring and cringe, more it advanced to the end.",4,0,1,10 March 2019
Taxi Driver," Hated it
","Taxi Driver is such a movie in which you would want to wait for the better part, but in the end you would find out that it was really not worth it.",7,3,9,27 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Absurd
","Rise of Skywalker is either ignorant to its backstory or irrational to the context. Talk about the worst, EP IX doesnt even fit in the saga. It was a cheap move by Disney to bring an abrupt ending to the Skywalker saga and that too with the means of a groundless plot.",1,20,32,24 December 2019
Notting Hill," Floppy
",Notting Hill do succeeds in holding up your interest but eventually wastes the cast's true potential.,4,0,6,29 October 2019
Bird Box," Bad
",A Quiet Place ripoff with a rather predicatable and tiresome ending.,3,1,3,29 December 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Good
",Kill Bill loses most of its fascination during the second half of the film but slowly picks it up later when you think about it.,8,0,2,8 October 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Bad
",An animosity amid the characters followed through a flat road. Reservoir Dogs is monotonous and careless at best.,3,4,7,28 October 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," Not Bad
",It's a Wonderful Life is slow and sometimes even boring but still a great christmas movie.,7,0,5,17 October 2019
Joker," Outstanding
",Joker is astonishingly brilliant if you take into account all the past movies dealing with the character. Joaquin's gripping performance and Todd's sense of direction aids to triumph for DC.,9,3,6,17 October 2019
Blade Runner," Boring
",Blade Runner (1982) lacks the essentials to be in the SC-FI genre.,2,2,10,30 October 2019
The Truman Show," Missed Potential
",The Truman Show came pretty close to being the greatest TV show of all time.,5,0,5,1 November 2019
