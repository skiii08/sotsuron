First Man," What an immersive movie
","I loved this film. It puts us right in the rocket, giving us the experience of being blasted into space. The Gemini takeoff in particular really made you realize how precarious space flight was, and how much courage was required. I liked Ryan Gosling in the role. He was understated, but conveyed the inner thoughts of Armstrong, which is no mean feat. The ending was a downer however, which is why I can't give this film 10 stars. I know the Neil and Jan Armstrong eventually divorced, but it was after 38 years of marriage. I really think she might have been a little happier to see him when he returned. In fact, seeing documentary footage, it's clear she was. I really think that ending, prevented the film from being more popular.",9,1,2,19 April 2020
Knives Out," It was good, not fantastic though
","Daniel Craig was the best part of this film. It had a great cast, and an interesting storyline, but ultimately you tend to forget about it after watching it, compared to Gosford Park, which I've seen numerous times and loved.",7,2,3,19 April 2020
A Quiet Place," This should be more highly rated
","This is such a suspenseful film, and yet it manages to portray a loving family, attempting to survive an apocalyptic environment. I highly recommend it.",10,0,0,19 April 2020
The Martian," This movie grew on me with repeated viewings
","I've seen The Martian now numerous times, but the first time I watched it I was underwhelmed. The reason being that having loved Apollo 13 and having seen numerous documentaries about a real space emergency, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief with The Martian. Watching documentary footage of real people both in NASA and among the public becoming tearful at the successful landing of Apollo 13, just made me so aware that the scenes of the public anxiously waiting for Mark Watney to be rescued weren't real. It took a number of viewings for me to finally develop that suspension of disbelief to enjoy the ending. But every time I've watched it I like it more and more. Matt Damon is fantastic and so likeable in the role. He made the movie, but I also liked Jessica Chastain, and the whole cast really.",9,0,1,19 April 2020
