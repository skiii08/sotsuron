The Blair Witch Project," What a waste of time and money!
","The only thing scary about the movie is that there might be a sequel.  I got sucked in by the hype and watched this home movie of 'adults' not being able to find their way out of the woods...passing streams (you follow a steam if you're lost, by the way) and spending most of their time cussing each other out while walking in circles.  They did so many dumb things that I was ready to cheer at their demise.  The movie critic for our paper had told us the movie had no 'BOO' scares, just mental ones.  Maybe knowing there wouldn't be anything jumping out at you helped make it boring. Regardless, I give it a 2.",Null,0,0,3 October 1999

","I just went to see it this evening. I was worried I would be let down by it by expecting too much. The movie wasn't anything like I expected. It gave you a knot in your stomach at certain points and when it was over, the whole theater was quiet and nobody moved for a minute. It was tastefully done and without taking any sides. The hijackers weren't drooling madmen and the passengers weren't extra special heroes who decided to farce a crash of the plane to save others. They were just regular people that wanted to live and knew they had to do something and do it fast. No one really knows what exactly happened, but enough info can be compiled from phone calls, recordings, flight data recordings and other means to come up with a likely scenario of how things played out. 10/10",10,0,2,18 May 2006
