Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Now, thats how movie should be done!
","This movie passed my expectation, I thought the second part would be done in a half ass sort of way, but instead it is a lot better than the first one.
The music, the style, and the acting were excellent. I haven't enjoyed a movie like this in a long time.This movie was really funny and 'cool' at the same time.
My favorite scene in the movie, when Uma character was training with some kung fu master. The camera effect was like an old martial art film, and you can tell that the director is very passionate about that particular scene (or any scene in the whole movie). I couldn't stop laughing, it was hilarious.I love this movie, and I suggest everyone who likes kill bill vol 1 watch vol 2, because it will do more than just satisfy.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
50 First Dates," So-so date movie
","`50 first dates' isn't Adam Sandler best work, but it was a huge improvement from Anger Management. The movie consists of very funny characters, and it was nice to see Sean Astin do a different kid of role. Usually he plays the cry baby in his movies like Rudy and lets not forget Lord of the rings. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandlers movie chemistry is very good, and pretty convincing.I liked this movie because of its light headed feel, and shooting this film in Hawaii really gives me that light headed feel that I really enjoy when it comes to watching this type of comedy. Another reason why I liked this film when Rob Schinder and Adam Sandler are in the screen together, those two actors are hystericalWhat I didn't like about this movie is Drew Barrymore 'dramatic' little episodes. I can't stand all the crying and the sobbing she does through the movie. The reason I can't stand all the crying and sobbing, because its an Adam Sandler comedy.  I don't think the writers or Drew don't realize that the movie is Happy Madison Production!If you are looking for a for a fun date movie, this is it. If you are looking for a typical Adam Sandler movie, this is it.",7,0,0,1 March 2004
Akira," Holy crap, that was an awesome trip!
","This movie is the ultimate sci-fi adventure movie. I liked this movie a lot more than Blade Runner (by the way is a great flick), because I think it's more interesting and surreal. The Animation is still pretty impressive even for today's standards.So you get an Anime that still looks impressive and it has a deep story, what more could any sci-fi fan want?I love this classic, and I can still watch it like 5 or 10 more times, and still get entertained.P.S: This movie goes on my top list of Sci-Fi movies that includes: Alien, Aliens, Minority Report, and clock work orange.",10,0,2,3 March 2004
Hellboy," I'm I the only person who thinks this movie sucked?
","This movie was a complete disaster, and a lot of the critics thought it was worth seeing. They even said it was one of the better 'comic book' movies. I thought it was the movie is just plain old silly.The acting was really bad, and the story was equally bad too. Maybe the movie is trying to stay 'true' to the comic book, but it was way to boring.The action was lame too, and there's way to much CG. The CG was terrible.The movie tried to be funny, but it just turned out to be one of the corniest movies i have ever seen.worst of all: The director should be ashamed. I was hoping something like Blade 2, and instead you get a money robbing movie like hellboy.
No one should watch this movie, I mean no one!",1,6,10,5 April 2004
Mystic River," it was ok, but over rated
","This movie is not a bad movie at all, but at the same time it's not a great movie either.The problem I had with this movie it lags way too long. If the movie was done in quicker pace, I will probably give it a 7/10 or even an 8/10.The acting was good, but I don't think that Sean Penn deserve to win the Oscar for best actor (Johnny Depp was awesome in Pirates of the Caribbean). Sean Penn is a great actor, but he has done better work with movies in the past. Tim Robbins in the other hand, stole the show from Sean Penn, he did an outstanding job.This movie was ok, and the acting was done pretty well. But it was too long, and the movie was over rated, and I think it didn't deserve all the attention it got in the Oscars.",6,0,0,15 March 2004
Princess Mononoke," Better than lord of the rings will ever be
","This movie was just flat out beautifull. Not only that the Animation was crisp and clear, but the story was very uplifting and moving. Some of the scenes in this movie is dream like!I think it's better than lord of the ring, becasue it's more fast paced, and too me I think the story is more intriging than LOTR.I recommend anyone who likes the fantasy genre, this is a must see.",10,1,2,10 February 2004
Evil Dead II," One of a kind...
","This movie is really good, and its one of kind!Its one of the best horror/comedy movies of all time, and I never get sick of the scene when all the furniture of the house was laughing at Ash! You don't see that kind of greatness in today's movie.This movie has a lot of style, and it can be seen when Ash puts the chainsaw on his chopped off hand. The way it was done was very impressive.This movie is really fun, and you can watch it with your group of friends and have a great time.This movie is classic for everyone to watch, and its way better than spider man will ever be.",10,2,2,14 October 2004
