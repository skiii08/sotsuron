Resident Evil: Afterlife," I Don't Believe in This Afterlife
","Paul W.S. Anderson claims to be a 'big fan' of the Resident Evil games, however like a father encouraging his son to live his life while he constantly undermines everything he does, his actions betray his words. I'm sure his intentions are good, but as they say, the road to hell is paved in good intentions. Apologists for his Resident Evil movies will say 'lighten up, it's based on a video game, it doesn't have to be smart.' I'm so tired of that argument. Just because a movie's based on a video game, doesn't mean it has to be mindless action with no coherent plot. Roger Ebert once said video games will never be art. That may be true, but most of them do have a story to tell. And if these stories are to be given any justice on the big screen, filmmakers can't disregard the source material. The worst thing about this is that I had to pay 3D prices to see this movie (it's not being shown in a regular format). So am I going to have to buy a 3D TV to watch this when it comes out on Blu-ray? Not likely, because I'm never going to watch this movie again.Alice (Milla Jovovich), the main character of the previous installments returns in this one looking prettier than ever. She has ruby-red lipstick, makes a 'duck-face' when she fights, and wears a designer pilot outfit. In a post-apocalyptic world infested with zombies, who has time to get dressed specifically to fly a plane? Even her clones all have matching outfits, hairdos, and flawless skin. We get it Paul Anderson, your wife is hot, can we move along with the movie please? Anyway, the beginning of the movie takes place in Japan. The Alice clones infiltrate Umbrella's underground facility in an attempt to enact their revenge on one Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). What's not clear is what is Wesker's position in Umbrella's corporate structure? We don't know, but the clones need someone to blame. They wreck havoc on the facility, and kill the guards using guns, throwing stars, psychic abilities, and slow-motion. These clones treat their lives with reckless abandon; jumping backwards out of a window while shooting at nothing, and detonating explosives in close proximity to themselves. When one dies, another takes it's place. It's okay, because all know clones have no soul. Once the kamikaze clones do their job, we're conveniently left with one Alice to follow. Somehow, she makes it to Alaska on a single engine plane and while there she meets up with an old friend, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). However, something has happened to Claire that prevents the two of them from catching up on old times. Good, because who wants the character's gap between 'Extinction' and 'Afterlife' to be bridged with needless dialog? In any event, after this non-reunion, and without refueling, they fly to LA in search of the fabled safe haven known as 'Arcadia.'While in LA, they 'crash' land on the roof of a building, and meet up with a group of survivors. This group includes a Hollywood producer (Kim Coates), a struggling actress (Kacey Barnfield), and a famous athlete (Boris Kodjoe) to name a few. Apparently LA is filled with clich√© archetypes. They use an unnecessarily 30-story high prison as a place of refuge from the zombies, and the interior of this prison has like 100 torches scattered about. At the bottom of the prison, locked in a cage, is Chris Redfield (Prison Break's Wentworth Miller). Oh I get it; Wentworth Miller played a character known for breaking out prisons and Chris... Forget it. Chris and Claire are siblings, but you wouldn't know it by the way they act. At least Claire has a reason for being emotionally distant. The group finds the location of Acadia, and have to fight their way through hordes of zombies, and a curiously placed hooded axeman, known as the 'Executioner' in the games, to make it there. Wait, why is there an axeman in the middle of LA in the first place?That's what this movie does, it treats the game like a bargain bin and takes the elements deemed 'cool' and shoehorns them in without any explanation, or context. Nothing is explained; I know what they mean because I played and beat EVERY GAME in the series. Paul Anderson, who only directed this and the first installment, but who has written the screenplay for every single one makes these movies stand-alone. Meaning, each movie feels self-contained and doesn't carry on from the previous installment. Any connection between the movies is tenuous at best. Characters are just empty shells being used as nothing but props in the action scenes. Alice is the only consistent character, and she's as lifeless as the zombies shes killing. She herself is a killing machine; she only gets more powerful with every movie (even though she became 'human' early in the movie). And any gamer would agree it's no fun playing a game that provides no challenge, likewise, its no fun watching a movie in which the hero/heroine go unchallenged. The Resident Evil games pioneered the survival-horror genre. In the older games, the ammo was scarce, the healing items where few and far between, and the enemies were powerful. It put you in a constant state of danger and unease. Hell, in order to conserve your ammo you couldn't kill everything you saw, sometimes you just had to run... That is unless you cheat. And that's what Alice is, a cheat. Instead of a main character that's fragile, and can be overwhelmed at any time we're given one that does the overwhelming. That would be okay if this movie wasn't called RESIDENT EVIL. If you take away everything that's 'Resident Evil' about these movies, aside from a few terms, nothing will have changed. And that's when you know something is wrong.",4,13,27,11 September 2010
The Expendables," One Word: Overkill
","The plot of 'The Expendables' is as such: a group of grizzled, joking mercenaries are hired to rid an island of it's dictator. Admittedly, not the most original premise, but it allows actor-director Sylvester Stallone to do what he does best, which is kill. One thing a good action movie needs is catchy names, and this movie does not disappoint. Stallone plays Barney Ross, along with him are Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Jet Li as Ying Yang, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, and Randy Couture & Terry Crews as the double entendre named Toll Road and Hale Caesar. Plus 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin shows up as a henchmen named Paine. Those names are up there with the likes of 'John Matrix' and, well 'John Rambo.'Barney and his crew are mercenaries, but act more like a biker gang. They hang out at Mickey Rourke's bar (belonging to his character, not the actor) to throw darts, and shoot some pool in between missions. You don't know much about how they all came together, but that's irrelevant: they kick ass. Barney, their leader, meets up with a mysterious man in a church to hear an offer for a job. This man names himself 'Mr. Church,' and is played by Bruce Willis. This is the heavily advertised scene between Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger, and it's exactly what you would expect it to be. They trade jabs, and always try to one-up each other. The scene ends with an allusion to Schwarzenegger's real-life. You would have hoped that Willis and Schwarzenegger had more to do, but it was good while it lasted. Maybe their characters will pop up in a possible sequel. Barney accepts the job to take down this island dictator, and his benefactor, played with certain sliminess by Eric Roberts.'The Expendables' handles the action scenes fairly well. The impact of bullets and knives are emphasized for maximum effect. There are also a couple of good, well-placed scenes, including ones involving a seaplane, and a car chase with a vintage pick-up truck. The only thing that was lacking was the fight scenes. You'd expect a movie with Jason Statham and Jet Li to showcase their respective talents. Statham beats up a group of men playing pickup basketball, and we're teased with a fight scene between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, but that's about it. Stallone himself also looks awkward whenever he has to run, but then again the guy is 64-years-old. However, from then on it's about guns and knives. One particular sequence in which Terry Crew's character, Hale Caesar, uses an automatic shotgun to decimate his enemies stands out among the rest. Before, he muses about how difficult it would be for a man to remain calm when hearing the sound of that gun. How right he was. I would like to say this movie stays way from CGI, or what CGI it does use is seamlessly integrated, but that isn't the case. In a couple of shots during the end, the CGI is painfully obvious (pun intended). Also, for a movie called 'The Expendables,' it's heroes are awfully resilient.With 'Rambo' and now 'The Expendables,' Stallone proves himself to be a competent action director, although he tends to film his actors too close. If a mindless action movie was a sandwich, I would order it: 'light on the plot, heavy on the bullets, with a side of Mickey Rourke,' and the guy taking my order would be like: 'Oh, you want The Expendables?'",8,7,16,16 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Prelude to Darth Vader
","Unlike Episode One, this one grabbed my attention during the whole movie.Episode 2's purpose was clear:  To show us how Darth Vader became Darth Vader.  How you ask?  By giving Anakin a bigger, more important part that didn't involve 15-Minute long Pod Races.  From Anakin's ambition and frustrations, we see how the Dark Side originated in him.  The Clone Wars was really a side-story.  How Anakin grew was the real one.  I also have to give George Lucas props for throwing in hints of Darth Vader- the music, Anakin losing his hand...Well done.However, that wasn't the only thing that made Episode 3 good.  For starters they gave Samuel L. a bigger part, and also, they give Natalie Portman's character some life and made Yoda completely computer generated.All of those factors make Episode 2 what it is.  I look forward to Episode 3",7,0,0,10 June 2002
Centurion," Blood and Mayhem
","Those who are fans of HBO's 'Rome,' or Starz's 'Spartacus' will be pleased with 'Centurion.' It doesn't have the narrative of 'Rome,' nor the trashy-goodness of 'Spartacus,' but what it takes from both of them is violence. And boy does it have a lot of it.The story follows a group of roman soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, they must trek through enemy territory to rescue their general, Virilus (Dominic West), who was captured following an ambush. This group is lead by Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who previously survived a raid on his fort by the Pictish, before escaping and being rescued by General Virilus and his 9th Legion. General Virilus, a man's man, was summoned by Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), a Roman Governor. He was then given the task to go on the offensive, and wipe out the Picts, for no reason other than to help Julius return to Rome. It seems like this is the motive of EVERY Roman politician outside of Rome. Accompanying his legion is the female tracker, Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict herself who now helps the Romans (think Wes Studi in 'The Last of the Mohicans'). She may look pretty, but when she screams, you see how dirty her teeth are, and think to yourself 'I wouldn't want to kiss that.' The plot is very solid, but nothing special and the cast do their best with the material. Voice-Over narration by Michael Fassbender's character, Quintus, is heard throughout the movie. It's not overly done, and serves it's purpose by giving us insight to Quintus. He's the typical roman soldier, honorable, yet filled with national pride. You have no problems rooting for him. Etain, has no tongue, so we don't have to hear Olga Kurlenko speak. All she has to do is make intimidating faces that look more cute than menacing. The rest of the cast is solid, and there's even a black guy in the legion! Guess what happens to him. Every roman solider speaks with an English accent, while the Picts sound Scottish. This isn't 'Mel Gibson's Centurion,' so I have no problems with this. After all, this is an English speaking film. My only gripe is that not enough attention is paid to the characters before they start dying off.Director Neil Marshall (The Descent) really knows how to give his films a sense of dread and unease. Like 'The Descent,' the protagonists of 'Centurion' are chased, and have to survive in an environment they know nothing about. This film is also gory as hell. Heads are not only decapitated, but are diagonally cut in half. Swords go through bodies like they're 99% liquid, and limbs are easily detachable. Hell, even being pushed into a tree while running will result in a blood splatter. One thing this film does not lack is ways to kill people. The kills are very much the highlight of this film, and the blood here is not as cartoonish as the blood in 'Spartacus.' Primarily shot in the forests of Hampshire, England, 'Centurion' is very pleasant to look at; the cast is surrounded by tall trees, and snowy mountains. This accentuates the battle sequences and makes them more enjoyable.'Centurion' contains everything you expect in a film about Romans: blood, betrayal, even a hint of politics ‚Äì but sorry, no sex. However it has a very by-the-books story, and it's characters lack emotion. Aside from Quintus, it's hard to feel for any character, but the movie doesn't care about that. It's a gritty period action flick, and if you like violent deaths, you won't care either.",7,3,9,28 August 2010
