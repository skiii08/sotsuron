Blade Runner 2049," Why Jared?
","Really good movie. Really good photography and vibe over the whole movie, really enjoyed watching the the whole thing until Jared Leto and the animation of Sean Youngs character appeared. Jared Leto and the animation of Sean Young, ruined the whole movie. Still i will watch it again.",7,0,6,28 November 2017
