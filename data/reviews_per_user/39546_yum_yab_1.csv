The Blair Witch Project," there are two good things and two bad things about this movie....
","Good things:1. This film has set a new standard. If this kind of film can be done with just $60K (even though people complain... if you knew how the film was made you'd agree this money wasn't wasted), then think of how much better than Blairwitch a film like StarWars should be (which cost hundreds of millions). Blairwitch had a better concept, better acting, tighter production and better promotion/marketing than every other Hollywood movie this year.2. People will see the merit of this kind of film and we'll see talented but underfunded film people coming out from their shells and embracing us all with their art.Bad things:1. A new generation of fearless film critic has been born. It's cool to think Blairwitch wasn't scary... it's cool to say that low budget = low quality. 2. Big film production companies will pick up and cash in on the originality of films like Blairwitch, Cube and Pi and totally prostitute the film industry... once again. Blairwitch clones are a certainty. Anything that made this much money will most certainly be investigated by stiffs in suits.
Don't see this movie... it will only threaten the imaginations of discerning cinema goers such as fans or legit film making",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
