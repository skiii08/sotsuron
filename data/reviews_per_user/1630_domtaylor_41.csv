The Avengers," In a post 'Infinity War' world, this film looks kind of small. But it still holds up.
","The idea of sequel to what were essentially four different series, and bringing four major comic-book characters to the screen in the same film shouldn't have worked. But it does.'Avengers Assemble' isn't just a good film, but a great one that actually surpasses all MCU films that came before it. All of the characters are well-developed and share equal importance to the action-packed story. It's this key focus on character that really sets the film apart. The story itself is pretty generic, but it's the way in which the characters interact throughout the film that give it a personality. All of the cast are great, the score by Alan Silvestri is epic, and the script is full of witty dialogue that elevates the entertaining action sequences. The film isn't perfect, however, due to the 'over-theatrical' (but well performed) villain, the dissonance between the audience and the army of CGI aliens, and the rushed conclusion. 8/10",8,1,2,12 July 2018
Vertigo," A masterpiece that still holds up today, despite a few flaws.
","Despite being 60 years old, Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' still holds up today. Its breathtaking use of colour and camera work to tell the story is excellently anchored by Bernard Herrman's majestic score and some masterful performances by James Stewart and Kim Novak. The film perfectly conveys the theme of voyeurism, thanks to Hitchcock's amazing use of the shot-reverse-shot structure and eye-line matches, to place us inside the head of Scottie, who we begin to discover may not be the person whom we should be rooting for. The themes that 'Vertigo' explore are definitely ahead of their time, and it is confounding that Hitchcock actually managed to sneak them into this studio film. The story takes some genuinely unexpected turns and Hitchcock cleverly allows the audience to be one-step ahead of the characters, in order to create tension and excitement. Although the film does include some heavy exposition, Hitchcock's use of visual storytelling (especially in the first act) makes up for it, and this makes the film require much more thought than many from its time. My main issue with the film is its somewhat quick conclusion. A little more time to digest what is happening would have made the ending more satisfying. Still, 'Vertigo' is definitely a great film and, in my opinion, Hitchcock's best. 8/10",8,1,2,12 July 2018
Men in Black 3," MIB lll is one great film that you can't miss!
","Men In Black 3 brings back the epicness of the first two movies.Although it has been fifteen years since the first movie, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have kept the quality of their roles and Josh Brolin started his role fantastically also. You would actually think that Josh Brolin would have to be related to Tommy Lee Jones to pull off his role so brilliantly! Men In Black 3 kept me entertained from start to finish and had a variety of comedy and action which is one of the things that makes this a really great movie! Barry Sonnerfield came back with a bang and made this movie as original as the others. This was clevery written and has a great story vouch will hook anyone into this film! Overall,Men In Black 3 is a great movie to see with your family(the IMAX 3D is fantastic on this film by the way)and I would recommend it to be seen on the big screen!",6,1,5,31 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," It's not bad, but it's clear that the folks at Marvel were still finding their footing.
","Many people seem to forget that 'The Incredible Hulk' is actually part of the MCU, most likely due to how different it feels and the fact that it was nowhere near as good as 'Iron Man (2008)' before it. It's definitely one of the weakest MCU efforts, but it's not bad. Edward Norton is decent as Bruce Banner, and Tim Roth is good in his role. The action is well-done to a certain extent and the whole thing is entertaining enough, but the characters aren't really that well developed and the film is actually rather forgettable. Still, it's never boring and entertains while it lasts. 6/10",6,0,0,12 July 2018
Rocketman," An entertaining musical that's let down by following the music-biopic formula too closely.
","'Rocketman' is a pretty entertaining Elton John biopic, but unfortunately it's just that: a musical biopic. While it does differ from the majority of them as it's a straight-up musical as opposed to just featuring on-stage performances, every beat of the narrative is very generic and therefore predictable. This means that for all its different qualities, its generic traits actually overcome them leading to a film that's unfortunately much more forgettable than it should be. Like I said though, it is definitely entertaining in the moment and the musical sequences are well-realised and enjoyable. Egerton is great in the leading role, too, and holds his own in the singing. Actually knowing that he is performing the songs himself really adds to the believability of the whole thing and doesn't just make it seem like an old album is playing over a mime act. In the end, this is probably one of the best examples of the music-biopic thanks to the fact that it's trying to be something different. Unfortunately, though, that's not enough to overcome the traditional trappings of the genre, leading to a picture that's enjoyable in the moment but ultimately rather forgettable. 7/10",7,1,2,7 September 2019
Captain Marvel," Solidly entertaining.
","Admittedly, it is one of the more forgettable MCU pictures, but it still offers the high quality entertainment value of even the more middle-tier flicks in the franchise, never failing to keep you invested in the story and caring for the characters. The best character work here is the relationship between Carol Danvers and Nick Fury, who's interactions provide some of the film's best moments. Speaking about Nick Fury, the de-aging CGI technology used here on Samuel. L Jackson is phenomenal, to the point where it becomes completely unnoticeable. Marvel have always had success with this in the past, but this is clearly the best example of this technology seen in any film to date. Some of the other CGI, especially in the climactic action sequence, isn't nearly as good, but thankfully it doesn't prove to be too much of an issue as you are invested with the characters while watching. The 'live-action' action sequences aren't as involving as they could have been, mainly due to the poor editing, however they're still entertaining enough in the moment. Although it is an origin story, the overall structure and narrative in general allow it to feel somewhat distinct from stories of that type, which is definitely a positive thing and retracts from the predictability of it all. Overall 'Captain Marvel' is a lot of fun and less predictable than expected, but its sometimes badly edited action and the fact that it is fairly unmemorable mean that it never quite reaches the heights of the best MCU movies. 7/10",7,3,6,5 April 2019
Iron Man 2," A clear step-down from the original, but much better than it's reputation would suggest.
","Often regarded as one of the worst films in the MCU, 'Iron Man 2' is actually rather enjoyable. Sure, there's a big difference between this one and the first, but Favreau manages to further set up the MCU and simultaneously deliver a fun experience. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent once again and Don Cheadle proves a worthy replacement for Terence Howard as Stark's best friend 'Rhodey'. Other great cast additions include Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff (who's entry in this film was vital for the characters' success in the larger MCU). While the villain is much more 'comic-book' this time around, Mickey Rourke is very entertaining in the role and his motivations are clear. Also, this film isn't as character-driven as the first and seems to be more focused on spectacle. Thanks to the special effects and choreography of the action sequences, though, they are entertaining. It might not be a great film, but it's enjoyable stuff. 7/10",7,0,0,12 July 2018
The Hunger Games," An action packed movie you won't want to miss!!
","First of all, let me just say that this is really the review that makes sense. I don't see how this film can have some such low ratings. Whilst watching this film, you need to forget about the book and think that this started as a film.The scenes are effective and action packed which keeps you wanting more! Surprisingly, it didn't seem to go on for 2 hours 22 minutes. The acting was great and believable for all the characters. This film was... different,in a good way, to other films with reasons like the camera angles and effects. There's nothing much more to say except you'll be sorry if you miss this cinematic experience and that this film definitely deserves a 9/10! I hope you use my advice,book readers, on not thinking about the book because if you do, you'll struggle to enjoy the amazing movie! The hunger games is definitely a MUST SEE MOVIE!",9,3,9,22 April 2012
Us," It's thrilling and engaging with great performances.
","'Us' is not as good as 'Get Out'. Now that that's out of the way, I can talk about one of the years best films so far. While all of the performances are good throughout, Lupita Nyong'o is outstanding in both of her roles, delivering the strongest performance of 2019 yet, and makes the film more engaging. The first act is great at setting up the characters and conflicts, thanks to the realistic dialogue and a superb visual style. Things really get exciting in the second act, once the doppelgÃ¤nger family are introduced. Here both the tension and horror ramp up to deliver a truly taut, tense and thrilling middle portion that works so well because we care for the characters involved. The doppelgÃ¤nger family is truly creepy as well, supplying the traditional 'horror' of the film. Unfortunately, the ending is by far the worst section of the flick, as it is severely bogged down by a massive exposition dump that over-explains a lot of the narrative and leaves little to the audience's imagination. There's also a final twist that isn't initially all that impactful as it doesn't really change anything and seems only to have been included for a cheap shock. However, upon reflection it does add an extra layer of subtext and gives the overall message a deeper meaning. Another good thing is that the final confrontation is executed very well in terms of the staging, editing and music and this ensures that things don't end in an underwhelming way. There is also a lot of symbolism and a few hidden meanings scattered throughout, so, while the main narrative is fully explained to the audience, there is still a lot of room for reflection and discussion once the film is over, which is always a positive thing. Overall, 'Us' is a very thrilling and engaging picture with great characters and performances. While the third act could have been handled a little bit better, it's by no means awful and it definitely doesn't tarnish the excellence of what comes before it. 8/10",8,0,3,11 April 2019
The Irishman," He's available.
","'The Irishman' is good, even reaching greatness at several points, however it has a few problems which bring it down. Firstly, it's long (running for a whopping 3hrs 29mins) and it feels it, mainly due to its pacing. The first two-thirds have a very episodic feel and aren't very focussed. The intent of the piece isn't really clear here. What we see just seems like a selection of random events in the protagonists' life, rather than a carefully constructed, character-building narrative. It actually takes around 3 hours, which is far longer than most complete films, for its main purpose to become clear. That's not to say what precedes it is bad, though. It's actually far from it, as its individual scenes are undeniably entertaining thanks to good writing, direction and performances. It's just never that engaging because of its lack of satisfying coherence. It also follows the traditional structure of the genre, coupled with generic narration, which gives it an overwhelming sense of predictably. The final portion of the film, however, really brings everything together and makes it stand out from other gangster flicks. Here, it offers a reflection and meditation on the genre as a whole, exploring themes of guilt and death in an effective and engaging way. It's an incredibly bold, ultimately genius, way to end things and leaves a great lasting impression. It makes the whole experience more likeable and far less generic upon reflection. Saying that though, one mustn't forget that it takes a long time for it to really be effective. A lot of the first 3 hours or so could easily have been trimmed for a leaner experience, without losing anything essential. It does allow for more time with the performances, though, which are nothing short of outstanding. Joe Pesci is the highlight, appearing in a far calmer role than you might expect. Another notable aspect of the film are the de-aging CGI effects used throughout, which aren't phenomenal and are really noticeable in the first few scenes. Thankfully though, the power of the performances and writing easily allows you to forget about this very quickly. It's surprising how little you even think about it as the film progresses. Overall, 'The Irishman' is definitely worth seeing (ideally on the big screen like I did, although it may be a little late for that now). Even if it's not Scorsese's best and can seem like an endurance test at times, it's still an ultimately effective piece that's undeniably entertaining in the end. 7/10",7,6,16,26 November 2019
Aquaman," The worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst full stop.
","The DCEU has never produced a 'good' film and sadly 'Aquaman' is no exception. It's an overlong slog that has a terrible narrative, unbelievable CGI, average performances, and an awful exposition-filled screenplay. The film just gets worse as it progresses, and I had completely lost interest by around the half-way point. There is one good action sequence near the middle of the movie that is actually rather entertaining, and that is probably due to the fact that it uses real stunt-people and fight choreography as opposed to the awkward CGI body doubles that are used in 75% of the action set-pieces. The problem with these is that, since we don't care for any of the characters at all, it is easy to notice that CG has taken over. If we were invested in the narrative and were bothered by the film's stakes, then the CG replacement would probably be less of a problem. Talking about character, some of our hero's decisions are completely unbelievable and make him a totally unlikeable character. The film does use some good scene transitions sometimes, but that's hardly enough to save the picture. The worst thing about it, however, is that it's simply not fun. It could have at least been entertaining, and I could have even excused the bad narrative and dialogue if I was having some kind of fun. Yet, I was bored throughout most of it and was never invested within the story. It's the worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst films full stop. 4/10",4,2,5,28 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," It's the best 'Thor' movie, but that's not saying much.
","The change in direction for the 'Thor' franchise is a welcome one that elevates 'Thor: Ragnarok' above its two predecessors. Unfortunately though, only just. The film is a straight-up comedy at the expense of an investing story, real character development and emotional investment, which would be fine if any of the comedy was actually funny. The majority of entertainment value would come from the film's comedic moments, and since they are actually rather annoying, there isn't much to enjoy here. It's a shame, too, since director Taika Waititi has proven time and time again that he's capable of creating genuinely funny comedy. It's not all bad though; the movie is colourful enough, has some entertaining action and I can't say that I was ever bored. The 'comedy' just really drags it down. It's bizarre, as well, that out of all the 'Thor' stories they could have attempted the full comedy route with, they decided to try it out with 'Ragnarok', one of the hero's darkest. 6/10",6,0,2,15 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Refreshingly low stakes and great performances make this the best Spider-Man film since 'Spider-Man 2'
","Easily the best 'Spider-Man' film since Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2', Jon Watts' 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a constantly entertaining boots on the ground story, with refreshingly small stakes and a good sense of humour. Tom Holland is great as a young Peter Parker, one that actually acts and feels like a teenager, and his performance really keeps the film webbed together. Michael Keaton also gives a fantastic performance as Adrian Toomes. While the villain is rather generic, it's Keaton's performance that makes him a memorable one. The most interesting aspects of the story are seeing Peter Parker get to grips with his powers and begin to discover more about the dangers of the world and himself. The worst aspects of the film are actually the high-flying CGI action sequences as they feel entirely synthetic. It's a shame that they decided to make almost all of the action CGI, especially considering that Tom Holland is capable of performing stunts. In fact, he actually did do the majority of stunts himself, only the studio decided to make him do these while wearing a mo-cap suit, so that they could mimic his movements onto a GCI model. I personally feel like this was a bad move and that the action would have felt more realistic if they used an actual stunt team with Holland at the forefront. Still, the great character moments outweigh the somewhat unremarkable action scenes and the film contains one of the best, most tense scenes in the entire MCU. It's a scene in which in which there is no CGI involved, just two actors and a car. 8/10",8,0,1,15 July 2018
Doctor Strange," Its outstanding special effects can't elevate the picture past its poor storytelling and inconsistent tone.
","The visuals are undoubtably fantastic, leading to some very unique action set-pieces that have enough style to set them apart from other superhero films, and its outstanding soundtrack is one of the best of the MCU. It's a shame, then, that the story and tone of 'Doctor Strange' drag it down to be one of the worst films of the Marvel cinematic universe. Stephen Strange is an unlikeable protagonist, one who we can never root for, and this means that the audience doesn't really have any reason to care about the story. Also, the narrative is very predictable and the film doesn't have a proper grasp on time; the 'training montage' is over very quickly and because there is no indication of how much time has passed, it seems as if Strange has gone from a nobody to the sorcerer supreme in mere days. Therefore, it feels entirely unbelievable that Strange can masterfully use his powers and save the world by the end of this film. Throughout the picture, Strange should have been struggling to use his powers, indicating to the audience that he is still learning and developing over time. Another big issue with the movie is its ham-fisted attempts at comedy. It is never funny, yet its 'humour' is always prevalent, even undermining serious moments on several occasions, and this becomes extremely annoying. Sure, a few comedic moments wouldn't have gone amiss, but since the character of 'Doctor Strange' isn't a funny one, this film should have had more of a focus on its serious elements and getting them to be successful. Without its superb visual elements and soundtrack, this could have been a disaster. 6/10",7,1,1,15 July 2018
Ant-Man," It's a little generic, but a lot of fun.
","It's amazing that, despite all of the production issues involving Edgar Wright's departure, 'Ant-Man' turned out good. The film has a consistent tone and manages to feel like one complete vision. Ant-Man's powers make for a unique superhero tale with some interesting action and the origin story is an entertaining one that keeps its characters at its heart. The film also makes a good attempt at humour which, while not always successful, feels welcome as it fits with the characters and isn't out of place. It isn't a perfect superhero film, however. The character arcs and overall narrative are extremely predictable, and the villain is an especially weak one. It never really breaks the mould, but it doesn't seem like it's trying to. Instead 'Ant-Man' focuses on delivering lots of fun and it does that that in spades. Plus, Christophe Beck's memorable soundtrack is one of the best in the entire MCU. 7/10",7,0,0,13 July 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The best animated film of the year.
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a surprisingly mature, yet constantly entertaining animation that never loses its sense of fun despite the serious themes that it explores. At its core, the film is an origin story that hits all the beats that we have come to expect from films of its kind, however these elements are fused with the completely new 'multiverse' aspects and this ensures that the generic elements of the narrative don't prove to be much of a problem. The excellent character development also helps to keep the film fresh. While a few of the 'Spider-People' aren't really fleshed out further than their basic character traits, the majority of core characters have believable arcs that allow us to care for them. Peter B. Parker was a surprisingly nuanced character and his Spider-Man story is probably the most realistic one that we have ever seen on the big screen. Although it initially seemed distracting and some of the shots looked like you were watching the 3D version without the glasses, the animation style was overall excellent and really brought the comic book aesthetic to life, in a way that has never been seen before. The character design was also generally good, except from Kingpin's as he looked way too big and didn't really fit with the aesthetic style of the rest of the characters. Unlike a lot of recent superhero flicks, the film knows when to use humour and when to be serious, never confusing the two, allowing for both laugh-out loud comedic moments and genuinely tense and exciting action sequences. Overall, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is a fantastic film that knows exactly what it wants to be, and will appeal to children and adults alike thanks to its humour, action, and fleshed-out narrative. 8/10",8,1,4,28 December 2018
Captain America: Civil War," A fantastic thriller with some amazing action sequences.
","With amazing, heart-pounding action sequences, an intriguing character-driven storyline and several fantastic character introductions, 'Captain America: Civil War' is definitely of the MCU's best and also one of the very best in the genre. This is largely due to the way in which its 'superhero' aspects come second to its 'thriller' ones, meaning that the film is about much more than CGI extravaganza. All of the action feels entirely grounded, despite the inclusion of various clearly ungrounded superpowers, and the focus on practical hand-to-hand combat makes the film feel much more palpable. The movie is also full of emotion, as we see characters that we have grown to love pushed to their limits and forced to do things that go against their 'hero' personas, which again adds a sense of weighty realism to the picture. It's a constantly enthralling political thriller, and a lot of fun that never drags, despite its 147 minute run-time. 9/10",9,0,1,13 July 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Big-budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best.
","You know a film is good when it manages to make three hours absolutely fly by. 'Avengers: Endgame' does this in spades, making its gargantuan run-time seem as fast as a snap of the fingers. While it is properly pacy, this doesn't mean that it's a constantly moving, action driven piece in the same vein as its predecessor 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018). Instead, it's a much more character focussed, dramatic film and in my eyes it's all the better for it. While 'Infinity War' was great in its own right, 'Endgame' feels like a completely different beast all together; the two are undeniably separate entities. The characters have always been what makes the MCU stand out and 'Endgame' arguably has the best character work in one of these films to date. Rather unusually for a picture of this ilk, it is focussed more on that than any action or spectacle, both completing arcs from the entire franchise and establishing new ones in itself. Each of the core players are focussed upon greatly here, which is extremely involving, especially to long-time fans of the series. That's not to say that the film is devoid of any action at all though; it comes eventually and is very much worth the wait. The third act action sequence is probably the most satisfying moment of the entire franchise and proves that Marvel knows how to stage these things very well, while still keeping a keen focus on character. There's also a lot of fan service throughout, but this hardly a bad thing at all. Being able to reference even the lesser known and liked films of the franchise and trust that the majority of the audience will be able to understand is something that Marvel wears with pride here. 'Endgame' is for the fans after all and it never forgets this, yet (unlike 'Infinity War') there's enough groundwork laid out here to make it really work on its own as an individual story, too. Overall, it's an outstanding conclusion to the 'Infinity Saga', satisfyingly wrapping everything up, making it feel like a definitive 'end', yet still leaving you excited for what's to come (the MCU isn't going anywhere any time soon). It's big-budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best and one of the greatest Marvel films to date. 9/10",9,42,67,23 June 2019
Toy Story 4," It's decent, but simply not good enough to warrant getting the toys back out of the box.
","I'll start by saying that 'Toy Story 4' is definitely a good film. It has outstanding animation (with almost photo-realistic environments), tells a fairly thematically rich narrative that doesn't pander to children, and is a decently fun time overall. However, it's simply not good enough to warrant getting the toys back out of the box. 'Toy Story 3' was an absolutely perfect ending to the series, expertly wrapping up all of the themes and character arcs in a very satisfying way, and the heads at Pixar said they would only make a fourth movie if they could come up with a storyline that was as good or better than that of the original trilogy. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't make the cut. It lacks the humour and wit of the first two films and the pure heart of the third, meaning that it's only a middling Pixar effort (though that is to say better than the majority of animated films out there). It has a strong opening act that sets up some nice, thought-provoking themes, however these are never really expanded upon and somewhat thrown out in service of other, less-interesting ones. Take the character of 'Forky' for example. The (highly marketed) theme and arc surrounding his character are very interesting, yet they are only one of many that are pretty underdeveloped and quickly resolved. That seems to be the biggest problem with the film as a whole: there are too many cooks in the kitchen. It has eight credited story writers and this is extremely obvious. Unlike any of the previous entries in the franchise, it lacks a clear through-line in terms of theme and this is a great detriment to the piece. What's worse, however, is that the message that the film finally settles on is completely contradictory to that of the original trilogy, and some character arcs fully go back on what was established in those prior entries. I can see what they were trying to achieve, and in its own right the message isn't a bad one, yet it simply doesn't work here as this is a direct continuation of the first three films. It's easy to say that you shouldn't compare this fourth entry to the rest of them and that you should take it as its own thing, but at the end of the day that's impossible to do as it's not it's own thing. Had it been a sort of spinoff, focussing on different characters in the same world, that wouldn't have been such a big ask. As it stands though this is definitely 'Toy Story 4', a direct follow-on exploring the lives of the same characters, so direct comparisons to the first three are inevitable, and it should have taken them and their character arcs into consideration. Another issue is that the original supporting characters, including Jesse who can sort of be seen as one of the leads, are severely underused here. Classic characters such as Hamm, Rex, the Potato Heads and Slinky only have a couple of lines each and add nothing to the overall narrative. Even Buzz, who is in the film quite a bit, doesn't really have much to do and he sort of seems out of character. This is a huge shame as those characters and their individual personalities brought a lot of the charm to the first three films. There are new side characters introduced in this film that get a lot of the screen time, but unfortunately they just aren't all that interesting and it seems a shame to have all of the great classic characters do practically nothing so that these new additions can just be okay. Like I initially said though, this is far from a bad film. There's definite enjoyment to be had here and it's attempts at exploring big ideas are admirable. It's just simply not good enough, however, when 'Toy Story 3' ended the franchise so perfectly. Had it been funnier, more exciting and more than middling Pixar, it wouldn't have been such a problem that it reopened the 'Toy Story'. As it stands though, it's unfortunately quite a disappointing return. 6/10",6,5,10,27 June 2019
The Favourite," A unique period-drama let down by its plodding pacing and under-developed characters.
","'The Favourite' is somewhat of a mixed-bag. It certainly tries to do something different with the 'period-drama', and Lanthimos' distinct style and the fantastic performances are evidently what makes it distinct. It is also clear, however, that this is the first time in which Lanthimos isn't directing his own screenplay. In terms of the narrative, this definitely isn't Lanthimos fair and this is what really lets the film down. It's never exactly boring, but you are also never really fully invested in the story and, overall, the piece feels extremely long. The core conflict between the three lead characters doesn't seem to have a lot of development, either, and it's hard to really care about them much. Sure, there are a few good scenes that explore the character of Queen Anne deeper, but I felt that, in a picture that really relies on the relationships between its core players, they are only glimpses of what should have been. Personally, I don't think that the humour really landed and this is likely something that limited my engagement in the film - it is a 'black comedy' after all - yet in my screening there were quite a lot of belly laughs, so I suppose if the humour works for you, then the film will be much more successful. Luckily, despite the weak characters and plodding pacing, Lanthimos and the cast keep it from being bad. It's definitely not my favourite Lanthimos film, but it makes for a unique 'period piece'. 6/10",6,2,6,19 January 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Much worse than the first.
","Making a follow-up to a masterpiece is no small feat, but who better to make a sequel to Spielberg's best film than Spielberg himself? Well, probably nobody but that just shows what a hard task this must have been. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is nowhere near as as good as the original. It's not even close. Spielberg's touches are evident in the film, however, and thankfully that means we get a few good sequences (such as the RV scene) that are genuinely tense, exciting and well-crafted. Unfortunately though, these sequences are few and far between, undermined by a seriously silly storyline and screenplay that make this film feel like a parody of the first. Having characters that use gymnastics to fight dinosaurs and ones that would rather accompany the same space as a T-Rex than a snake really highlight the shortcomings of the screenplay. Even Jeff Goldblum can't save this, mainly because the 'Ian Malcolm' in this film is completely different from that in the last. At least the visual effects are up to scratch again (except from the obvious control blatantly seen on one of the animatronic dinosaurs' legs) and the soundtrack by John Williams is good, without being a copy of the first films'. Overall, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is a massive let-down that, apart from everything else, is actually quite boring. 'Jurassic Park' is Spielberg's best film. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is one of his worst. 5/10.",5,48,72,10 July 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A modern superhero film that's not afraid to take risks, while also delivering on the laughs, thrills and spectacle that audiences have come to expect from the genre.
","'Avengers: Infinity War' shouldn't have worked. It has over 20 major characters and only 149 minutes to fit them all into a cohesive story, but somehow Anthony and Joe Russo (along with screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus) managed to not only make it a good comic-book film, but one of the very best. The fact that it brings together multiple different franchises is a groundbreaking achievement in its own right, but the film actually accomplishes more than that. It's a film that's not afraid to take risks, one that takes audience expectations and completely smashes them, delivering something that stands out from the rest. The majority of characters are well balanced (apart from Steve Rogers, in my opinion) and the pacing never drags, aside from a couple of side-plots being slightly too long. The film also has a good handle on tone; it knows when to be funny, but never loses its sense of drama and fully delivers on its most serious moments. The action scenes (while mostly GCI driven) are all exciting and grand in scale, and the score by Alan Silvestri is one of his best in years. On top of all that, the film is always fun and has its fair share of epic goosebump-inducing moments. The ending of the film initially felt disappointing, but reflecting upon it made me realise that it was actually perfect and one of the things that makes the film so great. It's not the best film of the MCU, but the way in which it takes real risks and offers a genuinely unique experience elevates it to be one of the very best in its genre. 9/10",9,0,4,22 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It's official, old buddy, you're a has-been.
","'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' isn't a good film. It's dull, far too long, very baggy, and quite simply a bit boring on the whole. Even in its best scenes, where it's a little more interesting, it's never truly engaging and this is primarily because the whole affair is rather aimless, seeming to not have a real purpose. For a film with a run-time of 161 minutes, it's extremely light in the story department and what is happening is hardly interesting at all. Every beat of the narrative is pretty much in the trailer (minus the stuff in the final third), which is very surprising as it seemed like the marketing department must have been keeping something hidden to deliver a better experience. Surely then, the character work is excellent and Tarantino's signature dialogue keeps things interesting, right? Nope. While DiCaprio and Pitt are at the top of their games, the actual characters are very uninspired and the dialogue is pretty standard. It doesn't help that there is hardly any development in that department, either. Rick Dalton has a very tiny arc, even if it's basic and just told to you in a clunky third-act exposition dump, but the rest of the characters stay the exact same throughout, which obviously makes things far less compelling. Sharon Tate is hardly even in the picture, which is very bizarre considering that Tarantino began the screenplay about her. She's just used as a tool to try and build tension in the audience as they anticipate what is going to happen to her. This links with another major issue with the piece. It's a half-fictional, half-based on reality narrative about a made-up actor and stuntman that's telling the story of Sharon Tate and the Manson murders. It doesn't sound like that's a good mix, and that's because it isn't. It simply doesn't work. Supposedly, this is Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood, but it just seems like he hates it and everybody in it - just look at the Bruce Lee scene. The way that Tarantino portrays, and even treats, him is horrendous, which is very strange considering that Lee was clearly an inspiration on some of his earlier films. When asked about this scene, Tarantino has said that he accurately portrayed Lee because that's what he was like in real life. Tarantino didn't know the guy so there's no sure fire way of him knowing that and he just comes across as arrogant himself when he refuses to accept that he's in the wrong, especially when people who actually knew Lee in person have spoken out about it. The final act of the film has been much discussed and, for the most part, has been heavily praised. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say that it's dealt with in typical 'Tarantino' fashion. However, where it goes is very predictable - I guessed what would happen correctly after seeing the trailer - and it's actually dealt with in pretty poor taste to the point of being rather disrespectful. I know what Tarantino is trying to do with it, but the message is rather messy and the final result rather uncomfortable. Look, while the whole thing is pretty bad, it's not completely without merit. If anything should be being praised about it, it's definitely the performances. They're fantastic all round, with DiCaprio and Pitt truly giving almost career-best ones, but unfortunately that's not enough to make this thing worth recommending. The other great aspect of the film is the production design; you truly believe the 1960's Hollywood aesthetic. Again, though, that's not enough to overcome the bland screenplay and total lack of narrative investment. People are saying that it's Tarantino's most emotional movie to date, but I felt absolutely nothing for its entire duration. Although, after thinking about just how much of a waste of time the experience was, I find myself rather irritated. I guess that's something. It's certainly a polarising picture, one that Tarantino has said he wants people to discuss. I doubt he meant discussing how disappointing it is though. 4/10",4,15,23,21 August 2019
Aladdin," Make way for the Fresh Prince; Disney ain't ever had a friend like him.
","When discussing Guy Ritchie's 'Aladdin' remake, it's impossible not to get caught up on the fact that it's exactly that: a remake. This new wave of live action Disney do-overs is pretty harmful to the filmmaking industry, as the majority of them (including this) have been enormously successful at the box-office, telling behemoths like Disney that this is what audiences want. It isn't. Or at least it shouldn't be. I'd much rather watch the original 'Aladdin' (1992) and have something new to see at the cinema than have to watch every classic again in an inferior way. Thankfully, though, this version of the flick is nowhere near as bad as it could have been. It's pointless, yes, but it's here and I have to admit it's a fairly entertaining time. The first portion moves rather slowly and it's not all that enjoyable, but things really take a turn for the better upon the arrival of Will Smith's Genie. Somehow the aspect of the piece that people were most worried about is the best thing about it. He's an entertaining character and Smith really brings him to life in a satisfying way. The relationship between Aladdin and the Genie is well realised here, too, and the middle portion of the film is actually rather fun. Naomi Scott is a good choice for Jasmine, as well, and she works well together with Mena Massoud, even if the script doesn't develop their relationship all too well. Surprisingly, the musical numbers are also pretty good. While the visuals are often copied straight from the original film, the actual music is enjoyable. Despite them all, bar one which is good if a little too pop-sounding, being taken from the original, they manage to sound fresh thanks to the cast - especially Smith. The updated versions stand on their own and Smith's style fits them surprisingly well, meaning that whenever there's a song, it's a fun time - something really important considering that this is a musical. It doesn't just remind you of how good the songs in the original were either, it actually makes you like and remember these new versions. It's not all good though; the film is far too long. Somehow they managed to take the exact same story that took 90 minutes and tell it in 128, and you can feel it. Also, while it is entertaining to an extent, there have been far more enjoyable family films this year that are a lot more original than this. Overall, it's a decent, if overlong, watch that can actually be fairly enjoyable. Like I said though, it's never outstanding and it's originality is severely lacking. Without Smith, this wouldn't have been anywhere near as successful. 6/10",6,0,1,7 September 2019
The Bourne Legacy," The trailer makes it look better than it is by a lot!
","I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it needed more action in my opinion. The action scenes,when they came, were good but most of the movie was Story,Story,Story. Renner and Weiz were good in this and suited the roles.When the film ended it seemed,in story wise, that it was just the beginning.I know there is going to be another movie and they are speaking 2 more after that but this should have gone deeper into the(so to speak) quadrilogy.I am just hoping that the next few movies will be better than this one. It's worth a watch though and you'll need to see this one so that the others will make sense but I'd say to wait until it releases on DVD.",6,1,8,8 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," The best film in the MCU.
","This sci-fi masquerading as a superhero flick is the best film to come out of the MCU. It's laugh-out-loud funny on multiple occasions, it has a great cast of unique characters that are all played fantastically by the actors, and the story has a beating heart at its core. The film works so successfully because of the way in which alien characters (including a hybrid raccoon and a talking tree) are realistically portrayed and developed. Somehow the film manages to always feel human and something that we can relate to. On top of this, the action sequences are spectacular and, since we truly care about all of the key players, there isn't a disconnect between the audience and the CGI on display. Also, who could forget the film's fantastic 80s fuelled soundtrack that plays a large part in the story and the character development. The best thing about the film, however, is that it's an utter blast from start to finish, no matter how many times you have seen it. It's blockbuster filmmaking at its best. 9/10",9,0,2,12 July 2018
Jurassic World," There's some entertainment to be had here, but overall it's just mediocre.
","This long anticipated (for some reason) follow-up is pretty average, and shows that the once masterful 'Jurassic' franchise has become part of the Hollywood money-making machine. Perhaps it shouldn't have been surprising, however, since every 'Jurassic' sequel has been a disappointment. I'm sure that Colin Trevorrow tried to make an interesting film, but it ultimately turned out rather bland. With horrible cinematography, an exposition-filled screenplay, and an over-reliance on CGI (that will make this film seem older than the original in a few decades), 'Jurassic World' is a major disappointment. Still, once you accept that this is going to be a predictable Hollywood blockbuster, there's some passive fun to be had and there are far worse films of this type out there. Chris Pratt is pretty entertaining too. 5/10.",5,0,1,10 July 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers: Age of Adequacy
","A clear step-down from the first, 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' is for the most part a mess. The characters aren't as well-written as the first, the pacing is poor, the story is pretty generic, and the film's action isn't even all that entertaining. On the flip side, the villain is unique, there are some good character moments and the inclusion of Scarlett Witch makes for some interesting scenes. However, these things can't elevate this film to more than 'good enough'. It's definitely not terrible and it's adequately made, but it just feels as if something is lacking to make us care more about the plot and characters. The film is certainly watchable, but it does nothing special to set it apart and therefore ends up being only a little more than average. There are worse superhero films out there, but considering that this is an 'Avengers' film, it can't help but feel like a let-down. 6/10",6,0,0,13 July 2018
Midsommar," A pain in the Aster.
","'Midsommar' starts out fairly well with an undeniably disturbing scene that acts as an interesting setup for both the characters and what would seem to be the underlying theme of the piece. Unfortunately, it steeply goes downhill once the characters arrive at the festival. Quite frankly, it soon becomes a bore; it's not scary, thrilling, tense, or even dramatic, and any semblance of theme or character is thrown out of the window. The complete lack of any dread, tension, or atmosphere leads you to wonder what the whole point of it is. It doesn't even feel like it's trying to be scary or unnerving at all, aside from the few moments of overt gore that are shown in great detail. This was clearly only done in a desperate attempt to shock the audience, which is kind of a cheap move. Aster even seems to think that foreign customs are enough to unnerve them. The whole piece really tries to evoke a fear of 'the other', which is really quite disrespectful. For example, there are several very long scenes showing the cult do traditional dances and chants, even simply eating meals in the way that they do. They aren't doing anything at all weird or scary here, yet it seems Aster just included them to build a sense of dread. He even includes a disabled character that has absolutely no purpose within the narrative; he only exists as an attempt to 'frighten' the audience. Again, this isn't scary, it's just disrespectful. Another issue is that the characters generally don't feel threatened or in danger at any point, which is really detrimental to the film. If they're not scared, why should we be? Of course, we don't really care about them anyway. In the end, 'Midsommar' is just an extremely overlong collection of uninteresting scenes about uninteresting characters, that has zero atmosphere, dread, or tension. It's not scary, which wouldn't even be so much of a problem if it had an engaging story and good characters, and you leave feeling absolutely nothing, wondering what the whole point of it is. I must say that it is extremely well made, with some interesting shots, great production design and fantastic performances, but when the story is this bad that doesn't really account for anything. It's a real shame, too, as this should be the cure to modern 'jump scare central' horror flicks that flood the screens every month. Aster clearly has the talent behind the camera to craft something unique in the genre, but here he's completely wasted that on an absolutely terrible story with no scares at all. It's just a waste of time really. 4/10",4,14,24,9 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," While it's not as good as it's predecessor, Vol.2 is still an entertaining space adventure with good humour and action that stands as one of the MCU's better films.
","'Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2' is the follow up to 2014's excellent 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. In this sequel all of the main cast return along with writer/director James Gunn who,this time around, penned the script alone. The film catches up with the Guardians several months after the events of the first film and centres around the meeting of Peter's father, Ego.On the whole this second instalment is extremely fun. It does however lack the charm and surprise of the first film. The characters are all great and are given some decent dialogue that is filled with attempts at humour which sometimes works but unfortunately often falls a little flat. There are only few laugh out loud moments here, unlike in the first film, and a lot of the jokes elicit less than a smirk. That's not to say that the shortcomings of the jokes are a detriment the fun of the feature, though; the overall light tone of the script and the comedic nature of the characters contribute to a constant sense of entertainment. The cast are all on top form, especially Michael Rooker as Yondu who's character is developed more than in the first feature. Baby Groot surprisingly wasn't overused and didn't take up the majority of the screen time as I expected. The character was fairly good and had some funny moments, although I much preferred the innocence and aggression of Groot in the original film.One standout aspect of the original film was the retro 70s soundtrack that led the action and emotion and here we get another plethora of classic 70s tunes that accompany the Guardians. While I preferred the utilization of the soundtrack in the first film, 'Awesome mix vol.2' was implemented well into the feature and included some great songs that added to the fun.The action scenes in this film were all constantly entertaining and felt fun. Gunn once again directed them with style and the witty remarks by the characters during the sequences really added to the fun. The third act did however get a little too big and generic, heavily relying on CGI-fuelled extravagance, but luckily it retains a key focus on character throughout.The film had an emotional payoff, which really worked and provided some great moments for the characters that we have grown to care about over the course of the two films.Overall 'Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2'is a thoroughly entertaining film ,that retains a sense of fun and character throughout, that never comes close to being as imaginative and original as it's predecessor. It is a film that has excellent character moments that make you really care for them and provides plenty of joy, even if a lot of the jokes fail to make you laugh as much as the film makers clearly intended. 8/10.",8,1,5,1 May 2017
Thor," Keep the camera straight, Kenneth.
","Kenneth Branagh is a good director, but the acclaimed thespian probably wasn't the best choice to direct Marvel's 'Thor'. His choice to have almost every single shot on a canted angle is extremely annoying and it gives the film a monotonous feeling. If every shot is tilted, none of them are. The bland screenplay and characters don't help either, as they are the thing that really makes this film boring. The attempts at humour fall flat, yet the film is unintentionally funny on several occasions due to how some serious moments are over-done to the point of feeling parody-like. Saying that, the film isn't terrible; there are some enjoyable action sequences, the score by Patrick Doyle is pretty catchy and the overall message of the film is a good one, even if it is a bit poorly handled. 5/10",5,1,2,12 July 2018
Joker," A truly haunting character study.
","'Joker' is the type of film that you want to rewatch immediately yet never watch again; it's as deeply disturbing as it is utterly compelling, leading to a unique experience that truly sticks with you. The pure visceral effect of it literally lasts for days, and once that wears off the narrative still lingers in your mind, something truly rare in today's age of cinema. It's an incredibly grounded character study, with one of the most complex protagonists in years. He's not a hero, but not quite a villain either. It's far more complicated than that, purely because it's simply far more realistic than that. Arthur fleck is just presented as a person, one who you aren't supposed to empathise with but rather pity. The film never forces you to feel a certain way about him either, as it just shows the events in a relatively unbiased way, which allows for different audience interpretations. The filmmaking here is fantastic, with everything from the cinematography and production design to the haunting score putting most films to shame. It still astounds me that Todd Phillips directed this as it's in a completely different league to anything he's helmed before. For all it's technical, behind-the-camera excellency though, there's no doubt that this wouldn't have been nowhere near as successful without Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance. It has been said before, but it needs to be said again: this guy deserves the Oscar. It's far and away the best performance of the year, and is perhaps one of the best performances I've ever seen. Phoenix's mere presence here demands your attention and he completely throws himself headfirst into the role, outdoing himself in the process (a very high praise for an actor of his talents indeed). Sure, the writing is great too, but Phoenix completely sells Arthur's transformation in such a convincing way that I'm sure the performance could have overcame bad writing had it needed to. Thankfully though, Phoenix is matched by the film surrounding him, which just solidifies how great the whole thing is. Like I said, it's a very disturbing, even scary, watch that is completely absorbing from the opening frame. It's not fun, but it isn't supposed to be. It knows what it wants to be, establishes this very early on, and rolls with it, completely sticking the landing. It's an incredibly accomplished work and if DC stick to this route from now on, they'll soon become the leading company in comic book adaptations. 9/10",9,2,2,31 October 2019
Marriage Story," Engaging.
","The title may seem ironic; 'Marriage Story' is, after all, about a divorce. However as much as it's about the end of a marriage, it's the little moments of love and affection that Baumbach really chooses to focus on. It's an engaging character study and nuanced look at the legal system that is extremely well written and features some of the best performances of the year. Seriously, Johansson and Driver are at the top of their games here, injecting life into their characters in even the quietest of moments. That's where the film really succeeds, too. For a story about a divorce, there are less arguments than you'd expect. Of course, they do happen and are expertly done (one scene in particular is destined to become a classic and is sure to be studied as a masterclass in writing and acting), but it's the restrained, subtler scenes that really create the most emotion, and highlight the strength of the piece. While it's obviously sad and emotionally affecting in that regard, it's also surprisingly funny. Even though it's never hilarious, there's a sense of humour injected into nearly every scene. This is mainly due to how realistically the piece is written, as the humour comes from common, everyday interactions more than jokes. Again, the simple fact that this tone works highlights just how strong the writing is. One of its biggest missteps, however, is its focus on Driver's character, Charlie. After an introduction to both parties, the film begins with a heavy focus on Johansson's character Nicole, then shifts to Charlie's perspective. The problem is that from there onwards the audience sees things very much from Charlie's perspective, even if the flick ensures that neither Charlie or Nicole are seen as a 'villain'. Because it initially establishes itself as a two-sided piece, it does feel a bit limiting that Charlie is undeniably the protagonist. That's not to say that Nicole isn't a great character, however. Whenever she is on screen, Johansson and the writing are great. We do primarily see her from Charlie's perspective, though, which obviously limits things. Luckily, this isn't enough of an issue to ruin the film by any means, and it's something that's more of a problem upon reflection rather than when actually watching it. Randy Newman's score is a little bit of a problem, too. While the music is in itself great, it is very similar to Newman's 'Toy Story 3' (2010) score, so whenever it plays it is simply reminiscent of that film rather than serving to enhance this one. That's a very minor issue, though, and likely something that won't affect most viewers. Overall, 'Marriage Story' is engaging throughout with a great screenplay and subtlety gripping performances. It's certainly one of the years' better films and it's a shame that most people will only be able to see it on the small screen. 7/10",7,1,8,7 December 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Rules over all other Batman movies!
","Throughout Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy,he has portrayed excellence but in this film he shows genius! It was cleverly thought out and the way it pieces together is fantastic.

It is still a breathtaking masterpiece though.The action gets you off of your seat and the story gets your mind rushing around.The main cast in this movie-Christian Bale,Tom Hardy,Anne Hathaway,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Marion Cotillard,Morgan Freeman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt- are all fantastic!

Black Panther," Highly entertaining and thematically rich; one of Marvel's best.
","The great characters, action and setting make 'Black Panther' an extremely enjoyable Marvel film and one of the MCU's best. The film is always entertaining, bolstered by an amazing score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson that really captures the essence of the flick, and the self-contained story feels refreshing as it's never concerned with setting up further films, only being good in its own right. While the plot is quite predictable, the writing ensures that the audience always care about the characters and are invested in the narrative, leading to one of the more engaging stories of the MCU. The film is also definitely an ensemble piece, and, as good as Chadwick Boseman is in the role of T'Challa, it sometimes feels like the eponymous 'Black Panther' is outshined by the outstanding characters that surround him. That's certainly not a bad thing though, as it means that every major character has their own moment to shine - including T'Challa himself, who gets several of the film's best moments. Although the CGI looks unfinished in some of the action scenes, risking a disconnect between the characters and the audience, the action is always enthralling - a stand out being the entire South Korea sequence - and this is in part due to how invested we are in the story and how much we care about the characters. Overall, 'Black Panther' is an always entertaining superhero flick, with fantastic characters and action, that ranks as one of the MCU's best to date. 8/10",8,0,1,17 July 2018
Iron Man," Despite there being 19 further entries, 'Iron Man' is still one of the best MCU efforts.
","With a career-defining performance by Robert Downey Jr. and an excellent character-driven story, 'Iron Man' is a first-rate superhero film that puts character development and plot over spectacle and visual effects (although that is good here, too). It also kickstarted the MCU in spectacular fashion, setting the ground-work for what was to come but also being great in its own right (something that 'cinematic universes' are forgetting to do now). It might not be the best film to come out of the MCU, but the fact that it is better than the majority of them is a real testament to its success. 8/10",8,0,0,12 July 2018
Thor: The Dark World," The worst film in the MCU.
","The sequel to what was the worst film in the MCU managed to achieve something: it stole that title from it's predecessor. Despite a hokey narration that sets up the plot, 'Thor: The Dark World' starts off promisingly with a good action sequence and re-introduction to Asgard, but it soon becomes clear that the film is aimless. Far too much time is spent with the uninteresting 'Earth characters', and the pacing is terrible. Even when the action finally begins, it's boring. Sure, the special effects look good, but we don't care about them because we don't care about the characters. On top of that, the film has what is probably the worst villain of the entire MCU and it has horrible cinematography. At least it has a better handle of tone than the first and the camera is held straight. Plus, it's watchable enough and stands on its own two wobbly legs without setting up further films. 5/10",5,1,4,12 July 2018
Green Book," Mortensen and Ali make it an entertaining watch, but the whole thing feels very outdated.
","There's some enjoyment to be had while watching 'Green Book', but everything from the story to the cinematography feels very early 2000s, and it's ultimately quite shallow in its messages. It focuses more on the core friendship than anything else, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Mortensen and Ali have great chemistry which really gives the film its entertainment value. Unfortunately, though, it takes a long while for the main conceit to really get going and this first portion of the flick is almost devoid of any real entertainment value. Luckily though, once things get on the road it becomes a fairly entertaining time and moves along briskly - although the skit-based comedy that makes up for most it (which, again, feels outdated in a picture like this) becomes quite tiresome. Overall, it's sufficiently entertaining throughout - thanks largely to Mortensen and Ali - and moves briskly enough. It's let down by its outdated filmmaking and narrative conceit, though, and by its lack of depth, too. 6/10",6,19,33,10 February 2019
Incredibles 2," It's extremely underwhelming and one of Pixar's worst efforts.
","Brad Bird often stated that he would only make a sequel to 'The Incredibles' (2004) if he could come up with a story that was just as good as, or better than, that of the original. Sorry Brad, but I don't think that using the exact same story again really counts. Seriously, 'Incredibles 2' has pretty much beat-for-beat the same plot as the original, only with worse dialogue, much worse characters, and far worse motivations for the villain. In the first ten minutes or so, the film completely goes back on the character arcs of the original and basically resets the story, so that the exact same plot can play out again. Instead of expanding on the original, it actually takes away from it which is very disappointing. That's a good word to sum 'Incredibles 2' up: disappointing. There wasn't a chance that this one would actually be better than the original, but the fact that it doesn't even come close, and that it's definitely one of Pixar's worst efforts, is actually rather surprising. The two plot-lines that we cut between during the film don't really blend together all that well, and therefore the film feels disjointed. Personally, I think that the best moments of the film are those that explore Bob's relationship with Jack-Jack, however these moments are underdeveloped and the exploration of Jack-Jack's powers begins to lack logic as the many powers that he gains start to become illogical with his supposed 'polymorph' power. However Jack-Jack does provide some of the film's best moments, especially a scene involving a raccoon. The voice-cast are fine, but there's nothing noteworthy in that department. The best pieces of music are taken straight from the first, and the new stuff that Michael Giachinno brings is underwhelming and forgettable. The action scenes are, for the most part, well done and deliver some sort of entertainment, however there's always the underlying sense that we've seen it all before. This film claims to be something different, that it is better than the recent bulk of similar superhero flicks, when in reality it is just that: a generic superhero film with hardly any real character development. It's a shame too since the first definitely wasn't a generic superhero film and it broke the genre stereotypes (despite being released years before the modern 'superhero craze'). The film just sort of ended too, without any real resolution or closure, and instead of leaving me excited and ready for more, the bombastic score (taken from the original) and the once cool 2D credit animations (taken from the original) left me feeling hollow. 'Incredibles 2' is an incredible disappointment, and actually tarnishes the legacy of the first. Sure, it's not terrible and it's entertaining enough for the majority of its runtime, but as a follow-up to one of the best animated films of all time, it's simply not good enough. 5/10",5,1,5,26 July 2018

","'Jurassic Park' is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's best film, and one of the best films of all time. Everything about this film is as close to perfect as it could be. All of the performances are top-notch, the score by John Williams is timeless, the CGI is phenomenal for its time, and the expert blend between that and the utterly breathtaking practical animatronic effects mean that the dinosaurs are as convincing today as they were in '93. On top of that the film is endlessly quotable, and in equal parts awe-inspiring, laugh-out-loud funny, genuinely tense, and a constantly entertaining thrill-ride. 'Jurassic Park' is without a doubt a true masterpiece and a pinnacle of film-making. 10/10",10,3,3,10 July 2018
