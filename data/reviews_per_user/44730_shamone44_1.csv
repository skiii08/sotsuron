Requiem for a Dream," Excellent!
","This film is excellent, I felt intense and could hear my heart beat right until the very end. The visuals where excellent and the story and character build was great. I personally felt Ellen Burstyn was so convincing as she became more and more addicted to her prescription diet pills you could feel every moment as she went deeper into a psychotic state from being so happy to being plain crazy! However on the other hand I was not as impressed with Jennifer Connelly in the film as I felt her character to seem a bit hazy she never really looked as though she was getting heavily addicted to the drugs and I felt during some periods of the film it seemed like she hadn't been on anything then all of a sudden she has to prostitute for drugs.. Felt confused by her character..Overall the film left a lasting impression which left me feeling rather scared afterwards! Really enjoy these types of films that make you feel things that may be uncommon in everyday life.",Null,2,3,31 January 2011
