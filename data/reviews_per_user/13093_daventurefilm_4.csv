Blade Runner 2049," A Modern Masterpiece that will (hopefully) have the same reputation as the original
","Having heard all the positive reviews and comments, I already had high hopes. It even managed to exceed those!!!K, the new Blade Runner, is what Harrison Ford was in the original. However stories from the first film find themselves playing a key role in the new one as the two interlink faultlessly.Ryan Gosling plays the character brilliantly. With such a diverse acting resume spanning from Comedies (Crazy, Stupid Love) to Action (Drive), There is no doubt about it he is a talented actor. Acting alongside Ford brings another big action to his growing A list blockbusters.Ford's talent is natural here, adapting into the character he played all those years ago and bringing it to modern day. An actor who doesn't show his age when he runs and gets beaten around!As for the supporting cast, K's love interest Jon (played by the beautiful Ana De Armas) bought an element of necessary romance to the film, carrying and helping our main protagonist along. Sylvia Hoeks, who plays the 'Replicant gone rogue' Luv, brings the majority of the films violence with her. Other stars including Robin Wright as the Lieutenant giving orders to K and Dave Bautista as Sapper providing a famous supporting cast.The visuals here are second to none! From the vast deserts of a 'post-apocalypse' Vegas to the futuristic neo-noir rendition of California, everything is built for purpose. Nothing comes across as a pointless fill in. Everywhere we go, we're pulled along every step of K's journey. When he is isolated, we as an audience feel isolated with him. When courageous, we are pushed to the edge of our seats. It really sets out to give the audience every emotion in the book and, in my mind, I almost found myself wanting to be part of that world (almost)!The score from Zimmer and Wallfisch juxtaposed incredibly here, just as it did for Dunkirk. However I feel that they have gone a level up here and to bring such emotion to individual notes pushes me to confess that it is the best score I've heard yet!OK, I know, lots of positives. No such thing as a perfect film (although this comes so damn close)! I have to admit I wasn't all convinced by Jared Leto's role. His character seemed cool and, as you'll notice, he has a pivotal role in the new era of Replicants. I just thought his character didn't have as significant a role in the film as it needed.I don't want to spoil the plot but so much is happening here that I'd rather you just watch it for yourself. Conclusions are made to questions from the original, however questions that are left felt intentional to bring audience to debate.To sum the whole lot up, it was an honour to spend 2 hours and 44 minutes in this amazing world created by all the cast members. Do I want a sequel? No. This is a film with a beginning, middle and end. Lets keep it that way. Dennis Villeneuve I applaud you for taking the brave step in making this film and pulling it off in such style!!!",9,12,26,10 October 2017
Kick-Ass," You Don't Need Super Powers To Create A Super Film
","Based on the Mark Miller comic book of the same title, British Director and Producer Matthew Vaughn brings his legendary filming talents (Stardust & Layer Cake) and sends all guns blazing in the extremely brutal and imprudent Kick-Ass. This is an action-adventure superhero movie with far-fetched but thrilling violence, extreme recklessness and a huge element of comedy.'With no power comes no responsibility', implied by the film's foremost protagonist Dave Lizewski (Johnson), a comic book enthusiast with an abnormal fetish for superheroes. His references to Bruce Wayne and Scott Pilgrim give the sense of realism and makes the comic geek trio seem like average college teens. His geeky ways slots him into Peter Parker resemblance, yet there are no spiders or no transformation of any kind. All it takes is a costly spandex purchase from eBay and automatically he becomes Kick Ass, a baton wielding ninja street hero with no heroic powers. His school girl crush Katy (Fonseca) is led to believe he is gay and due to his male stereotyped tunnel thoughts, he pretends the gay rumour is true. Though Dave walks around with a 'kick my ass' post-it on his forehead he can't help but hide within his alter ego and impress his girl. Aspects of Peter Parker still linger as he spends his spare time karate chopping the air (more appropriate than when he was jerking off to his teacher). It interprets clearly what real life is all about with unachievable dreams and violence on the streets 24/7. It also puts the audience into some familiar territory and gives an understandable plot with all of its post modern attributes.Hit Girl, played ruthlessly by rising star Chloe Moretz, kicks some serious ass as she somehow blends the powers of matrix gun handling with the homicidal mind of Jason Voorhees. In a 'true to life' film such as this, its hard to say she hasn't secretly been enhanced with some sort of turbocharged drug. For an 11 year old she sure knows her stuff, maybe a bit too much. Where a traditional girl her age would ask for a puppy on their birthday, she jokes about it and asks for a Filipino Balisong!Cage adds an unfamiliar role to his resume as the 'built up crime escapee' dad, classically going by the alias name Big Daddy, whose outfit is none similar to a spoofed adaptation of Batman and Night Owl. He spends the duration of the film hunting down the dangerous protagonist Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), the rich crime boss of New York City with an army of guns at his finger tips. His son Chris D'Amico (Mintz-Plasse) is far from his McLovin ground, but still just as great. Why hasn't anything like this been done before? Surely by now narratives are starting to repeat themselves, even with all this hype about Directors rebooting superhero films (Spiderman, Superman, even Daredevil). Working on a budget of $30m with no over exaggerated special effects, Vaughn hid himself from any distribution limits and independently funded the film. He had all intentions to dive into extreme boundaries and manages to avoid falling into the trap of trading expense for a trashy narrative. Instead he surrounds himself with college geeks, street thugs, crime bosses and aspiring hero's. Then throws in a ton of violence and a slightly altered superhero narrative, mixes it all together and turns it into a hybrid genre blockbuster. The sadistic violence may explain why Brad Pitt's name is in the credits testing out his talents for Producer.This, in my opinion, has been the best re-creation of a comic book he or anyone else could have possibly done. In two simple words this film is bloody and brilliant! Kick-Ass can so easily blend the funniest of comedy moments, similar to that of Superbad, with intense violence that can only remind you of watching a late night Tarantino film. It uses similar conventions to that of Sin City and Watchmen where not only is it set in New York - Superhero block, but it's broad cast and considerably low budget slots it as an Indie film, whilst putting itself a fair distance away from all the Iron Man gadgets. Vaughn shows he can clearly turn raw talent to stardom through the faces of Daniel Craig (Layer Cake), Mark Strong (the sadistic Septimous in Stardust). He's only had 3 seating in the Directing chair and from what we have seen so far, it's all masterpiece. With an X-Men prequel on the way and some new faces what's stopping the new cast from being the next Hugh Jackman or Halle Berry?!Kick-Ass is a risky attempt from Vaughn and his ideas won't satisfy everyone in the world. The film is beyond the violence we regularly see in a 15, not to mention Chloe's 'foul mouth' script, but it all adds up to a great, if not perfect film that focus primarily on fans of the 'Teen Comedy' genre (those who can't get enough of McLovin with a gun). Whilst it stays clear of any pastiche elements, Kick-Ass pulls on every possible string to place it beyond society's limits. Being a modern day game fan, I thought the POV scene of Hit Girls solo takeout scene backed up with the strobe-lighting effect was fantastic. I felt compelled to clap during the credits because I had become so hyped up. I haven't even mentioned the amazing score! Its sad to think this movie may never have been released due to its cruel nature. Stars have been found, new limits have been reached and Vaughn has realised you don't need super powers to create a super, super film. Outstanding!",9,7,12,4 May 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," Pick up this film, and start watching!
","Honestly one of the best films I've seen. Acting from Leo and Jonah is off the charts! Let Scorsese take you on a 3 hour roller coaster of emotions, but be warned...Yes there is profanity, sex and drugs, lots of it! I wouldn't recommend if you get offended by these. But for a film which teaches some of life's biggest lessons, for the incredible career highlight acting of both Leo and Jonah, for Margot Robbie (yes I'm a fan) and for the sheer joy of a stereotypical Scorsese film. I urge you to watch, and perhaps learn a thing or two, from The Wolf of Wall Street.I still can't stop humming that song, watch the film and you'll know the one I mean ;)",9,0,0,19 April 2020
Despicable Me," Sets a mark amongst the 'Animated Greats'
","Likable super villain Gru (Carell) aims to achieve the greatest crime of all time with the help of his elder associate Dr Nefario (Brand) and his yellow mini minions. Only trouble is that he has to deal with the movie's antagonist Vector (Segal) who is also the son of the obese bank manager, whom Gru needs to borrow money from in order to commit this crime. To do this he pretends to adopt three cookie selling orphan girls to get access into Vectors weapon coated house and steal the ultimate shrink ray weapon. But when the children are fooled into thinking that he has adopted them out of love, Gru has to choose between world conquer and parenthood.After a year of Pixar and DreamWorks going head to head and giving the audience two memorable films involving Toys and Dragon slaying, both with immense budgets, Directors Coffin and Renaud invite the audience, kids and adults alike, into an hour and a half of fun with every character taking their own persona's and fitting into real life situations alongside fictitious creatures (notably the minions). Working on a fraction of the budget, Despicable Me focuses on offering a robust script (thank you Ken Dario) to entice the kids to its well-constructed jokes and adults to its well- assembled character establishing.When we first see Gru causing destruction as 'Despicable Me' is bellowed in the background, his villainous ways, although characteristic, are made to be funny and Carell perfects the voice-over to create what I think is the most likable animated character of the year.The film distinctively fills itself with all kinds of gadgets, as Gru pollutes the air in his futuristic juggernaut tank with an attached rocket ship exhaust. His minions are always hard at work creating ultimate gadgets (something for the male audience to admire). His workaholic lifestyle explains his unloving persona and he has no friends other than his yellow aliens and Nafario, voiced unrecognisably by Brand.Everything changes once Gru adopts three orphans – the doubtful Margo, pink clothed tomboy Edith and baby Agnes with her mad love for unicorns and determination to be adorable. Aside from selling cookies, the orphans practise for their performance of Swan Lake (more Barbie and less Black Swan). As the countdown begins for Gru to undertake the ultimate crime, his days start to merge when the orphans begin to take over his life, including tea parties and kittens. During all these happenings, Vector plans world domination whilst stuffing popcorn and playing on a 'very futuristic' Wii.The yellow minions (don't worry I haven't forgotten about them) constantly remind me of the green aliens in Toy Story and sound like Bevis and Butt-Head stuffed with helium. Their language, although with very little English, is made easy to understand through their actions. Though the creatures were used primarily to promote the film, I couldn't help but think they were put in the background of the main storyline when so much work and fun had been put into creating their unique looks (one eye, fat, tall etc). The idea of a minion being snapped and turned into a glow stick was ingenious. As was the shopping scene where three minions unconvincingly disguised themselves as humans. From what I did see of them they were cute and funny throughout, especially the way they bobbed around as if they were taken from LittleBigPlanet.Though it lacks in being a first class CGI film, it makes up for it in the character development. The three girls offer a kind hearted aspect to the movie as a whole, especially the younger Agnes who got me laughing out loud with her childish jokes. As animations are renowned for the greatest 3D effects, I expected nothing different from this. However Despicable Me knew how to use them wisely, not in the sense of having something poke at you in your seat, but making you feel like the film surrounds you. It really felt as though the minions were floating around the cinema. The highlight moment of the film had to be riding on the roller coaster as it really felt as if the cinema was riding it too. I had to withdraw myself from saying anything rude as I was surrounded by little kids. Word of warning don't start sipping any drinks or snacking on some popcorn the moment Gru enters the carriage.I thought Vector could have been less 'cheesy couch potato' and more of a 'gadget building Emperor Zurg'. The good guys had plenty of laughs but Vector made the laughs fade. Like Carell, Segel is hilarious in his films but if you are going to make him a villain then you have to make him serious and not try to be funny. I also thought more could have been made out of Vector's dad (possibility for a sequel plot?)As a directorial debut for both Directors', this film gave both Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon some powerful punches and earned its Bafta nomination, though unfortunately just losing out to Toy Story. This is a movie that will really get both kids and adults in stitches and some sobs. It ticks all the boxes that a top animation film needs (likable characters – check, jokes that make you laugh – check, suitable for all the family – double check). Like other animations this one too has a powerful message undermining the cruel behaviour of Gru. Watch this film with open thoughts. I have picked out some negatives of the film, but don't get me wrong as I really enjoyed it. I may have given it 7/10 if I was a bit younger and did not seem out of place in the cinema. But a boosted smile was on everyone's face by the end, even if the credits dance is slightly cheesy.",8,0,2,4 May 2011
