Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," numbed despite 3D
","The ticket clerk offered me a free toy which I declined. I felt as embarrassed and idiotic as Jar Jar.I ordered a *small* coffee figuring I would need a boost to get through this; fortunately they gave me a somewhat gigantic one.I heard a couple of voices far behind me in the large theatre otherwise I was the only one there.The application of any stars here at all are for the hard working tech folks and the great orchestral players not to mention the long-suffering extras in the grandstand and so on.Did George Lucas actually write this script all by himself? At least he could have farmed out the comedy to someone, anyone. Shandling? Lewis? Larry David? How much did this film cost? Good Grief...The only enjoyable element of this film was John Williams' piece of string writing at the very end of the closing credits.Awright, I did my *duty* and saw the thing, yaaawwwnnnn......",3,5,10,15 February 2012
Star Trek," Exceeded Expectations
","Having suffered the post-Gene Trek franchise, I was prepared for the worst. So I have to give J.J. Abrams credit for washing the bitter taste of the Berman-era out of my psyche with this decent effort.I had only one major disappointment, and that was the music underscore.The composers for TOS were adept writers, steeped in Stravinsky and Prokofiev. TNG was fine until they made the boneheaded move of firing Ron Jones, a Ravel aficionado. And James Horner did fine work in the early movies.With this new movie, it sounds like Abrams has hired a video game composer with severely limited abilities. All I could do was try to ignore this underscore and focus on all other elements of the film.I hope they pay more attention to this issue in the sequel.There were a few elements that didn't quite work for me, one being the dialect of Nero which sounds obviously American. The first Romulan we ever saw in TOS was Mark Lenard, and his dialect seemed credible. This wrong accent for Nero causes one to see an actor at work, instead of a believable character.On the subject of casting, I realize this was the most difficult challenge of all, and I think they did very well re: Kirk-Spock-McCoy-Uhura. Sulu-Chekov-Scotty-Pike-Sarek were not as convincing.One element that makes me feel trepidation about the upcoming sequel is the angle of the timeline alteration. Will Abrams use this as an excuse to destroy Gene's beautiful vision and revert to the destructive negativity so characteristic of the Berman era ?? Wiping out Vulcan was a pretty extreme plot angle. Also, I felt the torture scene was a bit much for a film kids will see, especially in an era where a recent Vice-President of the USA champions waterboarding.If, in this upcoming sequel, Abrams chooses to steer the ship off course a la Berman, that will be it for me and I will stick to the beautifully buffed TOS-DVD release.update MAY 2013 re: STII: re: *Will Abrams use this as an excuse to destroy Gene's beautiful vision and revert to the destructive negativity so characteristic of the Berman era ??* In reading IMDb reviewers' posts now, I get the impression that JJA has indeed gone off-course in this way but I will have to try to summon the courage to get to the theatre to see indeed if we are now burdened by yet another ST-producer who just doesn't *get it*",8,1,3,3 January 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Frighteningly and prophetically relevant for this moment in USA history!
","This has always been one of my all-time favorites.  Kubrick's nightmare is on the verge of coming true as we have a couple of 'General Ripper's' in the form of Cheney and Rumsfeld, who seem intent on wielding absolute power despite a complete lack of psychological self-knowledge.  At least Peter Seller's President 'had a brain'.  Not so in our current Oz.  If you are heading to your bomb shelter in the upcoming weeks, make sure to take along this classic!",Null,0,0,30 March 2003
The Bodyguard," memorable performance by Whitney
","What a sad day today (11 FEB 2012).The Bodyguard will not go down in cinematic history as an unforgettable film, but Whitney's acting performance was just that indeed and quite compelling.After seeing this movie when it came out two decades ago now, I was really hoping she would shift career gears just a little bit in order to more cultivate these acting talents.It's hardly believable that such a great talent has departed at such a young age.R.I.P.

Hugo," Boring
","This was my first digital 3D and the snowflakes-in-your-face are very impressive; I can see now where it will be a challenge to go back to 2D.The next pleasure was to simply look at this representation of Paris in the 1930s in this format.So far so good. And then the underscore music by Howard Shore, and I knew I was in for a rough ride because he chose to imitate Philip Glass and this left me somewhat nauseous for the remainder of the film.Why did he go that route? Because of the tic-toc-clockery theme? If so, either he or Martin forgot that clocks are inherently sleep-inducing. Combine this with the slow pacing, and after an hour I realized I was hopelessly bored.The only cheer at this point was a credible effort by young actress Chloë and then the storyline veered off to a film-business homage.With all due respect to Georges Méliès, I was really not at all prepared to spend an afternoon at film school. I would be happy to do that at another time when in the mood.If that is your bag, then this film is a must-see.Otherwise, there must be something else out there much better...",4,11,23,28 December 2011
Prometheus," Needs to flesh-out characters
","I can't say I enjoyed this film with the main reason being the issue of character development, or more accurately the lack thereof.The priority was to tell the basic story, OK, which answered questions re: Alien.But an opportunity was missed. The film could have been 'humanized' (so to speak) with more emphasis on the personal relationship of the scientist-duo protagonists.An opening scene could have had them at home attempting to conceive to the sounds of Chopin, and to get the time, edit out the unnecessary scientist-security guy lunchroom bit. (And that would have given the credits-music a pay-off.) The characters are trotted out and portrayed one-dimensionally so who cares about them? Therefore the movie has no 'grip'.Not that some of them don't have a degree of credibility: the trillionaire CEO isn't exactly the brightest fellow but this is not surprising as he has wasted his life focused on money-making so his fate fits. But the lack of storyline redemption for some of the others further adds to a sense of coldness-who cares about this project.One of the shoot-em-up scenes is simply an irrational butcher shop.3D would have helped at least in the visuality, which was OK, but the film needs anything in the way of elements to try to fill this void of characterization. With Creature of the Black Lagoon as the roots of 3D and with our greenies sliming about in the soup why not set it up for the glasses? If you are an Alien devotee then you will likely make the effort to get out of the house to the theater to see this one, but for anyone else I don't see the point of doing so.",5,13,19,4 July 2012
