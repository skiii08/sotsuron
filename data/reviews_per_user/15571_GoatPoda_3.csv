Requiem for a Dream," Addiction hurts
","The problem that anti-drug films face is the difficult balance between sensationalizing their subject and ethically engaging the audience. This was a beautiful horror film, but the characters didn't engage me. I knew that doom awaited all them, and I wanted them to find a way out, but I didn't really care. The visuals were shocking and provocative. A husband and wife sitting behind us left when they showed the arm. But they wouldn't have left if they had cared what happened. I understand that Aronofsky is showing the inevitable emptiness that results from long term drug addiction, but why make a movie that's only purpose is to show that drugs are bad? The first half of the film was much more playful, with the charcters imaginings, with Sara's hope of making it on TV, but as soon as I knew there was no hope, that nothing new and creative was going to happen, I lost interest. It creates martyrs out of its characters, which coupled with Jared Leto, Marlon Wayons, and Jennifer Connelly's aesthetic beauty - sensationalizes drug use. My friends left the theater saying, 'That was a great movie...' and we walked into the bar across the street, and no one really had much to say about it other than it was really cool how the pupil dilated.",6,0,1,7 December 2000
Life Is Beautiful," There are two kinds of laughter: Honesty and Ignorance.
","Life is beautiful, but man is not. I felt strange as I left the theater for this movie, I was impressed by the imagination that poignantly proved that love and the human spirit could conquer all, even during the worst of times. The trouble was that the worst of times was the Holocaust in an Italian concentration camp, and I kept thinking - this is terrible! As time goes on and the Holocaust becomes a thing of history, and as less survivors are alive to remember the travesty that mankind let occur, Benigni is being praised for making a film that DOES trivialize some very serious subject matter. History that is only half a century old. I think the film itself is a noble and creative effort, much like the characters in the film, but the cartoonish depiction of genocide and desperation did not sit well with me. The audience I was with laughed and cried on cue. They were manipulated. Just like the Nazi's were manipulated in Germany. I'm sure Benigni's intentions were noble, but noble intentions don't merit unconditional praise and Academy Awards. Maybe we should feel good for the child that was saved form the horror of his situation, and then maybe we should pity him for his ignorance. I'm not so sure, but I'm not laughing and crying on cue. I didn't hate this film, but I don't understand how one could love it.",1,52,127,2 February 1999
Stranger Than Fiction," Drearier Than Reality
","I found myself staring at the screen in 'Stranger Than Fiction' and waiting for something imaginative to happen. And it never did. I found myself daydreaming about how hysterical the outtakes must have been between such strong performers as Ferrell, Hoffman, Latifah, Thompson, and Gyllenthaal. But I sensed no magic. Now there are those who have praised this film as a mind bending experience akin to 'The Truman Show', or 'Adaptation'. Whatever. Those were films that delighted their audience while challenging concepts of movie watching. It is not too smart, come on. Did the bakery anarchist need to drop out of HARVARD LAW SCHOOL for us to respect her? Amateurish. And Director Marc Forster paints his images in sepia dreary browns and rainy days. The professor MUST be a PROFESSOR because he drinks lots of coffee and has lots of books. The writer must be a WRITER because she chain smokes and thinks of DEATH. And poor Queen Latifah must have been standing around holding her umbrella wondering how she got in this boring movie in role that has her playing a modernized mammy. I blame a wasted two hours of my Saturday night on Marc Forster who did great work in the past, but here strived for something that didn't happen. Who hires Will Ferrell, puts min in a surreal comedy and asks him to act dull and boring the entire time? I hope others don't go see this film looking for a Will Ferrell comedy in a Charlie Kaufman script because they will be sadly disappointed.",1,45,94,12 November 2006
