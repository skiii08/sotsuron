The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Very good
","I went into watching 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' without reading the book 1st so I didn't know what sort of story to expect. The rating of the film was high but I was still a bit skeptical as to whether I would actually enjoy this, I'm glad to say I did like this film. The story is well written and the acting is very impressive. Logan Lerman as Charlie was the main character, he had some problems and he played his role very well, he seemed like a completely believable character who you really feel for. The rest of the cast were also good, especially Emma Watson. Having seen a lot of her in the Harry Potter movies, this was the 1st time I've seen her in anything else. She made the change with ease and her American accent was believable I thought, she really did show just how good of an actress she is. It has a serious side to it and some of the flashbacks are a little uncomfortable to watch. The way the friendships are developing is realistic and quite heartwarming. You really feel attached to the characters and maybe can relate a little to them, they are all extremely likable in their own way. I also liked the soundtrack for the film. Overall it's a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone who wants a good drama. 8/10.",8,7,11,18 September 2013
It," It
","First of all, I am yet to read the book or see the original from 1990 with Tim Curry as Pennywise (I hope to put this right on both fronts asap) so when seeing the 2017 version, I had nothing to compare it to and no idea of how the story should be going. I went to see 'It' on opening night at the cinema and it was one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. For a start it was actually more than half full and there was a certain buzz in the air, a really great atmosphere.I will say that I personally expected it to be scarier but I suppose if your fears are clowns then this will probably be terrifying, Bill Skarsgård gives a menacing performance as Pennywise. He changes his voice at times so one moment he can be hilarious and seem almost innocent and then the next moment he will have a real menacing look to strike fear in to the audience. The costume/make up that went in to this is spot on. Although not as scary as expected I can still see why some would find this terrifying, although some moments did make me jumpy slightly, I found that the film in general was just creepy due to the excellent atmosphere created. The film got the mix of horror and comedy spot on, there were a lot of people in the audience laughing out loud and then gasping the next minute.There have been a lot of comparisons to Stranger Things as well as classic films like Stand By Me & The Goonies. It is a horror film but it gave me equal enjoyment watching it for the comedy/coming of age aspect. I thought there might have been some sort of back story about Pennywise as well as more from the kid's parents/locals of the town etc but I think maybe that might be taking the film a bit too seriously. Unless this is explored in more detail in the sequel, like I said I'm yet to read the book so I am a bit unsure. I think the casting was spot on, I can't praise Bill Skarsgård's performance highly enough (hopefully he will win some awards) and then the chemistry between the Loser's Club is terrific. All of them gave great performances and provided plenty of laughs but I have to praise Finn Wolfhard (Richie) who had some excellent one liners.Overall an excellent film, probably my favourite film of 2017 (so far anyway) and I can't wait for the sequel.",9,6,13,13 September 2017
Fight Club," #10 in the IMDb top 250.....really?
","Having just watched this film, I honestly can't believe it is ranked in the top 250....let alone in the top 10! Don't get me wrong this film was good but I just can't see why it is rated so highly. If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system.After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best.I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me.7/10.",8,11,28,15 August 2013
World War Z," Good but had more potential
","'World War Z' was a film that I enjoyed but feel it had potential to be something great. It does involve a lot of zombies but I would class this as more of a disaster movie. The zombie were mainly seen in hordes going up buildings and over walls, rather than up close and personal. There wasn't much blood either.The film was shot incredibly well and looked very realistic, the scene on the plane was probably the most impressive and the scene I enjoyed the most. The atmosphere is dark and the tension builds up nicely. The action scenes are very fast paced when we get them as well. Some of the scenes are actually breathtaking and just crazy.The acting is solid all round and we do feel for Brad Pitt's character because we found out a bit about him at the start of the film, and we know he is doing it for his family first and foremost.The way it ended was a bit unsatisfying and I feel the plot was a bit rushed in places. It is a solid action flick but some parts may drag a little.I would recommend it though, it was enjoyable, well filmed, acted well, had tension and atmosphere, good action. But there was just that little something missing, I can't quite grasp what but it definitely had potential to be more than it was.7/10.",7,2,4,11 October 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," fresh & clever comedy
","Romantic comedies aren't usually my kind of thing but I thought this film was great. The cast is strong (Gosling, Stone, Carell) which is the main reason I chose to watch this film. It is quite a long film but the plot is really clever. There is plenty of different things going on in the film and the way it all gets linked together is brilliant and certainly something I did't see coming.There are some genuine laugh out loud moments and the film is straight to the point. The cast is great and all work together well, the plot is fresh and clever and it really was one of the best romantic comedies I have seen (haven't seen many but still) - Would recommend this film to anyone. 8/10",8,11,13,3 August 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins: Wolverine - a good addition to series
","I am a big fan of the original trilogy of X-Men films. Wolverine is my favourite character so I was really looking forward to watching this. I think the idea to learn more about his early life was a good idea. There was plenty of good over the top action and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is superb as usual but the story just wasn't as interesting as it could have been. It was just the kind of film where after 20 minutes it became very predictable. Overall I would still recommend this film, whether you have seen the original trilogy or not it should be quite easy to follow. It was decent viewing, a good addition to the series but not as good as the others. 7/10",7,6,9,27 July 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Boring & confusing
","'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' was a film that I really wanted to like but I just didn't get it.It was just boring, nothing was happening. It was unnecessarily slow with so much talking. There was so many scenes going back and forth in time were it just confuses you. It was really painful to watch, I just couldn't sit there and watch it until the end. It was just simply too long and really hard to get in to.I only really watched it because the cast was so strong (they all done a good job) but it just wasn't for me unfortunately. Really confusing and just a bore. Maybe it would have made more sense if I'd realised before that there was also books to do with this film.2/10 - The acting was good.",2,8,14,9 September 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Just brilliant! Cap will blow you away.
","Wow, this film absolutely blew me away. The plot is good and the action scenes are just breathtaking. It is basically 2 hours of non stop action. Fighting, flying, explosions, shooting, it has everything.Chris Evans is just great as Captain America. The costumes look brilliant every single fight scene had me on the edge of my seat. Captain America pretty much destroys everyone who stands in his path. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is absolutely incredible as well, she needs her own movie! I can't recommend this highly enough. I think even those who are not fans of this genre may like it purely for the action. I'm a huge fan of Marvel movies and this is definitely one of the best ones.Without giving too much away, just go and watch it and be prepared to be blown away. Literally.9.5/10",10,6,11,31 July 2014
Full Metal Jacket," A film of two halves
","'Full Metal Jacket' was a film that I had been meaning to watch for a while after all the good stuff I had heard about it.It really is a film of two halves, unfortunately I didn't like the 2nd half.The 1st half at boot camp was excellent, we saw a lot of character development and emotion as well as a lot of humour and really serious issues. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio were just brilliant.The 2nd half I didn't enjoy as much, it looked great and there was a lot of action but it was just a bit boring and felt really dragged out, whereas the 1st part just had everything that you wanted.Glad I got round to seeing it but wouldn't watch it again, slightly disappointed after a really good start to the film.6/10.",6,132,165,9 September 2013
Gone Baby Gone," A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck
","'Gone Baby Gone' is a fantastic film. It is the sort of film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, thinking to yourself what the outcome will be. There's plenty of scenarios that went through my head as the film progressed. There is plenty of twists and turns and the flashbacks link the film together well to fully explain what has happened.When I started watching, all I knew was roughly what the plot was. I didn't expect it to be so complex and thrilling with so much more going on that just an investigation. It really will keep you guessing.I haven't read the book so I don't know if some cast members aren't a true representation of their character. But I can say I thought they all done a great job at making this film believable. I thought Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan were superb in the lead roles. Morgan Freeman was as good as ever, he wasn't in it much but by the end you will see he plays a key role in the story. Amy Ryan who played the missing child's mother was also superb as well as all of the supporting cast.It's a tension building story that I can't recommend highly enough. I really enjoyed it. Cleverly made, well acted, good action and great suspense. A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck. I am now looking forward to seeing 'The Town' and 'Argo' for the first time.9/10.",9,2,4,16 October 2013
Léon: The Professional," Excellent film. Natalie Portman is superb.
","'Léon' is a classic.The plot is gripping and dramatic, keeps you on edge.It starts off with the brutal killings of Mathilda's family but she isn't there at the time so avoids it. She comes back while the bad guys are still there and knocks on Léon's door hoping for help. This scene could have been so simple with the door just opening, but I loved how emotional this bit was. This is where I really started to feel for the characters as we saw through the spy hole tears running down Natalie Portman's face. This is where the film really starts as the two plot revenge together. The character development in this one is just great. The action scenes are just fantastic and so fast paced. The acting is excellent (How Natalie Portman didn't win any awards for her role as Mathilda I don't know).It's hard to go into more details without potentially spoiling this one, just be sure to watch it. You won't be disappointed. If you like a film with good character development, fast paced action and a film that grabs your complete attention, this is for you.10/10.",9,10,12,16 October 2013
Oblivion," Visually amazing, very enjoyable.
","'Oblivion' was a film that kept me gripped from the 1st minute. The set is just visually amazing, everything about it is stunning. The way the Earth looks, the vehicles, the bubble ship (where Jack lives) all just looked brilliant. The special effects were amazing too. I really am struggling for words to describe just how good it did look.The cast all done a great job, Tom Cruise was pretty much perfect in the lead role and then there was Morgan Freeman, who I wish could have had more screen time. Then there was two lesser known actresses, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko who both gave very good and believable performances.I thought the plot was good and as I said before, it got your attention right from the start. The action scenes were breathtaking and extremely fast paced when they happened. Some have said that they felt the film was too long, I personally felt it was the right length because it enabled the characters to develop. It was a little bit predictable at times and did get a bit confusing when there was a twist, although it all made more sense in the end.Overall, this was a very enjoyable film that is just simply stunning on the eye.8/10.",8,15,21,28 August 2013
American Beauty," Brilliant drama
","American Beauty is a brilliant drama, so powerful and moving. Having read roughly what the film was about before I started watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by how multi dimensional it turned out to be. There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lines were interesting in their own way. The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just a brilliant drama. It also has its comedy moments which help the film to flow. The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and made it seem so real, especially Kevin Spacey. Wes Bentley is also deserving of a mention for his portrayal of the very mysterious neighbour. The way it ended won't be to everyone's taste but for me it makes it more memorable. Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend and I would certainly watch again. Top marks from me, one of the best dramas I've seen. 10/10.",10,4,7,18 August 2013
Warrior," Such a powerful movie
","I will start off by saying that I am by no means a fan of MMA or any fighting sport for that matter but this film is outstanding, its about so much more than just fighting. This is about disjointed family who have not seen each other for years, they all have past or present problems that they need to put behind them and to forgive each other and move on.We see a lot of character development in the first hour or so which allows us to root for them as we get to the fighting stage, we know how much it means to them and therefore we care. It really is such an emotional ride.Excellent acting throughout especially from Tom Hardy who is absolutely incredible. My only fault with the film is that I would have liked an extra 5/10 minutes at the end of the film to see what happened to the characters after the final fight. But overall and excellent film.9/10.",9,4,7,19 December 2014
We're the Millers," Hilarious comedy with a great cast
","'We're the Millers' was a really enjoyable comedy which was full of laughs from start to finish. I had only seen the trailer once or twice and it didn't really catch my eye but I went for it anyway and I was pleasantly surprised at how much it made me laugh. It was 1 hour and 40 minutes but that time just went so quickly.The plot was great and straight to the point. David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) creates a family as a disguise to help him pull off a huge drug smuggle. He finds a 'wife' (Jennifer Aniston) who is desperate for money, a 'daughter' (Emma Roberts) who is supposedly homeless, and a 'son' (Will Poulter) who is just an idiot who lives next door and is home alone with nothing better to do. The chemistry between these four characters really bought the film to life and they really did provide you with lots of laughs as the fake family, where it was all destined to go wrong but they got there in the end after some extremely awkward situations. Jason Sudeikis was brilliant in the lead role and Jennifer Aniston (a stripper, :P) was almost as raunchy as she was in 2011 comedy, Horrible Bosses. But for me the star of the show was English actor Will Poulter, he was the one who gave me the most laughs and I think this will be seen as his 'break through'. He just really suited the role of the awkward teenage boy; his facial expressions were just brilliant. The supporting cast was also good and added even more comedy value, especially the Fitzgerald family who were just always in the way while 'The Millers' were trying to get back home. Then there was Scottie P who had a funny catchphrase. The characters were all extremely likable and 'The Millers' really did end up like a real family in the end which was quite heartwarming.The jokes are crude, some parts are stupid and far fetched but this is a comedy and its meant to make you laugh, which it really does. I say sit back and enjoy this comedy for what it is and just have a laugh and enjoy yourself at their expense. I think this will achieve quite a high average rating on IMDb and for me it is one of the best comedies of the year (I rated it just over The Heat, which I gave an 8). I would highly recommend this to anyone. This is a good solid comedy so well done to all the writers and to the cast for executing this to perfection. I would definitely watch this one again and will be buying the DVD when it is released.Also, be sure to stay to see the gag reel in the credits, there is a scene which references to Jennifer Aniston's time in FRIENDS. This was really funny and showed just how much fun the cast had filming this.9/10.",8,8,18,23 August 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Very good comedy
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is a good comedy which has its fair share of laugh out loud moments. The story is simple but effective and Steve Carell plays the role of Andy perfectly. He really is a versatile actor. The supporting cast around him were also good and added a lot of comedy of their own.Again, this is a comedy and if it makes you laugh then its done well. Who cares if the jokes are vulgar or silly? Just enjoy it for what it is. Well done to Steve Carell for writing and starring in this comedy, I watched the 'XXL Version' which had '17 extra mins of never-seen-before pleasure' and it was one of the better comedies I have seen. Would recommend it if you want a good, cheap laugh.8/10.",8,6,9,19 August 2013
The Machinist," Good thriller that gets you thinking
","This was a good film that really gets you to think. The plot is good and is straight to the point, it is one of them films where you are really confused while watching it but it makes much more sense at the end. The suspense and atmosphere really builds up and keeps you gripped.Christian Bale was absolutely incredible in this film, he played the role of Trevor Reznik perfectly. The amount of weight he lost in order to do this film was just unbelievable, such a commitment to the cause.Overall this was a good film, not quite on par with Memento (as its being compared to this) but still enjoyable in its own way. A very clever film. Definitely worth a one time watch at least.7/10",7,3,4,12 August 2013
Ocean's Eleven," Excellent heist film
","I can't believe I waited over 10 years to finally watch Ocean's Eleven. Danny Ocean brings together a team of 11 to pull off the biggest heist in history.Featuring an all star cast; George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and so on, this is one great film. The film is easy to follow and straight to the point.Everything about the film for me is done so right. The story develops at a nice pace and is executed to perfection with plenty of twists & turns. It's very sleek and stylish, it had me laughing and also wondering what could possibly happen next.Massively entertaining. Highly recommended.",9,3,5,27 July 2015
District 9," Looked great but a bit boring
","District 9 is a film that is shot incredibly well and it does look amazing. The action towards the end is quite good but on the whole it was just a bit boring. I thought the film was supposed to be full of violence and gore? Well the blood from the 'prawns' just didn't look realistic at all. The human characters weren't that great but I really liked Christoper and the baby prawn.The plot was solid and the potential was there. I just think it could've been executed better. It was shot a bit 'documentary style' which I didn't really like and the camera seemed shaky. The film did get better when it got into the main story but I feel it could've been so much more, I wanted more action. The story did seem a bit mixed up as well. It was one of them films that I wanted to love, but it just didn't hit the spot for me. Overall it was quite a disappointment, although it did look amazing. It isn't something I would watch again but I can appreciate why others rate it so highly. 5/10.",4,3,5,24 August 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," A wonderful animated film
","I have only just got round to seeing 'Wreck-It Ralph' and I can safely say it is a film I will be watching again! It was such a great film, it is enjoyable for the whole family and is definitely one of the best animated films I have seen.The characters are all lovable in their own way and voiced very well. There is some good laughs along the way too which is good. I really loved the plot and how it was done, it was so clever. The animation all looked great, the soundtrack was great, the colours were wonderful and all the characters looked brilliant. It was really cool to see little cameos from characters from real life video games such as Pac-Man, Sonic and Bowser. This film should be enjoyable for everyone but avid gamers in particular will be able to relate to it more.Ralph is just a brilliant character who is known as a bad guy in his game 'Fix-it Felix', where Felix takes all the credit. Ralph just wants to be loved so he sets out to become a hero. All he has to do is sneak out of his game and into another to win a medal, it sounds simple but of course there is so much depth and meaning to it. He ultimately ends up causing a lot of trouble but with the help of his friends they manage to save the day. As is often the case with an animated film, there is plenty of heartwarming moments. I would highly recommend this film to anyone. I personally can't wait for a sequel now, there is so much potential to do more with this franchise. Brilliant.9/10.",9,5,6,26 August 2013
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Did I watch something different to everyone else?
","I have just seen this film and it feels like I've watched something completely different to everyone else. It isn't even that funny, some moments will make you smile to yourself but I didn't find myself laughing out loud at all.The plot for this film did sound like a good idea but it was poorly executed. The film is predictable and just pretty stupid in general. The way some of the people die is mildly amusing due to the fact that it is so over the top to be scary despite all the blood, but again it is predictable. It was obvious which is why I didn't find it that funny, there was no surprise factor.The cast blew hot and cold for me. Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) both done a very good job. They were likable characters, especially Dale, and the silly conversations they had together were probably the scenes I enjoyed the most. Katrina Bowden also adds some charm but the rest of the cast were pretty dull.Overall I was disappointed, it may be worth a one time watch but to call it 'one of the funniest movies ever' is well over the top. Very few laughs and predictable all the way through. Wouldn't recommend.5/10.Watched the trailer again, all the best bits are in there. Just watch that, it's better than the actual film.",5,10,32,7 October 2013
Gone Girl," Every bit as good as the book
","Gone Girl is one of the best books I have read for a long time. It's a completely engrossing story that is incredibly dark and twisted. The film is every bit as good and exactly as I envisaged everything when reading. The film is an edge of the seat, nerve shredding thriller that really gets the viewer thinking. Even though I knew what was going to happen it still had my heart racing. The style, pacing and direction is spot on from David Fincher and the cast are all fantastic. Ben Affleck and of course Rosamund Pike will get a lot of praise (much deserved) but I also enjoyed Carrie Coon's performance as Go. This film is just incredible storytelling about a really twisted subject. It's a straight up 10/10 for me and goes in to my top 3 for 2014. My only criticism is that I wish the ending could've been slightly different but at least it stayed true to the book (bar a couple of minor things). Highly recommended.",10,3,10,20 December 2014
Good Will Hunting," One of the best films of all time
","Released in 1997, I finally had my first viewing of Good Will Hunting this week. It's the best film I've seen in ages.Featuring a great cast consisting of the late great Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Stellan Skarsgård and the Affleck brothers. Good Will Hunting was a simple film that offered a lot. It had a bit of everything, some very nice relationships amongst characters which was great drama and at times extremely funny. The film flows at a good pace which kept me interested all the way through, the story was intriguing as I really related to the characters well.There were plenty of good laughs throughout the film as well as some truly memorable scenes packed with emotional punch, mostly from the meetings between Sean & Will, the way their relationship developed was full of heart. My favourite scene has to be the 'farting wife' scene, absolutely hilarious and made even better when I found out after that it was improvised, Robin was so funny that even the director was laughing, making the camera shake during that particular scene.Overall a truly memorable film that I certainly hope to watch again & again. Highly recommended.'If you ever disrespect my wife again I will end you. I will *beep* end you. You got that, chief?' - Such a memorable scene/quote. Brilliant.10/10.",10,7,13,16 February 2015
Room," Room
","Room is a simple story that will hit you hard. Brie Larson plays a young woman (Ma) who was abducted and has been held captive in 'Room' for 7 years, where she has subsequently given birth to her son Jack. Jack has never been out of Room and knows nothing else. We see how they cope in day to day life in Room, as the captor brings them basic rations every day. Throughout the film it is left to our imagination as to where exactly they are and what is the reason why. Jack believes that the outside world is non existent and anything he sees on TV is not real. Jack is key to their escape so Ma has to explain the situation very carefully to him in order for him to grasp that the outside world is indeed real. The pacing of the film is very good, we pretty much have two halves: the first half starts straight away with the pair in Room, we see them go through many different emotions in their fight for survival. Then they plan the escape (which if you have seen any trailer for the film you will know that they eventually escape anyway so it's not a spoiler). The second half of the film is about both of them adjusting to the outside world. Ma going back to family life and facing struggles as her father can't even look at Jack. Thankfully her mum and mum's boyfriend are much more supportive and really help Jack along the way. The acting is terrific throughout the film which gave it a lot of realism. I do wish that the film had perhaps been a bit more detailed, we could've had another 20-30 minutes which could've explained briefly how the captor took Ma, what exactly happened to him at the end and how he was caught, a few bits of news/interviews detailing the fact that she was missing, search parties for her, was anyone ever suspicious of him etc. And also a bit more of Ma and Jack as he was younger just to get a sense of even more struggle they went through and then perhaps a little segment at the end of him growing up in the world. All in all though it is certainly my favourite film of the Oscar nominees for best picture this year. 9/10 and highly recommended to all.",9,7,15,22 February 2016
22 Jump Street," Great sequel with some truly memorable scenes
","2014 has been a good year for sequels (Inbetweeners 2, Rio 2, Captain America) and 22 Jump Street is another for that list. This is certainly as good as 21 Jump Street, possibly slightly better.It was non stop laughter all the way through with some truly memorable scenes. Two of my favourite scenes were when Captain Dickson found out what Schmidt had done to his daughter and also the grenade and say 'something cool'. That being said I felt all the jokes in the film were executed to perfection. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have a great on screen chemistry which make the jokes even funnier. I just couldn't stop laughing at times.The storyline to this film was very similar but still very enjoyable with some new characters thrown in for good measure. Be sure to stay for the end credits where we see some crazy suggestions for more sequels as well as a funny cameo from Seth Rogen.Without giving too much away, if you loved the 1st one then you'll love this. 9/10.",9,6,14,28 September 2014
Gran Torino," A brilliant film
","'Gran Torino' is an excellent film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. Clint plays Walt Kowalski who is a disgruntled Korean War veteran. This film is shot incredibly well and as the viewer, I was gripped from the first to the last minute.The film delivers all sorts of emotions, some scenes are truly memorable. I found myself laughing at some of the things Clint was doing, just the way he played Walt was brilliant and completely believable. Then there was the character development side which was really nice. The ending in particular may make you well up a little.Once I finished watching it, I found that it stuck in my mind for a while. When thinking of it, I realised that there wasn't actually a lot of stuff happening but the story is just so gripping and memorable. It is just a fantastic drama and a film I would certainly recommend and watch again.9/10.",9,3,5,28 October 2013
Big Hero 6," Excellent animated film
","Just seen Big Hero 6 and really enjoyed it, another terrific animated film by Disney. I thought it was every bit as good as Wreck-It Ralph.The film is somewhat a film of two halves, at the start it is all about the characters and it is absolutely hilarious in parts too. The second part of the film went a different direction as we saw a lot of action, which I wasn't expecting. But it was still good.The animation is superb as usual and the voice cast are very good. I liked most of the characters in the film but Baymax is truly memorable, Baymax provided so many funny moments and in general is just a very lovable character.A film that is a good mix of everything, sweet relationships between characters, very funny, cool gadgets, great action scenes and some amazing visuals. Just a really fun film to watch for all ages.9/10.",9,42,65,4 February 2015
Jurassic World," A blast from start to finish
","Jurassic World was a blast from start to finish and greatly exceeded my expectations. I haven't seen the original trilogy for over 10 years so couldn't remember much about them, therefore they was not in my mind when watching the new version. I enjoyed Jurassic World so much that I am now going to make it a high priority of mine to go back and watch the original.The new theme park looks amazing, in fact everything about the film is visually stunning. The story is straight to the point and doesn't overcompensate where it doesn't need to, there is two kids going to the theme park, their auntie is in charge and Owen (Chris Pratt) is basically a dinosaur trainer. The kids go off on their own (that car ball vehicle thing was super cool by the way) and then of course dinosaurs get out of hand and run loose causing mayhem across the park.The action scenes were breathtaking and go on for a good chunk of the film. I wanted entertainment and I definitely got it. Everything about the film was just thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. There was even a few scenes that made me laugh out loud. I really liked each character in the film and the 120 minute run time flew by.Without saying too much, Jurassic World is my #1 film of 2015 so far and my favourite of the Jurassic Park franchise. I highly recommend it.",9,9,30,16 July 2015
Taken," Great film!
","I hadn't heard much about this film but it was on TV one day and I decided to watch it. I have now seen this film about 5 times and it is one of my favourites.It is full of non-stop action, shooting, fighting, car chases, you name it, this film has it. A 90 minute thrill ride. So gripping, leaving you speechless at how good the action on screen is.Liam Neeson is brilliant, he was born to play the role of Bryan Mills and he executed his role to perfection. Maggie Grace as his daughter was also good. The plot was fairly simple and a little bit predictable but the action was just amazing. Bryan Mills went to extreme measures to get his daughter back, you just knew he would do it, no matter how long it took and no matter how many risks he had to take. It was exhilarating, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.It was a short lived film but I think that made it better, it just hit the spot perfectly. It was breathtaking. I could watch this film any time and it would still be great. I would highly recommend it to anyone.We're also left with one of the greatest quotes from a film - Bryan Mills 'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.' to which the villain replies down the phone 'Good luck.' - This is so memorable and really sets the film up for a thrilling ride.Overall, one of the best films I have ever seen. 10/10.",10,14,19,5 August 2013
Frank," Funny to start but becomes very tedious
","Frank is certainly a film that I thought had a lot of good and bad points. The story is unique and Frank is a very mysterious character. Most of the film takes place in a nice remote setting which adds a great atmosphere.The acting throughout from all the cast is of a very good standard. Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic and executed the jokes to perfection. I particularly enjoyed when we heard his thoughts/updates out loud, there were very funny at the start of the film. The humour overall is dry but works for the most part. Apart from Jon's thoughts out loud I would say the hot tub scene was also quite memorable.The film takes a tragic turn midway through and the band also progress. I felt that after an hour the novelty wore off slightly and it became very tedious to watch, I really started to lose interest. The second half of the film didn't really work for me and I felt disappointed after such a great start. The film wasn't engaging enough to make me connect to the characters as the serious stuff happened but it was very enjoyable when it was more on the comedy side.A well made film with great performances that unfortunately lost its way towards the end. Some will love it, some will hate it and I can see both sides to that argument. Overall I would say 5/10.",5,31,42,9 February 2015
Reservoir Dogs," Classic!
","Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius.I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks.Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see.9/10.",9,5,10,10 August 2013
In Time," Very unique film
","'In Time' was a film that I saw advertised when it was released and thought it looked good but then I didn't hear any more about it until I came across it on DVD. I'm glad I did manage to see this at last because it was very enjoyable.The plot for this film is very unique, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. There was a lot of familiar actors in this (Cillian Murphy, Johnny Galecki, Vincent Kartheiser to name a few). The acting was very good overall I thought, even from Justin Timberlake in the lead role.There was some good drama as well as good action scenes (car chases, shooting etc). It is the sort of film that will keep you guessing as to what will happen next and it was just a very interesting concept overall.It would have been nice if there was a bit more back story though, it was never really explained why the world was like it was. Apart from that, just take it for what it is and enjoy it.Would recommend it to anyone who fancies watching something a bit different.8/10.",8,53,70,30 September 2013
Whiplash," Good film with outstanding performances
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWhiplash is a very good film that is carried by the outstanding performances of J.K. Simmons & Miles Teller. The film overall is completely engaging although at times it is slightly over dramatic/unrealistic. I really enjoyed the catchy music themes throughout.The parts I didn't think went well with the overall tone of the film was the crash scene which seemed totally unnecessary and extremely unrealistic that he would get out the car, then still get there on time and play in the state he was in. I'm pretty sure that J.K. Simmons' character wouldn't be able to get away with such abusive ways and I was expecting the other drummers to take a stand together. I would liked more of a back story because the characters seemed great, the final scene was breathtaking but left slightly unresolved.It is a very engaging film with outstanding acting performances (I'm backing J.K. Simmons for the Oscar and also felt Miles Teller deserved a nomination) but I felt there was a few missed opportunities. Still I would highly recommend the film and I give it 8/10.",8,4,8,15 January 2015
X-Men: First Class," This really is 'First Class'
","Being a fan of the original X-Men films, I was really looking forward to this. I thought it would be interesting to find out a little bit more about the earlier lives of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr.I really liked how the story developed and the roles of Charles and Erik were portrayed fantastically by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively. The other (previously unseen) mutants in this movie were also interesting, especially Hank. The cameo from Wolverine was also hilarious.The storyline was great and plenty of action to keep you gripped. Overall this film was brilliant and I am really looking forward to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' now, especially after this one was left on such a cliffhanger. I think this is definitely as good as the original trilogy of X-Men films, possibly better. This is one that you just have to see.10/10 -",9,3,6,28 July 2013
Monsters University," Pixar does it again
","Having really enjoyed Monsters Inc when I was younger, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that there was going to be a prequel released.It was interesting to see how all the characters had met and what their friendships were like in the earlier days. The film has a good simple plot and is perfect for the whole family to enjoy as there is also some funny parts as well as heartwarming moments. It was great that Mike and Sulley (the two main characters) had the same voice-overs as the original film, this made it feel more authentic.Overall I really enjoyed this film, but then who doesn't love a good Disney Pixar film? 8/10",8,14,21,28 July 2013
Lucy," Very impressive action/sci fi thriller
","Lucy does seem like one of those films you'll either love or hate. I personally loved it. It's a combination of action and sci fi that is pure entertainment from start to finish. There's a lot of great action scenes (car chases, shoot outs etc) especially when Lucy completely wipes out a bunch of people with one move. There's also some pretty gruesome scenes which may make you wince a little. Then there is once scene where Lucy makes a phone call to her parents, this is pretty emotional and allows the viewer to feel more attached to her. The film is mostly over the top action which is very entertaining and visually looks great. The music played throughout the film made it more atmospheric but at times there would be some very witty one liners to change the mood. There was plenty of cool looking scenes and enough suspense to keep me glued to the screen. Scarlett Johansson was superb in the lead role (I think these sort of roles really suit her). Morgan Freeman was a good choice for the professor and the rest of the cast all done a good job too. The ending was perhaps a bit of an anti climax but overall it's a great way to spend 85 minutes if you want to watch a film for pure entertainment. A very unique film and perhaps one of the most underrated films of 2014 - liked it a lot more than I thought I would. 9/10.",9,10,23,7 October 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first Hunger Games film
","Let me first start of by saying that I have never read The Hunger Games books so my review is based solely on how the films pan out. This film takes places directly after the events of the 1st film where Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have just won the 74th Hunger Games and are now being targeted by the Capitol.I felt everything about this film was superior to its predecessor. The acting is stronger, the character development is stronger, the action is much more fast paced and also more realistic and just in general it doesn't seem as cheesy. Don't get me wrong the 1st film was good for laying the foundations but Catching Fire took the series to a different level.I'm now really looking forward to Mockingjay part 1 which hits cinemas this month and I'm also considering picking the books up as I really like the whole setting and the characters.8.5/10 and it becomes a new entry in my Top 10 Films of 2013!",9,2,15,21 November 2014
50_50," Boring
","'50/50' is a film that I really wanted to like but ultimately it was a complete bore and I struggled to watch it all. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, I had high hopes as I really like both the actors. I have nothing bad to say about their performances but throughout the film you just don't feel any emotional attachment to JGL and SR is kinda just there for cheap laughs (not really laugh out loud moments, just some things that'll make you smile). The plot is a delicate subject but doesn't really draw you in. There just isn't anything happening and I found myself looking at the clock (sign of a boring film). I certainly wouldn't class this as a comedy, it is just a drama that fails to deliver what it could have done. Overall I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend this film. Shame because I like the actors and the potential was there. 4/10.",4,12,23,5 October 2013
Jackie Brown," A good film but not Quentin's best
","Following the success of Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's 3rd film, Jackie Brown, was one I was looking forward to. When I saw the rating on here was significantly lower than the previous two I was a little skeptical. Afer finally getting round to watching Jackie Brown, I think the slightly lower rating is justified.The plot for the film is good, there's a really well assembled cast as well. I liked how we saw different parts of the story over and over again from a different person's perspective. There wasn't that much action but the main story was pretty gripping and kept you guessing. Although it was gripping to an extent, I felt that it took too long to get going properly. This film could easily have been an hour shorter and would've had the same results.Overall it is a good film but for me there wasn't enough happening to justify it being so long. A good one time watch anyway.7/10.",7,4,7,28 October 2013
Her," One of the best films of 2013
","Finally got round to watching Her and I had high hopes after all the praise it had received. It did not disappoint.Everything about this film is pretty much perfect for me. The cinematography is beautiful, the pacing is just right, the acting is superb, the characters are likable and the plot is very unique. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as Theo and Scarlett Johansson voices Samantha to perfection.One thing that did take my by surprise is that the film had quite a few laugh out loud moments which is always good. The storyline was unique and manages to play with your emotions as a viewer.Outstanding 10/10. Would highly recommend.",10,6,11,10 August 2014
The Social Network," Good but dragged out
","Facebook and the Internet in general is a massive part of today's world, so making a film on this subject seemed like an interesting idea.The acting in this movie is very good, Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield in particular (two of the main characters). The way the story develops is interesting and seems like it would be very realistic but I found myself losing interest just over half way through, there is just so much talking and it feels extremely dragged out, 2 hours is a bit too long. Yes this is a good drama but I can't see why the critics have rated this so highly. I guess its all about personal opinion.For me this is worth a one time watch. 6/10",7,8,13,29 July 2013
Goodfellas," A masterpiece
","I have only just watched Goodfellas (yes, I know I'm 23 years late) and it is one of the best films I have seen. You just know a film is good when you've been watching over 2 hours and it seems like only half an hour.The plot is great and easy to follow. The cast is brilliant and all played their roles incredibly well. I personally thought Joe Pesci was the star of the show, he was just crazy and funny as well, a really likable character. Lorraine Bracco was also deserving of a mention. The action is extremely good and the set looks fantastic. Martin Scorsese really has done a brilliant job with this film. The soundtrack was also great and went perfectly with the film. I also liked how some characters narrated parts of the film, this really helped in parts.Overall one of the best films out there, it is one of those films that everyone just has to see at some point. Well deserving of its high place in the top 250 on IMDb and all the awards it has won.10/10 - A classic.",10,7,13,12 August 2013
Warm Bodies," Surprisingly lovely
","This film isn't your usual Zombie film, yes there is a load of zombies in it but it is with a twist. This time it is about good zombies. There is still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a relationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent Nicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen friendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK it is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we are left with a great ending.I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely worth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also funny, a winner for me.8/10",8,9,12,30 July 2013
