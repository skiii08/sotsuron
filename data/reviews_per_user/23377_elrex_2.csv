Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great family film
","Phantom Menace was worth the wait.  I loved the movie and I can not wait to see Episode 2.  I also loved being able to take my daughter to see a Star Wars movie.  I know a lot people can not stand Jar Jar, but my daughter got a real kick out of watching him.  Kudos to George Lucas for keeping the kids in mind.",9,0,0,25 June 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Left Me Stunned
","I will never forget my reaction to watching the first Matrix.  I was stunned and I was very impressed.  I was worried that I would not be stunned for the second movie.  Was I wrong!  The Matrix Reloaded left me completely stunned. I even went back to see it for a second time within just a few short days, and I got the same reaction.  Stunned!  I could not believe the brothers could find a way to do it, but they did.  I must give them credit for throwing in a lot of talking and softer music for the action sequences.  I felt like I was watching a rough draft of Gandhi Goes Kung-Fu, instead of the sequel a nearly perfect action movie.....points off for the Trinity-Neo I love you-don't die on me.  Like I said, this movie left me stunned!",8,0,0,30 June 2003
