E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Movie That Made Me Love Movies!
","It always amazes me when someone tells me they didn't like this film or that they thought it was creepy. E.T. was the first movie I cried at in the theatre, was the first movie I remembered everything about, and the first movie that felt personal. As an 8-year old in 1982, I was suddenly becoming aware how much growing up without a father was making me different from my friends. I was alienated and alone at times, seeking my own identity that little boys often find in their dads. E.T. made me realize that I wasn't alone and that love, compassion, friendship, and family could still exist even if my father didn't want me. The movie is beautiful, inside and out. EVERYBODY delivers a meaningful performance with heart and dedication. If you haven't seen this film, watch it, and be prepared for an emotional roller coaster that ALL great films should have.",10,1,1,16 March 2020
Aquaman," The Funnest Movie Of The Year!
","Finally, DC doesn't make a movie that feels like a funeral! As much as I loved Wonder Woman, the Dark Knight Trilogy, and Man of Steel, it became crystal clear that DC was more interested in making darker films for adults, while alienating the kids that make up most of the target audience for a superhero film. There were actually children asleep at Justice League! Whereas my 11-year old was on the edge of his seat through Aquaman! It's fun, upbeat, emotional, visually stunning, and worth the price of, not just your ticket, but the whole family.",8,1,1,30 December 2018
Man of Steel," Best Superman Movie to Date
","For those who disliked this movie, what is it you want? Depth to a story, development for the background characters that define Superman, incredible cinematography, and an epic superhero battle unlike anything ever seen before? I've always found it interesting that 2 of the best Superman films, Superman Returns and this movie, are often torn apart by people that have no idea what they're talking about. Stop the hate! Make some popcorn and enjoy!",9,86,111,5 January 2019
Marriage Story," Brilliant Performances!!!!
","This movie takes the overdone idea of a divorce and makes it incredibly captivating. While everyone's performance is brilliant, Adam Driver is pure genius in every scene. When you watch this film, and you really need to, ask yourself this; if Nicole and Charlie had read their lists at the beginning of the film, would they still be together at the end? As a man who has been married for almost 20 years, this movie goes a long way to showing the importance of communication in making a marriage work. Great movie!",10,2,3,22 March 2020
