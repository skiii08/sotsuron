It," MY FAVOURITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!
","My review of Stephen King's IT.Taking place in 1989, a boy named Bill Denbrough refuses to accept his brothers death. With help from his friends they create 'The Losers Club' to fin Bill's little brother and kill Pennywise, the eater of children.As soon as the film started i was hooked, the movie is not tame but doesn't get to gory either. Bill skarsgard is amazing as pennywise delivering the scares and horror you would expect. All of the kids are good actors delivering laughs and strong characters. Iv'e heard people complaining about the CGI but it actually follows the books appearence on pennywise. It's a ton of fun and a 10/10!",9,0,2,15 August 2019
World War Z," It's a great movie! (No Important Plot Information Revealed)
","This is a great movie with some thrills, amazing special effects and characters! One thing that comes to mind is that it's not as bloody than other zombie movies, well, I see that as a great opportunity for younger viewers to begin watching zombie movies. The second thing's that it's not like the book at all, this gives the world war z story a new plot and story to enjoy! I can't see any problems with this movie, I think it's great. My friends think it's great. Just stop complaining!!!!",9,1,1,13 June 2019

The Mummy," Really good!

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Fellowship of the Ring Review
","I will keep it short, because almost everyone has seen this film. This is a spoiler-free review aswell.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an awesome movie. It is kind of like a combination of multiple genres: It is most fantasy but there is also action, romance and a good bit of horror (Moria) plus some jokes as topping. The casting aswell as the performances are great, the special effects holds up suprisingly well and the ending is magnificent. Score is also fantastic.I'm not fanboying when I say that it is a 10/10, because this movie is almost as near perfect one can be, and the sequels does not dissapoint (at least the two following). If you haven't watched it yet, I strongly suggest that you go buy the whole trilogy!",10,0,0,25 December 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Two Towers Extended/Theatrical Cut Review
","I will keep it short, because many people has already seen this film. This is a spoiler-free review aswell.
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a great sequel which I have watched in two different cuts: The Theatrical Cut & The Extended Special Edition. What version should I view, you may ask. I think you should watch the theatrical cut because the extended edition goes on a bit too long. But the main cut is a great sequel to the first one and it has the charm of the original aswell.It is a 10/10 for sure. This trilogy is great, and you should own all of the movies.",10,0,0,26 December 2019
Hotel Transylvania," A very good family-movie with amazing script!
",This is one of the best animated movies I've ever watched and it really does live up to your thoughts. Good work with the perfect cast!,8,1,1,22 November 2018
The Mummy Returns," Nice! But not the best
","Sequel of the mummy 1999 remake. Includes adventure, fantasy a little bit of horror plus humor. I loved the first movie and i like this one too. But the story is not as good as the first one and the animated Scorpion King looks like he is from a computer-game.",7,0,1,19 July 2018
It Chapter Two," Incredible Sequel! SPOILER FREE REVIEW
","IT Chapter 2 tells the story of the seven losers 27 years later. After a phone call, the Losers Club are forced to revisit Derry to finish the creature of evil taking form as the both charming and terrifying; Pennywise the 'Dancing' Clown.2 Years ago Pennywise made his way to the most famous horror villians with beeing given a movie that was the worlds highest grossing horror film of all time. Now they released the sequel, and I will say that if you didn't like the old take of this part of the story then you probably will be walking out of the cinema with a grin on your face, this movie is awesome! There are some effective scares here and there, in one scene I forced myself at the back of my seat so hard, it was like the scene aqtually was happening. All of the actors here does a great job, we really believe that they are the grown up-versions of the kids. I would say that the best actors were Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgì±…rd. Now what I did not like. I think they should've had more Pennywise in the movie, most of the times it is Pennywise as something else we see on-screen. Also I might see how it could get booring at times for some people. And I thought the de-aging of Ben and Eddie was a little bit to obvious. Other than that I think it's a worthy sequel with a rating of 8/10 from me! Also can't wait for the supercut!",8,0,0,21 September 2019
Halloween," Greatest slasher? Yes! Greates Horror? YES!
","John Carpenter's Halloween is nothing but a masterpiece. Jamie Lee Curtis is a great lead role and of course; Michael Myers (The Shape) is an amazing killer, he kinda feels supernatural and that is what makes him so scary. My personal favourite horror-genre is Psychological, not because of the gore but because of the fact that humans can be monsters too, and since serial-killers do excist, the psychological movies are way scarier than for say; Supernatural movies. John Carpenter's Halloween is still the greatest horror movie of all time. So call your best friends, pop some popcorn, and turn on this mastrepiece on your biggest screen. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!",10,3,3,14 September 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Return of the King
","I will keep it short, because what needs to be said has already been. This review is also spoiler-free.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is my personal favourite in the trilogy. It has the msot fight scenes out of any Lord of the Rings tale, and they are all very well written. The first big war that takes place is one of the best scenes in the saga and the ending of the movie is great. I could not fault the previous two, and it's the same for this one.Of course it is a 10/10. This movie is great, and something else I did not say previously was that I really liked everything they did with Gollum in this film. Buy it, no questions.",10,3,4,27 December 2019
Incredibles 2," Great and fun entertainment!
",Great movie! One of the best animated movie I've seen! It's a sequel and that makes it even better! The only thing I didn't enjoyed was that a kid sat behind my chair and spoiled the whole movie,8,2,4,16 September 2018
