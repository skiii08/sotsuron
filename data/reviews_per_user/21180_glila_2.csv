Howl's Moving Castle," My Personal Favorite from Miyazaki
","I understand that many people consider Spirited Away to be Hayao Miyazaki's finest work, but I disagree. Though it was spectacular and amazing to watch ( a great pioneer in the world of animation) I prefer the story of Howl's Moving Castle. A young hat maker is cursed into becoming a old woman after meeting a mysterious stranger known as Howl. She soon discovers his walking 'castle' and the creatures it holds. As she gets to know this mysterious man more and more she becomes younger and younger but also has to save Howl from the evil witch who cursed her in the first place. I have seen this movie more than any other Miyazaki's and love it every time. The animation is superb and as stated before the story is amazing.",10,0,1,30 January 2015
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Pleasantly surprised by quirky, confusing film
","Before watching this movie I had to do some research on it and the results were not pretty. A 51% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.3 on here says a lot about a film. I did however read multiple reviews that the confusing and hard to follow story was supported by a noble cast including Ewan McGregor, George Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. This seems very much like the kind of movie I would like and I did like it. I thought that it was going to be a lot less funny than it actually was. It was marketed as a comedy yet was very dramatic, and the humor was dark. I know this bothers a lot of people but I like it. Overall I had very low standards and I was pleasantly proved wrong by a quirky, confusing, well casted romp with some more dark moments you don't expect to find in a comedy.",8,4,6,31 January 2015
