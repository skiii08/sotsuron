The Monuments Men," This movie give me hope.
","I just added this to my blog: http://radmanart2ndhome.blogspot.com/ I have to post a retraction from my last post:If it was not for this blog; I would not be doing art at all, for at least the past 3 years. So when I said 'My new art takes a little longer but I sure hope it is worth it. Is it all worth it at all? Who cares I would be doing it no matter what any way'; that is not true completely.I have watched this movie about 5 times thanks to Dish.com: The Monuments Men (2014) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2177771/ PG-13 1h 58min Drama, War 7 February 2014 (USA) This movie give me hope.",10,1,3,8 February 2016
Minority Report," This movie is a example of how our present day unjustice justice system is.
","When I rented this movie; when it first came out, it just screamed sex offender registry to me. I am and have been very outspoken on the internet against the sex offender registry and mass incarceration since 2001 online; so this movie really touched me. It is a lonely job; like Chief John Anderton in his quest to disprove Precrime. Lets face it when our government wastes millions of tax payer money on the sex offender registry; they are saying these people will re-offend. Like Minority Report predicts people committing crime; the sex offender registry does the same thing. Instead of freezing them in prison; they allow posting their photos and personal information all over the planet. Even more wasted tax payer money is spent through; police wasting there time constantly investigating them, verses protecting people from real crimes. I always say I would rather have a sex offence committed against me than getting shot in the leg. The amount of people shot and not killed in our country is staggering; look it up. Director Lamar Burgess seems to me to be a great example of a politician fear mongering to gain votes and power at other people's expense. He looks exactly like the character in the sex offender comic I drew and posted on the internet; in the comic Joe Dork. The end gave me chills with lines like this: '...you know your own future...which means you can change it if you want to.' and this: 'You still have a choice, Lamar.'. Of course we can change our future, of course we have a choice; that is what life is all about; even insects and animals display this inherent trait. When I wrote this; I left out the main reason I think this movie is about sex offenders. When a person is put on the sex offender registry they are assigned a risk level. A risk level is just another way of our perverted justice system to say; this person will commit a sex crime.",10,0,0,16 February 2020
Rocketman," I'm not the man they think I am at home.
","The movie was very good and very emotionally moving. His life was very heartbreaking. He experienced a great deal of pain and neglect.Yes his life long friend Bernie, wrote the songs. Elton John had the music and his friend put the music to an actual experience Elton John was going through at the time. Alcohol and drugs pledged Elton John and it is a important part of the movie. The pain he suffered in life and how he tried to self medicate is a journey worth watching in this movie.",10,0,3,24 June 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Outstanding Movie
","WE rented this at the Redbox. Amazing recreation of so many great weird Marvel Comics. When it comes to comic to movies; I love movies taken from weird; off the track comics. The standard everyday doo da comics; do not make great movies. As far as I can tell this movie takes it's plot from comics such as: Planet Hulk, The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #92-105, Thor Vol. 3 #1-12, #600-603, Thor Giant-Sized Finale #1, Contest of Champions #1-10. This is a great movie; despite it being under the total censorship of Disney. There is allot of violence in this movie though. If Disney continues to get rad I am happy to watch movies like this. All movies are fake and I guess the reason Disney likes comics to movies; is because it is make believe, made into make believe.",10,2,4,30 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Barf! Really, this movie makes me want to barf. Sry Michael Keaton you rock forever!
","I rented Spider-Man Homecoming recently at Redbox; at the local Kroger. The voice of Spider-Man is made to sound like he is 5 years old? This is not Spider-Man; it Spider-Child? Weird, this is not right. I know the whole long, awful; Spider-Man-Boy comic book series was made, and no one cared about that either. There is selling out and then there is selling out; and this is that and beyond into infinity. Believe me my name means infinite in Latin; that makes me a authority on the subject. This whole movie is a insult to Spider-Man in every possible way.Look they need to make a long series of Spider-Man movies of the only time the whole world loved Spider-Man. That is when Todd McFarlane and Eric Larson, wrote, and drew it.",1,5,13,26 October 2017
Rush," the artist of Radmanart2ndhome
","I am writing this on October 17 2013. I would have never seen this movie if it were not for the free preview on Dish network ( dish.com ), of HBO. If you ever put your life on the line in; or in my case (on a motorized vehicle: Ninja 2001); you know what this movie is all about. This movie touched me. I vaguely remember in 1976 the attention this type of racing brought to the world. I was too young to really know; but thanks to Ron Howard, now I know. Now make the sport bike movie to honor racers like me; the unsung hero's of American highways. You do not understand this movie unless you have raced at above 200 miles a hour; in my opinion, or, have been a fan of someone who has.",10,0,1,17 October 2015
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Taboo to Christian's for no reason at all; after all these years.
","I made it a point to watch this for the same reason I saw the first Harry Potter movie in the theaters; that got a standing ovation by everyone at the theater at the end. Sometimes the best thing to do is watch and enjoy the shows main stream Christians tell you not to watch.The movie magic really delivers to us New York of 1926. That is a huge fascination to me and captures my attention above all else, through the whole movie.From the start of the early introduction a Muggle as a main character (Mary Lou) gets my heroic, defensive sentiment up. Must be from watching all those Harry Potter movies.Newt Scamander to me is a supper hero veterinarian. Having someone who loves and protects wild animals, as the lead character of the movie; really makes you take his side, no matter what. This is by far the greatest and best movie Eddie Redmayne stars in; to date.This movie does what all the Harry Potter movies do; makes you see that even in the witchcraft world there are good and bad. The fact that there is a immense thrust of pure chivalry from Newt Scamander; in both movies, makes this movie, give you that emotional all over feeling, we all watch movies for.",10,0,0,25 June 2019
Django Unchained," My Favorite Movie of All Time
","Django Unchained made in 2002; is the best movie I have ever seen. I have been to college for graphic design for 8 years and have been a professional graphic design artist since 1988. If you ask me I graduated a art director and if you look at my greatest accomplishments in college; you might say I went to college to make movies. I have to admit other favorites of mine are Schindler's List (1993) and The Pianist (2002) If you were to ask me for my 2nd favorite movie it would be Inglourious Basterds (2009). The trick to this movie is not to watch it for a couple years. When you watch this after a while; it will bring you to such a pinnacle of rejoicing of righteous indignation; it is incomparable to any movie made to man. Django's love for Broomhilda Von Shaft being his saving grace and ultimate power accessibility is the story of the history of man. The very center point being; the love of a man to the love for a woman, being the culmination of the retribution of a entire population of a oppressed people is absolutely believable and that is why you cannot deny the infallibility of the message of this script. In the words of Depeche Mode: People Are People. We are truly equal on this planet and the denial of this is the reason for all war. The acceptance that we are all equal is the secret to peace on earth. In the words of John Lennon: Imagine.",10,0,6,21 October 2015
Mulholland Drive," Sad but true interpretation of this movie by me
","Sad but true meaning of this movie: No matter how many times I see the movie Mulholland Drive; I am more amazed every time. My wife and I had to drive many miles to see the movie when it first came out in a theater. It had limited theaters that the film was showing in the Dallas Morning News. I guess I was a huge David Lynch fan since Lost Highway https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_(film). When we arrived at the theater that was showing the movie Mulholland Drive; I was amazed at how nice it was. The sound quality was very good; I remember the bass and loudness shook the room it was playing in. When we got done watching the long enthralling move; I could barely see straight. I remember having a hard time finding my way out of the theater. We actually went around the whole theater trying to find the door out. I felt dizzy, even high; after seeing the movie and making my way back to the car. When I searched the internet around that time and to the present; I could barely find any info on the subject. Now there is allot of interpretations on the movie's meaning. The Wikipedia page has grown enormous since then. If you are ever in a waiting room or something, and you need to kill some time on you phone; look it up on Wikipedia; it is a good long interesting read. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film) I think it is about two ghosts the haunt Hollywood. The ghosts relive their lives and how they first met. It is funny how Ghost Box recordings always work best with celebrity's. www.prrsociety.org/ghostbox.html Maybe the celebrity's possess this new found way of speaking through the afterlife. I think the movie is about a lesbian couple who's love is so strong it will not die. I think lesbians possess the most power to love each other transcending all other love. I think when two women love each other it becomes something different than normal explainable love. Women love like no other species on earth. Women possess the power to love far better than men. The two main stars in Mulholland Drive represent that love to me. Two women who's love for each other would not die; even after death. Of course since such love is normally despised and shunned; it almost explains why such a love would resonate past death upon the plain that is our pitiful existence. ",10,2,3,3 February 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," I am hooked for life to Guardians of the Galaxy
",I am all about comics. I started reading every Spider Man when it cam out starting around issue number 47. I mention comics all over all my Radman_art and Radmanart websites since 2001; when my wife made my first website. The title of my websites refer to a super hero I invented in 1988 and had published in Thrasher Magazine. My splash page for my radmanart2ndhome.blogspot.com web site is of the issue Radman was published in. In all my newspaper articles praising my art; I am referred to as Radman. I created about 150 pages of comics back in my heyday's of the late 1980's. I have drawn the Guardians of the Galaxy's charatcter Rocket many times to perfection on my Radman_Art Blog Homepage 2016 page. I liked to draw Rocket because he is my favorite super hero of all time now. I love his New England accent. I never new I would have a raccoon as a favorite superhero. The point I am trying to make is I am all about comics. Until the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie I had never even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy. Weird huh? Pretty weird coming from a comic authority that I claim to be. Since then Guardians of the Galaxy has become my favorite super hero saga and will be for life.The amazing thing to me is Guardians of the Galaxy first began in the epic year of 1969. Probably the coolest year our country ever had. Say's Wikipedia: The original Guardians of the Galaxy are a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Guardians first appear in Marvel Super-Heroes #18.You have to admit that is pretty weird. Long live Guardians of the Galaxy!,10,2,3,28 March 2018
Vanilla Sky," Cameron Crowe Please More Like This
","This is Cameron Crowe at his utmost. Why genius like this goes untapped; I will never know. This movie is worth watching just for the incredible filming of it. Not just because of CG. They really shut down time square; for intense. Called 'the million dollar shot.'. Cameron Crowe said: 'We had Times Square to ourselves, which was an eerie, inspiring feeling,' If you have ever lived in a city around or in New York City you know what this means.This has always been one of my favorite movies and still is. My wife wanted to watch it again and I jump at the chance. I wrote this about Vanilla Sky on my Radmanart blog in 2017:I was watching Vanilla Sky the other day and was moved again by this awesome movie. David to me resembles the scars of mistakes we make in life. This part gave me chills (edit): And what is any life; if not the pursuit of a dream The dream of peace the dream of achievement the dream of hearing someone say these words when they really, and truly mean them, I love you, Roam free Most of us live our whole lives without any real adventure; to call our own It's hard to comprehend; they laughed at Jules Verne too.David offended Julianna Gianni selfishly and awfully. Isn't that the true scar's of David? David's life completely changes because of his disfigurement. Is that right? No it is not. One minute popular David the next shunned, even by his, one time, friends. Many uniquely, amazing people in our society are affected in this same way; without any visible scars. One minute a pinnacle of society, the next condemned by our fanatical political and religious beliefs. Very sad.",10,2,4,18 October 2019
Mother!," Mesmerizing!
",I have bad mouthed horror movies on the internet before but recently I have seen a few movies that are a exception to the rule. I am glad that directors are using their talents to create these masterpieces. Like Brightburn; Mother sent me to the internet immediately to try to find out if it came from a book or a comic book. In both cases I discovered; it did not. This alone shows the individuality of today's new bread of directors. How could you not admire that?I had no idea what Mother was about. Even after watching it and thoroughly reading about it; I still am convinced that it solely came from someones very wild imagination. Captivating imagination that creates a movie like Mother is so rare today. Darren Aronofsky is a gem that should be cherished and not squandered. Javier Bardem had been a favorite actor of mine for years now. Jennifer Shrader Lawrence's performance was above and beyond the call of duty and what makes this movie a work of art. Who does not like Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer?,10,0,1,31 December 2019
Moonrise Kingdom," The Greatest Movie To Date I Have Watched
","To be honest with you all; every time Wes Anderson makes a movie it is my favorite movie. I did not like the animated one so much, but it was still good though. Ever since I saw the The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), I have been a huge fan of Wes Anderson's work. I had a link and a statement on my original Radman_Art web site since about 2001 saying: Wes Anderson is my favorite director. I do not know why but they remind me of being a child when I see his movies with children as characters. The Royal Tenenbaums reminded me of growing up on the East Coast. The The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou reminded of my vacations on the beaches of the East Coast and my fascination with the ocean.Moonrise Kingdom (2012) reminds me a lot of the era of the film; as I remember it as a child. It reminds me a little of when I set out on my own to live in Florida as a 16 year old young man. The children do not remind me of me as characters; except the sea side house reminded me of the houses we would stay in along the beach for summer vacation.Long live Wes Anderson's work as a director. Every movie he makes; is my all time favorite. I can not wait to rent The Grand Budapest Hotel!",10,2,5,30 March 2014
Deadpool," Once again the lesser know comic character is the best for a movie.
","Like Guardians of the Galaxy; this movie introduced me to a comic book character I did not know about at all. I instantly feel in love with this hard core hero. He may be ruff around the edges, but this shines through as realistic, to what you might expect in a mercenary, like this movie portrays. I did not like the graphic part of his origin. I hated seeing him tortured by his captor Ajax. Ajax gets his comeuppance; so it made the whole ordeal vital to the dramatic effect of how Deadpool becomes the Deadpool we all know and love.",10,0,0,9 September 2018
