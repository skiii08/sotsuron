Raiders of the Lost Ark," Can't go wrong with Speilberg and Lucas
","Indian Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark
Steven Speilberg's blockbuster extravaganza of yesteryear is a culmination of non-stop action glory thanks to co-producer George Lucas.  It is safe to say that the creditability of these two filmmakers isn't questioned, and if anyone could back that it would be Harrison Ford whom owes a lifetime of success to both of them.  `Raiders of the Lost Ark' makes Ford an American icon.  Ford plays a young tough yet vulnerable archaeologist/adventurer known as Indian Jones.  Of course it is characteristic of Lucas to use this film as a stepping stone for an epic trilogy.  The film has all the right elements, Lucas and Speilberg, and a foreshadowing of the development of Dreamworks. Indy is out to stop the Nazis from obtaining the mythological Lost Ark of the Covenant (a treasure chest enshrining the original ten commandments). Historical relevance of the Third Reich encourages audience members to delegate interest an support for the hero, Indian Jones.  Fast-paced, quick moving and heart-stopping stunts galore fill the screen, including one of the greatest filmed action sequences; Jones taking on a German truck and a gaggle of soldiers trying to stop him. The picture is fun, frenetic, and suspenseful with a tough of rogue humor contribute to elevating the movie into the pantheon of great films. Perhaps the most memorable and distinctive feature are the action sequences.  Even to this day the film still resonates with cool action sequences that were well ahead of its time.  Adventures couldn't be more fun and realistic, when comparing `Raiders of the Lost Ark' to the many other action films since. With the combination of terrific direction, an all American heroic icon, and the destruction of evil Nazi's it is no wonder this film is highly acclaimed as one of the best action films ever made.",Null,0,1,15 May 2003
Collateral," Michael Mann gives new definition to the word cruise.
","This movie was unbelievably thrilling while maintaining a believable tale.  Tom Cruise's (Vincent) dialogue was so charismatic it will leave audiences rooting for the bad guy.  The character Vincent is a socio-path, who's erratic but fascinating philosophies pave wave for his justified views on death and destruction.  This movie in a way parodies Tom Cruise's scientologist beliefs.     Don't forget Jamie Fox.  His character, Max adds a hilarious insecure sensibility on every issue.  The intensity is always in the red and the action is sensational.  Who would have thought the collaboration between these two actors would be so functional.  I hope Tom Cruise will finally get his shot at an Oscar come March.  If you have a chance to see this in theaters take it, but be cautioned of its violence and abstract morale.",10,0,1,13 August 2004
