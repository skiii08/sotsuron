Black Swan," By Rodarte
","You would never focus on the fact that these costumes were made by Kate M. And L.M. from Rodarte but these were displayed by MOCA in LA and the attention to detail from the director as well as what the actresses had to go through to wear it, really brought the fairy tale, the dark story, the dark romance through to the audience. It is easy to get caught up in his tales, in his worlds. The film is a phenomenal art piece from a director who is really open about the amount of work that consistently goes into his practical effects through his body of work. His personal touch is always present. His love of beauty, of the beautiful, of the exquisite, is a clearly life long, heart felt nature. Ballet is not for the weak. It is about perfection.",10,0,2,15 March 2017
Inglourious Basterds," By Armani
","Just to start: 2009 Inglourious Basterds (costume designer: Brad Pitt's evening attire). P.I.M.P. Other than that, the director is also a bad ass. This film is pretty far out there. Methodology of this director is pretty legendary. His distinguishment: fearless writer. Contribution to field or impact: wow, he just blew up Hitler's face. Well done. I couldn't watch that. I might want to marry the Jewish bear. That character alone is amazing. I wonder if he ever really lived. What a contributor. This guy loves movies. He loves cinema.",10,1,6,15 March 2017
The Dark Knight," By Armani
",2008 The Dark Knight (wardrobe: Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne tailored wardrobe handmade by Armani). Exceptional touch. Well done. The movie is so well done. The trilogy is so well done. The acting is so well done. The makeup is well done. The cinematography is well done. I'm so glad the Academy gave Heath Ledger his award. He seems to bloom film. Christopher Nolan seems to be bringing it back. He is also a bad ass. I like him in person. It is awesome to see him. He is a storyteller.,10,0,1,15 March 2017
