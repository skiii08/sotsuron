50 First Dates," What a fantastic movie!!
",This was the best movie I have seen in a very long time. I was truly surprised because I really did not think it was going to be that fantastic. I wish I had someone who cared enough for me to make me fall in love all over again with him every single day. Go see the movie believe me you will not regret it. Can't want until it comes out on DVD.,10,0,0,21 February 2004
