Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointed
","I'll try to be brief.  TPM lacked both likable and 'hate-able' characters. Liam & Ewan were wooden, Natalie was positively Charlie McCarthy-esque. Jake Lloyd was annoying, Jar-Jar was the same, only to the nth degree. Darth Maul was a no-show, Darth Sidious also.  You can bash the acting in Episode IV, but at least Han Solo was a roguish, wise-cracking character, and Leia was smart-alecky and brash.  Darth Vader had more than 2 lines of dialogue, and was quite scary.  As for those who say TPM is just setting up for the next two, how do you explain ANH?  That was a fun, enjoyable, self-contained story & movie.  TPM is nothing more than a merchandising vehicle.  Oh well, not very brief...",4,0,1,6 July 1999
