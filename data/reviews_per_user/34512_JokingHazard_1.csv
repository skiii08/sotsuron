The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Peaks Of Being A Valley
","If you don't get the title, what I mean by it is: This movie is okay. It has good moments (mostly all of them containing Erza Miller) and some bad moments (mostly containing the other actors).While I did enjoy some characters and some of the takes on high school stereotypes, I though the movie was very bland. It didn't develop the characters very well and I found myself not caring when something good happened to a rather unfortunate main character.Erza Miller and Mae Whitman do a pretty good job at playing their characters, who are actually relatively interesting and fun. Then there's Emma Watson, who I'm a big fan of, but I found myself stumbling over her fluctuating accent and she was a bit of a flat line.Logan Lerman, who I also kind of like as an actor, is kind of boring and quiet. That is what his character kind of is, so he works to a certain degree, but in the end, I really didn't get attached to any of the character's, with the exception of Erza Miller.The main problem stems from the fact that it's supposed a character driven story, but the movie gives his flat, generic characters to connect with. Their characteristic's are too plain and their goals are too simple that when they accomplish them, we don't really care. None of the character's really grow to any extent.In conclusion, this movie is nowhere near terrible, but it's very mediocre. Give it a pass.",4,1,3,17 July 2013
