Come and See," time is a good indicator of greatness
","i saw this movie first time 18 years ago. at that time high school kids in Russia were kinda forced to watch this film as a reminder of what happened. i liked the film a lot. 2 images got stuck in my mind - a raped girl and old lady on a bed in the middle of nowhere. i've been wanting to watch this film again for the past 5 years and finally got a hand on DVD. too bad there are no extras except very short text by Sean Penn. i watched it again, almost 2 decades since my first viewing. the movie is one of the best films showing the side effect of wars without really glorifying the combat part of it. there is no superficial philosophizing, just very internal representation of reality as seen / felt by a young boy. in my opinion, there are only 2 films that can stand in the same raw with 'come and see' - Apocalypse Now and Thin Red Line.",9,1,4,14 May 2005
