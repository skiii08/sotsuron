Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," borat, the show that will never been seen on TV again
","I have never seen a grown man act such a child. If your into racism, discrimination and any other insult from a bad speaking kazakhstanian imitator. This Film is perfect for you. The Movie starts with Borat lustfully kissing his sister 'the 3rd prostitute in Kazakhstan' before departing to America to film a 'documentary'.The movie now moves to America where Borat learns to drive portraying woman as no more than sex toys on his way. As nighttime draws Borat and his even lesser sidekick Azamat, decide to stop the night in a house that is renting a room. This is the point in which the film turns into a racist rant. And the point in which I turned the film off and split the disk in two.",1,4,10,14 March 2007
Catch Me If You Can," A mediocre film, with a couple of interesting twists starring Leonardo DiCaprio
","I had seen this film sitting gathering dust on the shelf of my local store and decided it might be worth giving it a try. It defiantly did not disappoint me as I was sucked into the world of Frank Abanale Jr and experienced his unfortunate and stressful life.Based on a true story, this film is about a young boy aged 17 who in his lifetime had managed to con his way into millions of dollars. Flipping easily between different jobs from airline pilots to Doctors, to lawyers. Along his way he even managed to run into a bit a romance.However, I believe that Leonardo did not play his character in a pensive way, as I think he should have. Although he is revelling in his wealth, he should perhaps be a little bit more upset due to the circumstances.It is an interesting plot line with lots of snaking twists and turns, it is unequivocal to see that a lot of thought has gone into planning this film out, but I must admit that I have seen better films.During some of the unnecessary scenes in the film I was so bored I realised I had taken better interest in the way the curtain was blowing in the wind, in contrast to the more interesting scenes where I would be literally on the edge my seat in frenetic anticipation.Overall, the film is generally interesting, and is a definite must see. If you don't like the film I'm sure heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio will catch your attention. (And I'm not jut talking to you ladies!)",8,1,3,14 March 2007
