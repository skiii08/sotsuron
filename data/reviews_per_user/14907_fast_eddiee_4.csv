Scarface," one hell of a movie
","Scarface is a great and popular film because of its gripping performance by Pacino and its excellent screenplay. It has all the necessary elements in making a complete film- the girl, the message, the explosive ending, the action, and even the humor. I didn't know who De Palma was before I saw this film, but I do now and I must say I have become a follower of his. De Palma's work on this film was done really well: in particular, the first scene in this film where Montana is in the detention center is spellbinding. The scene starts with a black color and then transides to the black colored coat of a detention center official as we are introduced to our ill-famed hero, Tony Montana. Montana sits in his chair mimicking a king in his throne and has an exchange with the officials that shows us the dynamic of his character. Here De Palma gives us insight to how powerful this individual man is, all the while keeping us entertained. Indeed, Tony has plenty of ambition to get things done his way and only an army can stop him as he works his way up Miami's cocaine empire. Al Pacino does a really good job throughout- it is hard to find a scene where Pacino is not directing the action around him. The screenplay and Pacino work together marvelously. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a taste for gangster films like Carlito's way and Casino. Scarface is a movie that will be remembered for a long time and will stand, like no other, as a film that shows evil never prevails.",Null,0,0,28 February 2002
American Psycho," I changed my name to Patrick Bateman
","American Psycho is a real good film; I haven't watched a movie this intensely in a long time! This movie kept me glued to the screen and it pressed me to look deep into the mind of this american madman. (That is, until I eventually was nauseated by all the gore and disturbing emotions that I had to take a break.) Everything in this movie is perfectly crafted with precise and deliberate measures to make for an extraordinary movie- The 'narrow-minded' camera, which only let's us see cutouts of the scenes, The many faces of Patrick, which take us into his 'warped' mind and shows us the stress he faces as the pressure rises, and the supporting actors, who let us see why the world  becomes too much for Harvard graduate Patrick Bateman... (Patrick Bateman... sounds like Norman 'Bates,' doesn't it? Correlations between the Hitchcock classic Psycho and this movie go way and beyond- take the music, for instance.) This movie will interest anyone that has brains and a concept about what emotional pain is. Watch your step, madness is just around the corner for some people; maybe there is a Patrick Bateman in all of us...",Null,0,0,22 March 2002
Platoon," Great Vietnam movie
","Platoon was one of the first of many Vietnam War films to show the injustices and human tragedies that occurred in the jungles of Southeast Asia. This movie won film of the year in 1986 and anyone who objects need to study not only the amazing performances by all of the men in the film but also the storyline that shows us how man's feelings are hardened to the point of breakdown in War. This movie is a presentation meant for everyone to see what Vietnam Veterans had to go through, done specifically so that the public embraces them now and does not shun them like the whole nation did after the war. Like Veterans, anyone who has had some or tremendous emotional difficulty with some of life's obstacles will relate to this film more than the average person. Platoon provides us with a glimpse into the insanity of war, the brotherhood of combat, and most importantly the deterioration of feelings until the point where trust can only be placed in the man who fights by your side.",Null,0,1,1 March 2002
Windtalkers," good action film but that is about it
","If you want to see an action film with some fine combat scenes, Windtalkers may be for you. If you are looking for an in-depth inspection of soldiers at war and relationships amongst soldiers like in Saving Private Ryan, rent SPR or Thin Red line instead. In Windtalkers, John Woo incorporates his usual style of intense shootouts meshed with slow motion moments of calm, and it seems to follow through on a battlefield just as well as it did in a chineese kitchen (hard boiled.) The only problem I found with Woo's style is that many of the action sequences did not capture the whole battlefield but only zoomed-in portions of it. This is unfortunate- It would have been better if techniques in 'Patton' and 'A Bridge Too Far' were used.      Nicolas Cage does a good job and once again an only slight variation of himself as a character is enough. Adam Beach and Roger Willie do a splendid job as the code-talkers. It was good to see Native Americans honored for their services in WWII.      Windtalkers may not be the movie of the summer but war movie buffs should take a look. Although it does not have a deep plot about war and the men that partake in it, it does bestow native american WWII vets some of the credit they deserve.",Null,1,1,10 July 2002
