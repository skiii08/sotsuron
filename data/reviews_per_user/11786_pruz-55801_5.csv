Ford v Ferrari," Great movie and Christian bale is AMAZING but........
","Excellent well made movie overall and bale is abnormally amazing delivering an Oscar winning performance but the ending is cruel and unforgiving I can't give away the rest due to spoilers, of course that doesn't take away from how the rest of the film is, overall some serious eyecandy",7,1,3,21 November 2019
Captain Marvel," I Was SOOOOO Wrong About This Movie!
","Wow! Just wow! I (like everyone else) was debating to see captain marvel, but when I saw the reviews it turned me off. They said 'it shoved feminism down your throat!' They said 'bad acting!' They said 'goose is the only good thing about this movie!' And I believed them. But thank god I had the sense to see it anyways! Going into the theater I was like 'ok show me you what you got marvel' and they proved me dead wrong!! I don't even know where to begin I am at a literal list for words as there were TOO MANY THINGS GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!! (I'm not joking when a friend asked 'how was the movie?' I dididnt know how to properly explain this great piece of entertainment) First of all to clear the air: THIS IS NOT A FEMINIST MOVIE! I repeat This is not a feminist movie! (Btw I am a pure conservative) The media blew this movie way out of proportion about the feminist message. Yes of course there were very subtle hints of it but it's not revolutionary as a feminist piece of art (just because it's has a female lead doesn't make it a feminist legend) The movie start to finish kept me on edge with great story telling and plot twists. Another's thing people are complaing about is braie larson's acting they say she is too bland, but thats the point! HER CHARACTER IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EMOTIONAL! She was actually playing her part perfect. Her character is very reserved and withdrawn to strangers and gradually you see her develop. Samuel L. Jackson was also great ( the secod act of the movie feels like a buddy-cop movie) To end off as the move came to a close the entire theater gave a standing ovation! The atmosphere was full of surprise people were basically saying 'Hey I didn't know it was this good!' Do yourself a favor, ignore the comments, watch the movie , and decide for yourself what you think about it!",10,3,7,11 March 2019
Toy Story 4," This never happened, please say this never happened
","Honestly there is nothing for me to add that others hadn't said, no buzz none of the original toys. They took the values if the movie that once made this franchise great and stepped all over it.
But it's okay! It never happened, it's not like they just ripped out a piece of my childhood and tore it to loeces oh wait they did.

Green Book," AMAZING!!!! A new twist on the race story we've all saw!
","Wow! What an amazing movie. My expectations going into the theater was oh great it's going to be Another cliche Oscar film, where all white people are bad..yadda yadda yadda.. well to my surprise it totally wasnt! It was an open minded approach to the race situation today. Showing that (gasp) not all white people are bad!! The message was driven into my head but I was happy about it it had a positive spin to it. The acting was supreme! Really! This movie shows that there is still hope in today's left-driven liberal Hollywood! Watch it you won't regret it!",10,1,3,22 February 2019
