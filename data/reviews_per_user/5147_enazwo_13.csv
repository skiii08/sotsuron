The Incredible Hulk," Finally a Romantic Movie for Guys
","So often us guys have to endure going to romantic comedies, or date flicks so we can entice the lovely objects of our affection to continue to spend 'quality' time with us. And more often then not it comes at an expense that goes beyond the mere dollar value of the excursion. That expense is having to tolerate some rather dubious plots, dialog and an ending you could see coming a mile away on your way to the movie theatre.Now for a guy a long comes 'The Incredible Hulk', and it so lovely a date movie for guys. It has a beautiful intelligent girl, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who stands by her man. And no matter how angry and destructive he gets, no matter how unfashionable and tattered his clothes get, she stands by her man; Hulk that is, (Eddie Norton), and though he now only has a rain drenched cave for him to sleep in Betty stays by Hulk's side and even snuggles with him; and together they hold the cold, wet, and lonely dark night at bay.They wake to face hostile world together.I sincerely enjoyed this movie, and I am probably the only one who also enjoyed Ang Lee's thoughtful 'Hulk'. I think that is all right to enjoy both, though they are different interpretations, they both were quite satisfying to me....now if I could only find me a Betty Ross, and I wouldn't have to watch my temper, worry about my ragged clothes, or the dark lair I live in.",7,4,7,16 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," I'ts a good summer flick, forget the ballyhoo
","Okay Tom is high on the media's radar, so what. Come on, didn't he get robbed of an Oscar for 'Born on the Fourth of July'? Did he not also get so robbed for an Oscar in 'Magnolias'? And so what he's in love with a hot chick. Who hasn't 'Sang it, shout it, tell the world about it' when you've been in love. There's worst things to say in the media now-a-days, if you know what I mean.'Love' it isn't a mean thing. And besides who hasn't done it on a couch?So here's the deal the movie 'M-I-III' is-what-it-is, and that's a summer action movie.Like duh, it's not pretending to be Shakespeare, or even Shakespeare with Explosions, it is what it claims to be and it delivers the goods. Nuff said.Lighen up, golly-durn-ding-dang",8,0,1,14 May 2006
The Ring," Yikes! I want my mommy.
","'The Ring' was a movie that I thought was going to be a waste of time. I had no hopes for 'The Ring' as the plot is very similar to a recent release called 'feardot.com.' Which was a very stylish and effective horror flick.Basically 'The Ring' is about a urban legend of a video that once you watch it you die seven days later. In the movie 'feardotcom' once you log in to the site you die in approximately the same time span. There are other plot machinations that also similar which 'The Ring' tries to change in a obvious 10 minute tacked on ending.Unnervingly for me was as the first five minutes of 'The Ring' started I was groaning because it reminded me of the start of countless cheap teenage drive inn slasher flicks. With two girls spending the night together alone with the parents out-on-the-town they try to scare each other with urban legends. Then one tells the story of the videotape that once you watch it you die seven days later. What follows was quite creepy and made me realize that director Gore Verbinski wanted to lull you into thinking it was going be a cheap teenage drive inn slasher flick.One of the girls has actually seen the video, with her boyfriend and a group of their friends. Well you can imagine what their fate is.Now a relative of the deceased girl, Rachel Keller, Naomi Watts, is an investigative reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer, who is asked to look into the strange death. Rachel agrees and soon comes across the video and watches it. Soon Rachel realizes that she's racing against the clock to solve the mystery before her seven days are up. Add to that, her son has accidentally seen the video too.What follows is one of the creepiest and compelling horror movies I have seen in awhile. Pay attention or you might make the mistake of assuming there are plot holes in the story. Also the black and white video is an eerie macabre piece of work that was a very effective component to the story.I do find weakness with the ending as I feel it was a rushed tacked piece to avoid to close a comparison with 'feardotcom'Finally I do want to admit that 'The Ring' got me to jump a couple times like I haven't jumped in years. At one point I even launched my bucket of popcorn out of my lap. Embarrassing when that happens to us, however it makes us laugh to be that startled. So I say give  'The Ring' a shot.",8,0,0,4 November 2002
Star Trek," My brother old school Trekkies...it is indeed very Good!
","Yes it is sad there is no Shatner....however you are not given any time to contemplate his absence because this movie waste no time in putting the story into Warp Drive.....There is many things that this movie takes the time to acknowledge about what us 'Trekkies' already know that you have to say, 'thank you' to the writers and that maverick director...but shortly the rug is pulled out from underneath the 'Star Trek' universe....very clever and original......I actually was trying to resist liking this movie...being an old school Trekkie......The movie won me over in about 15 minutes..... Yes this young cat playing Captain Kirk.....tried to make the role his own...and I admire his effort....but...perhaps because of what I know of the character, and the natural, association with the Shatner....it was inevitable that the audacious and cavalier personality of Shatner played to my heart strings.But for you newbies to Star Trek, and skeptics....well...I think you're going to enjoy the future....It has been awhile since I wanted to go out and see a movie again the very next day...Summer is off to a good start.....",8,5,12,8 May 2009
Troy," Not so bad, not so good.
","I'm not sure about the wisdom of casting pretty boy Pitt as Achilles. Though Pitt is extraordinarily talented, as in Snatch, Legends of the Fall, he was not formidable enough to be a legendary Greek warrior. The scene in which Achilles is training his cousin with wood practice swords look so much like the neighbor kids playing around.I was disappointed with the scene where supposedly Achilles and Hector face off in a battle and everyone stands around to watch as if it was an after school fight in the apple orchard.I was impressed with Eric Bana's Hector and enjoyed his moments on the screen.However Orlando Bloom is another pretty boy who was not convincing. I will always fondly remember him as Legolas.One enjoyable part for me was that I found myself cheering for both Hector and Achilles and was torn by their climatic finale.Summer eye candy, popcorn munching, sword and sandal epic that, though not great, is light years better then Van Helsing.",5,1,2,18 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," LSD Pirates of the Caribbean.
","Okay, I know this movie is a HUGE international success, but that don't mean anything. I mean really the majority isn't always right, just check your history for that.So let's analyze this shallowly 'In Depp' flick. Other then the Hollywood contrived turd teeth, there isn't one remotely probable authentic 'Pirate trait' anywhere with in a Ka Zillion million one hundred thousand ba billion lite nautical years of this preposterous, pretentious, and decaying gas bloated flick.Money can buy many things but it cannot buy intrinsic value. But alas my little pretty popcorn munchers, there's so much to be distracted by. There's this, there's that. And there is some off fluff and air puffed frosting. Not to mention it all cost so much to produce. So that alone is worth the fashionable wasting of your time-and easily earned cash-to see, so you can brag, and verbally preen in front of your friends gushing 'Oh I saw Pirates and it was three hours long and I had too go to the bathroom much, and often.'",3,0,2,18 June 2007
Wanted," Preposterous Action and Orgy of Glorified Violence.
","A slick looking hyper-adrenaline-rush contrived-flick with an absurdity quotient 15 points off the credibility scale, may entertain some whom may still believe that Mad Max was a real person, and that Santa Claus, The Tooth Fairy, and Wrestlmania are real.Yesh there are fine performances by McAvoy and Mr. Freeman, Jolie looks fine and sultry in a smoky come hither-I'm gonna beat your ass then apply my considerable lippage to yours-kinda way.But the general premise of a 'Fraternity' of Assassins and there naturally gifted enhanced physical abilities wears wispy thin in the opening sequence, where an Assassin can manage to pump up his heart rate and adrenaline so he can run and propel himself through significantly sturdy Office Building plate glass window-with out having to blink or close his eyes-then able to still have enough momentum to streak-in mid air-across almost to another building while shooting pistols and automatic weapons accurately, before losing a few feet of elevation and crash through another plate glass Office building.The movie attempts to get clever with the plot and doesn't work with any believability at the end, and actually caused me to groan out loud.Of course this movie has a steady stream of well crafted action sequences that will surely keep most entertained; well those who secretly wish they could be an Assassin with Angelina Jolie as their personal trainer.The movie manages to directly insult it's audience towards the end, and I was like, 'I am no such thing', well that's not exactly what I was thinking but you get the drift.There is also a laughable attempt at visual allegory towards the end, hinting at the 'oh what a tangled web we weave..etc, etc, blah, blah.' I don't mind suspending my disbelief on a movie where there is some attempt to explain the unbelievable premise, such as 'Ironman' 'The Incredible Hulk' etc. but this flick I just couldn't hang with.",3,15,44,30 June 2008
Van Helsing," Oh my God! 110% pure glitzy spilth and detritus
","Not since shattering my ankle and pulling my femur out of its hip socket, in a spectacular car wreck, have I experienced such agonizing torture.The plot and story of Van Helsing is of such an outrageous, far-fetched and preposterous nature that it leaves one staggeringly baffled to where nothing in the movie has any chance of making a lick of sense or have a flicker of appeal.Hugh why? Oh why did you do it? Is it really all about the money? If it is-so early on in your career-about the money then shame on you.
Kate you're desperate since Pearl Harbor to establish your self. I understand, but really other then looking smashing in that leather corset and awesome hip boots, you didn't do your self any favors.There's such a massive overwhelming use of sub quality CGI that entire sections of the film are nothing but laughable at best.There's only the thinnest, wispiest, and flimsiest attempt to explain the gathering together of some legendary monsters. It is just awful, I'm sorry but it is. I'm ashamed of myself for sitting through this loud piece of monumental balderdash.",1,1,2,10 May 2004
Quantum of Solace," Gritty Hands on Bond.
","As most here, I was totally blown away by 'Casino Royale'....and 'Casino Royale' is to Bond movies what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is to Indiana Jones....So I did kind of go in with lowered expectations....But I have to say I did enjoy the movie. Yes I did miss some of the sophisticated suave Bond stylings....yet this almost brutal..unapologetic Bond I found entertaining, distracting....and successful escapism. With that being said....I hope they don't stay with this formula...as I don't think the franchise would have ever attained the success, it has enjoyed, if it had employed this kind of dark and gritty sort of Bond...However it does make for an entertaining time at the movies...",7,0,1,14 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The greatest fantasy film of all time.......so far.
","My anticipation and enthusiasm to see this movie propelled me to see the midnight showing at a multiplex where there were 12 sold-out screens all showing at the exact same time. Needless to say it was sheer delightful mayhem.Consider the first hour and half of TTT to be an eloquent appetizer and sumptuous salad to a filet` mignon and lobster dinner.As mentioned by an astute earlier reviewer Peter Jackson was so wise to hire 'actors' and not 'stars', though now those actors-as a result of 'LotR'-now are stars.Beautiful, inspiring, dark, powerful, funny, breath taking, action-packed.
If you do not like fantasy films stay away. If you have not seen The Fellowship of the Ring stay away. All others attendance is required.",10,0,0,20 December 2002
From Hell," Remarkable, and original
","Is this a cinematic landmark? Not quite, and yet almost. However it doesn't disqualify it from a worthy expenditure of a connoisseur of night movies.I wish that I could find fault with Depp in general, as I have never agreed with his charmed life's spewage. Yet, unarguably he is phenomenally talented, and it cannot be denied, especially by a US peasant such as myself.So with that being said, this is a flick that is exceptional in it's scope and is relentless in the free exploration of possibilities of the times.Controvery, is the least this story, would have been greeted with, had it come out during it's times. Yet it can still rattle a few nerves, while being original, and very will done.Yeah",8,2,3,10 November 2005
The Happening," It was Happening for me.
","I enjoyed this movie knowing I would be in the minority, as I tend to be a bit more discerning in my taste in both books and movies.It is of course understandable why the masses-who have been raised on the top forty pap of todays commercially engineered fare, where demographics are used to gauge and tweak the final product in order to harvest the highest take at the box office-would dislike this movie.MNS I consider to be a modern day artist with a great creative imagination. It takes courage to try and produce an original and creative story that would perplex your average run-of-the-mill, garden variety movie goer, who is easier entertained by comic book plot machinations, where the hero and the villain are drawn out for them, requiring nothing of the movie goers own mental participation.Today our planet, is being inundated with man's scrapping of the planets skin to get at the earthy pustules of fuel, cyclones kill thousands, earthquakes kill more, record tornados, rivers cresting and flooding the mid-west,brain eating lake amoebas, bird flu, mrsa, Ebola, acid rain, flesh eating virus, and man pours millions of tons of contaminates into the air, dumps billions of tons of sewage into the rivers, streams, lakes, and the sea. Last year it snowed in down town Bagdad when it hasn't happened in distant memory, and on the same day a tornado touched down in Vancouer Washington where they have never had tornado's.......so why couldn't the earth evolve a self defense mechanism? Or maybe it has.....and we're beginning to reap the evil we have sown. It so easy to want to see a movie where the villains are laser toting aliens from outer space, or drug crazed murderers, sporting the latest shades, and cool glocks. Or the glamorized conflicted hero who eventually destroy their Nemesis with violence. These movies of course most be decorated up with the latest special effects, explosions, car chases, and/or erotic couplings to further spike the response of the numbed cerebral cortex's of the programmed movie masses so they fork over their money like zombies.No one wants to consider that the collective defense of the planet's flora could ever evolve a way to save itself from the planets real enemy.....us. Movie goers do not want to think of themselves as the evil enemy of Mother Earth....because then how could the movie have a happy ending?This movie also requires the viewer to fill in some of the blanks, MNS doesn't spell it out for you, yet he puts in all the hints, the evidence for you to follow....This is a good satisfying movie, but it is not for everyone. It requires the movie goer to think in the bigger scope of our imagination, where on this bluish orb teeming with life, hurtling through the cold vacuum of eternity, that maybe we really are the earth's terminal illness....and the planet is reacting, with spasms, fevers, and anti bodies..........",8,1,5,18 June 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Yes loved the books, and I love this Movie..So there
","Grand, sweeping, and at times monumental. But nevertheless captures your emotions for the characters in the nostalgic manner, of Tolkien's writing, that makes it-lump-in-your-throat-difficult to say good-bye to these beloved characters. Yes I will treasure this movie and its predecessors till the end of my days.",10,1,2,8 January 2004
