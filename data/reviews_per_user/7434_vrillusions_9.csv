The Ring," leaves you thinking afterwards
","After just seeing it, it wasn't really as scary as I was expecting.  But it definately 'messes with your mind' so to speak.  I haven't seen the original version, so I can't really compare it.  All the actors were very good.  I also like some of the transitions between scenes.  As for it being really scary, depends on just how screamish you are.  What I would suggest, though, is to not read any real in-depth reviews of it since a lot of them might give away too much.  How important is it to see this in the theaters?  not really critical.  I would go to one of the earlier shows to save some money. Although it was interesting having several teenagers in the row behind constantly asking one of them who already saw it if a certain part was going to be scary.  Like other people have said, a lot of the questions that get asked durring the movie are never really addressed.  Can't really say because it might spoil it, but don't get upset if you still have questions afterwards, I think most people will.  I gave it an 8 out of 10",8,0,0,26 October 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," It earned its R rating
","From the opening scene you can tell that this is a musical.  But that didn't dampen the hilarious jokes.  The basic Idea of the movie is that the southpark kids want to see the new terrance and phillip movie.  Once parents realize this is where they are getting their foul language, they then try to attack the source. . .it will be a surprise, trust me.  This movie is hilarious right from the beginning and doesn't stop.  A lot of the humor is really vulgar and they make fun of everyone that is different.  I unfortunately don't get to see the Southpark series on Comedy Central, and I didn't have to.  This is definitely not a film for minors.  And if you are underage, don't think about getting in.  I (18) was carded at the ticket booth, and I then did not turn in the ticket till I was at the entrance to the theatre, to prevent people from sneaking in.NOTE:  There is a special clip at the end of the movie following the credits, don't miss it!I gave it a 9/10 rating.",8,0,0,9 July 1999
The Others," One of the best thrillers in a long time (8/10)
","I am usually not that big a fan of scary movies, since they are usually very typical.  People run around, then they all die along the way, until usually one or two people walk away.  This is BY FAR not typical.  But it is typical in psychological thrillers in that most of the film doesn't make sense until the last half hour or 15 minutes.  But the rest of it is amazing.  Although slow at times, its slow in a way that your still interested enough to pay attention.  All the actors were great, and the twists and turns that take place during the course of the movie are amazing.Rating: 8 out of 10 (Worth the prime time theater prices, and will probably buy it when it comes out on DVD)",8,0,0,13 August 2001
Blade II," Great movie, leave the kids at home
","I saw this film without any knowledge of the background of the movie (i.e., I didn't see the first movie) and that didn't matter.  Enough is explained in one way or another that I didn't have to see the first one and get lost in this film.That being said, the action scenes were phenomenal.  Lots of, well, blade action you could tell was choreographed well and executed perfectly.  Some of the scenes are a little on the gory side, so I wouldn't bring children to this.  The plotline was ok, but nothing special.I would suggest going out to the theaters and seeing this flick, besides seeing all the action on a large screen, the Episode II trailer is before it.  I always see films during the day so it only costs $4.50.  Would I see this at 'prime time'?  Not really, although all the bangs and stereo sound is used superbly (in some scenes, you could hear stuff happening all around you), you can still get a good experience by renting it.  So, basically, if you can get to a movie theater to see it, you'll like it.  If you have to wait till you can rent it, you'll like it (8/10)",7,0,1,23 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great movie, worth the price to see it in the theater
","All I can say is, wow.  This is a great film and the start to what looks like an awesome trilogy.  Even with it being 3 hours long, it wasn't drawn out or anything.  The scenery and the fight scenes, especially the beginning one, were spectacular.  This film is definitely worth the price to see it in theaters.I know people said that the ending was bad, but when you realize that the film is part of a trilogy, that the ending doesn't look as bad.  I never read the books, but from I hear they kept most of the storyline the same as how it was in the book.  9/10",9,0,0,23 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best movie I've seen in a long time
","First off, I just want to say that I have not read the actual books, so can't compare them to the movie.This was the best three hours I have had in a movie theater, period.  The cinematography was great and the acting was excellent.  Gollum, who was focused on a lot of the movie, was done very well.  I was afraid we would have another 'Jar Jar Binks' character.  Fortunately he isn't annoying, and is intriguing enough that you can't help but watch.  Although I'll admit some of his close-ups were a little overdone (too drawn out).As for the numeric rating, there are a few things that I take into consideration; variety and intelligence are the main two.  When I talk about variety, I am talking about all the different elements that are in a movie. Not everyone enjoys the same thing in a movie, so to me variety is key to have something everyone will enjoy.  This movie does just that.  There is comedy, action, suspense, romance, sentimental moments, fantasy, and that's just what I can think of right now.  There will be at least one point in this movie that practically everyone will enjoy.Intelligence can be described as the think-ability factor; do you have to think a little when watching it?  Very few movies out there are like this. The majority of films present everything to you and leaves you, the viewer, with nothing to really think of.  The movie is presented in an interesting way, there are three main story lines happening throughout the film.  You basically are following one story line for a while, then it moves over to something else.  Other's probably describe this as 'jumping around'.  I personally enjoyed it when after a few minutes into the movie I realized that's what was happening.  It makes you think.  You have to almost construct three stories happening at the same time.  I also liked the fact there was no recap at the beginning of the film, it just starts.  That being said, if you haven't seen the first one, you will not enjoy this at all.Since both of those rated really well, and I enjoyed it, that's why I'm giving it a 10 out of 10",9,0,0,24 December 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Excellent movie when you 'stand back'
","I just watched this movie from one of the original VHS tapes (in a book-like box).  And, at first it felt really boring, there was very little dialog, special effects didn't seem that good.  This was until I 'stood back' and realized that all the silence was what was good, and then, when I realize this film was made about a year before men have landed on the moon, it really got me interested in it.  This also got me interested in the special effects which were really ahead of its time.  Even though they can be explained after watching a few 'Movie Magic' episodes, it's still kinda mindblowing, (since you can't explain how its done until after you see it).This is one of those movies where you either like it, or you don't, there is no middle.  All the people that hate it have become numbed by all the fast paced, explosive movies you see today.  Those that love it are really the true move watchers, who go to movies always giving it the benefit of the doubt.  And treat each movie as unique and not trying to compare it to other movies or genres.  I am one of the latter ones, perhaps because I took a TV/Film and Literature class at school, which tought me certain aspects of movies and their meaning and purpose.Another quick thing I like to mention is the truthfullnes of everything. The one explosion that is seen in the move is, in my mind, the only 'true' explosion in space.I know there is alot of speculation about the ending sequence of the movie, which is exactly what Kubrick and Clarke wanted, But most movie goers today don't.  When people go to the movies, most don't like to be left hanging (sorry can't think of any examples at the moment).  They don't like to walk out of a theater (BTW, this is rumored to be re-released to the big screen Dec. 31, 2000 (in honor of 2001)) trying to figure out the ending, people now want to have everything thrown out to them in either dialog or naration, thus giving everyone the same ending.  2001 isn't supposed to have the same ending for everyone, it was made to let each and every person interpet it in there own way without being influenced by others.  If you are looking for some sort of explanation to the end, try searching for ebert's review of the film.If you are thinking of viewing this movie, DO NOT use what I have said to judge if you should see it or not.  Don't use any review here. Like I have told you, every person will see this movie in a different way.  Just pay the few dollors to rent it, or even borrow it off a friend.  It will definitely be worth it just for you to say 'I have seen 2001,' just like you would for any other classic film.Vote: 9/10",9,1,3,17 March 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Great movie that no matrix fan should miss
","I was worried that I would be disappointed from all the hype this movie was getting; that my expectations have been set to high.  I was wrong.  The assembly of the movie is nothing like the first Matrix.  Although it is pretty much linear, there are a lot of flashbacks/flash forwards that make it a little more interesting.The 'Burly Brawl' scene was just amazing.  Especially when you realize that the action sequences are entirely computer generated.  This is the first movie that I have seen computer graphics that did not look like it was computer generated.  A lot of that goes to the technique they used to create the scene, but still amazing nonetheless.As for the rest of the plot, I'm not telling, and hopefully no one else will.  The surprises are what made this both amazing and hilarious.  Even though there was a lot of talk about it being too romantic, that is not true.  Although there were a lot more intimate encounters with Trinity and Neo, and it plays a role in the plot, it does not overburden the movie. There is a couple more fight scenes in this one compared to the first, and they are longer.The Matrix, Reloaded does not revolve around Neo as much as it did in the first one.  This is intentional.  The Matrix was about Neo and his realization about what the matrix is and that he is the one.  Reloaded is concentrated more on the war and the danger it poses on Zion.  It also concentrates on the matrix system a little more as well.  I can't exactly say how it does, since that will give some of the plot away.In conclusion, if you saw The Matrix, then you should go see The Matrix, Reloaded.  9 out of 10.",9,0,0,14 May 2003
The Matrix," Great Movie
","All I can say is, 'WOW'  This movie is great straight from the beginnining. The CG are amazing as well as the camera movements.  The action sequences are also very well done.  At the end of the 'Lobby' fight scene (towards the end of the movie), there were a lot of people clapping and cheering.  I honestly believe this WILL win an oscar for best photography and special effects, and is a definite contender for best picture.  And when you see this movie, you will never really look at the world the same way again, I PROMISE THAT!  Definite must see.",9,0,0,3 April 1999
