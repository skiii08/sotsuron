The Sound of Music," Great!
",I just finished watching it today and I have to say it is amazing. The acting couldn't be done any better. Beautiful scenery helps it set its happy and upbeat mood. And the dramatic scenes at the end have the perfect music to accompany it. Though I have to say that my absolute favorite thing in the movie was the music. It was AMAZING. Every song was done great and easily gets stuck in your head. (Trust me) My favorite is Do-Re-Me. There is no dull or boring moments and Julie Andrews did a terrific job. Overall this movie is perfect for young and old alike. I highly recommend buying it.,10,2,8,5 January 2007
The Shining," One of the Best Horror Movies Ever
","After watching this movie I decided its my favorite horror movie ever. Stanley Kubrick did directing gold with this movie. Every second of it was perfect. But the acting is what makes this movie great. If they would have chosen anyone but Jack Nicholson this movie would not have made it. Just seeing his face as he descends into madness scared me more than any other horror movie I've seen. It also helped greatly that the person that played Wendy actually looked scared to death. The special effects may not be that thrilling for today's standards, but man they scared me more than today's overrated special effects. The plot actually isn't that hard to understand. A man takes his family to a remote hotel to work as a caretaker in the winter while everyone else is gone. But when he gets there the isolation slowly sends him spiraling into the depth of madness. And his wife and pshyic child have to fend for themselves. The scariest thing in this movie is the complete feeling of isolation. How they have nowhere to run and the only means of escape is a big snow cat thing.(not sure what it's called) If you like horror and want to see a movie look no further than the shining.",10,1,2,23 August 2007
Ratatouille," A Very Smart And Well Written Kids Movie!
","I went to see this movie with my parents not expecting to like it. I felt like I have outgrown kid's movies. That's why when I actually saw it and really liked it I was so shocked.The storyline follows a mouse Remmy and his struggles to be accepted by his rat clan. He wants to be a cook and his rat family frowns upon him. That's when he teams up a human cook at a fancy restaurant.It may be a little weird but the plot accompanies the movie perfectly. All the actors succeeded in giving a believable and honest performance. And for the first time in a kid's movie since The Incredibles I felt that the script was smart. There wasn't any cheesy moments when you have to roll your eyes due to the fact it has been done so many times before. Overall the plot, script, and acting blended very nicely.The animation was very beautiful and modern. I also enjoyed how it gave one of the most unlikable animals,the mouse, a cute and likable design. The plot and story is nothing without good animation.If your looking to take your kid's to the movies and find something you'll like as well as they do look no further than Ratatouille. Plus its my favorite Disney/Pixar movie to date. Overall 10/10",10,2,6,16 August 2007
