Sucker Punch," Awful scenario and CG effects.
","Worst movie I've ever seen. But I'll always remember it, as three of my friends left the theater before the end of the movie, I was the only one to stay, just to make sure this movie was complete rubbish till the end.Baseline : A Girl playing a video game while she is dancing and dreaming, and fighting whatever is easy to destroy with nice CG effects (which are horrible) in order to accomplish totally unrelated things in real life. Nothing makes sense and it's not even good to fall asleep as you're still wondering why you choose to see that movie.Picture : The movie was obviously made in a single green room and so does look everything : fake. Even the real characters. Except maybe their tiny little skirts. The visual effects are horrible and you're quite often lost on the screen trying to understand what you are actually seeing.",1,5,14,31 March 2013
