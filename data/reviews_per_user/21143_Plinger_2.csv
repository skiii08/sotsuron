Love and Death," Brilliant intellectual comedy
","'Love and Death' is one of the funniest movies Woody Allen directed. It contains enough slapstick for at least three films. For cineasts it is even more fun to watch it because of the disrespectful insinuations on nearly every film that has been made after a russian  novel. The influences of Dostojewski, Tolstoi, Groucho Marx and Ingmar Bergman are mixed up and the result is an intellectual comedy about a coward named Boris Grushenko who by accident becomes a highly decorated war hero in the russian fight against the invading Napoleon. Allen´s decision to use Sergej Prokofjew´s music contributes to create a bewildering atmosphere.  I liked  'Love and Death' when I was a child because it simply made me laugh.  I even like it more today because every  time watching  it it reveals more of  its subtle humour.",10,6,7,31 January 1999
The Dirty Dozen," Slaughter and Violence
","'The Dirty Dozen' is a horrible film and maybe Aldrich´s worst.American Criminals are trained to kill and in fact they manage to destroy a nazi-headquarters. They slaughter all men and women inside with hand grenades and finally burn them alive. One of the most violent and cynical movies I´ve ever seen. It glorifies war as a gentlemen´s game and if women appear in the film they are shown as objects only designed to satisfy the sexual needs of soldiers. I cannot understand the popularity of this movie which sometimes is called a 'classic'. There are good and there are bad war movies, 'The Dirty Dozen' is a splatter-movie. Even worse is the huge number of sequels.",Null,6,15,8 April 1999
