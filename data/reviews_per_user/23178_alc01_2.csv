Casablanca," The best there ever will be.
","Look up the word 'classic' in the dictionary and Casablanca it there.  It is as perfect as a movie gets.  The writing, the pauses, the looks, the love, the humor - all in perfect time.  The shadows, the music even the background actors and noise blend to make each scene seem real. Even the 'bit players' are some of the best that Hollywood ever had.",10,2,2,1 October 2002
To Be or Not to Be," The best one - -
","Most people have seen Mel Brooks remake of this movie, so it is like watching Jack Benny doing Mel Brooks.  It was clearly the best movie or performance Jack ever gave - all of his radio, television and movie works combined - HE IS GREAT!  Of the two movies, Jack beats Mel hands down, but had it not been for the remake most people would never have know about this one.  The death of Lombarde right after this movie caused it to almost become totally lost - a shame as she is great here as well.  This is a must see for many reasons - Jack, Carol, the laughs and the tears.",10,2,4,9 October 2002
