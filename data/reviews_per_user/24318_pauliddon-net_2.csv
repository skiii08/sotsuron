United 93," Best movie on that day
","It brought United 93 the other day suspecting a load of patriotic bs but was surprised that in fact it was one of the most well done movies in a long time, I brought it for the same reason that it was the same director as Bloody Sunday and thought it would be interesting and I was quite impressed the way it was laid out.And the actual fact the FAA admit they had screwed up seriously after seeing the World Trade Center being hit, the way the passengers fight back and the final shot out the cockpit window of the ground rushing up to hit you in the face, it all feels very real.I do reckon 9/11 was an inside job but still watch it and forget about all that because it is a good movie, even if it is fact or fiction.",7,1,7,16 December 2007
World Trade Center," I could see what they were trying to do but didn't really work
","I was looking forward to seeing World Trade Center since I remember watching it on the news on the day and recently doing research into the fact that it was probably a conspiracy (the facts add up check my website HTTP://www.pauliddon.net/.But it starts out with Nicholus Cage as his usual job as a fire chief and then about six minutes later the first plane Flight 11 is shown as a shadow before hitting the towers, then the shock is showed as they arrive to see some people jumping out of windows and by 20 minutes in they are in the lobby of the South Tower when there is a collapse (explosives of course) and they are pinned down for the rest of the movie, then it cuts between them and their wives watching on TV and finding out the news, they are dug out and then its over, I know it was a tremendous story but it just keeps going on in the dark of buried firemen, I give it a five because I was in a good movie but I wouldn't recommend it!",5,1,3,15 December 2007
