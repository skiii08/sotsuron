"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Delightful film for tolerant viewers
","I really like the tone and feel of this film.  It's a gentle tale of some very different men making their way across Australia, each struggling with their own problems yet still having time to help each other.  Not all folks will appreciate it, but if tolerance is in your blood, you'll like it. My wife and I especially enjoyed Terence Stamp's performance. I think it was a particularly difficult role to play convincingly, but he carried it off magnificently. I highly recommend this picture.",10,1,2,4 January 2003
