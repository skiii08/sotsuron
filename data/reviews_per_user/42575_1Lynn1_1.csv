Casablanca," The timing is important.
",I know the clichÃ©s always fly fast and furious when this film is mentioned but I think it deserves all the praise and attention it receives.One of the things that I think makes Casablanca so special is when it came out - while World War II was still being fought and the Allies could have lost. To me that gives it more emotional appeal than the many many post-war films that depicted anti-Nazi heroics once it was safe to do so.I realize all fans of this film have their own favorite lines but one that always sticks out for me is when Victor welcomes Rick 'Fought in Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War' Blaine back to the fight and reassures him that 'This time I know our side will win.',Null,0,0,14 July 2004
