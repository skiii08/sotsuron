Marie Antoinette," Ennui Antoinette
","I suppose there is something to be said about a movie that I guess intends to show you boredom (and loneliness), but... wow is it boring to watch. I think the story (much like Lost in Translation) is terribly redundant (and in the case of Marie Antoinette, episodic). There is almost no characterization here other than Marie - and I am being polite. Most of her scenes show her alone and inactive (several times in fact, to the point you want to shout at the screen, 'okay I get it.') We get no sense of what Louis's problem really is other than he is a bit shy. We also get absolutely no sense of what is really happening outside the gates of Versailles; which is a valid point for what I believe is Ms. Coppola's intention. More frustrating is that almost none of the supporting characters have story lines that grow toward anything. Nothing in the story builds - except your frustration.",Null,2,3,30 April 2008
