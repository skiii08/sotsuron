First Man," Chazelle is at it again. Also please stop rating this a 1 if you haven't seen it.
","The cinematography could be best described as claustrophobic and it's the perfect way to convey this story. Damien Chazelle is something else. I rank this in between La La Land and Whiplash. It was phenomenal. Ryan Gosling managed to make a boring and the lowest of key hero seem so complex and compelling. I'm very glad I don't have to choose between him and Bradley Cooper, easily the two best male performances I've seen in a long time. Claire Foy..... this was the first work of hers I've seen and I understand why she's so beloved, an absolute talent. It was definitely a slow burn but that final act was probably the most beautifully intense finale I've ever seen. The entire film was just such a technical achievement. I have a weird feeling it's not going to get the full credit it deserves, but this is undeniably another masterpiece at the hand of Chazelle. P.S. that score tho .....",10,11,26,12 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga break your heart
","This is gonna win a ton of awards, and it should. Bradley Cooper had the best performance I've seen in a very long time AND he directed it. Insane. The music is amazing, the acting is unbelievable: Cooper, Gaga, and Sam Elliot all blew me away. Lady Gaga has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard. Such a heartbreaking story about the beauty and evil in life, a genuine masterpiece that won't soon be forgotten.",10,2,3,5 October 2018
Captain Marvel," A great and worthy welcome into the MCU
","Other than Iron Man and Spider-Man, for me, this is the best origin story in the MCU yet. Carol Danvers kicks absolute ass, the skrulls are surprisingly awesome, and Nick Fury in a co-lead/supporting role is perfect. Filled with genuine emotion and some of the best special effects the MCU has seen so far, there's a lot to love and not much to complain about. It takes a little bit to get going, but when it does it soars. The future of Marvel is in really good hands with Captain Marvel and I cannot wait to see her in Endgame. I'm gonna ramble on a bit cuz I'm still hyped, Maria Rambeau is so great every word she said went straight to the heart. Goose is obviously great. Jude Law And Annette Bening were pretty weak to me, but there impact on the plot was at least engaging. Ben Mendelsohn is soooo good, I can't say enough about how cool the skrulls were. The soundtrack slapped. The hero moments were great. Carol's peak power is unrivaled and it's really astonishing to see on the big screen. Overall, an entertaining and emotional quasi-origin story that has the ability to empower you regardless of race or gender. That post credit scene ... unreal",10,10,25,8 March 2019
Aquaman," Posituve direction, but can this save the DCEU?
","The 2nd best DCEU film behind Wonder Woman! Wooh!!!! Honestly this was a bit better than I thought it would be. Jason Mamoa does a solid job here, Amber Heard is a goddess, literally and figuratively, and James Wan shoots a beautiful looking film aside from a few weird CGI uses. The story is pretty similar to Black Panther, but it's not that derivative. There were some cool action sequences and I'll admit Aquaman's official suit was pretty fricken sick, but the music choices were baffling at times. I'm not ready to say this film or character can save the DCEU, it's a very solid superhero movie, but if it was set in the MCU it would certainly be one of the lesser entries. Kudos for not making a film that sucks though, choosing creative directors like James Wan will be key to DC regaining some of its former glory.",6,1,4,21 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great performances - meh everything else
","This would've been so good if, aside from a few moments, knew how to fill in the space inbetween the awesome performances. The strength here lies in Rami Malek as Mercury and the rest of the ensemble, as well as with the greatly shot performance scenes. The weakness lies in just about everything else. They managed to make 'Queen' seem very vanilla and formulaic during any part that didn't include singing until roughly the last 20 minutes of the film (which did its best to try and redeem the previous 2 hours). Overall I don't think it's as poorly done as the critics are suggesting and I don't think it's as wonderful as most fans are suggesting.",6,2,5,5 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Long live the Spider-Verse, just outstanding.
","This is a straight up animated masterpiece. The animation style, the universe(s), the voice acting, the story telling, everything is amazing. I feel bad for the other animated films this year, because Into the Spider-Verse blows them all out of the water. It's hard to believe this is the same animation studio that made the smash hit The Emoji Movie. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still my favorite from the hero, but this one is not far behind. My only, tiny complaint is that the villains weren't very fleshed out, but with the multiple Spider men and women needing adequate backgrounds and screen time, I can easily look past it. This is a superhero movie for the typical fans or the oblivious viewer, creating the always beautiful message that anyone can wear the mask. We're all a lit bit Spider-Man.",10,20,43,14 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Part of the Journey is the End
","Part of the Journey is the End. An absolute triumph of cinema. The perfect conclusion, and undeniably the most emotional MCU film to date. I cried from start to finish. You can have The Godfather, Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, or any of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but to me this is the greatest movie of all time and I will never concede that it is not. Something like this will never be accomplished so perfectly tragic and beautiful at such a grand scale ever again. It's a momentous achievement in cinema, and I fear it will be taken for granted when it's all said and done.",10,0,3,26 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino capitalizes on his goldmine of talent
","Definitely coulda shaved 15-20 minutes off, but I'll let it slide cuz this was clearly a Tarantino passionate project (even moreso than his others). I can't imagine Leo not winning every award come award season, and Brad was as phenomenal as ever. I would've liked to see more of Margot Robbie, but even in her disappointingly limited screentime she literally and figuratively shined. Overall, it's definitely one of the better movies I've seen in a very long time, and even if it's runtime was exhaustive the ending made everything worth it and more.",9,28,46,27 July 2019
Logan," One of Cinema's Greatest Films, Regardless of Genre
","Simply put the best and most human superhero film to date. The trailer itself was beautiful and heightened my expectations for the film. As soon as the film begins you knew you were experiencing something different and refreshing. It breaks the flashy and clichÃ© mold often exhibited by Marvel's most noteworthy blockbusters. Instead of the flashiness 'Logan' is more of a neo-western than it is a superhero movie and that creative decision pays off immensely. Incredibly violent, but the violence is earned, unlike other comic book movies, 'Logan' shows you the consequences of violence in the most visceral way. Beautifully filmed, directed, scored, and acted. The movie itself and its leading trio of Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and the incredibly talented newcomer Dafne Keen were all worthy of serious Oscar consideration. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart, not only was it the perfect swan song to Hugh Jackman's tremendous run as Wolverine, but of the countless movies I have had the pleasure of viewing this was the only one that successfully and shamelessly moved me to tears. It was a pleasant surprise to experience a movie starring a superhero that felt genuinely intimate with believable stakes. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to take the time to watch 'Logan' in both it's theatrical and black and white 'Noir' cut as well.",10,1,2,21 August 2018
Creed II," Another great addition to the timeless saga
","To clear the air: it was absolutely formulaic, completely predictable, and not quite as good as the first. The story was not as strong ... BUT, it was still very good. There's something about boxing/combat movies that are so compelling and this was no exception. Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan, and Tessa Thompson (even though she was a bit underwritten) were all as good as they were in original if not better. They even managed to make Creed's adversary sympathetic, and while you weren't rooting for him, you definitely felt and understood his motivation. The fight scenes were choreographed amazingly and definitely packed a physical and emotional punch (lol) I thought the music was a good choice and while the score wasn't always the strongest there were still solid moments. I nearly cried when the Rocky theme came on it was beautiful. I don't think there was a dry eye in the entire theater you could feel the energy building with each punch. While it's not as good as the original it's still a hell of a boxing movie and just a good movie in general.",8,5,9,24 November 2018
Green Book," A beautiful film, with beautiful performances and an even more beautiful message
","I'm officially on the bandwagon, this was magnificent. It's a beautiful story to begin with, but Viggo and Mahershala give other-worldly performances that elevate it to even greater heights. Visually the film was nice too, there weren't any magnificent set pieces or anything like that but there was an intimacy to the cinematography that I haven't noticed in many other films. I'm sure people will complain that it's a little fluffy, but it took on very sensitive subject matter head-on and did it in a way that forced the viewer to confront their own beliefs in the process. Personally, I loved it and I'm going to remember the way it made me feel. I understand it takes more than just a film to change people's perspectives, but as this one said 'it takes courage to change people's hearts'.",10,2,6,22 November 2018
