The Blair Witch Project," Not THAT Original (Achtung Spoilers)
","First of all, I have to say that BWP is a milestone in the movie industry. To compare it with Citizen Kane is probably too much, but they have at least one similarity: both has been claimed to have invented new concepts in moviemaking, both are not that original. Many techniques credited to Kane as it being the first film to use them have been used in other movies before. BWP, too, is not very original in the idea, because The Last Broadcast precedes it by a year. For some reason, though (I suspect wrong marketing strategy), TLB never came to be known so widely as BWP, and so people say BWP is a pioneering movie.Now about the ending, I would have to warn for spoilers here because you're not going to see what you expect to see. The movie has developed fear from the beginning by not doing what most other horror movies normally do: show the monster. And if the ending had been you seeing the Blair Witch, it would indeed have been an anticlimax and killed the whole movie altogether.
Last words: even though this film would never make it to my top ten favorite list, it does make it to my list of must-see movies. If you plan to see it in a movie theatre bring a plastic or paper bag in case you wanna throw up. Not because you see some ugly monster, but from the jittery cameras.",Null,0,1,9 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Anakin
","Underneath the Jedi lightsabre fights and breathtaking special effects, George Lucas has succeeded in making a great story for his fourth (or first, depending on how you look at it) Star Wars movie. This is not just a sequel that was made because Lucas wants more money (although of course, that would be one of the reasons too), but also because he has a story to tell: that even the sickest, cruelest, Hannibal Lecter meets Jack the Ripper villain was once a cute little boy. How in the world that the cute boy ever develops to be Darth Vader, that's the story of Star Wars Episode I through III.This is the movie for everybody, which works in different levels for different person. Kids would love the robots and the lightsabre and the wacky characters like Jar Jar Binks. Grown ups would wonder how they made that CGI look incredibly real. As for me, the top reason why I watched this movie was Natalie Portman.Aren't you looking forward to Episodes II and III (and, if Lucas remains true to his words, three other Star Wars movies)?",1,0,1,9 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," What? THAT's a hobbit?
","The problem of this movie is, its slow pacing. The story is very simple: someone has to deliver something to someplace. I don't mind all the little details, which makes Middle Earth so realistic and alive, but please don't linger on one topic forever when it could be done in 5 seconds! The casting for Gandalf and other human beings are great, but totally wrong for all hobbits. They look too much like men, and the casting of Elijah Wood is especially catastrophic, since he's too cute to play a hobbit. At least make'em smaller! They can make Gary Sinise's lower leg to disappear in Forrest Gump, why can't they make'em smaller?",1,1,6,10 January 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Divided Opinion
","The opinions about this movie seem to be divided between 'Five Star' and 'Five Rotten Eggs'. I know why: most of IMDB voters come from North America and Europe, not China or Southeast Asia. They are not used to the martial arts movies where1. people 'float' because they can make their bodies light as a feather and 2. if you hit somebody on the right positions in his body with your finger he cannot move until someone releases him and 3. there is a poison that can reverse the direction of your blood circulation.As a result, some people are very amazed and say, 'This is better than the Matrix!' while others unimpressedly say 'This has gone too far! What is this thing, walking on water and floating in the air!'I come from Southeast Asia, and therefore am quite used to the martial arts movies from China. This is why I could concentrate more to the other aspects as acting, story, and directing.The acting and directing part is superb. I never doubted the ability of Ang Lee or Michelle Yeoh, but before I watched Anna and the King I never really took Chow Yun Fat seriously. To me he was just another greedy actor from Hong Kong who stars in nine or ten movies in a year and still want to record an album just for the sake of money. I guess he has changed dramatically and do quite well in this movie, although it was not an Oscar performance.I find the story a little disturbing, especially with the character of Jen Yu (original Shiao Lung) who seems to be too 'Flower Generation'-ish for the setting era. It was like, what, China in the third, fourth century before Christ, and the sex revolution has already begun in China. That is not how a chinese girl at the time would have done, and without proper explanation too! I mean how is it possible for a woman to hate and fear a man a minute, and fall in love and have sex with him the next.Not that the character is shallow. Jen Yu is a rebel child who wants to get away from her parents' overprotective hands. And she has a frightening talent with the sword. That is a powerful combination that makes her so dangerous, but thirsty of love at the same time. But still I need an explanation about that sex scene.But in the end, I should say that this movie is far different than any other martial arts movies I have ever seen (the ones that are usually directed by Tsui Hark and starred Jet Lee or Andy Lau). The story is not as simple as 'he-killed-my-father- now-I'm-gonna-have-revenge'. It is far more developed and complex, and quite touching.So for all of you who haven't watched it, do so. It would give you a picture of what's happened (and happening) in the chinese movie industry for the past couple of decades. For all of you who have watched this movie, expect more from the new generation of chinese directors like Ang Lee, John Woo, and Tsui Hark. They're invading Hollywood like storm!",Null,0,0,22 January 2001
Mulholland Drive," Inexplicable
","I have never seen a David Lynch film before, and was not quite prepared of what I was going to see in Mulholland Dr. As it turned out, the first few scenes proved to be quite weird, although you can still figure out what's going on, more or less. After a while, you can't follow the story anymore, but strangely you're not bored because there's suspense in every corner. You still hope that there is an explanation; you still hope that the different stories would somehow connect with each other, like in Pulp Fiction, but in the end of the movie you realize that they don't.The atmosphere is quite surreal, and more than once I feel like I was watching a very long 'Black Hole Sun' video, only without the song and with dialogues. If you're into 'normal' films, don't watch this movie. But if you have an open mind, you might as well try.",Null,0,1,11 January 2002
Life Is Beautiful," How could one not love this movie?
","This movie will make you smile, laugh, but also cry. I have only seen two films from Roberto Benigni (Il Mostro and this) and he's already on my second place of Top Ten Favorite Directors of all time. Guido (Roberto Benigni) is a guy who came to a big town to open a bookstore. There he met a beautiful teacher named Dora (played by Benigni's real wife, Nicoletta Braschi), and, after 'stealing' her heart from her fiance and a funny romance, married her. On their son's fifth birthday, they had to go to a concentration camp. But Guido didn't want his son to be sad, so he kept the kid's spirit high and made him believe that life is really beautiful. Truly one of the best movies of all time.",10,1,2,3 March 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Give me the creeps
","I saw this movie a couple of days after I saw 'The Exorcist' for the first time, and what do you know: I got more creeps watching 'Eyes Wide Shut' than 'The Exorcist'. Like what Chris Carter says, it's not what you see that makes you frightened, it's what you don't see. After watching 'The Exorcist' I could still go home alone at night, but not after watching 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Coward eh?",Null,0,0,7 June 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not for those who has not read the book.
","First, the bad things:I know it's not easy for anybody to make a Harry Potter movie, especially since the book provides a story that is so rich in details and imaginative. Take the move of setting from Privet Drive to the Hut-on-the-Rock. The movie doesn't give enough explanation of that, and therefore only those who have read the book would understand. Of course there are very few people in Europe and North America who hasn't read the book(s), but the filmmakers should also consider other parts of the world where Harry Potter is not quite as popular.The difference between the four houses is not explained at all, and therefore it causes some wonder why Harry said to the Sorting Hat, 'Anything but Slytherin'. What's wrong with Slytherin? the 'Muggles' may ask.Another thing, Hermione cannot seem to make up her mind about what to call he-who-must-not-be-named. Even in one scene (when the trio are talking near the fireplace) she called him 'you-know-who', and then 'Voldemort'. And in the book we know that the reason Harry's scar hurt when he first saw Snape was because Snape 'looked past Quirrell's turban' but this was not showed in the movie.Now: the good things: All in all, I should say a very impressive movie and one that shouldn't be missed if you're a Potter-mania. The kids don't act very well but the grown-up actors and actresses are of top quality. Alan Rickman is especially great. Can't wait for the sequel.",1,2,7,2 December 2001
