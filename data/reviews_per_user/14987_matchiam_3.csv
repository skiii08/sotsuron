Men in Black 3," Production distractions & no surprises or imaginative design
","I'm giving Men in Black a 4 due to the fact that it was so predictable and similar to the first 2 movies. Familiarity is important for most entertainment media however similarity breeds boredom. They also lost the comedic edge the first 2 movies had. The first 2 movies had some surprises in the scenes and imaginative characters wherein this one didn't really shock you or surprise you in any of the sets or the designs of any aliens. There was an unexpected thing that happened also. This movie was obviously shot in 3d. Which meant that some of the scenes were blurry as they were changed into 2d. It was also painstakingly obvious that it was shot in high def and digital because you could see the makeup lines and the dye job on Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Was it good clean fun ? Yup. They channeled the autistic guy from Fringe too hard w/ the Time Traveler though & his wardrobe was over done..... I think Hollywood is going to have to re-think some things: like, allowing people to look naturally beautiful. The days of using make-up to accentuate features that get washed out because of stage lighting are gone. We can see everything now. Like eye contacts circles. Looking forward to watching a movie in the theater where you aren't distracted by wardrobe.",4,5,8,25 June 2012
Joker," #Joker Stand Alone Movie: Should be left alone or be toned down for general consumption
","I'd say the character that #Joaquin portrays could've been in any other story or franchise & it would be seen as disturbing & too dark for the mainstream. It was well acted & tears down the 'suspension of disbelief' which takes the character out of the campiness that #Joker's portrayal has been in the past. If fans of the #DC stories can see this as a 'What if?' or #Elseworlds story: then it's easier to swallow. I think for that reason alone, it hasn't been removed from mainline theaters.It's a sad look at mental illness in real world settings that depict a part of what's going on around us w/a political tone that's definitely social commentary.In reality, it very narrowly captures an element of the DCU within Gotham (that could very easily be New York or San Francisco, or at least the most lowest income areas of both w/a little bit of LA thrown in). That sets the tone: the familiarity with the underside of society that we all hope will 'just go away' or 'is someone else's problem. We see a common enemy of big pharma & Capitalism gone bad. We see a person seeking help (albeit through a broken system, that may have been forced on him). Then we see a man, who through the eyes of mental illness, comes to a breaking point. A breaking point we can all sympathize with. A breaking point, that we think might not be his own fault. Therein lies the rub: we relate & disgust ourselves a little, and yet we can't look away at this travesty. That's why it's disturbing. We all find ourselves just 5 minutes away from making similar choices.This movie takes us to the precipice of normality & morality then takes a magnifying glass to our psyche.Here's to hoping for a longer edition that works out even more of that complexity or at least a second one to explore that depravity & not make just another 'violence for violence sake' comic book storyline.",6,0,1,7 October 2019
The Wolverine," As a movie-watcher: feh, as a fanboy: upset & disappointed.
","There are bad edit points, disappearing props, plot holes. @Rila Fukushima (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3822462/?ref_=rvi_nm) brings it & I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman for trying to rescue this. Do NOT go to see this in 3D.We noticed every possible mistake.. the teaser during the credits is one of the only saving aspects of the movie. There are seriously silly novice mistakes in the movie... one we call the 'floating chopsticks' where they mysteriously reappear in one scene, there's the 'claw caress' where someone's hand just disappears in another.. then towards the end, there's the 'Was that a Si Box?' scene where this huge prop is given to someone- then flat out disappears... not to mention once Wolverine totally impales someone dramatically w/a close-up & seconds later one of the other cohorts just picks him up, like, 'shake it off buddy, I gotcha...'. Or how about- 'There's a ninja-like guy sitting on the roof 100 feet away & the place is guarded to the teeth w/armed samurai-like trained men & hundreds of people, and not one other than Wolverine notices?' REALLY?! I have a pet peeve in quality movies: Do NOT do flashbacks of what we just saw 15 mins ago- it's a waste of production, time & money. It not only insults our intelligence, but, calls attention to poorly written dialogue and acting, if they can't convey the importance of the moment- this is a directors cop-out & trap. Then there's the time warp, whereas this is supposed to occur after X3 (which they clearly demonstrate w/in 5 mins. of the film) and the original comic book Lady Deathstrike story is blown to bits. The original story took place when the X-Men were just beginning & Kitty Pryde had only just visited the team & hadn't joined. I would guess that the girl who plays 'Yukio' is a nod to the Lady D (Yuriko) story but for the movie is merged into Mariko's (the love interest) character whereas her father is the Silver Samurai (Notice the similarities in the names?). Which if it followed the original writings, would make her Lady D. As a fanboy, that's where I was disappointed. As a movie watcher- I would lump this movie into the same area where poorly screen-written James Bond flicks are stored in my grey mass. I say poorly written because this movie depends on the acting of one man, with boatloads of action to carry it. Not to mention the obvious distaste for the main character by some woman who is saved by him, who ends up sleeping with him. The plot hole in the movie that coincides with this is that there is no leading up to romance between said hero & damsel in distress. Another similarity is the campy villain: They created another character: Viper. I guess they couldn't afford the real Silver Samurai story. Inasmuch as I enjoy what they did w/this character as a villain- they just don't show her colors in the writing & story. She's just some self-serving denigrate mutant who they try to squeeze into the story. Lastly, as my friend likes to point out- these days studios like to give away best scenes in the trailers & sneaks- and the bullet train scene is one of those.The supporting acting of Rila Fukushima added a lot to the movie- as she is boatloads of attitude, skills, action & style. She deserves a spin-off. The tribute to Stan Lee at the beginning of the movie was really cute. Guess they couldn't afford his standing cameo for all Marvel films... -There is one classic Background Actor Lurker moment that was hilarious to me- he should be given an award- when Viper is meeting someone in one of the seedy parts of town- when they meet, there's this Extra who's making a face and looking all over ridiculously, way exaggerated. To me, that was classic & at the same time showed the novice production of this film.DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS IN 3D AT ARCLIGHT THEATRES. THE GLASSES LOW QUALITY DIMINISH THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE FILM, plus- it just wasn't made to be a 3D cinematic experience.There is so much more to be said, but, there's only so much room.",5,5,11,14 August 2013
