Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Highly overrated
","VOL. 1 was a decent (yet overrated) movie filled with good action & mystery regarding the characters. As more is revealed in VOL. 2, the story was very lackluster. With less action & scenes of uninteresting dialogue, I was unsure why everyone claimed this was better than VOL.1. If you edited both movies together in a 2 1/2 movie, it would be much better than sitting through 2 dialogue volumes, but Quentin would have made less money that way. This would have worked much better if the action & dialogue were more evenly distributed instead of 1 being mostly action & 2 mostly dialogue. 1 was filled with more 70's elements & pop culture references & 2 lacked that feel IMO.",3,9,17,7 August 2004
