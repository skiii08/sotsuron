The Avengers," Disney Marvels at Whedon Assembly
","If you have been a fan of the core Marvel Studios' films since 2008's IRON MAN, where the beginnings of the 'Avengers Initiative' were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER, then the AVENGERS will not disappoint. In fact, it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren't as good as this fast- paced, funny, superhero showdown.Marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the Disney banner – and they no doubt wish that the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises could return to their fold, as it was the success of these earlier films that brought Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy – and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike; by Odin's beard, Sir Kenneth Branagh directed THOR. Enter Joss Whedon, who created a weekly TV show in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that was a near-perfect example of a live-action comic book, to deliver a heavily-anticipated yet so-easy-to-fail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked. And worked it did.The film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as Loki, Thor's mischievous half-brother, played with a Anthony Hopkins-worthy sneer by Tom Hiddleston, appears, escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a SHIELD HQ as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including Stellan Skarsgard's Dr. Selvig, also of THOR, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, getting the full movie treatment here, all under the semi-impotent glare of Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed spy Nick Fury. Obiously Loki never saw Samuel L's wallet from another film.The movie picks up with the re-introduction of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow as Whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in BUFFY if he had an Avengers-sized budget backing him up, but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, finally appear and, of course, get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor/shield/hammer. Once the team finally assembles, insanity, and the hilarity that often follows, ensues. Oh, and Mark Ruffalo proves that the Hulk can indeed smash.Joss Whedon's adept skills, he also writes the screenplay, prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of Thanos, the mainstream movie audience who thinks that Tony and Pepper are destined for each other, and his own loyal, core fan base of Browncoats. Each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page. The rough-up dust-up of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a street-level brawl in NYC against, what else, an invading alien army, could very well have became tedious, as admittedly, the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless, forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures, but the action, humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen.2008 saw the release of both IRON MAN and Warner Bros.' DARK KNIGHT. The result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow. In 2012 that bar was set yet again. What remains to be seen is if the upcoming DARK KNIGHT RISES film, as well as the sequels for IRON MAN, THOR and CAPTAIN America, will continue to raise that bar, or if they will all just... assemble.",10,5,11,11 May 2012
The Young Victoria," Victoria not quite as special as Elizabeth
","THE YOUNG VICTORIA (2009), directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, is a simple love story and performs a great job at romanticizing such by wooing the heart of many a teen and twenty-something girl who still wish they were a princess with a showcase of glamorous balls, elaborate costumes and a good-looking prince with a sharp accent. For every other demographic watching the film, this reviewer included, the political intrigue of a dying king, an overbearing mother and a manipulative PM, however, isn't quite as rewarding.Emily Blunt, who, as it has been noted, fought for this role, passing on the opportunity to co-star in the comicbook film IRON MAN 2, proved that she had every right to play the monarch and did so with a beautifully royal countenance. Along side of her, Rupert Friend is both dashing and enjoyable as her loving paramour bringing an elegance to an otherwise everyman role.Where the film fails, if the telling of two people successfully in love is a failure, is that aside from the romantic yearning and positively – ahem – Victorian dating rituals practiced within, the viewer does not get to witness the social policies that her reign was responsible for or any true conflict thereof. She has almost already won before the film ends. In contrast, Shekhar Kapur's ELIZABETH (1998) weds the yearning of romance with hard, state-wide deliberations and a very dangerous conflict, thus creating a more compelling film.The conflict in this film comes as a result of two different characters and types of love. The first is Paul Bettany in an outstanding performance as Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's PM. Melbourne courts Victoria and offers love but his is a love of power with wedding Victoria as a clever and manipulative means to grabbing all. The other is King William played by Jim Broadbent, truly the king of acting nobility, who loves his niece and realizes that his own paternal instincts were denied by allowing the Duchess of Kent, her mother, to control every aspect of the young soon-to-be-queen's life. Alas, Broadbent's scenes are shorter than a drink of champagne and Bettany's are as political as the U.S. President in any Jerry Bruckheimer presentation.THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an enjoyable, romantic film to watch with clever dialogue and outstanding locations. However, the Young Victoria will always be a girl when compared the rich majesty that was Elizabeth.",6,2,2,1 October 2010
Coraline," Henry Selick's animation masterpiece
","Henry Selick, director of cult-classic and animation masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, offers up another piece of animation magic and proves that he can do so without the creative help of Tim Burton. Of course, working from a story written by graphic novel wizard Neil Gaiman certainly has its advantages.The star and titular character of the story, Coraline, is the perfect imaginative kid for a perfect imaginative tale, set in a similar vein as the children from Narnia or even Dorothy Gale if both were re-imagined by the aforementioned Tim Burton, even though Gaiman is absolutely no stranger to all things eerie as this tale clearly shows. Coraline, voiced by Dakota Fanning, is a bit of an A-type brat and ignored by her typically over-worked 21st Century parents who spend more time in front of a laptop screen than listening to their only offspring. And so the tale begins.Coraline is whisked away into the troublesome but adventuresome (and aren't they always?) 'Other' world where, at first, her Other-Mother and Other-Father treat her to a royal treatment, one not used to back at her real home. Then, as is apt to occur with such fairy tales, the young girl indeed finds out that strange things are afoot at the Circle K. Meanwhile, the viewer is whisked away into yet another gorgeous world of stop-motion animation where Selick's imaginative realism borders on pop-art candy for kids and something more sinisterly macabre that would certainly induce nightmares for the under-10 crowd, which includes ghost children, a wanna-be mouse-circus ringleader, and retired actresses whose age could be counted like the rings of a tree.As it is easy enough to imagine, the promises and threats of the Other-world soon have real implications in the real one. Selick treats the viewer into stunning images of cobwebs, raindrops and creepy spaces along with a fun cast of characters, including a know-it-all cat perfectly voiced by Keith David. Aside from the goth-lite plot and a nearly-too convenient wrap-up, Selick does his very best to keep the craft of his animation at the peak of its form while also using it to benefit the story, something that Burton seemed to forget in the not- quite-as-hip CORPSE BRIDE (2005).Fun, beautiful to watch and perhaps mistargeted to a kiddie crowd that Pixar usually caters to, CORALINE is a winner. And, perhaps if released in Pixar-free year, would have been an Oscar winner as well.",9,4,4,11 June 2012
Argo," The 'Fake Picture' becomes a real hit
","In the film ARGO, producer Lester Siegel, played by Academy Award winner Alan Arkin, puts forth real effort into making a fake film a success as a perfect ruse to rescue six wanted Americans hiding at the Canadian Ambassador's residence during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. The triple-threat of Ben Affleck (ARGO's Producer-Director-Star) must have channeled the spirit of Siegel (the character for the film was the amalgamation of real-life f/x coordinator Bob Sidell and producer Barry Gellar) as he, along with fellow producers and Hollywood heavies George Clooney and Grant Heslov, created a very real, very memorable film crafted with the utmost of professionalism in detailing the story's plight and rescue.Affleck ups his game with his third directorial stint and moves away not only from his usual Boston locales but also from the present day. In doing so, he completely immerses the viewer into the period of the film. Alongside the requisite horror show that was the 70s fashion style as well as carefully-placed Star Wars memorabilia – that no doubt brought a tear to the eyes of fanboy friend Kevin Smith – Affleck restaged the storming of the US embassy with the all-too real documentary feel and cast lesser-known actors into the roles of the Americans allowing their performance, not their celebrity status, to carry the show.Interchanged with this, is the flawless, and at times welcoming, editing of the situation in LA as Affleck's character, CIA operative Tony Mendez, wheels and deals with Hollywood to create a tight cover story, the kind that only Tinseltown can. Affleck portrays LA as an open, bright and aloof place, contrasting the tight, grainy and oppressive situation in Tehran. Modern-day Hollywood itself makes the most subtle of appearances during the film's climax through some of the drama during the airport escape including an almost-forced chase scene. Backed with John Goodman's smile and Bryan Cranston barking orders like he's on the set of a Glen Larson TV show, Affleck delicately builds the tension leading up to the escape. Much like Cameron's TITANTIC, the ending of the film is known, but the wielding of the personal dynamics, which is just one of reasons that made THE TOWN so incredibly good, proves Affleck's acumen. Affleck provides a fast-paced, suspenseful and, at times, humorous film that makes for great storytelling. Even more importantly, ARGO furthers solidifies Affleck's talent as writer/director and distancing himself from his roles in a host of truly-poor rom-coms and actioneers from the early 2000's.",10,2,5,19 October 2012
Us," This is not... Us
","Jordan Peele no doubt wants each of his artistic creations to stand on their own.They do. And they should.And yet.The Academy Award-winning behemoth that is Get Out will always be his benchmark. And rightfully so. That said, for his sophomore film, Us, as enjoyable as it is, is a tougher film to get in.Whereas Get Out could be plainly viewed as a thriller, the viewer is dared to dive deeper into the social commentary for an ironically more-satisfying story. With Us, Peele is asking for a much deeper, and not quite as refreshing dive.
Us is beautifully made and fantastically acted. Lupita Nyong'o elevates every film she is in. Academy take note: she has space on a shelf for more Oscar gold. She plays the matriarch of a normal family out on vacation who must soon race from death, and scissors, by insane jumpsuit-wearing versions of themselves. 'We're Americans,' the mirror-mirror version of Nyong'o boasts. True that, but for a voyeuristic film, Peele keeps any origin-story insights in a tight, ahem, twilight zone.Peele clearly has a message to broadcast on duality. Everyone wears masks; some are simply more noticeable. He is asking the viewer to decide on which shadow runs the longest. Unfortunately this duality makes Us a more uneven film than it should be.Us isn't sure if it should be slasher horror or a meta comedy. As a result, the horror scenes appear unintentionally humorous. The comedic beats too much of a stretch.If anything, the film is original. And enjoyable. Unfortunately, his Shyamalan-istic reveal is more of head scratcher than head turner.",8,0,2,4 June 2019
Troy," Modern look at the Classics: clumsy, rugged yet grand.
","Like the sacrificial ox burning to honor ancestors, TROY pays significant homage to the epics that have come before. For a 21st Century Hollywood Machine production on one of the Classics, and taking into account how LORD OF THE RINGS totally spoiled us when it comes to such adaptations, TROY doesn't fare too poorly. Perhaps a little clumsy and rugged at times, especially in the editing, but the well-done casting is able to polish a bit of grandeur onto the epic.Wolfgang Petersen, along with screenwriter David Benioff, present not only a digestible rendition of Homer's poem crafted for the youth of today, but also craft the film as being historical fiction. Gone are the gods' roles and involvement and even Achilles' supernatural origins are obtusely dismissed. Brad Pitt's sculpted Greek form, however, puts him as close to gods as anyone on this mortal plane as his legion of worshippers will attest to. TROY definitely slants to tale to show favor for the film's namesake kingdom. Peter O'Toole, in a much-needed award-winning role, plays Priam with benevolence and wisdom although with perhaps a little too much naiveté when it comes to the gods as opposed to the always- enjoyable Brian Cox's warmongering Agamemnon. Eric Bana's Hector is a warrior family man while Pitt's Achilles is indifferent, and even bored with battle and only fights to preserve his name. Even Helen, who leaves her rabble-rousing husband Menelaus for love and sanctuary in Troy, comes across as being innocent. Only Odysseus, skillfully acted by Sean Bean, comes across as a Greek who knows his place and station and merely wishes to survive. And if surviving means constructing a horse from the boat's lumber, so be it. After all, he has a date with Sersei and the Cyclops later on. Of course the ultimate question is will TROY live on in eternity like Achilles so desperately sought after or will it be dismissed like the setting sun over the Aegean sea?",8,1,2,18 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," A short story that should have been treated as a short film.
","Let's not look at BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as the 'gay cowboy' movie or as 'the film that should have won the Best Picture Oscar.' Let's avoid the clichés that cinema as an art form reflects the political nature of society and let's definitely not tiptoe around the assumedly politically-correct stance that the homosexual community needs to rally around this film and treat it as a benchmark. Instead, let's look at BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as a film, something many reviewers (and fans) refuse to do.From its opening scene of a lonely pre-dawn road through the entire first act filled with Canadian majesty masquerading as the purple mountains of Wyoming, film auteur Ang Lee tries his best to illustrate the solitary life that a sheep-herder must certainly face. This solidarity continues its theme as Ennis and Jack learn that they are a definite minority and how their lifestyle affects other choices they must deal with.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN possess a number of fine and memorable scenes, most of which occur in the following two acts where Ennis and Jack, apart from each other, do their best to simply live life. Lee's base camera-work coupled with beautifully-authentic looking sets helps capture these cinematic moments. Where BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN fails is its inability to place these individual moments into a cohesive and compelling film. Lee fails in glancing over this solitary cowboy life by providing nothing more than the quickest of glimpses. As a result, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as a whole appears as nothing more than filler material padding a short story.The silent moments in a cowboy's life is a topic that has been illustrated in more compelling films than this. Kevin Costner's OPEN RANGE is perhaps the most current example. A handful of good scenes does not make a complete narrative and Ang Lee and James Schamus have partnered on better collaborations than this.Heath Ledger's Ennis is a one-dimensional rough and stoic cowboy of old whose press has surprisingly outshone that of Jake Gyllenhaal's work, whose character  and acting  is definitely the superior of the two. Not to slight Annie Proulx's magazine story, it appeared that Lee and Oscar-winning writing team of McMurty and Ossana failed to forget the basic premise of adapting a single short story into a full-length feature. Great scenes become highly memorable but without a cohesive story combing such scenes into a greater sum results in an unimpressive product.",6,2,21,16 March 2006
Crash," GRAND CANYON of the 21st Century
","In 1991, filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan created GRAND CANYON, a follow up to his hit THE BIG CHILL, focusing on the lives of individuals from different classes in the great melting pot known as Los Angeles. Fourteen years later, Academy Award-winning writer Paul Haggis boosts the tempo on Kasdan's formula with CRASH. Instead of looking at classes, Haggis focuses on race relations and proves that not only does everyone in LA hate everyone else, they downright despise each other.No one is safe in Haggis' hands, which beautifully amplifies the awareness all Los Angelinos must feel, as his cast of characters include questioning Anglos, surviving African-Americans, angry Persians, working Latinos and the downright criminal Korean. Much like in a Robert Altman film, this cast all interacts with each other in unsuspecting cyclical ways. The two misunderstood African-Americans who hate to be profiled end up car-jacking the very- whitebread DA and his wife. The white rookie cop has to deal with his racist partner and his callous captain. A Mexican locksmith becomes a scapegoat for a Persian shopkeeper. An African-American detective is in love with his South American partner. All these roles are admirable played by an exceptional ensemble cast, many of whom are not known for serious  or good - drama work.The story focuses on events that try the souls of mankind: carjacking, fender-benders, break-ins, shootings, racial profiling; events that make citizens feel hurt, afraid and, most of all, angry. It is anger that Haggis shows so well and the emotion is cast from the screen like a betrayed friend. Haggis also substantiates that no one in the overpopulated metropolis of his film interacts or understands their neighbor, and that this lack of touch is a direct result of their own anger and fear  and it doesn't take Yoda to point that aspect out. Don Cheadle's character, Det. Waters, so eloquently points out in the scene-setting opening moments, 'In LA, nobody touches you. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.' Haggis takes the next hundred odd minutes proving his thesis statement on anger and fear in a dramatically beautiful way. He then surprisingly does something else: he shows that love still exists in the City of Angels.",10,1,7,23 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Lucas: Master Storyteller; Spielberg: Master Merchandiser
","In this final installment, Luke truly matures into a true, in control Jedi Knight.  He is in focus with his emotions, thoughts, powers and skills. As a result, his strength carries the movie.  Unfortunately, Spielberg's merchandising aims result in the creation of the Ewoks, which, as Kevin Smith summed up in CLERKS, are really nothing more than Muppets and rob from the story's strength.",10,1,2,21 October 1998
MASH," Needed a stronger plot to back up the comedy
","Robert Altman's Korean War dark comedy, MASH, jumps between outrageous actions, hit-or-miss comedy, and a questionable football game that is as out-of-place as it is juvenile. Of course, most of the script could also be classified as juvenile. MASH clearly broke away from standard, read: serious, war movies. Patton was released the same year and is as opposite MASH as Pabst Blue Ribbon is from 12-year Glenlivet. PBR, it could be argued, makes for super fun times. MASH could be looked on as a situational comedy that lead the way for the outright antics of John Landis' Animal House eight years later. However the backdrop of the war around cannot be ignored, as much as the script would like.Set in the earlier years of the Korean War, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is home to Captains Hawkeye Pierce, Duke Forrest and Trapper John. All three crack surgeons. All three lousy soldiers. They retain a fraternity style of boyish freedom, upsetting the rank and file all the way, yet are good at their job heeding their primary vow as doctors.War is hell. The doctors have no problem in raising hell as a self-prescribed treatment to deal with the daily carnage. In line with his actors, Altman focuses more on their pranks and jokes than surgical drama.Altman is a master of creating movies with large, intricate casts, weaving together the narrative with background frivolity. MASH was one of his earliest feature movies and he was still building his craft. This one? The editing appears like it was cut in a MASH operating room. Many jokes are not allowed to breathe. The set-up and punchline occurring like the rat-a-tat-tat of machine gun fire in the distance. No fermenting, like Larry David would do later. Or even the TV show that this movie spawned. However, when the humor does work, like when Trapper and Hawkeye travel to Japan, it goes off like an atomic bomb.Some of the inconsistent humor is a result of massive ad-libbing. Time and happenstance of the era are also huge considering factors. MASH presented a vanguard, a bold new direction for film that, along with the heist movie Kelly's Heroes also released the same year, made for a strong one-two punch to the Kissinger. Fifty years on, much of the comedy is machoistic and sadly dated. MASH's profane early existence has since been overshadowed with the blatant and the banal.Yet, the movie's charm is still present. Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould are alpha males who not only beat their own drums but want you to join the band. Roger Bowen and Rene Auberjonois play the perfect foils - and deserved more screen time.The characters - those crazy characters - drive the narrative. MASH was dying for a stronger plot to allow those rogues to thrive.MASH is a series of fun asides and half-baked comedy bits edited into a two-hour revue of social commentary. Of course, the Deadpool movies could be the modern-day equivalent whose relevance in fifty years' time has yet to be proven. And hopefully will not. Of course, Deadpool did not have a tedious football game to play out in a final act.",7,0,0,20 May 2020
The Town," A great spotlight for Affleck's talents
","Let's admit to a solemn truth here: heist flicks are as formulaic as any other genre film. One grand heist leads to another, more often than not there is at least one car chase, the alpha male falls for a woman, said male decides to leave his life of crime, which leads to his final escape, be that successful or not. Let's now subscribe to another truth, this one more recent: Ben Affleck has matured well beyond his Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR foibles both in front of and, perhaps even more importantly, behind the camera. THE TOWN, then, is beautiful example of the craft of the heist formula executed perfectly and proves that Affleck, his second outing as a director, is one helluva storyteller.Based on the Chuck Hogan novel 'Prince Of Thieves', THE TOWN follows a bank robbing troupe led by Affleck with Academy Award nominee Jeremy Renner along for the ride and overseen by the late, great Pete Postlethwaite all while being pursued by Jon Hamm's G-Man. Aside from the life-as-a-criminal angle, significant insight is given to Affleck and Renner's relationship, complete with daddy-issues – performed in a killer scene by Chris Cooper – and the budding romance with Rebecca Hall. The drama in these characters' lives proves to be just as strong and important as that of the robberies themselves. And that grand heist? None other than the theft of ticket sales from Fenway Stadium and Affleck even films inside the holy internal works of the Green Monster. Affleck's direction throughout the film is meticulous and tight showing the audience his exact view on the story itself.THE TOWN is an entertaining, well-executed movie and a great vehicle for spotlighting Affleck's talents. Also, it should be noted, this is the film that got Renner his recent super-hero and spy gigs and, more importantly, should have brought him an Oscar as well, the absence of which is the true crime here.",10,1,3,19 July 2012
Watchmen," Sex! Blood! Superheroes!
","WATCHMEN is the latest comic book to gain an adaptation by filmmaker Zack Snyder, whose film 300, based on the Frank Miller series of the same name, became a $210 million phenomenon in 2006. WATCHMEN is also the latest adaptation from the works of Alan Moore (V FOR VENDETTA, FROM HELL and, ahem, LEAGUE OF EXTRORDINARY GENTLEMEN all have big-screen counterparts). WATCHMEN, the comic, is deemed sacrosanct among the fanboy faithful and is considered to be one of those culture-crossing reads defined as a thinking-man's comic while also being a catalyst of change within its own genre giving comic books more mature themes.WATCHMEN, the film, is essentially a murder mystery that takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon is still President, the U.S. won the war in Viet Nam and superheroes are illegal. The Comedian, a costumed hit-man, is murdered causing another costumed hero, Rorschach, an ink-face blotted, overcoat-wearing detective of sorts who provides the film's ongoing monologue, to believe there is a growing conspiracy against former heroes. This conspiracy begrudgingly reunites some of these watchmen as they launch their investigation. Murder, violence and blood, lots of blood, follows.Snyder and screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse provide a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel providing exact panel-by-panel reproductions in some cases and maintaining a majority of the original dialogue. Coupled with spectacular F/X work, most noticeably on the electric-blue CG-character Dr. Manhattan, the film looks great. Where the film differs is the staggering amount of violence and gore added.WATCHMEN, as story, is definitely R-rated material. Rape, impotency, sex and the aforementioned Dr. Manhattan, who is naked for most of his screen time (he no longer requires clothes for he neither modest nor requires their protection), certainly sets this thematically apart from IRON MAN and DARK KNIGHT. But as genre-breaking as the story might be, WATCHMEN is still a genre film and must abide by certain parameters that bind all genre pieces. These are all ignored allowing instead the glorification of violence and a level of gore must more suitable for Snyder's zombie film than his superhero one. Violence and superhero action can go hand-in-hand and where Snyder does use such to lengthen scenes noticeably shorter in their original form (like Comedian's murder) in other instances, like the disturbingly-powerful near-rape scene and a mugging attempt, the filmatic violence detracts from the hero's true path, used instead to shock the mainstream audience and perhaps wow the teenaged videogamer.WATCHMEN can be described as a sophisticated, multi-layered mystery using superheroes as the backdrop and is not easily compared to such films as the X-MEN. Such a comparison is akin to relating RAGING BULL to ROCKY or BARTON FINK to ADAPTATION.",8,5,10,2 April 2009
The Alamo," Remember the Alamo, surely but perhaps not this version
","The Alamo  as a battle  has been adorned as being the stuff of legends in American history. It brought about the death of American folklore heroes Davy Crockett and James Bowie, allowed Sam Houston to rise in power and fame and came complete with a vile villain in the way of General Santa Ana. So why is it that 21st Century America is so fascinated with the deconstruction of said legends? At times, such realism hurts the story and that ended up being THE ALAMO's downfall.Leslie Bohem, Stephen Gaghan and John Lee Hancock's script tries to shoot for an accurate description of the events leading up to the battle and the humanity of the major players involved. Perhaps that was achieved, but a middle-aged Crockett reminiscing on the brutal trials of war doesn't make as compelling a tale worthy of the King of the Wild Frontier. The same can be said for Houston's alcoholism and Bowie being a slave owner. Billy Bob Thorton's acting  and fiddle playing  is what helps save his character's reputation. If anything, it is the Mexicans that come across as being efficient and even noble in their own way. Their uniforms are pressed and they fight as a regiment. No wonder they won the battle. All America had to offer were soldiers more caught up in their own problems! Even the battle at San Jacinto, which was supposed to give the film a positive American ending, merely felt abrupt and tacked on, much like the final war scene at the end of Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR. Even with the base story, at least THE ALAMO looked good. Hancock provided great camera moves with a clean, slick look and nice edits, especially when the action kicked in. Most impressive was the total tracking of a cannonball flying into the Alamo itself. Fans and history buffs might praise, or reject, Ron Howard and the film's other producers on trying to achieve an accurate telling of the Alamo's fall but in doing so all the elements of wonder and excitement these names of legends fabricate instantly become meaningless. John Wayne's ALAMO proved that even though the Alamo was lost, American pride, gumption and that stubborn spirit of ours lives on; that even the worst of times can still bring out the best in Americans. Hancock's version does little more than bring pity to the dead.",6,1,5,8 July 2005
Van Helsing," Wanting and wacky
","In this age of FREDDY VS. JASON, LEAGUE OF EXTRORDINARY GENTLEMEN and the upcoming ALIENS VS PREDATOR, where team-ups and dream duels are getting attention, siccing one of the original monster hunters onto the phalanx of Universal's monster stable seems like the ultimate idea borrowing from such great premises as FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN and Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN. Unfortunately VAN HELSING is more akin to ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. Perfect in concept, Stephen Sommers sets Man of the Church, Vampire Hunter Van Helsing to confront and destroy the most unholy of monster triumvirates, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Werewolf  and throw in Mr. Hyde to start the adventure off. Beautifully paying homage to FRANKENSTEIN at the film's start, VAN HELSING soon degrades into clichés and the convenience of unoriginality. From the scene in Rome where Friar Carl plays Q to Van Helsing's Bond to Van Helsing and Anna wading through hordes of unborn vampire sacs ala ALIEN's Ripley to the Indiana Jones-style stunts, the overused familiarity of the scenes became tedious. Sommers even had nods to Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS and if the Frankenstein Monster broke into song and soft shoe like Peter Boyle in YOUNG FRANKESTEIN, well, that wouldn't have been too surprising.What VAN HELSING does offer is some fun action, cool stunt work and great camera angles taking the viewer along on this magical monster tour. Hugh Jackman proves, once again, that he is indeed a great action hero and holds together a mediocre script on a rather good- looking film with a solid cast. Richard Roxburgh's Dracula will hopefully be remembered and Kevin J. O'Connor's Igor blended both horror and humor. Alan Silvestri's score was perhaps too good for the likes of this movie and is a definite high point.If sequels are to scare up, hopefully Sommers will bring the Van Helsing character back to its more creepy and mysterious origins. One needs look no further than Coppola's 1992 Dracula with Anthony Hopkins in the hunter's role. Adding too much 'super' in the 'supernatural' role made VAN HELSING, like it's final battle scene, both wanting and wacky.",5,0,1,17 May 2004
Ghost Rider," Comicbook Actioneer is an Easy Ride
","The problem with comicbook films is that once the filmmakers decide to distance themselves from the source material, a necessary step that all films face upon adaptation, the core audience immediately goes on the defense. Pleasing said fans is always a difficult task. GHOST RIDER, then, succeeds on the level that it is a fun, comicbook adapted film. However, placed against some its more successful contemporaries, the campy nature of GHOST RIDER is its chief detractor.The Marvel Comics anti-hero Ghost Rider got his start in Marvel Spotlight #5 in 1972 and the film's origin resembles the comicbook tale close enough: motorcyclist Johnny Blaze makes a deal with the devil transforming him, at times, to be an fiery instrument of vengeance. Marvel then revamped and updated the character in 1990 completing the skull-like visage with a flaming chain and spikes. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson takes elements from the classic story and incorporates it with the stylizations of the more modern version in an attempt to please both worlds.Opening with an origin that unfortunately lasts the entire first  and lengthy  act, the film finally roars into action as the damned Blaze (Nic Cage) fights against the devil's son, Blackheart (AMERICAN BEAUTY's Wes Bentley) and his demonic horde. Bentley pulls off the rogue with a smile but at times he and his cronies' post-MATRIX get-up have all the posturing of an upstart emo band. Even Cage and Sam Elliott, playing his mentor, camp it up at times playing mere parodies of themselves. Topping off the cast is the ultimate Easy Rider, Peter Fonda, playing a laughably-scary devil with a grin-and-a-wink that seems to channel Jack Nicholson.Once the action begins, the film pits the flaming Ghost Rider up against elemental demons and, predictably, the police. And like all cliché Westerns or their rock-n-roll, comicbook counterparts, there seems to be nothing his American Chopper-possessed bike cannot do, which even comes to his side when whistled like a loyal steed.What the film desperately lacks is any sense of a real and natural environment. Story aside, what made the SPIDER-MAN and X-MEN films successful is the fact that these unreal events were happening the world right outside the window. Here, the humor  both intended and ridiculous  prevents that barrier from ever entirely withdrawing. Another impediment is the film's rating. Taking a similar path to the BLADE films and first CROW, Marvel should have pushed for a R rating to truly give the devil his due. More dark horror and less toothy one-liners would have made an electrifying film, something that video game-looking ghosts and goblins cannot properly achieve.At best, Ghost Rider is a b-grade superhero; his film falls into the same classification. But true fans should already be aware of this. After all, boyhood fantasies of a flaming skull warrior on a tricked out bike can only go so far. This film meets you half the way.",6,2,4,19 February 2007
Kick-Ass," KICK-ASS didn't quite live up to its name
","From a plot stand-point, the selling item that would be pitched to producers, although on this film a studio did not initially buy into the project forcing Director/Screenplay Writer Matthew Vaughn to self-finance until completion, KICK-ASS is a wonderful fantasy that deconstructs the current comicbook movie craze: what if a normal Joe donned a costume and fought crime? And for the first act, this fantasy was made real possessing fun characters, true-to-life violence and a glimmer of fantasy that movie magic can do so well.Vaughn, no stranger to either movie magic or true-to-life violence, crafts a lightning-quick story around Aaron Johnson's Dave Lizewski, a comicbook fan who is tired of being kicked around (by girls, by street thugs, by his own inadequacies) and decides to kick back. As a costumed super hero, though, Dave learns that his costume alone doesn't provide him with any added immortality, and proceeds to get kicked some more.Enter 'real' super heroes Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). And exit any of the real-life experiences. Big Daddy, a cliché of a framed cop, has a surplus of weapons, money and machismo. Hit-Girl, the Robin to Big Daddy's Batman, has Trinity's moves from THE MATRIX and an arsenal stolen from James Bond. Together they – wait for it now – attack the Mob, killing stupid goombas each more spectacularly and violent than the previous one. And they befriend Kick-Ass. The film continues with Kick-Ass getting the girl and saving the day after a sacrifice of ultimate proportions is made.Raise your hand if you've seen this before.This current comicbook-movie trend, which is now 10-years-old if you consider Bryan Singer's X-MEN film from 2000 to be the progenitor, is nothing more than a sub-genre that feeds from a much larger branch that has been entertaining fanboys and muggles alike for decades. Westerns, war stories, cop flicks, sword-and-sorcery, science fiction and even 80s action films are all morality plays where a hero, be it John Wayne, Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis, stands up and occasionally takes a kick in the face before defeating that ultimate evil. Comicbook movies do just that, albeit with colorful costumes, but when done well, makes that costume believable and even non-existent as it is the character that drives the story.The first act of SPIDER-MAN is widely regarded as the perfectly-outlined origin story. Love, loss and learning all play part of Peter Parker – the Character's – development. Peter becomes what drives Spider-Man. Ignoring Peter's 45+ years of development over that of Dave Lizewski's, KICK-ASS focuses on a potentially fun character and his all-too human impetus for donning a mask. However, as is evident in Dave's ongoing monologue, he questions why real-life superheroes don't exist as he tries to become one. But just as real-life superheroes don't exist, neither do real-life superhero films.Vaughn's film is fun to watch but ultimately is a comicbook movie – and a generic one at that. One that ends as foul-mouthed spectacle existing in a universe where 11-year-olds such as Hit-Girl would never be a hero in a Stan Lee story.",6,0,4,17 August 2010
Lincoln," A most excellent look at a personage of historical significance
","Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show as the title character in LINCOLN, but by all rights, the film itself could have been named 'AMENDMENT XIII' as the second act's energy, as well as most of the third, is focused on the debate in the House to abolish slavery nearly leaving Lincoln himself as just a witness to history while a cast of character actors from screens both big and small pound tables and chests alike in a grandiose fashion.Director Steven Spielberg, and his long-time cinematic director of photography Janusz Kaminski, created a gorgeous movie where they carefully and beautifully frame each shot allowing the audience to play historical witness. Similar to Spielberg's work in MUNICH, the camera is expertly placed, rarely moving, allowing for a perfect spectacle of a scene: be it the aftermath of a bloody battle, the always-smoky rooms where speech itself has somewhere to hide, a rocking chair on a rickety floor that looks ancient even for 1865, or the bright, winter sunlight filtered through the gauze of a window furnishing or a washed-out flag. Likewise, Day-Lewis himself is always framed, the camera accenting on his height, catching the lines in the gray of his face as he bears the weight of a nation divided playing equal parts father, preacher, lawyer and, most of all, grand storyteller.The film, however, keenly focuses on those individual glances but the overall story itself is not as put-together. A series of poignant, incredibly-acted, well-constructed scenes are displayed; each scene a marvelous production complete with conflict, character exposition and beautiful dialogue. Yet these scenes are nearly staged as free-standing productions by themselves and, other than the overarching story detailing the end of Civil War and the proposition of Amendment XIII, miss any flow connecting them and strengthening that overall narrative. Again, it is the presence of Day-Lewis who provides the human touch to the drama of politics. Amidst the yelling and the smoke and the death that incorporates nearly every scene, Day-Lewis' Abraham Lincoln has the ability to smile and, in a move completely foreign to modern-day presidents, sit and speak with the everyday man. He knows this is who is fighting his war and also knows that these very same people will find their own strength to rebuild America. Like a grandfather, he has stories to tell bringing relevance and peace to the chaos of the day, just not his with own family where a slightly-miscast Sally Field, playing Mrs. Lincoln, adds embarrassment and strife while Joseph Gordon- Levitt, as Lincoln's eldest, wants to be the attention-grabbing rebellious son but at least maintains his nobility, even when being ignored. Spielberg elevates the spirit of the man, in a similar manner to what he accomplished with Oskar Schindler, by bringing relevance and importance to that man's place in history. Spielberg shows a man who was able to work both with and around Congress, wanted peace badly enough to fight for it and was taken much too abruptly leaving any future potential into the smoke of history.",9,6,10,1 May 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," I Will Choose Free Will
","A mash of sci-fi, fantasy and rom-com, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU works as a fun film, and actually works quite well as a suspend-your-disbelief narrative goes, mostly due to the believable chemistry between likable stars Matt Damon, a senator-to-be, and Emily Blunt, an NYC dancer.Writer/director George Nolfi chose not to go easy with his first-time outing and decided to adapt a Philip K. Dick story, a tale in which every event in life is mapped out – and policed by fedora-wearing caseworkers – but two lovers meet as a result of a cosmic accident and, as if a modern-day Hitchcockian duo, decide to run against fate. The resulting genre flick is a meeting of the overlord concept from DARK CITY and the rebelling-against-prophesy ideals from the MATRIX, both of which parallel the age-old ordeal of the existence of free will. Damon does it with his Boston smile, Blunt with her accent.Nolfi keeps the pace moving lightning quick, complete with a piano-heavy Thomas Newman score, and offers just enough exploration to keep the wow- factor accelerating giving neither the characters nor the viewer a chance to fully take a deep breath and put together the sense of it all. Is it truly to be believed that spilling your coffee is a planned event akin to the election of a president? However, the delivered world of the film is one of fun make-believe where impulsive choices are the best, properly-worn fedoras are still magical and Matt Damon takes the bus - daily. Another theme that helps complete THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU story is the empowering choice to write your own ending. True, Damon and Blunt's David and Elise, may have had their destiny already assured, at least by the viewer, but that classic sci-fi theme that states the future is wide open, that destiny has not already been written, needs to be affirmed for the next generation, which is who, perhaps, Dick was writing to. Nolfi has helped with that vision.",9,1,3,2 July 2012
Black Hawk Down," Loved the film
","You might have heard this film being described as 'the first 20minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN extended to a two hour plusfilm' and I want you to strike that from the record. This is not to betreated as a Steven Spielberg conquest. Yes, the man terrified usinto ever going in the water again, made us laugh at the Nazis,cried for the Jews and brought dinosaurs to life but BLACK HAWKDOWN was directed by the man who proved to us that in space noone can hear you scream, had virtually every male on the planetpounding their chest while yelling, 'Maximus' and almostsingle-handedly created the visual style not only for a cyberpunkworld but in doing so defined how science-fiction films would lookfor the next 15 years until the Wachowski brothers one-upped himin '99. This is Ridley Scott creating one intense war film. This isNOT the first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, this is the first20 minutes of GLADIATOR extended only with the GermanicBarbarians sporting AKs and the Romans in this film are led by anex-heroin addict turned Jedi.  In GLADIATOR, and then in HANNIBAL, Scott has been able tosuccessfully place the camera in the middle of the action allowingthe viewer to become a participant awashed in dirt, dust andblood. The camerawork transitions between floating as elegant asa Black Hawk to tumbling in the streets of a red hot Somalianmarket. Bullets sing by you. The dull thump of exploding RPGsreverberate inside you. War is hell and you just paid $8 to witnessit. Scott doesn't disappoint.Aside from the incredible camerawork and F/X there is an actualstory present. The Americans are not shown as this invinciblefighting machine acting on the whims of a corporation nor are allSomalians shown as gun-toting warmongers. In fact, despite anybad press this film has received from Somalian-Americans, I defythose people to watch this film again, if they even bothered to inthe first place. Somalia is portrayed as a starving country whosepeople are willing to do anything for a slice of bread. Parents lovetheir children and watch them as they run in the streets playing.But this is a war film. There are good guys and bad guys andsometimes the lines are not always clear on who belongs to whatteam. American policy and American authority is questioned andthe only thing that matters is if these troops can make it to theconvoy safely or not. That and the fact that Somalians are terribleshots.I remember this time in history. I was in college and I believe thisday-long skirmish ended up being a footnote on the news. After all,I'm sure there were more important events happening that day likereporting on why miniature golf attendance was down thatsummer.Ridley Scott took a moment in time, a drastic, hellish,insurmountable moment and expanded on it showing bravery,camaraderie and patriotism. Two hours into the film I noticed I wasstill holding my breath. I'm looking forward to reading this book.",9,0,0,2 February 2002
Big Fish," A more mature Burton film.
","What can easily be described as a more mature Burton film, BIG FISH is certainly a return to classic Tim Burton elements, elements that were sorely missed in the beleaguered PLANET OF THE APES. Burton is able to wind between the whimsical and the serious and the laughable and the endearing without getting too campy, too heavy or especially too sappy, which this film could have easily become. Burton plays with the camera, the settings, even the actors, mixing up the environments, emotions and motions, but never gets too risky allowing subtle movements to occupy just as much screen time. However, perhaps some of Burton's more extravagant (darker?) motifs would have made the more playful scenes of the movie even more magical.Some of the tall tales told throughout the film were definitely reminiscent of Gilliam's ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, although Gilliam allowed the absurd to rulethroughout in that one. Burton could have gotten away with allowing a little more madcap absurdity to creep in a permeate tiny areas, after all Burton and the fantastical are quite the compatriots and as tight as - dare it be said - Batman and Robin. If anything, BIG FISH proved that Burton could direct stars, stars who could act, mind you, that were as big as the movie itself. Finney and McGregor prove to be just as magical as the story itself. A twinkle of their eye, a big smile, and the audience is ready to believe anything, especially the tales of one big fish from a small pond.",8,0,0,8 January 2004
Super 8," Super.
","Writer/director J.J. Abrams knows, if anything, to keep the pace up, sometimes even hitting 11. His monumental STAR TREK reboot played testament to this as characters, settings, intrigue, cosmic play and even the death of Winona Ryder came flying at warp factor 9 when, at times, it can be argued, a slower pace would be welcome to provide more character development. So too happens here with Abrams' latest, SUPER 8, but instead of playing with Gene Roddenberry's creations, an even higher-power is being paid homage to as this film feels as it could be set in Producer Steven Spielberg's backyard.The film itself pays homage to the days of super-8 mm recordings and times when young boys made movies before becoming the next generation of Hollywood. So too here, a group of teenage friends plan to make a monster movie and instead end up as stars of the film itself. However, unlike in the aforementioned STAR TREK, where the characters, if anything their names, are already known, Abrams' fast pace prevents the viewer from getting any deeper into the lives and characters of these kids who are already deep into their long-term existing friendships. Outside of Joel Courtney's Joe and Elle Fanning's Alice, the other friends all kind of blend into the Goonies, Elliott's bicycle gang and Biff Tannen's nameless thugs. Abrams does get a huge piece of the puzzle correct, and that is the everyday boy getting involved in the spectacular extraordinary all wrapped in a coming of age tale – the perfect Spielbergian formula. Courtney and Fanning are believable – enjoyable – teens and their fathers – Kyle Chandler for Joe, Ron Eldard for Alice – are both dramatic and fantastic. As the tale rockets by a little too quickly, their characters make for a great focal point of the story, even if Joe's bedroom, perhaps a little unbelievably, houses every bit of late 70s and early 80s toy collector nostalgia possible.SUPER 8, like Joe's bedroom, is a wonderful vision of nostalgia. A bit derivative at times, a little glossed over at others. However, it would be hard to come by a finer example of a modern-day look at a time of fun films.",9,0,1,21 June 2012

Crazy Heart," Pick up your Crazy Heart
","Country music, and I mean good, soulful music that both comes from and punches you in the heart, often tells an honest story, sometimes exaggerated. That story can have ups and downs, tell tales of love lost and love found, even for one night, and probably makes more than one reference to drinking all night, bowling alley bar assumed. This good, raw music helps tell the story of one Bad Blake, who epitomizes that cowboy soundtrack, and no one other than Jeff Bridges could pull off such a character study as found in Scott Cooper's CRAZY HEART.Bad is a living cliché. In his prime his stature would have made him a contemporary of the Highwaymen and his charisma certainly a welcome addition – as it stands, Bridge's Oscar-worthy performance eases together elements of both Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings. But his prime is now well good and done and he consigned to playing bowling alley bars with session bands that idolize the man looking past the fact that he's more a drunk than a singer. But then true love hits and his muse returns, as Maggie Gyllenhaal's plucky single-mom reporter, giving way to a new song. Bridges IS the film and lays out Bad's life in a true train-wreck style. As off-the-rails he gets, though, the constant twinkle in his eye proves that he is a charmer and endears the viewer to the character. One of the provided insights is his relation to Colin Farrell's Tommy Sweet, a one- time Bad Blake protégé who is now playing to sold-out amphitheaters. Bridges shows a range of complex emotions from resentment over Sweet's popularity, anger at the distance they kept, and prideful awe recognizing that Sweet truly is a performer. Farrell supplies his wonder factor proving that this Irish bloke can sing country – well.As with many character-driven movies, the narrative tale becomes a minor chord and plays itself out with the familiarity of other songs. Instead of the typical elevator story of found fame - lost fame – regained fame, CRAZY HEART begins at the bottom and sinks lower before getting back to ground level. The progression of the man, however, the heart, is much more important that the trappings of a three-act format. To quote Bad, that's the way it is with good ones, you're sure you've heard them before. CRAZY HEART, and Jeff Bridge's Bad Blake, is among the best.",9,3,4,11 July 2012
War of the Worlds," Sound and Fury Signifying A Summer Movie
","With all due respect to the Bard, Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS was certainly jammed full of the requisite sound and fury. Whether it be the lightning blasts the alien hordes road in on, their reigning devastation as humans were vaporized by the hundreds (that's one solution to Earth's over-population) or the fury  the outright horror  that human actors Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins, nearly mimicking his award-worthy role from MYSTIC RIVER, experienced, WAR OF THE WORLDS was a great summertime amusement-park ride.Spielberg provided many of the elements fans of his films come to expect, and provided them dead-on. The alien invaders were as creepy and menacing as the news coverage on Tom and Katie's engagement as Dennis Muren and the ILM team set out to create a very menacing, and ultimately very cool, threat. Spielberg once again allowed the everyday man, a member of the post-nuclear now-acceptably dysfunctional family, to play witness to the fantastic with Dakota Fanning picking up the 21st Century role of cute, screaming blonde kid once held by Drew Barrymore. The signification? Other than summertime action, not much else. Perhaps Spielberg has done his 'everyman' story format once too often as not only does Tom Cruise fail to live up to this Spielberg-ian status, but the story does tend to become slightly ridiculous as this superman tends to be the only human that not only survives every encounter with the invaders but also becomes one of Earth's saviors as well. Perhaps Cruise's superhuman ego could not simply disguise itself with eyeglasses and a fedora. As the movie lumbers forward like the Tripods, the alien tech just does not make sense. Would not space-faring aliens have better ways of tracking these insect-like humans other than line-of-sight targeting? Even the mighty Tom Cruise must have some form of kryptonite  other than bad q-ratings. The end result is that the film satisfies the need for a summer action hit as well as giving humanity a nice positive ending in this pc-world we are specimens in. It's well known that Spielberg can be highly sentimental  just look at SCHINDLER'S LIST  so it should come as no surprise that the aliens meet their ultimate end, as fans of Wells' story were already aware of, in the city of the world champion Patriots and Red Sox. This ride has it all: plenty of dips and loops, but also high-speed action that can take your breath away.",8,3,5,5 July 2005
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Visuals; Boring Story
","Let's agree on this first: the FANTASTIC FOUR is a beautiful movie to look at. The visuals and f/x are top-notch. The casting was dead-on. Even the costumes and sets, especially the Thing's makeup, are a fanboy's dream. Mr. Fantastic was a stretching machine moving in positions only seen previously in a comicbook. The Human Torch's flame mode was realistic and exciting. Sue's invisibility and force fields were visually cool and Dr. Doom's cloak and face plate was definitely neo-Goth. Not forgetting the aforementioned Thing, the make-up crew proved that CGI wasn't necessary to pull off the effect.Now the praise has been administered, there is only one real question that needs to be asked: why couldn't the story have been just as good?Forget the 40+ years of comicbook history that this film uses as a cornerstone, what makes a good comicbook superhero movie, as both X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN films have financially proved, are characters that the everyday movie-goer can relate to. Michael France and Mark Frost's script tries to display the modern-day, nuclear family set-up that this team shares, unlike their mutant colleagues, however they drastically fail by not allowing proper, natural character building. No chemistry exists between Reed and Sue, which is tragically ironic seeing as how they both play scientists (and Jessica Alba cast as a scientist is truly science- fiction), while Von Doom postures like a whining trust-fund kid. The only true characterization shown revolves around the Thing, coupled with some of the Torch's antics. How can a film that only needs to focus on four central characters  and one villain  fail at this?Perhaps some of the blame should be portioned out to director Tim Story who, along with editor William Hoy, cuts together the film at such a superhuman speed that there is virtually no sense in the passage of time. The scenes fly together leaping the viewer from New York to outer space to Von Doom's mountain retreat to the Baxter Building all in a single bound that those of us who are not strange visitors from another planet can't focus on the individuals, rather only the events. Events are what drive summertime blockbusters; good characters are what make good films. One final question. Just because this is a comicbook movie, why cater to the lowest common denominator with dialogue? Johnny Storm is supposed to be a humorous hothead but comes across as the cliché ugly American. Von Doom, who is supposed to be as smart as, if not smarter than, Mr. Fantastic is relegated to base sneers and pining. For that matter, Richards, who is Marvel's answer to Stephen Hawking, comes across as being anything but intelligent. The Fantastic Four comic paved the way for Marvel superheroes, and their cinematic children. One would think that bringing the grand-daddy of comics to the silver-screen would present an honor. Instead it felt more like a big-budget made-for-television prologue paving the way for a real FF film. Perhaps by 2007. Wouldn't that be ahem Incredible?",7,0,1,28 July 2005
Moon," Welcome to Lunar Industries. Enjoy your stay.
","Science Fiction used to be just that: fictional storytelling that has an underlying, relatable theme set in a fantastic environment pseudo- grounded within the realities of science. Authors like Heinlein, Bradbury and Dick understood and thrived in this medium, setting the tempo for the imaginations of the next generation; their film adaptations, for the most part, were not as spectacular. That next generation, however, seemed to forget the thematic elements of such stories and focused instead on the spectacle of fiction. MOON has the pleasure of recapturing that feel and the message of those tales from a by-gone era.MOON is, essentially, a one-man play admirably performed by the Oscar- overlooked Sam Rockwell, playing Sam Bell, a miner overseeing a solo three-year operation on the moon. Bell spends his time focusing on his work, staving off boredom and interacting with the station's HAL-esque computer system, the Spielbergian-named GERTY, perfectly-voiced by a cold, or is that cool, Kevin Spacey. An accident out on the lunar surface gets Bell's attention that, surprise-surprise, things are not all well with Lunar Industries and that his indentured slavery to the corporation might be a greater price than imagined.Directed by Duncan Jones, whose father knows a thing or two about the oddities of space, MOON absorbs the viewer into Bell's tight living space. The film's lo-fi F/X work to its benefit amplifying that classic sf-movie feel giving proper attention to the story, not the visuals. But as such, the look is starting real as is the permeable paranoia that also exists on the station, a paranoia that is enhanced by Clint Mansell's simple yet haunting orchestration, a paranoia that leads to a quest for escape. But who can escape the reaches of a corporation? With MOON, Jones crafts a mystery around Bell's service, his life, and his destiny. He also brings into question how much of our souls are willingly sold to corporations and the almighty, intergalactic dollar as well as if we have what it would take to escape.",10,3,10,20 June 2012
Rock Star," Simplistic and Enjoyable. Prepare to Rock Out!
","ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's 'Izzy' acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. His likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the Metal 'goat horn' hand-sign several times over.The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. More interaction with these life-long Rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's score, the Steel Dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style Metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! Let's all hope that films like ROCK STAR not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival.",8,20,26,29 January 2002
