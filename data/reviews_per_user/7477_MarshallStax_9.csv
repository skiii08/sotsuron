United 93," Just the facts; no drama
","Writer/director Paul Grengrass chose to go with a straightforward, home-video style with this film. There is no attempt at finding stories or meaning, no plot to speak of. Things simply happen and then it's over.By going with a barely-compressed time frame which denies the audience a chance to see into the lives of the people involved before the events play out, we are denied involvement with the emotions of the characters from anything but a superficial, fly-on-the-wall standpoint.Greengrass chose to focus narrowly in this movie on air traffic controllers and the passengers on United 93, none of whom we ever really get to know.Frankly, while the finished product is probably exactly what Greengrass was after, a far more remarkable film could have easily been made of this event. But is it still too soon? For a 'real' movie, yes. But this thing is respectful to a fault, except perhaps in the implicit condemnation of the US's leadership in a time of crisis. That very carefulness, that presentation of everything in as neutral a light as possible, ultimately leaves an empty hole that will probably bring very few viewers the catharsis they bought a ticket to seek.If this were a work of fiction, it would be a very minor release. If it had ever been made at all.A final comment: I for one am sick to death of watching camcorder-style photography in big-buck movies. Focus, steady shots, action that's not rendered an incoherent blur, smooth zooms instead of quick, jerky, 'my first video with this new camera' pulls and pushes: is it really too much to ask for?",5,7,18,29 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," More of the same. Lots more.
","I found the first 'Pirates' movie to be an unexpected delight. I had never seen a pirate movie I liked before, so I went in interested but with low hopes. After all, this was a film with a troubled production, whose shoot went significantly over schedule and budget. Reshoots were employed. These are usually bad signs for a movie and bode ill for its ultimate disposition. And really - a movie based on an amusement park ride?However, from the surprisingly convoluted but still neatly self-connected plot to the top drawer visual effects and of course the performances (including Depp's, an actor I had never previously had much opinion of), 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' turned out to be so much more than I had thought it would be. As one reviewer somewhere said (L.A. Weekly, I think), these are movies for people who do not like pirate movies.Count me in! I like to have my buckle swashed from time to time, but I do not count myself a pirate movie fan. Yet I LOVED 'Curse of the Black Pearl'.So, I was really looking forward to the release of Dead Man's Chest. Bill Nighy was an added bonus; I saw he was to play Davey Jones (he of the locker). I loved his work in the 'Underworld' films, 'Love Actually' and 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.The plot sounded promising; Jack Sparrow owes a debt to Davey Jones: his soul! He does everything in his power to get out of repaying it, including enlisting the help of every character from the first movie. So where did it all go wrong?The movie is too damned long. There are too many characters. Not enough happens of significance; too much happens for the sake of on screen action. Time is elastic in the plot; people travel to and from ports and islands with amazing rapidity, to the point where the audience is wondering if these people have simply developed the power of teleportation. And really, this feels more like a remake than a sequel. Phantom ship? Check. Supernaturally enhanced crew? Check. Curse? Check. Outrageously staged sword fights? Check. Etc...The special effects are as amazing as ever, though the kraken both appears too often and yet not enough of it is seen each time.Sadly, the movie is more an endurance contest than a giddy ride. In fact, it is very much like the 'dark tunnel' amusement park ride: sit down and watch everything scroll by without actually caring about or being a part of it. Characters are already established from the first film (a dozen or so) and nobody grows or changes except for maybe, maybe a glimmer out of Jack and Elizabeth.Special note here about Johnny Depp: Jack Sparrow was very much a one-note performance in the first film, but enjoyable due to the character's unpredictability. As written here, Jack is as predictable as gravity, and about as interesting. He is a dead center in a film that desperately needs a live one, and no amount of fey sashaying or uncoordinated sprinting at the head of a cannibal tribe does anything to change that.Plotwise, things just happen and happen and happen in this movie to the point of boredom; what should be a rousing three-way swordfight on a rolling mill water wheel is just dull and the kraken attacks (all four of them) are simply variations on a theme.The creative team here has really used the last ounce of goodwill they generated with 'Curse of the Black Pearl' to create this loud, frequently boring, sporadically amusing and overlong mess. At least the next (and last?) film will tie up all plot threads from this one and hopefully give us a rousing, satisfying end to this stuff.",5,0,3,9 July 2006
Resident Evil: Extinction," Sampling finally makes it way into a visual medium
","Transcript of a pitch meeting between Paul W. S. Anderson and Screen Gems studio suits. In the interest of not being sued, all dialog but Anderson's has been removed.'So here's a pitch for a new movie I want to make. First off, it's set in a post-apocalyptic desert, like 'The Road Warrior'. Oh yeah, I loved that movie. I gotta use that tractor trailer rig with the fuel tank in it sometime. I always wanted that thing to explode at the end, instead of being filled with sand. I'll fix that in my movie! Anyway, Sarah Connor, you know, from 'T1' and 'T2', leads a group of expendables around. Hey, remember when she said, at the end of the first one, 'There's a storm coming'? I'll drop that line into my movie, just to show the fan-boys I like the same movies they do. Hey, did you ever see 'The Birds'? I did. Man, was that creepy! I got it! The rag tag fugitives are attacked by birds at some point! I'll figure out why later. Maybe they're robot birds or somethingLet's see these survivors are looking for a safe refuge. How about some place far away from the desert, someplace isolated, so they're safe from the cyborgs. An island? No, that's too much like the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead'. And 'Damnation Alley' had them going to, like New Jersey or something. Hmmm... how about Alaska? Yeah, that's it! They're going to Alaska.Hey, did you ever see 'Planet of the Apes'? Not the remake, but the original. I did, and that scene with the Statue of Liberty really stuck with me hey, they're in Vegas! New York New York Casino has a statue like that! I'll do an homage!So anyway, speaking of 'Dawn of the Dead', I like zombie movies. I've done video game movies and horror movies and sequels and stuff, but not a straight up zombie movie. Did you ever see 'Day of the Dead'? The one where the scientists are underground, trying to work on the zombies to see if they can cure them or control them? It was cool.Speaking of movies I saw, did you ever see John Carpenter's remake of 'The Thing'? Man, that was one batsh*t scary movie! I love that part where the floorboards are being torn up form underneath as some kind of monster comes after Kurt Russell I could use that bit. Oh, and the creepy dark lab, where stuff runs past the camera in the foreground? Classic Carpenter bit. I'll borrow that, too.Hey, did you ever see 'Re-Animator' or 'From Beyond'? Some good horror creatures in those films. I ought to introduce poor Johnny-come-lately horror fans to the monsters from those movies.What do you mean, you don't want me to make this movie? Are you nuts? It's a sure fire thing!'Resident Evil 3'? Yeah, I did the first two, but I'm done with those. I don't want to do that one. I want to make this big budget tribute movie to everything cool I ever saw growing up, the one I just told you about!Hey, I think we may have a 'You've got your peanut butter in my chocolate' moment here, guys but can I direct this one? No? What do you mean, Russell Mulcahy! That guy may have done the original 'Highlander', which was actually very cool, but he hasn't directed much of anything of note since thenFine, just pay me and I'll have a script for you in two days.'",2,22,39,23 September 2007
Armageddon," What a gigantic crock! Er...rock...
","In terms of value for budget dollars spent, 'Armageddon' is the worst movie ever made.  The movie has nothing to say about anything; it is purely an exercise in eye candy.  It is a piece of product without feeling plugged into the machine of feature film distribution.  It is cold and cynical, believing that all the audience wants to see is physics.  Judging from the box office, maybe the powers-that-be that green-lighted this project were right. But what about the movie?  The acting ranges from passable (Willis) to gut-wrenchingly awful (Affleck).  A mannequin named Liv Tyler plays The Beautiful Girl with all the verve and passion of a piece of shrubbery. The story goes that this movie was green-lighted and put into pre-production without even a script; it would be hard to argue after viewing the results.  There are many great screenwriters out there that can't get work, and then here comes this barely-even-written film to add insult to injury.  I had heard that living legend Robert Towne (Academy Award winner for 'Chinatown') ghost wrote dialogue for a scene or two in this film; imagine how the movie would have been if he had been hired to actually write the SCRIPT instead of just doctoring dialogue.      The movie plays with all the depth of a Levi's or Pepsi ad; it looks like a music video for the movie 'Armageddon'.  Only on a purely visual level does 'Armageddon' work at all, and even then it is heavy-handed and obvious, with shots screaming out 'look how cool this is!', subtle as a sledgehammer. Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and their ilk have perpetrated yet another abomination on the cinema; as if 'The Rock', 'Con Air', etc...weren't bad enough, now we have this piece of space debris.  At least product like this keeps the studios going so that worthwhile movies can be still be made.",2,3,6,22 February 1999
The Exorcist," Scary in its day, perhaps?
","I just finished a screening of this slow-moving, ponderous and uninvolving 'horror' film.  The opening sequences in Iraq, which drag on interminably, have nothing to do with what comes after.  When we finally arrive at the locale of the action, a lot of nothing ensues very slowly and to no frightening effect.  It's hard to see what it was about this film that scared so many; perhaps it was simply the shock of the sacrilegious comments coming from a little girl's mouth.  Truly, 'The Exorcist' commits the worst two sins a horror film can; it bores and it fails to frighten.  That said, it is still a well-made film with intelligence and a nice visual style; it just fails totally as a horror film.",4,2,8,23 September 2001
Blue Crush," Off-handed realism and hyper-reality mix
","'Blue Crush' has an unfortunate tendency to veer into extreme-sports style montages (freeze frames, sped up action, extensive use of slow-mo).  While undeniably fun to watch, this style exists mainly when the film is in the wet.  On dry land, the movie shifts gears completely, generally going for off-the-cuff realism underscored by carefully careless hand-held camera work, the look of natural-lighting and the casting of less-than physically perfect actors and actresses.  The director and cinematographer seem to have done a lot of shots from a distance and used telephoto during scenes of interaction between the female leads.  This more or less works to give us a feeling that we are watching real lives unfold. Unfortunately, the two styles of imagery clash and as a result might reduce enjoyment of the film.  Perhaps a more raw style of surf photography might have made the difference.  In general, though, the characters are well-drawn (especially the supporting cast), their dialogue is fairly believable and their motivations seem to come from an honest place.So... there's nothing wrong with 'Blue Crush' (except for a couple of detectable special effects shots and a continuity error or two) and there are numerous small but substantial pluses.  Go see it; you won't hate yourself afterwards.  And see if your throat doesn't close up in dread the first time we and our heroine Anne-Marie get a good look at the towering juggernaut of water at Pipeline on competition day.  Yikes!",7,0,0,20 August 2002
The Departed," What a wretched pile of f**k.
","Over-directed (pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what's happening on screen with the plot or characters), over-scored (save me from the freakin' metal Irish jig and the Stones, both heard twice in this thing), over-edited (the movie is awkward: scenes flow neither internally or into each other) and over-acted by Jack Nicholson (so far beyond the point of self-parody that it ceases to be funny), this horrid, horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters (except for Madolyn, the worst psychiatrist who never lived, who lacks even a second dimension) and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at.Really, I've never been a Scorsese fan, but this movie owes any praise it deserves for its twisty, turny plot to whatever was left over from the original 'Infernal Affairs'. Yes, in case you didn't know, this movie is a remake of a far superior Hong Kong film.As with 'Dreamgirls', another inexplicably over-praised 2006 release, there's just no denying the nudity of this emperor. Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful, Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all-too-predictable praise that's been heaped on it. 'Instant classic', 'best film of the year', etc...I'm sorry, but the technical competency of the filmmakers is questionable and the emotional impact of the story is zip. By the last few minutes, as blowing a person's brains on the wall is becoming more of a cliché than you would ever think possible, I found myself hoping that some deus ex machina would descend from the sky and just kill everyone so it would just be f**king over already.",2,20,37,26 February 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Powerful, epic, personal and affecting
","It may seem like an unusual name for a movie about the events surrounding the 1970's rise to power of Ugandan military dictator Idi Amin, but to see is to understand.The plot, based on a novel that in turn was inspired by actual events, follows a freshly-minted young Scottish doctor named Nicholas Garrigan. In just a few quick scenes, director Kevin Macdonald clearly shows us that this drinking, pot smoking free spirit is terrified by his suffocating future of being a family practitioner in business with his overbearing old man. Not nearly as sure of what he wants as what he doesn't want, Nick spins a globe and winds up in Uganda just as a coup has taken place. The director again lets us know quickly what this young Scot's about; Nick has a hard time keeping his hands off the ladies, as he jumps right into the sack with a flirtatious fellow bus traveler before he arrives at the village where he is to assist the resident doctor.A nicely slimmed down and understated Gillian Anderson, sporting a decent British accent, portrays the doctor's beautiful and under-appreciated wife. She picks up Nick from the bus stop and ferries him to his post through an eerie night road scape full of ghostly Ugandans wandering in the truck's headlights.Nick enjoys some aspects of his new gig: playing soccer with the kids, vaccinating little ones against the diseases that ravage the land, and yes, eyeing the doctor's wife.His seduction attempt nearly succeeds; Anderson smartly portrays a good woman whose need to be bad is only slightly weaker than her desire to be noble. Still in turmoil, they attend a rally nearby where Idi Amin is addressing his new constituents. Charismatic and rabble-rousing, Forest Whitaker convincingly portrays the first of many facets of Amin that will be revealed throughout the course of this film.It would be a disservice to the viewer who has not yet seen this thick, affecting film to describe the plot in any more detail, but suffice it to say that a fortuitous encounter with the dictator soon leads to Nick away from his boredom, good works and untasted forbidden fruit of the countryside village to the inner circle of the charming, terrifying and possibly insane bully Amin.The aimlessness of Nick's life begins to come clear for him as he gets deeper and deeper into the moral quagmire of being chief adviser and personal physician to the man who was ultimately responsible for the 300,000 deaths of those who opposed him within Uganda.The ending, after a build-up nearly as hallucinatory and overwhelming as 'Apocalypse Now', comes down during the Entebbe hijacking and hostage crisis of 1976.Nick's journey is told without a misstep and an epic, significant air hangs over this grainy, you-are-there photography. And the impact of casual violence and its affect on the value of human life has rarely been portrayed with more vividness than in this film. Nothing done by a Freddy or a Jason can match the atrocities visited upon those on the wrong side of Amin's politics, paranoia or temper.For the squeamish, this is a harrowing ride.The soundtrack throbs with African popular music of the time (think Fela Kuti, with less improv and more melody) and the sense of time and place is utterly convincing.As well made as this film is, it is still the cake that the icing of the actors decorates. Forest Whitaker gives what is without a doubt the performance of his career in Idi Amin. And Oscar nomination, if not an outright win, is a certainty if there is any justice in this world. And James McAvoy's callow Nicholas grows in heft and morality before our eyes. At first, he enjoys the opulence and easy living of being among Amin's inner circle, but, as he continues to dally with the wrong ladies and mock the covert operatives from England that approach him, an actual person with inner strength appears. And though his answer to all this is to run away, the impediments placed in his path teach him a thing or two about being a human being. MacAvoy deserves plentiful praise for bringing this pleasure-seeking young doctor to life, then shepherding him through these changes believably before our eyes.",8,23,29,24 September 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger than fiction? Or stranger to reality?
","Q: When is a Will Ferrel movie not a Will Ferrel movie? A: When it's 'Stranger Than Fiction'.In the wake of movies like Charlie Kaufman's oeuvre ('Eternal Sunshine...', 'Being John Malkovich', 'Adaptation') and 'I Heart Huckabees' comes this more-hit-than-miss what-if story about IRS auditor Harold Crick, a borderline obsessive-compulsive who only learns how to live when he discovers he's going to die.Pretty standard stuff, but it's handled with a zinger: he hears a voice in his head, telling him what's happening to him at that moment. A narrator. It turns out he's a character in a novel-in-progress by a writer who's infamous for tragically killing off her main characters. And Harold doesn't want to die, despite the fact that he really has nothing to live for.There's little astonishing in this modestly funny movie, but it's so entertaining and intellectually stimulating that its faults are more than outweighed by its pluses. Will Ferrel has to get the lion's share of the praise here; he goes from near-catatonic at the start of the film to being a very lovable and root-for-able everyman stand-in by film's end. He admirably keeps his comic persona almost completely under wraps here, only allowing it to show in very tightly controlled peeks here and there.The rest of the cast? Emma Thompson is fine (if a bit showy) as the writer trying to figure out how to kill Harold. Queen Latifah is utterly wasted here as the assistant sent by the writer's publisher to help her complete the book; I'm not even sure why her character was included, as she adds nothing to the story except to provide the pressure from the publisher to finish the book which will lead to our hero's demise.Dustin Hoffman is a hard-edged college professor of literature that Harold turns to for help in understanding how he became a character in a book. While Hoffman could have done this in his sleep, he still throws off a spark or two above the call of duty.And Maggie Gyllenhaal. as the anarchist baker that Harold unexpectedly falls for during an audit, is adorable. How could anyone resist falling for her? She's so good in this I almost bought the story convenience of her rapid switch from repulsion to attraction for Harold.Did I mention there are some problems with the plotting? Without getting too heavily into the details, things are just slightly implausible. I don't mean the part where Harold's wristwatch develops a mind and agenda of its own, or how Harold seems to drift in and out of his job without any repercussions, or even the biggie: how a writer can inexplicably begin writing about and thereby determine the destiny of a real person. No, I mean that things just kind of happen because they need to in some cases, not because they actually make a whole heck of a lot of sense.You can argue that the whole movie is allegory, that the characters are stand-ins for the human condition, and you'd have a strong case. And the sheer interest this movie generates for its characters allows most of these things to be willfully ignored by a person having a good time.But these niggling details wet down the wings this movie would use to soar to greatness.'Stranger Than Fiction' is a sweet fairy tale and is enjoyable as such. It even contains meaning beyond its surface in symbolic terms. But it is no 'Finnegan's Wake' or 'Ulysses', for better and worse. You could do far, far worse than to watch this movie.",7,0,4,27 October 2006
