The Expendables 2," The Cabin in the Woods of action movies
","To all the people who go into The Expendables 2 expecting a cohesive and well constructed plot or something to tide you over until The Great Gatsby comes out, why would you do that? The plot of The Expendables 2... well what plot. There is 5 tonnes of plutonium that the Russain's have left over from the Cold War that they were going to use for a mine and Van Damme wants it, that's it. If your looking for a deep human story, you won't find it here. What you will find however is some SWEET action sequences.What The Expendables 2 does succeed in is giving you intense, balls to the walls action. You can tell exactly what you are in for from the get go. The Expendables 2 opens with an action sequence with explosions, heads exploding and 50 Cals tearing the holy hell out of everything and Alex smiled a lot, and apparently speaks in the third person now.The acting is also what you expect. Sly is about as easy to understand as Batman (that's the Christian Bale Batman) speaking through Darth Vader's voice box, Jason Statham still sounds like he should be in The Sweeney and Chuck Norris is every bit as good as he was in Walker Texas Ranger, and I mean that sincerely *coughs*. The irony is the worst actor in everything else he is in, is the best actor in this, and surprisingly didn't annoy me. Yes that's right ladies and gentleman Liam Hemsworth was the best actor in this movie. However, undoubtedly the best part about The Expendables 2 is Van Damme who plays Villain, yes that is his name. His character makes you hate him enough that you want to see Sly go all Rambo on him.What really shines in this movie, apart from the action, is the humour and the references to each of the actors movies. One of them is in the final scene of the movie when Arnie and Bruce Willis are tearing people apart Chuck Norris joins in and Arnie says 'Ahhh, who's next, Rambo'. My personal favourite is in the Chuck Norris reveal scene when Sly says 'Is it true you we're bitten by a King Cobra' to which Chuck Norris replies 'Yes it is,but after five days of agonising pain, the snake died' and I for one personally love that-they got a 'Chuck Norris fact' in the mix.The script is every bit as corny in places as you expect it to be. For example in one scene Jason Statham is dressed as a priest and when a group of Villain's goons come in he says 'I know pronounce you, man and knife' at which point I cringed but that means that the script writer did his job. You can't be like 'oh, I'm going to ding you on the script there buddy' because they meant for the script to be like that and that doesn't bother me as it was meant to be that way, they cheesiness of the script wasn't unintentional.Overall The Expendables 2 is exactly what you expect it to be corny, over the top and incredible fun. Is it for everyone, hell no but for the ones who it is aimed at it is the best all out action film of the year and for me anyway the best all out action film I have ever seen",9,3,6,28 August 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Whatever the word is, unexpected isn't it
","I'm going to start by admitting, I'm not the biggest fan of fantasy, let alone The Lord of the Rings. I can see why people love them, they are well directed films and look magnificent. However I can't over look some of the sketchy acting and serious moments that I can't help but laugh at. That said I was actually looking forward to seeing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and does it improve on Lord of the Rings, eh.If any of you have read the book you already know the story. The short version is Gandalf wants reclusive Hobbit Bilbo Baggins to join him in an adventure in claiming back the Dwarfs homeland of Erebor which was taken over by Smaug the Dragon. The truth is while The Hobbit does improve on some accounts, I only laughed at the intentionally funny parts this time, the exciting scenes are just as exciting as the exciting Lord of the Rings but the boring scenes are just as boring as the boring scenes in Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately the boring sections are the ones that are long and drawn out. It also feels like it drags with the 2 hour 49 minute running time feeling more like 3 hours 49 minutes, which isn't a good thing. It's not like Fight Club where it feels long because they manage to fit a lot into the running time, it feels long because the film doesn't keep your interest up.Now, you're probably wondering why I've given it a good rating considering I've bashed it so much. The truth is. when The Hobbit gets things right it gets them really right. The massive visual set pieces are as exciting here as they were in Lord of the Rings and the back story of the dwarfs at the beginning is one of the most intriguing fantasy back stories I have ever seen. Also like it's predecessors it looks magnificent with the sweeping shots of New Zealand looking suitably epic, however I didn't see it in 48 FPS or 3D so I can't comment on whether they detract or add to the films experience. Also the acting is no where near as sketchy as before with amazing performances by Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Aiden Turner. But by far the stand out performance in the film and once again steals the movie is Andy Serkis reprising his role as Gollum. It is amazing what Serkis is able to do with just his movements and the way he is able to shift between personalities is unparallelled.Overall this is a very good entry to the series and in my opinion is the best out of the 4. However, I can't over look the boring parts which are unfortunately the parts that are overly long, not to mention the overly long run time which has scenes that should have been saved for the extended edition. The people who will really get the most out of this film are the people who consider The Lord of the Rings some of their favourite films of all time which unfortunately, isn't me. For that reason The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good movie but won't be making it into my top 10 films of the year.",7,4,9,30 December 2012
The Untouchables," A very good film, but should have been so much more
","As a gangster film, The Untouchables is among the likes of Goodfellas and The Departed, however as a film about the hunt by Eliot Ness for Al Capone, it should have been so much more.Don't get me wrong it's a very good film, the performance by Andy Garcia as Giuseppe Petri was brilliant (he was my favourite character in the entire film and Robert De Niro as notorious gangster Al Capone is one of his best performances I have seen, it's up there with James Conway from Goodfellas. However, not all the performances hit home. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Eliot Ness was anything but spectacular, which is a great shame as Kevin Costner is a very good actor. Also Sean Connery's portrayal of Jim Malone is by no means bad, it's just that his character is Irish and, yeah, whatever that accent was, it wasn't Irish.What the film does really well though is how it is shot. The sweeping shots of Chicago look magnificent. However, on a technical standpoint nothing else really impresses like it should. There is one scene in particular where they use slow mo. The reason I bring this up is that it is one thing to use slow mo but it is another to over use it, especially as it is only this one scene that uses it, it does really take you out of what is meant to be a pinnacle moment of the film and it never really brings you out of that area and gets you immersed in the film again. The music can also be distracting, for the most part it's okay, it does its job but when an important part of the film rears its head, it goes all operatic which really doesn't fit the tone or the setting of the movie, which again slightly draws you out of the movie. In conclusion, The Untouchables is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen, however, for what it is and how much of a defining moment the plan to bring down Al Capone was in history, it just wasn't enough and for what I was expecting, I was a little let down. I just hope Scarface is better.",8,0,0,14 January 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," It's like Wall Street, except on Lemmon 714 Quaaludes
","In the time that The Wolf of Wall Street was approaching its UK release, it had been accused of glamorising and promoting the lifestyle that was or is being led by these corrupt Wall Street types. The Wolf of Wall Street is however a cautionary tale of excess that never becomes heavy handed and keeps you 100% hooked for the three hour run time and all this adds up to make The Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.The Wolf of Wall Street is full of sublime performances. DiCaprio is utterly captivating as Jordan Belfort in what is arguably the best performance of his career, possibly even topping his powerhouse performance in Shutter Island, ironically another Scorsese film. Co- stars Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey are equally as good, with McConaughey delivering a hilariously absurd performance as Belfort's mentor Mark Hanna.The Wolf of Wall Street is essentially the most unconventional horror film ever made. The horrors of greed and how it distorts people are expertly shown by Scorsese in a darkly comic yet truly terrifying way. There is no questioning that Wolf is dark, possibly Scorsese's darkest yet due to the fact that it is a comedy which leads me to what I thought would be the biggest problem with the film, the tone. Despite the fact that Martin Scorsese is a master director I thought that even he would find it hard to overcome the tonal issues he would more than likely encounter when trying to adapt this surprisingly dark story into celluloid. However, I am happy to report that Scorsese balances the tone with expert precision and is possibly the most impressive feat that Wolf achieves. The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely not for everyone and I would totally understand if someone doesn't like it for one reason or another, like the fact that some may think that the 3 hour run time is over kill. Despite the hefty run time (which is filled up perfectly), in my opinion The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese best film in 24 years and one of the most biting, unflinching and daring films ever made. This is a story of how even the mightiest of people can fall from grace done in the best way possible. If you want the definitive film about financial corruption that is clever and hugely entertaining, then look no further.",10,4,11,2 February 2014
The Conjuring," Wan balances originality and nostalgia to create the scariest film in years
","First of I have to start by saying that The Conjuring is not just a masterclass of horror cinema but it cements James Wan as not just the best horror director this generation, not just as one of the best horror directors ever but, in my opinion, one of the best directors ever. This is shown with the very first shot of the film. I'm not going to tell you what the shot is of but believe me when I tell you that it really sets the tone and if this particular thing scares you, it shows you how scary The Conjuring is going to be.While, in execution, The Conjuring is nothing new, a simply normal looking family move into a haunted house, the haunting begins with small things happening at first (in this it's all the clocks stopping at 3:07 AM) and escalates, they get people in to see what they can do and the apparition becomes increasingly violent and has to be removed. However where The Conjuring shines is with its scares. In many horror movies when there is a gap in the score, you know there is something scary going to happen but here it's not like that. At points when the score goes quiet Wan doesn't always throw something scary at you and when he does throw something scary at you there isn't always the sudden audio spike in the music rather he lets the horrifying look of the ghost scare you.Another area where The Conjuring shines is with the performances. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great as the paranormal investigating couple the Warrens and Lili Taylor as the mother who ends up getting possessed with some of the best possession acting I have seen since The Exorcism of Emily Rose. The children do great jobs as well which isn't uncommon in movies nowadays but it is still worth mentioning. Overall, The Conjuring is the scariest horror film in years and with Insidious 2 coming out in September, James Wan is on track to a comfy seat in the horror directors walk of fame.",10,0,2,8 August 2013
Monsters University," Pixar goes back to school
","Pixar, of late have not been the quality film makers they are known to be. Every since the release Toy Story 3 in 2010, it seems like they have been on a downward slope. Even though I didn't see Cars 2, I did see Brave and even though I liked it, it felt disjointed as it felt like two entirely different films spliced together, the villain was extremely weak which was disappointing as Pixar's previous films have given us some great villain's in the form of Hopper and Randell and just didn't have the polish that they're previous films are used to. It felt like the once legendary film company should be put out to pasture. However, with the release of Monsters University, Pixar are back on form. Monsters University marks Pixar's first prequel and adds to the already intriguing Monsters' universe, diving deeper in the profession of the screamer, showing that there is more to it than just simply being scary. This is one of Monsters U's shining spots as it shows that the idea for showing Mike's and Sully's university years isn't just a gimmick.The story starts of with showing us Mike's primary or grade school years and what inspired him to become a scarer. In one of Pixar's brilliantly crafted opening title sequences it shows us Mike's journey on getting to university. From then on in we get introduced to other characters from the original film such as Randell and of course Sully. We also get a couple of glimpses of George. With Mike and Sully not being friends at first they naturally start to bump head. Then a conflict between them results in them both getting thrown out of the scaring program and having to prove their worth the the head of the scaring program, Dean Hardscrabble, by taking part in the Scare Games where the winners are said to be 'the scariest monsters on campus', but to do so they have to join a fraternity called Oozma Kappa which, at first glance, consists of the lamest monsters you have ever seen. The story is well thought out, clever and worthy of the Pixar name closing out on one of the best climaxes in animation movie history. The performances are brilliant with Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi being as good as they were in the original. However, it is the new cast members that really shine. With great performances by Charlie Day as the purple fuzz ball on legs Art, Nathan Fillion as the leader of rival fraternity Roar Omega Roar, Johnny Worthington and of course Helen Mirren as the legendary Dean Hardscrabble.Overall, Monsters University is a return to form for Pixar and, for me at least, is better than Monsters Inc with it's superiour story, characters and and jokes.",8,0,0,29 July 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Folk Music: A True Underdog Story
","In true Coen Brothers style, Inside Llewyn Davis is five hundred miles away from their last film, True Grit. Unlike the tense revenge western that True Grit was or the screwball comedy that was Burn After Reading, Inside Llewyn Davis is surprisingly down to earth which is refreshing change of pace as today's film market seems to be filled with over blown Hollywood disasters and it is nice to see directors like the Coen's, Scorsese and Winding Refn that don't feel like they have to cater to the lowest common denominator as Llewyn Davis is one of the most genuine, subdued films of the new century. Despite this, Inside Llewyn Davis keeps the quirky and sharp dialogue you are likely to find in any of the Coen's films is still present and correct. Oscar Isaac of Drive fame stars as the eponymous Llewyn Davis (it's Welsh), a down on his luck folk singer who is just trying to find fame whilst barely scarping by. Davis, in true Coen fashion is, no loser, no two ways about it and Isaac plays it with convincing subtly. All the other actors are extremely competent as well. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake star as folk duo Jim and Jean and John Goodman in what is possibly his best role yet as Roland Turner a crippled yet articulate jazz musician who Davis hitches a ride with to get to Chicago. Each of the actors play their roles with their own style of performance. Mulligan plays Jean as a bitter, spiteful woman who cares little for anyone apart from herself and her partner Jim. Timberlake however plays Jim as a caring individual who just wants the best for Isaac's Davis. Goodman however completely steals the show in a role in what could easily have been a cameo but the Coen's expertly extended the role in what culminates to be some of the films best scenes. Inside Llewyn Davis is the Coen's best film since Fargo and much like Fargo; Inside Llewyn Davis combines stunningly distinct characters with a compelling story that is very loosely based on a true story or real people. All this makes Inside Llewyn Davis one of the greatest subdued masterpieces ever made and if you only see one Coen Brother's film in your life, make it this one.",10,3,7,2 February 2014
The Great Gatsby," What's with the excessive use of green screen old sport
","First things first, I have to start off by saying I'm not a fan of The Great Gatsby book. In actual fact it is the worst book I have ever read. The characters, with the exception of Tom, are bland and boring and the story is uninspired and predictable. I'm also not a fan of the 1974 Robert Redford version of the story. While I can say Luhrmann's attempt is better than the Redford version, it still by no means makes it a good film. However, that said I did go into The Great Gatsby with an open mind, and I don't think it helped one bit.I'll get the good things out of the way first. The soundtrack is good for the most part with songs by Jay-Z, Goyte and Nero. The best song however was an already existing song by Flux Pavilion called I Can't Stop. Shame the scene it was used in is the most headache inducing scene in the entire film. Joel Edgerton's performance as Tom and Jason Clarke as George are good, however these are the only good performances in the film. Finally, the way Luhrmann decided to tell the story by sending Nick to a doctor/psychiatrist about his experiences with Gatsby I thought, at first, was quite clever. However, in classic Luhrmann fashion, he finds a way to ruin one of the few things he has going for the film by getting Nick to write The Great Gatsby book. And it's all downhill from there.The Great Gatsby has it's fair share of major problems. Possibly the most glaring problem of The Great Gatsby is the over use of green screen. This wouldn't bother me if the green screen was used in moderation or if it was used stylistically like in 300 or Sin City. While you could argue that Luhrmann uses it stylistically in some scenes, but when it is used for the backdrop for the scenes set at George's garage is down right unacceptable. What makes this worse is that all the jewels in the movie are 100% real and cost million upon million of dollars/pounds. Another glaring flaw of the movie is the iffy acting. DiCaprio as the illusive Gatsby isn't horrible and if he improved his accent, his performance might be passable. However, with the accent he went with does nothing but stain his performance. Also this might be just me but I thought DiCaprio would have been a better Nick than he was a Gatsby. Mulligan is even worse, there is nothing redeemable about her whining performance as Daisy. This just isn't acceptable as Mulligan is a great actress. Don't believe, just watch Drive. The person who play Jordan, Elizabeth Debick, wasn't good either and if she does have acting talent, you wouldn't know it from watching this train wreck. But the worst offender bar non is Maguire, but then again, that isn't a surprised as he wasn't that good in the Spider-man films either. Overall, The Great Gatsby is the worst movie I have seen at the cinemas this year. The over use of green screen, the iffy acting and the stupid choices made by Luhrmann. I might be able to recommend this to fans of the book, but to fans of good movies, I would look elsewhere, preferably not another Baz Luhrmann film though.",3,3,7,30 July 2013
