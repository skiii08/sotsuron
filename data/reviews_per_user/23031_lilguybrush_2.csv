Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I feel a great disturbance in the force...
","...Like a million tiny voices yawning all at once. I've managed to avoid this film until just the other day, what with all the hype surrounding Episode 2 and the trailers looking so good I couldn't wait, so Episode 1 was what I came up with to pass the time and keep me entertained...mistake, this film is completely hollow, unfortunately a pod race or two and a villain who looks cool aren't enough to bring this film up to the standards of the original 3.The first film that George Lucas has directed in 20 odd years? I think that might be the first mistake, then there's Jar Jar Binks.If you're thinking of watching this just to fill the void between now and Episode 2 then all I can do is strongly advise you against it.",Null,1,2,4 May 2002
Army of Darkness," Hugely Entertaining
","After watching the first two Evil Dead films the last thing that i expected was this truly amazing comedy. Bruce Campbell is an amazing actor to be able to deliver such lines as 'Groovy' and 'Gimme some sugar baby' with such an amazing amount of cheesy goodness.If you haven't seen it, do so. If you have, see it again.",9,1,1,18 September 2001
