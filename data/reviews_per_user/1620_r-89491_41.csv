Your Name.," I like this movie more than I thought.
","I watched The Garden of Words a few years ago, which left me with the impression that Makoto Shinkai's visual pictures are beautiful but the plot is not exciting enough. This time, it was still a Makoto Shinkai-style movie, but the plot became much more interesting, and the sub-lens was even better. Although the plot is fictional and unrealistic, I am still moved by it.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Captain Marvel," I'm not familiar with this superhero
","But I fell in love with Captain Marvel and Brie through this movie.Compared with other superheroes, I especially like her impulsive and mood-oriented personality settings. After all, most superheroes are so perfect and thoughtful. Why not try to do things by nature? The interaction between Carol and Nick Fury is also very cute, and I like this friendly combination. Although the plot is not so attractive, I am looking forward to Captain Marvel's next performance in the Marvel Universe.",8,2,3,21 March 2020
Zootopia," Cute characters, interesting stories
","One detail I noticed is that the rabbit's ears will rise or sag with emotional changes, which is too cute. Love the songs inside,look forward to the second.",8,0,0,1 April 2020
12 Angry Men," Wonderful!
","The highlight of the whole movie is that the shooting location is in a conference room and toilet, which can be said to be a simple and single scene. Through dialectical discussions and objective statements, some people's subjective ideas are broken. The film focuses on the dialogue and debate of the characters. The protagonist understands everyone in a dialogue with an individual through his sharp observation. He finds a breakthrough through dialogue and some of their language and expression and then slowly break their ideas one by one. The film pays attention to dialogue and expression, and it is very wonderful to reverse the things with a small probability!",9,0,0,19 April 2020
Knives Out," Grab my attention all the way!
","What I feel is reverse, reverse and then reverse. Wonderful editing and performance! This film is not only a mix of British gentleman style and American background, but also clever settings and lens language.",8,2,4,16 March 2020
Spotlight," All cast members are so good and respectful.
","I can't tell in detail the shock I felt after watching this movie. Before that, I didn't know much about the issues discussed in the film. But when I watched this movie, I was deeply involved in the heavy, nervous and sadness that the movie brought me. You can't help but sigh, in the face of such a large and possibly sensitive topic, the film has a clear idea and a clear main line.",10,0,0,19 March 2020
Aquaman," At first I was unacceptable to heroes with such a rough shape, but this movie is really good.
","The part of Arthur's memory as a child is very cleverly interspersed in the plot. The love story of Arthur's mother is short but touching. To be honest, most of the plots are a bit unclear after I watched the movie, but I still remember the scene where they reunited in the end.",7,0,3,26 March 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun, exciting, but also just an entertainment movie.
","I watched it twice, the first time I watched it by myself, the second time I watched it with my friends, and the second time I still talked to my friends about various interesting little details in the movie. To me, it's a great fun, relaxing entertainment movie. I like 'Friendly Neighbor' Spider-Man, and I like the interaction between Spider-Man and Iron Man.",8,1,1,30 March 2020
Life of Pi," This is a movie worth exploring.
","The first half of the movie was a bit dreamy and romantic when the teenager and the tiger were drifting in the river. The second half is reversed, revealing the cruel side. I like this movie. It is well-balanced in commercials and arts. The plot is interesting, and it also makes people feel the charm of movie art.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A film with a prominent style.
","It is perfect in conflict and reversal settings, with dramatic conflicts and various hidden reversals throughout the film. These reversals are not intended to create a sense of dramatic ups and downs, but to highlight the obstacles to understanding between people through external behaviors and internal conflicts. These conflicts and reversals in details all point to one thing: Can people with different positions gain same understanding and tolerance? The answer is: Yes. But few people use conflict to express reconciliation. The reconciliation and tolerance in this movie were all completed in conflict.
In addition, the discussion about justice is throughout the film, and the ending of the film is thought-provoking.",9,0,0,24 March 2020
Forrest Gump," Bring inspiring and shocking power in a plain interpretation.
","'Life was a box of chocolates,you never know what you're gonna get.'I like this clever metaphor too much.If a person can really disregard everything, honestly, diligently and always insist on doing what they want to do, and finally, I believe that there will be many things in this world that will change because of you.",9,1,1,12 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Just like its name, it is best to see all kinds of magical animals.

Wreck-It Ralph," An animated film that uses creativity and emotion well.

Aladdin," I really like this movie!
","Love its songs, dances and all the humorous elements. When I was sitting in the cinema, I couldn't help following the characters in the movie. This is one of the best movies I've seen in 2019 and one of my favorite movies. Every character is so charming!Except that it is full of fairytale romance like other princess movies, this movie obviously contains more.",9,0,0,18 March 2020
Frozen," Let it go~
","To this day, I am still impressed by the phrase 'let it go'. Before I saw this movie, I saw a lot of discussions about the song 'Let it go'and Elsa. It was a long time before I saw this movie. It was then that I discovered that Anna in the movie seemed more like a traditional heroine? But...Just LET IT GO~",7,1,2,4 April 2020
Schindler's List," a fairly classic movie about World War II.
","For 1993 and beyond, it was a masterpiece. Of course, for now, it is still a fairly classic movie about World War II.When I took a course about movies, I I will still hear the teacher mention it, but I have seen a lot of movies about World War II, I think this movie is not far beyond other similar movies.",8,0,1,12 April 2020
Hidden Figures," A movie that is very inspiring for me.
","Although this movie discusses the current fierce discrimination, it is not depressed or dull, and the dialogue between the characters is also very interesting. This is also what makes this film unique: there is no fierce resistance or march. Instead, they use strength and hard work to prove their worth in the face of denial and rebuke.",8,0,3,8 April 2020
Coco," A discussion about death,love and memory.
","Real death is that no one in the world remembers you, because forgetting means real death.The scene that struck me the most in 'CoCo' is the sentence that family members said after Ector was not forgiven when he met his wife: 'you should not be forgotten.' Indeed, in our life, the present is precious, the future is precious, and so is the past.",7,0,0,17 March 2020
1917," 7/10 for stunning One Shot.
","Honestly,One Shot is really cool, and the lens art is great, but its plot did not impress me deeply. After watching this movie, I only remember that long, well-conceived shot.",7,0,0,16 March 2020
The Dark Knight," A very enjoyable DC movie.
","To be memorable, the characters must have two sides that belong to him, and there must be a change in the development of the story that exceeds the expectations of the audience. This movie does this very well. At the same time, the director is very good at using various imagery to express the theme. The film is full of various high-level lens metaphors. Good movies can often understand the key connotations of the film from a lens that seems to have no correlation with the main content. This movie is a good example.",8,1,1,5 April 2020
La La Land," Love its songs,dance and themes.

Life Is Beautiful," A movie that feels warm from the cruel

Up," Warm and romantic movie expressing love and dreams
","The first fifteen minutes is the Masterpiece. In contrast, the plot behind is not so surprising to me. Of course, it is still a lovely, warm and excellent animated movie with Pixar and Disney styles.",8,0,0,16 April 2020
Beauty and the Beast," A qualified princess movie.
","Before I watched this movie, I had received a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but when I finished watching it, I still thought it was a good movie. Regarding the fairy tales of beauty and the beast, I have only heard the outline, the specific plot is not clear, and I have not seen the animated version. This movie gave me a pleasing, fairy-tale experience. It is a qualified princess movie. But I was wondering, wouldn't it be better without singing?",7,0,0,20 March 2020
A Beautiful Mind," Compared to a genius mind, this is a story about a beautiful heart.

Joker," This is a good movie, but it seems that it is overrated.
","For someone who does not understand the background of the role of joker, watching this movie is very confusing in some aspects. In particular, the narrative of the movie itself is intertwined with reality. I can understand that maybe this is an artistic expression, but maybe it can be edited better. It is undeniable that the theme of the movie and the performance of the actors are excellent.",7,3,4,4 April 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," The 21st Century Gangster New Classic.
","This adaptation of Wall Street stockbroker Jordan Belfort 's autobiographical film of the same name is essentially different from the traditional crime film: it does not make obvious moral judgments in the film, and it does not arrange good and evil moral endings for the characters. The focus is on crime details and extravagant life, with very little attention to the victims. On the surface, this is simply a luxurious dinner that promotes the supremacy of money; but when you carefully appreciate the clips behind the video and the fate of the characters, you can feel the unexplained satire and breakthrough.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
The Green Mile," A three-hour prison-themed movie, but you won't find it boring.

Hitch," A comedy movie that makes people feel good after watching.
","Commercial movies often have some of the characteristics it must have. And these characteristics are often easy to become some routines. However, if you look at it more, you will inevitably be fatigue.
Therefore, in addition to satisfying the established commercial routines, the present good-looking movies must also come up with new ideas and new ideas. Routine and creativity are the way to tell stories in movies now.
Hitch has been very successful in both.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
Inception," The emotional drama is too procrastinating to resonate.
","The plot is very exciting and philosophical, but I don't like the protagonist's procrastinating love line. It always pulls me back from the intense and exciting plot.",7,1,1,22 March 2020
The Big Short," rich audio-visual language, straightforward honest attitude and objective sense of morality
","With witty black humorous and out-of-picture explanations, you can understand the relatively boring and professional financial topics.

Wonder Woman," A good movie that made me want to keep looking forward to the second.
","One of the action scenes perfectly matched the music, and it was very impressive. It left a deep impression on me. The story is wonderful but the ending is too casual. I have to say that Gal Gadot added a lot to this movie and the role of Wonder Woman.",7,3,13,26 March 2020
Black Panther," The overall plot is relatively boring.
",The only impression I left on the movie was 'Wakanda forever'. Haha.,6,2,3,28 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," I find it difficult to accept this style of film but at the same time find it unique.
","T uses a peculiar angle and way to express the effect of mind control on a little boy. I still find it difficult to accept the strange and absurd style and the love story of the little boy and girl is not my appetite, but I still feel that the ending is full of romance and hope. Scarlett's performance was short but crucial to the plot. Just Dance!",7,0,0,21 March 2020

Me Before You," Although the ending ... but I still feel that this movie has the power to heal people
","I read this novel before watching this movie. I have to say that the protagonist of the movie is quite different from the protagonist described in the novel. At least, I think the male protagonist in the movie is not as handsome, decent and strong as the movie. The rhythm of the story in the novel is very slow, the film is well adapted, and the ending touched me a little.",8,2,2,5 April 2020
Princess Mononoke," The epic of war between man and nature.
","Miyazaki's anime has always been brilliant due to superb technology and warm style, but this time the plot really left a deep impression on me and broke my usual impression of Miyazaki's works.The film has an epic free and easy nature, which perfectly reflects the theme of myth and spiritual strength. The end of the story also did not fall into the stereotype of the so-called 'happy reunion' ending of general cartoons.",7,0,0,11 May 2020
