Blade Runner 2049," Slooooow
",This movie is so slow and boring. Stupid plot and choppy scenes. It's like people can't write or act anymore. Absolutely zero entertainment factor.,1,8,14,26 February 2019
Unbreakable," Slow and boring
","I don't like the actor who played Mr Glass, but I decided to give this one a try. It has a few interesting parts, but it never took off for me, and that is a pity because it was such an interesting theme.",2,0,4,26 October 2019
Match Point," Oh my, this was BAD!
","This movie is basically about a piece of walking trash that has nothing, then is given everything. He marries into a beautiful and wealthy family, however, he has no qualms about betraying any of them as long as his selfish desires are met. While he's dating a beautiful woman in this family, he flirts, and eventually has an affair, cheating on both his girlfriend and his soon to be brother in law. And the worse part is that he gets away with everything, even murder.",1,0,1,18 May 2020
Justice League," Fun and Entertaining
","I really enjoyed this one. I'm not much of a fan of these Justice League type of movies because of their darkness, but this one seemed to tone it down a bit. The cast did a pretty good job and kept me entertained throughout the entire film. There were several light and witty moments that made me burst out laughing, especially when Aquaman sits on Wonder Woman's rope. Give it a chance!",8,0,0,14 October 2019
The Shape of Water," Didn't watch more than 2 minutes
",First scene is a totally nude woman dropping in a tub and starting to masturbate. I don't see why anyone thinks it's okay to be totally naked in front of everyone. I wish I would have read the certifications before I clicked on this one. I thought it was one of those superhero movies like aquaman. Ugh...,1,4,10,9 February 2020
Stranger Than Fiction," Pleasantly Surprised
","I watched this one not expecting much but to my surprise, I actually liked it. I'm not too fond on the main character.but still, it was entertaining... and different.",8,0,0,4 February 2020
