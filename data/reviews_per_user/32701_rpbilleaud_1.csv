Hereditary," Awful, just awful!
","When the buzz started around this movie, I was excited. Most terrifying film to come along in decades said. As scary as The Exorcist they said. Well, short story is, it wasn't. Not even close. I have to admit, immediately after watching it, I was like, OK, interesting story, certainly was creative. Not particularly scary, but it takes a lot to frighten me. The more it kind of marinated in my head, the more I realized it was full of plot holes big enough to drive a semi through. Even if it is never explained why Peter must jump out and die so his body can be possessed by Charlie and he can go on to become the leader of their cult (I mean if Charlie's spirit can possess a dead body, why not just possess Charlie's disembodied head? That would be way cooler), why the series of impossible coincidences that ultimately lead to Charlie's beheading in the first place? It seems that the point here is that Charlie has to die in order to lead this weird cult, but if that's the case, why no let her just die from her allergic reaction? Any number of different things could have happened that would have prevented her from being decapitated. Why didn't Peter call an ambulance when Charlie fell ill? If he still chose to drive her to the hospital, what are the chances that a deer would jump out in front of the car causing him to swerve to the EXACT location where a telephone pole was conveniently placed to knock her block off? Even if we invent the story that the deer was placed there by supernatural forces, how do we know that Peter will swerve to that EXACT spot, not drive off the road and recover control or hit somewhere else where there is not a telephone pole. Too much to chance. Too many questions with not enough satisfactory answers. This movie is momentarily entertaining, but an overall dud.",2,0,3,26 April 2019
