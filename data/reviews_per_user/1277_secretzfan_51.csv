Blade Runner 2049," A surprisingly enjoyable flick
","So I did not like the original Blade Runner. I saw it a bit ago before I saw this movie. I kinda thought it had some cool ideas in it and I enjoyed the characters, but I never loved it the way I wanted to as a big sci fi fan. Along with that I have never really liked Dennis V's film I did not like Prisoners or Sicario much at all, but at the same time as a sci fi junkie I knew I wouldn't be able to help myself and with the recent Ghost in the Shell movie that came out I knew I had to see after that. And Im glad I did cause this movie is pretty enjoyable. I did not think it was the greatest film ever like most critics say it is, but it deals with a lot of interesting ideas and Ryan Gosling dies a exceptional job as this new replicant character who we have to follow now. Also you do not need to see the first Blade Runner to like this movie. The movie does a great job catching new viewers up on the events of the first one so that you can enjoy this one as its own movie. It doesn't feel like it is trying to set up a franchise either. It is defiantly its own thing and as that I kinda really liked it. I thought Jared Leto also did a fine job in his scenes. He was not playing the Joker in this movie. His role was pretty intense and pretty contained. Defiantly found it to be a solid performance from this star. Also Ana de Armas who plays the AI has a really emotional relationship with K that I found to be really good as well. It was a really interesting bond that I wanted to see more of throughout the film. And Sylvia Hoekswas like OMG. She was probably my favorite performance in the whole film. She was truly frightening.Overall I highly enjoyed this film. Did I think it was the greatest thing ever..no I did not, but with so much against it I felt it came out on top for me.",6,1,5,4 November 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," The second best horror film eva!!!
",I do believe that this is probably my second favorite horror film after 'The Babadook' as it finds a way to have tension and build up in such a smart and interesting way. I found the horrific scenes to be very scary and to have pulled me right in and left me on the edge of my seat watching to see what would happen next. I loved the mystery around the film as well as it added to the tension and made each scene more gripping. Jeff Cutter should be very proud here as the cinematography on this film is amazing!! It help to add to the fear and the build up being done throughout the film as well. He managed to really ass another layer to a film already set up to be a horror movie. Josh Campbell did a good job with the story here and making it a lot better than what was in the original clover field. Overall this film is amazing and I defiantly recommend it to anyone looking for a amazing thriller.,9,1,2,21 June 2016
It," It just felt to much like Stranger Things
","Im going to be honest you guys I didn't love this one. I went into this with some relative interest in the story. I thought it seemed interesting and the concept was good too. Plus I enjoyed the trailer and the overall way it felt. I knew going in it wasn't going to be a straight horror in fact I wanted it to not be that. I wanted it to be like Stranger Things, but it just never clicked for me. I will start with this the characters here are great. The kids are each very interesting and thought provoking characters in there own right and I really enjoyed that about the movie. I loved watching these kids interact with each other and I thought that was very well done. The entity known as IT was also great too. Bill Skarsgard did a excellent job in his portrayal of this entity. He always had a presence throughout the whole movie and always was scary when he came up. It gave this feeling of intensity throughout that I really loved quite a bit. All the acting was great. I thought everyone gave a exceptional performance in this movie. But despite all of that something just always felt off to me about this movie. There were times when the characters would make certain choices that just felt way to clichÃ© and made no sense. I no that this is a horror movie but at the same time I expected something beyond a simple clichÃ© horror flick. I wanted something a little deeper and this movie just didn't go deep enough. It felt unsatisfying at times and I didn't like that. The movie also feels like it has to hold back cause it trying to be true to the source material too. It like Andy Muschietti had this grand idea but had to pull back cause he needed to be true to the book and the series and so because of that and those factors he couldn't go as far as he wanted too. I wanna say that I do like this movie though. There a lot of cool ideas here and the portrayal of adults in this film was fascinating and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. But even so the entire last act of this film feels like a strange derailing and was not nearly as interesting as what had built up to all of that. I also felt the ending was terrible too. I really didn't like the way it ended at all. Overall IT was a disappointment for me. A few cool ideas going on but overall not what I really wanted.",6,2,6,20 September 2017
John Wick," Terrible just fight action film...ugh.
","This movie was a waste of my time. With movies like 'The Equalizer' and the remake of 'Oldboy' the idea of the revenge concept is become more and more prominent. They have also become extremely exciting, but what was the appeal of those films? The characters were interesting and made the action more fun and promising over just seeing some guy beat up a bunch of people. John Wick was that. It as a beat em up revenge movie. It was a pointless movie that dragged on. I mean really. Why do I care? I didn't feel a reason too. I didn't care about who John Wick was or what he wanted and the whole mythes about him. This film gave me no reason too. People wanna talk about Transformers: Age of Extinction. Pfft talk about John Wick's lets just fight movie cause that is all that it was.",1,34,70,29 December 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The first Star Wars anthology works well
","To preface I did read Catalyst: A Star Wars story before watching the movie so my opinion is through that eye. This movie for me was amazing. I mean I really loved this film quite a bit. I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did with Force Awakens, but I still came out with a huge grin on my face when it was all over. The film starts a little bit slow. It takes time to introduce all the characters and tie up some plot points that were left in the book. The movie is a bit bumpy with the lack of a opening crawl which I felt was a huge issue for me and something this movie could of used to better set the scene and explain to fans where this movie takes place in the Star Wars time line. But from the second act to the last the movie really ramps up and gets really intense. Characters die at the hands of enemies. Things start to falter very quickly as the rebels fight to make sure that the death star hands don't get back into the hands of the Empire before it is to late for things to change. The character of Krennic is a really interesting character who you can't help but feel bad for. This is a man who wanted nothing than to be accepted by Darth Vader and Tarkin as a equal, but sadly was never able to do that as the two absolutely shun him away, and never hear him out. Felicity Jones I thought could of used a bit more depth to her character though. We get some idea of what type of person she is and her back story, but it sadly isn't enough to really make us care about her in the way we do for some of the other characters. This whole film really is lacking in the character department as it focuses a lot on plot. And that is a little bit of a hindrance and makes it not as fun and vibrant as the Force Awakens, but even so it is still a very strong film that is a much needed add on to the rest of the Star Wars universe.",7,1,4,20 December 2016
Passengers," A interesting idea that falters a bit in execution
","Passengers is a interesting tale about a man named Jim who wakes up early on a space ship and has to live a life alone in solitude on it. Sadly though he just hates being alone and makes the worst decision of his life by waking of Jennifer Lawrence's character named Auora, and from there that is how the story continues on. Passengers is a very beautiful looking movie with a lot of great visuals. The ship that they are on looking really amazing and very cool and was one of the first things that captivated me about this film. It was so interesting just to look at. Everything about it felt lived in and part of this bigger world. This was something I found that I loved about the movie from start to finish and was defiantly its best feature. This is also a movie with a lot of neat concepts going on in it. From the way solitude can affect us, and the decisions that we make and how they affect others around us. Sadly though the film doesn't go as far enough in those concepts as you would wish and instead tries to take a more safer route instead making for a slightly less interesting film with a narrative that feels a bit more flat and standard. This feels like a good film that has a really great film that is trying to break free from within it. There are so many parts of the film that are still good and kept me interested as I was never bored within it, but I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something too. Something that was more thought provoking. As it stands I do thing Passengers is a OK film to watch, but not one you need to rush out to see unless you just really want to look at the pretty visuals.",6,3,6,29 December 2016
Zootopia," A smart and funny film that I stand behind
","Okay so I have always been a huge fan of animation. There are soo many great animated films out there both that are dark and some that are really lighthearted and funny and this is no different than those. This movie works in all cylinders. This will be the most fun of any animated film I have ever watched. This jokes are smart and interesting. The dialogue is pretty compelling. And the world building her is perfect. It really does feel like our world, but it just at one point was being inhabited by animals. This movie really has a strong theme of racism going on throughout it as well and it does it in such a cool way without feeling like it is beating you over the head with its message. This movie is fun, cool and very inventive. It also leaves the door open to sequels that could deal with other things in our world. A great opening it leaves is the possibility of interracial coupling especially with our two main characters or with some side characters within this film. Sounds like a good idea for a sequel in my book. There is a lot of powerful ideas here throughout this movie and each one works soo well. Defiantly check this one out.",10,4,8,22 June 2016
Blade," What a nice little action film that wooed the world
","The film Blade took the world by storm when it first came out and people loved it. Despite its sub par critics reviews the movie still managed to make 70 million domestically and 131 million worldwide. It became a film that was beloved for its action set pieces and the interesting character of Blade, but when I watched the film today while I can see a lot of great action here this film lacks on giving a compelling and interesting enough story and it also ails in making the characters really that interesting either. While Blade is great to see on screen being portrayed by Wesley Snipes all the other characters along with the main villain do nothing for this story to make it interesting. N' Brush Wright's character could have been really something interesting, but she is not and instead feels very pale compared to Wesley and she and Blade have no chemistry together on screen. Stephen Dorff is a character that could have been great but is instead merely just a sideline Marvel villain before there was a MCU. Which is quite sad to say cause I saw some potential at the beginning of the fill for this character, but sadly he is nothing of notable interest. Overall Blade does have good fight scenes and is defiantly different from most vampire films. It has great action and great cinematography, but it fails in characters and story that are interesting enough to make the action understandable.",6,0,0,27 January 2016
Creed," The amazing Rocky returns!
","Let me start off by saying I have not seen any of the previous Rocky films before this so I am judging this as a film on it own merits as every film should be judged in this way. That being said Creed is one exceptional film. I mean it really is. This film wins on all accounts. Ryan Coogler was the right person to make this film a reality with exceptional acting and a emotionally compelling story to go along with it. This film wins on all fronts. Micheal B Jordan is a excellent new edition to this world and gives this story so much heart in his overall performance making a big comeback after the failure of Fantastic Four proving that he is a phenomenal actor overall and is rightfully deserving of a Oscar win at some point in his career. Sylvester Stallone also makes a strong return to the franchise making the story all the much more memorable. I really loved him in this role as he took it with all the force he had and he undoubtedly won for me, and is deserving of so much love for what he managed to do in this role as well. Overall this is a powerful film and is a welcome home for all Rocky fans, and is just a good legitimate movie as well.",9,11,20,2 January 2016
Spotlight," A investigative case that should feel boring and yet...
","Spotlight is a film that shouldn't work on any level. This film has no flashbacks, no blood, no sex scenes and yet it deals with child sexual abuse that goes on every day in many churches and all over the world. Spotlight brings up the question of religion and puts it on trial making for a lot of powerful conversations that could make a person lose there faith in humanity and in the ideals that many of Americans believe about there on faiths. Tom McCarthy makes this movie work so well. Allowing for each victim affected to tell there story in a way that never feels forced but instead like real people talking to each other. There are very few Oscar bait scenes as every character here feels like a real human being. Making this one truly amazing script. Sadly the film can't help because of the nature and the choices they have made in not showing a lot of flashbacks or grotesque sex scenes that there are times when the characters are all just talking to each other and trying to uncover things that it can feel dull and there are just so many politics and things that stop the characters from going all in and making this story a reality and letting the people know. Because of this I feel like this film did get some backlash from its Oscar wins because of all of these things. As powerful as the film is to some it may seem like a failure in there eyes, but it most certainly isn't. Spotlight might not be my favorite film of 2015, but it defiantly deserves to be up there because of its powerful dialogue and script that makes it all the more interesting to see it unfold before our eyes.",9,1,2,18 March 2016
Aquaman," A fun generic blockbuster
","For a decent while now the DCEU has been subject to controversy with the only movie being loved by both fans and critics to be Wonder Woman. Beyond that each film has had some sort of issue in the filming process before its initial release. Rather that be Suicide Squad with all of the Joker scenes being cut or Justice League with its infamous Superman mustache issue. All of these factors and more led to these films getting poor reception from critics and a few fans. So going into Aquaman there were many who were very skeptical.However with James Wan at the helm I had little worry. The man was known for making films that were commercially viable. The Conjuring 2 film made 320 million dollars on a 40 million dollar budget. Saw made 103 million on a meager 1.2 million dollar budget, and Furious 7 made over a billion dollars on its big budget 200 million dollar production cost. So there was little doubt that the film would do well. As far as quality Wan usually churns out quality work. His Saw series is beloved by many fans, his Conjuring work had been exceptional, and Insidious while not as beloved as Saw is also its own franchise. So I was pretty optimistic on him taking on the visual spectacle that was 'Man who can talk to fish: The Movie.'In regards to visual effects the movie isn't all that spectacular. There were areas that I found to be very clunky. Mera from a purely special effects standpoint never looked real, there were a lot of water effects that looked fake. The designs of the home where Aquaman lived were nice looking, but still needed a bit more rendering to be done. The fight scenes I will admit are pretty bad ass. Every fight seemed to find a way to surprise me. The ones underwater seemed to impress me the most with their visual flares.Jason Momoa also bolstered a lot of confidence and charisma in the role. His flirtatious attitude with Mera and his audacious approach to to his brother always put a smile on my face. He was defiantly perfectly cast in the role of a superhero.Additionally the film tends to be very funny. It always knew how to make you feel good when you watched. There was a lot of great chemistry between Aquaman and other character that allowed for some really enjoyable sequence that made me grin from ear to ear. It was just a good, upbeat, and fun experience at the movies.But my favorite aspect of the film was Black Manta. He was a marvelous villain. From start to finish he always kept me interested in the pain he was feeling at the loss of his father and how Aquaman chose not to save him. This anger fuels the antagonist and pushes him to vengeance. This desire makes the audience feel sympathetic to his plight and his desire for revenge.King Orm wasn't nearly as compelling, but I did like his character. He was more your standard bad guy who wanted to become king for his own selfish reasons and hated the people on the surface. There is a part of me that wishes this was two movies instead of just one. Perhaps then King Orm would be a little bit more three dimensional than he turned out to be.I really loved Aquaman and Mera's relationship. It was really sweet and funny. Jason played it more in the tone of him seeing her as a sexy catch and she was the sassy redhead who wanted him just as badly, and when looking at it through those eyes then they really work well for each other.Overall though there isn't really anything surprising here. It pretty standard superhero stuff. There a big awesome fight at the end of the movie that was cool to see. Mera and Aquaman have a overly dramatic kiss, and the movie ends with Aquaman giving a hopeful monologue to the future. So it was good.",7,1,1,1 January 2019
Concussion," A powerful film, but a flawed film
",Concussion was a film I was surprised a bit by how much I really enjoyed it overall. It was excellent and had a lot of really enjoyable moments in it. However the film doesn't go as dark as it should and instead fills itself up with this love story that takes away from the powerful message that the film was trying to convey and instead gets you to invested in the love story that is being shown on the film's screen right now. Along with all the grotesque imagery. This is a film that tries to hook you through the amazing acting of Will Smith. Who does a great job in the film undoubtedly. But the brunt of both the love and the hate need to go to Peter Landesman who seems to be doing a lot of true story films as of late as he tries to make a emotional impact on the eyes of the viewers right now.Overall Concussion is a film that you should defiantly catch at some point and then figure out your own opinions about it.,7,1,3,25 April 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Exactly what Thor needed
","So traditionally the Thor movies have typically been the weakest in the MCU, but when I saw the trailers for this film I knew that there is 90% chance this film would change Thor for the better. On top of that the director brought up how he never watched the previous Thor films and how this would reboot Thor for the better and it did.Thor Ragnarok is a full on, no hold bars cosmic superhero story in space with some great action sequences and some beautiful and gorgeous visual effects. It takes my favorite parts of the Thor mythos and amps them all up by 500x making for a more fun and more entertaining movie overall and I loved it for that. I love the fact that Thor isn't super stiff in this movie too. He is actually adding a lot to the comedy for the movie and making a lot more entertaining as well.The acting in this movie is also quite good too. A lot of the actors really do merge well into there roles and it is quite amazing and I like it a lot. Hela is such a great and evil villain too and her reasoning is really interesting as well. So is Valkerie in the film. She is also a great add on to the movie. Overall I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it.",8,1,8,5 November 2017
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino fan? You gotta watch this. Otherwise skip it
","OMG I loved this film. I have always been a Tarantino fan for years and years. I have loved everything he has done. And what he manages with Samuel L Jackson is amazing!! I mean seriously this is just amazed me to no end. This is a film that lives and breathes off the dialogue and speaking. It has a lot of commentary about the world we live in and I love this movie for doing that. It is also just a really interesting film on racism in the same way Django was, but this film is no Django. This movie falters because of its premise. It just isn't strong enough. It is also too long. Not like Kill Bill either where it was long, but didn't feel long. This film just has a really slow burn to get into the story before it does get interesting. The acting is superb tho. Not just Samuel L Jackson is great, but Kurt Russell wins. Jennifer Jason Leigh is just funny with all of her lines. \ Walton Goggins also is a new actor who won me over with this movie as well, and deserves a lot of the love in the film as well. Overall this is a film that I would recommend people go out and give a shot too.",8,3,10,27 January 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Its nice and well done
","After seeing this film I didn't come out saying that it was the greatest film ever or the best one in the MCU, but instead saying this a a very cool take and also a very different take on the Spider Man character. Marvel defiantly understands Spider Man and understands his history and who he is supposed to be and I really felt that hear. It was nice to watch a Spider Man movie where the main actor really does feel like a kid who is just trying to survive life. And that much alone I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun. The Vulture played by Micheal Keaton is also a very good villain for Peter Parker to face. The guy is truly scary and truly threatening as well and that was something I really enjoyed about the film. With most MCU films the villains are pretty meh for the most part, so it was nice to see a villain who was scary and made your worry for the hero's life. That was a definite positive. Also the fact that the villain didn't hurt the rest of the movie was good to. Cause Guardians had a good villain too but sadly it hurt the rest of the movie. I also really enjoyed the Zendaya's character. I thought she was really charming and really funny too. She was a great and very interesting character to me who I defiantly enjoyed when she popped up on screen. There is also a twist with her character that I won't spoil. Overall while not one of my favorite movies in the MCU I still had a good time. I had a lot of fun with it and would defiantly recommend it.",7,0,3,12 July 2017
Suicide Squad," A flawed film with characters that work
","Before the wreck that was Batman v Superman happened I was rather extremely hopeful on this movie, and it was the one film I was anticipating more than Batman v Superman. I have always adored the Harley Quinn character and what Bruce Timm and Paul Dini did with her. I am also a huge Deadshot and while I didn't think Will Smith was the best choice for Deadshot I was still intrigued with what the actor could bring to the table. And then Batman v Superman came out and it was a huge disappointment and tampered my anticipation for Suicide Squad. Also the fact that in the marketing they were pushing all the musical cues my way also hurt my anticipation for the film overall. But with all the my hopes and dreams being dashed by a rocky start for DC and a bunch of trailers feeling more like music videos than actual trailers I did come out of this film liking it quite a lot. Now from top to bottom this movie is cliché. We get a really boring villain that you have seen in every Marvel film and you have a team of characters having to stop this villain from destroying the world. That piece of the movie is very standard and something we have seen being done over and over again endlessly. However this film makes up for those clichés with its characters that are really all quite something to fall in love with. Rather its Killer Croc's one liners, Deadshot's love for his daughter, Harley Quinn's love for the Joker, and the Joker's overall insanity everyone has something interesting to add to this film. This makes the film a lot more fun and a lot more easier to get through. The comedy is great as I found myself laughing a lot throughout my first screening of the film and it all just works on all cylinders. If you are a fan of these types of films with super powered characters then I think you will defiantly enjoy Suicide Squad quite a bit. It brings some light hearted enjoyment to the dark and gross DC cinematic universe.",7,4,7,13 August 2016
Baby Driver," The funnest getaway movie ever
","Baby Driver was one of the most joyful experiences I have had at a movie theater for quite some time. The main lead in Ansel Elgort brings a lot of energy to the role making him really fun and entertaining. The character is also just very well written. He is a very good and kind hearted person in the movie, but he is not so good that he lacks no edge. I mean the kid is in the getaway driver business so he has seen a lot of bad stuff happen. Lily James plays a amazing role as the love interested for Ansel . I will say that her character through could have been given a little bit more to do than what she got, but I did believe that her performance told a lot about why she was willing to do some of the things she did and why she never ran way. But the star of this film isn't Baby rather it is the music and Edgar Wright's amazing direction as the film's use of music adds a lot to the enjoyment of each scene along with the erratic action scenes that can go from calm and innocent to intense and scary. A very good balance that is pulled off by Edgar. And it only bolstered by how much you care about the characters in the film too. Your with them and want to succeed with them till the very end. Overall Baby Driver is a fun and fast paced film that will have you on the edge of your seats till its over.",8,11,24,3 July 2017
Justice League," Justice League is a Marvel film
","I have gone back and forth with the amount of praise and criticism I feel this film deserves. After a while of thought after seeing the movie I have come to say I think this movie was a lot of fun on its own. Its not Wonder Woman that is true and it does go darker than some Marvel films ever would, but Justice League is in fact a Marvel film through and through. Rather u like it or hate that. Having a director like Joss Whedon come in and do re shoots on the film only helps this claim. This film is a result of a whole lot of criticism regarding this entire universe and how it was built. The foundation was never steady to begin with and as a result this film hurts because of that. Luckily despite that Justice League still manages to come out with a lot of entertainment value that puts a smile on your face. The movie has a lot of funny scenes that do put a smile on your face and make the film a lot more enjoyable. The characters are far more interesting and I enjoy seeing them coming together making for a far better experienceThe film does have a few issues tho. The entire second half of the film is a mess from a technical stand point. The editing is really poorly handled and so is the flying green screen overhead. Also mustaches for days. There are some weird cuts and slices and a few other problems that the film has. Overall Justice League is still a enjoyable film despite some of its flaws that it had. I defiantly want to see it again. It was fun and light and I just really overall enjoyed my experience in the theater.",7,1,3,22 November 2017
Split," A birth of a new cinematic universe
","In this world where everything is in a cinematic universe and everything is about a superhero with super powers M Night has created a new type of universe with superheroes. Heroes who don't war capes or fly around doing heroic deeds. This is instead something much greater and far more shocking. This is the story of a supervillian who has been given a dark and twisted origin story as a man who kidnaps children to feed on. People who have never known pain for one day in there life. That who this monster goes after. The film is strongly gripping for that reason and is much more interesting as well. And when a villain is born then so is a hero. The young girl Casey is the hero in this story. And she is very similar to the villain in her back story. She is a girl who has known pain and hardship in her life. Who has seen what it means to be afraid. And that is why she is the survivor of this story in the end. M. Night has found someone who forces him to hold back, and to tell a different type of story than he has before. A story that is far more interesting and far more complex as well. Jason Blum is the perfect man to make M Night a better filmmaker than he was. Allowing for a more interesting and engaging story to be told. That is why Split works.",8,4,14,5 February 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Verse revives people's love for Miles Morales
","A Review from a comic book nerd XDWhen going into Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse I was very excited. I had been reading Miles Morales since 2014 alongside Kamala Khan, and while I never loved him as much as I loved Kamala I had always enjoyed the story of Miles in the Ultimate Universe. He felt different from Peter Parker as he was more grounded in his responsibility to his family first. He was never defined by some major death of a family member the way Peter was, but rather instead by the loss of his Peter Parker. He became Spider-Man to honor his Peter's legacy, and that felt like a solid motivation to me.Back in the Ultimate Universe era Bendis was on a hot streak with Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and other street level heroes. This fine tuned writing really did well for the Ultimate Spider-Man as he would eventually create a really powerful bond between 616 Peter Parker and the 1610 one, and it was this relationship that I was elated to see get portrayed on the big screen.However there was one major worry I had about this film, and that was the entire concept of the spider verse. I just never liked the idea of a billion spider characters all coming together in one big giant event, and I defiantly didn't want it in Miles's first movie when he should be the focus. It also made me feel like these writers didn't think Miles could stand on his own which also irked me. Luckily though in the film these other characters don't take away from the character of Miles Morales as the film still revolves around him. The other Spider characters are kind of just there to help felt the big bad, and because the film is still called 'Into the Spider-Verse,' but there not major. I did like Spider-Man Noir a lot, and also Penni Parker was cool too.In regards to the animation for the film I felt it always looked pretty crisp and clean. I liked the style of allowing a comic book come to life in animation. It allows for it to feel more realistic, and for the colors to start to pop more. You can tell that the writers put a lot of love and care when crafting this film with the stylization in mind. It is something that is both amazing and spectacular. Pun intended. :-PThere is quite a lot in the film that pulls from Miles's story in the Ultimate Universe. I really enjoyed seeing Ultimate Green Goblin realized on the big screen, and his battle against Peter Parker was absolutely great. I also loved the death of Ultimate Peter Parker as it both dark and brutal. I literally started to have goosebumps in the theater when watching it. There was also the bond between Aaron Davis and Miles that was captured perfectly, and when Aaron died it felt like my soul left my body.That being said despite my love for this scene I did find Aaron's death to be a bit problematic. It makes Miles lose some of his individuality in my opinion. And with the movie trying so hard to get us to see that Miles is more than a Peter Parker knock off the idea that Miles would need another major loss to define him really undercuts his development. Especially when we have a more compelling story to tell with his relationship with his Uncle were Miles is caught between the world of crime and the world of a hero.Going into some performances I thought everyone did a pretty solid job. I thought Chris Pine's portrayal of Peter Parker was very original and a different take on the character. I found Jake Johnson's Peter to be absolutely amazing and quite memorable too. Hailee Steinfeild as Gwen Stacy was perfect casting in my opinion, and her friendship that she created with Miles was really heartfelt. And I can't wait for that to be developed more if we ever get a sequel to this movie.Overall this was a exceptional film with a really heartfelt story. It understands what makes Miles a really compelling character, and was just a lot of fun to watch on screen, and so for that reason and others I truly believe that this movie deserves many accolades.",9,5,10,24 December 2018
Dunkirk," With a lack of character development Nolan manages to make the cinematography the star
","Christopher Nolan is a great filmmaker that is undoubtable to me. He had accomplished many amazing feats and this film is no different than those. However what his past films did have that this one lacks is a really care for the characters involved and what was going on in it. This film is lacking in that aspect and instead the camera angles and the overall feel of the film is what makes you care more than the characters themselves do. I came out this film feeling a intense claustrophobic feeling throughout. There are many small areas that characters are in and the action feels so intense and it does this without any blood or gore. Instead it is all about the camera movement that makes you want to puke,tense up, and get scared for sheer life. Nolan uses the characters to put you inside the action and make you feel like you are there even if your not. It is a amazing work of art and powerful as well. Dunkirk truly succeeds in every way of what it tries to accomplish.",7,5,7,30 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," The most mature Marvel film ever
","To be exact I probably say this is a 9.5/10. This movie works on so many levels. It is so amazing and is a great follow up from Captain America: The Winter Solder. There are so many great and amazing moments in this film and they all work and it doesn't fill to crammed in. The Russo Brothers have done what Joss Whedon was unable to do in Age of Ultron which is find a way to connect all these MCU movies in a way that makes sense. The movie starts off with all of this political drama that is going on in what are some of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in my life. There all so interesting and they work on so many levels. The film makes you almost want to well up in tears at times with just how good it is. I will admit it does going on a little too long, but it still keeps you invested and makes you want to no more and learn about these characters, and how they are feeling. This movie also makes Iron Man 3 relevant again. Something I thought Ultron would do but didn't. In the film we get this broken down Tony Stark who is wounded and hurt so much by what had happened previously. He has lost Pepper now and finds himself alone without anyone else. He is more angry now and more unhinged because he created Ultron who almost destroyed the world. This movie makes you understand why Iron Man has chosen to take the side of the people and protect them by locking the avengers up. However it also lets you see Captain America's side who is against the government because he seen the corruption within them after Hydra had taken over. You also see that he desires to protect Bucky who he loves dearly. Both have there reasons and you get that and you really don't want them to fight and it makes you feel so sad when they do. The standout stars were great. Black Panther had a full arc here. He started on one path and ends on another. It is amazing and makes a full circle that is interesting and compelling. Chadwick Boseman also gives off a great performance and accent as well that makes it even better. I really liked that Black Panther didn't tell any jokes or quips. He didn't care he was all business. Spider Man was also great too. This is the Spider Man I wanted since I watched Spectacular Spider Man in the 90s as a kid. He is young, a kid and not so overly hot make actor. He is just the nerdy Peter Parker and I like that.Scarlet Witch and Vison's relationship was also great. I liked the humor there. I also liked Black Widow who gave her all. Really just all the Avengers did well in this film. This film does a good job mixing its humor with its serious moments. One never over takes the other. It all works in many ways. There is a really good mix of everything her that I really had enjoyed. The film does have some bad. Baron Zemo I didn't mind him.. I liked him more than Lex Luthor in BvS, but he wasn't needed. When I went into this film I was going in ready to hate Baron Zemo. Why do these films need a villain. You already have heroes v heroes why do you need some really bad villain to be in it. That being said for the plot of the movie it worked and it worked it spades. The film manages to use the destruction caused by the Avengers to be the crux of why this guy is here and is willing to tear up the Avengers. I also really didn't like the big giant title cards when they changed locations. I thought it was really strange. Just have little words geez. Anyway that is my review of this film. I really enjoyed it. I thought it worked in all cylinders.",9,1,6,12 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Welcome back to the Wizarding World
","It has been quite some time since the last Harry Potter film that ended off the battle against Voldermort and Harry living happily ever after. The story was over and we were all sad to see it leave, but we were also happy back when we heard we were getting prequel films. Still there were a lot of mixed reactions on the idea if Warner Bros was just trying to milk the franchise for all it was and wasn't caring about telling a good cohesive narrative. But let me put those fears to rest. Fantastic Beasts is a joy to watch. It is a world were we the original Harry fans are finally older now and these new characters are all adults too. The beasts are fun and good to watch. The story keeps you entertained and Newt's development is a ride you will enjoy taking from beginning to end. You learn to love these characters and the story there trying to tell. It is just in general a really great time to see. Fantastic Beasts is quite amazing. The film does suffer from some pacing issues though. I didn't really like how it transitioned from the dark and terrible story to the more light hearted stories they were trying to tell. Katherine Waterson's character I thought also needed more to do in this film as her journey wasn't as compelling as I really wanted it to be either. Ezra Miller played a very good villain, but because of the strange transitions didn't really allow for you to care enough about his struggles or what he was going through. Still overall this is a very well made film. It pulls the fans of this franchise back into this world in a big way and keeps it fun as well. I love all the actors involved in making this movie and I love the characters that go with them. The story was engaging from beginning to end and all in between. This movie gets a thumbs up for me",8,4,9,23 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," A great film that suffers from running time and going too big
",The Conjuring 2 manages to up everything that was in the first one. Doing what most horror sequels tend to do by upping there production budget and effects even more. Sadly this is also what hurts the Conjuring 2 as it feels very bloated and very lengthy. A good horror movie should be 90 to 105 minutes in length no longer. This film instead is 134 minutes long making for a long over done film with waaay to much going on. The film just doesn't feel very concise has a good story . And the movie suffers from not enough being cut out and making it keep going on and on. The characters are still great as I love the relationship between the warrens and the love story that is also being told within this film as well. The cinematography is also amazing along with the sound design. Everything in this film has a purpose and adds to the film's beauty and all the fear that is being built up with it. This is a film I recommend to any horror fan as I think there is a lot to like here if your in that field,7,0,2,20 June 2016
The Theory of Everything," A magical and thought provoking experience
","From beginning to the end the film known as the 'THEORY OF EVERYTHING' shocks and inspires us. Showing us the true story of a iconic brilliantly smart male. It shows us the tale of a male who was sick and near death, and how he overcomes that and moves to become one of the most brilliant minds to ever be known. This film is defiantly in the league with 'A beautiful mind' as it moves us in many ways and feels our hearts with so much glee. at the same time however the movie goes beyond that as well as we get more insight into not only the mind of the great Stephen Hawking, but also the mind of the notorious wife whom Stephen Hawking fell madly in love with. I also can't help but give a hand clap to some major actors in the film such as Eddie Reymaine and Felicity Jones who are able to hold there respective roles very well in the film and make there ideals known throughout. The performances are top notch and can't be beaten. They give some real emotion and a lot of heart felt passion that will make you want to cry as you leave the theater.The music score in the film is also done well as it adds to the emotion that the title has and makes it more memorable. In the end you will love this film and as it should be watched by all. Rather if it wins a Oscar or not.",9,0,1,25 December 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," A decent X men film
","X Men apocalypse adds nothing new to a landscape filled with superhero films and lots of X Men films of old, but just cause it doesn't add anything new doesn't make it a bad film. \From Xavier going bald to Magneto becoming one of the four horseman this film is standard from beginning to end, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It was fun to see Magento completely wrecking the X Men. And all of the end of the world stuff wasn't too bad either. I enjoyed Apocalypse as a villain even if he was cliché.The movie doesn't develop the 4 horsemen enough, but that not a bad thing at all. They didn't need to much development. What they were given was good enough for the story that was trying to be told.Quicksilver steals this movie though. He really is the best part of this franchise",7,33,58,25 June 2016
Ex Machina," Ex Machina will defiantly end up as one of the Oscar worthy films
","So I don't give every film that comes out this treatment of greatness, but when I watch one that is as captivating and as thought provoking as this one then I will give it my full recommendation for anyone to give it a look. The film just works on so many levels despite being this slow movie indie film. In fact if I were to say this movie had one flaw than it was that fact. The movie takes a bit of time to set the scene, but even as it is setting up its characters it is still captivating you. It sets them up in a way were you begin to grow close to them and understand what there going through. The whole film is built like a sci fi horror movie as well. From the moment the lights change you begin to feel a lot of tension in the air as you watch the movie. Every second takes your breathe away and you love it. It is the scariest non horror film ever, while beating out so many other stupid and dumb horror flicks that were used to seeing. The acting is also superb. Alicia Vikandar is now an actress who I want to see a whole lot more of. I can't wait to talk about her in my other reviews for the future. Domahall Gleeson also does a good job being this poor young boy who had no girlfriend playing into the geek trope of smart kid with no real life, and I really found myself buying into a lot of it. I quite enjoyed his character.Oscar Issac also does a great job playing the villain in the movie. There was so much mystery surrounding him that you didn't know what to think. He really transformed into his role as he always does. Overall Ex Machina is a treat to see whenever you get a chance to see it.",9,3,6,28 December 2015
Sing Street," A joy to watch from beginning to end
",From the very start of this film I could tell there was something very different about this film. From the characters to the set design everything about it was pretty amazing. It drew me in to learn more about the world that it was inhabiting. Everything about it felt real and true to how characters in this time period would act. None of it felt like it was a 2016 film. All of it made me feel like I was there in this time with these characters. Sing Street is a story of a young boy in in the 1980s of Dublin who goes to this catholic school and has a pretty hard time making it there. It is pretty hard for him there are many bullies at every corner and the principal is also pretty hard on him as well from the very start. The whole film feels like it is taking you on this ride with this kid as he finds a group of friends and decides to create a band together in it. The music in this film is amazing. I found myself moving my head to the beats of the music as it was just so enjoyable and fun. I love how the kids in the film used music too as a way to deal with the hardships that they were going through. It really made me feel more connected to the characters that inhabited this world. And the importance music had for them. The romance in the film is also pretty well done as it is a really powerful add on to the movie that makes our main character have even more depth than he already had. This film was a absolute joy for me to watch and I am glad I did. This film is just a good time to watch.,8,1,2,29 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars the last Jedi is ballsy
","This movie is undoubtedly going to be divisive and coming out of this film my immediate reaction was very mixed on this film. There were some things about this film that I hated and other things about it that I loved. Rian Johnson really tried to do something different here in this movie and for that I applaud him, but that doesn't mean I have to like all the changes he made. I cannot talk about what I dislike about this movie without going into spoilers. I do recommend seeing it though just to see some of the things that are done. CAREFUL FOR SPOILERSThe biggest issue I had with this film was the treatment of Leia. I found they way Leia was used in this film to be horrible and awful and almost disrespectful to Carrie Fisher. They had a chance to have her character die in this film, but instead they toyed with her death, and thus played with the audience. The scene where Leia opens her eyes and comes back to the ship was cartoonish and stupid. It was the dumbest stupid scene in the entire movie. Like what Leia is Superman now? The handling of Luke Skywalker also isn't that great either. While I did gelt like this was Luke the choices they make with this character in the second half of the film is terrible for me. They have Luke face Kylo and not even actually face him instead choosing for it to just be simple force ghost and then have Luke die in a really lonesome way making him feel more like a coward than anything else. There is also this forced romance between Finn and this girl named Rose that comes out of nowhere. And the character of Rose in general is poorly done. Now lets talk about Rey......cause man...Rey is a really intriguing part of this film. The relationship between her and Kylo is really interesting and thought provoking. The bond they share for me was really nice and beautiful and kinda sweet too. Even if it all does kinda start to crumble down. Whenever it cut to them was when I really enjoyed the film. There is of course the whole Kylo knowing Rey's parents stuff too which was really interesting, but the problem is that the movie itself leads you to believe it something bigger than it actually is so when the reveal happens your very much let down by it. Also while Finn and Rose bond was meh the fight between Finn and Phasma was amazing!!! For me it really did redeem Phasma for me and make me like the character a lot more than before. The film is very experimental in nature. There are a lot of interesting scenes like the weird mirror scene where we see multiple Reys is really something else, and asks a lot of different questions about Rey as a character. The death of Snoke I also found to be really great as well and really cool look at Kylo's unsureness too. And Kylo being the leader of the first Order was a great choice as wellSo for me this a pretty much half and half film. There is a lot of great stuff and a lot stuff I hated. And yet it is weird cause oddly enough I want to see it again and see where the story goes from here.",5,0,0,18 December 2017
Jurassic World," Lack of story but still enjoyable
","This was undoubtedly one of the funniest movies of 2015 begin Kingsman the secret service for me. Sadly were as Kingsman had strong and amazing characters with a lot of layers Jurassic World instead goes for a more cheesy and over the top approach that I really don't like at all. For this reason it lost a lot of its greatness when the idea of going back to see it again came into my mind. It is a film that I like overall, but has so notable issues. The characters aren't well defined. The children are just annoying little brats as well. Yet the film still manages to succeed on other fronts such as its CGI is great and soo much fun to look at in 3D or IMAX. The overall experience is really gripping and interesting as well making for an overall pretty fun final product. In the end while a flawed film it still worth the watch",7,15,33,2 January 2016
Logan," Fox transcends the comic book genre again
","I wanna give this movie as close to a 10 as you can get without actually hitting it. After I came out of Logan I was truly emotionally broken after seeing it. It was so powerful from every bloody and gore filled scene. Logan tells a powerful story that takes place in the X Men world, but doesn't feel like any of the past X Men movies. The film instead is more like a dramatic piece. It has edges and flows and feels powerful. Every scene in it feels more impactful than the last. Truly if superhero films keep getting this good it won't be long till the Academy Awards wakes up and has to nominate one of them for best picture. It just can't be denied forever. This is no longer just a typical comic book film with a comic book character as the lead. This is a drama that tries to pull at the heart strings on the viewer. It is nearly perfect. The film has many layer to it. It speaks more on family and the bonds that a family can share when there together along with getting a sense of normalcy in there everyday lives that they live. It would bring you on the verge of tears out how powerful this film truly is. It works on so many levels and deserves a lot of praise.",9,1,5,5 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good but.....ehhhh.. still has flaws- End of superhero age?
","Note I still gave this a 8/10. Why it doesn't live up to the hype it still a fun movie. This is not a bad film as it has a lot of strong moments in it, but there is still work to be done. Joss Whedon is a god among men and knows characters well, but that doesn't translate when you have as many as this does and it is not a series. And that is just the issue here Whedon. If this was a TV show it be the best show ever, but it isn't so writing it like one makes it feel so cramped. The story in this not to different from the first Avengers movie. It is still simplistic. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story. Same as how The Avengers wanted to fight Loki and defeat him. As I said Joss Whedon needs to go back to TV. The character development was so packed in with this film. It is like you were trapped in a box you couldn't get out of. And while some moments were great between the characters not all of them were as fleshed out. The romance was stale and random, and didn't feel authentic. It just became a plot deviceThat being said the character development is were the movie shines. I came out this movie liking every Avenger. Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Captian America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch,and Quicksilver all were developed to the point were you could love each and every one of them. Compare that to the last Avenger movie were Iron Man and the Hulk took all the glory and came out being the only ones we cared about. Sadly we all have to look at the box office and reception this movie got and as a nerd realize this may be the end of another superhero age or the beginning of it. Marvel has failed the non comic book readers and made them feel alienated. It has a cinematic universe idea which at first was brilliant has instead begun to fall and that hurts. I want people to love comic book movies and I would love it even more if these comic book movies could help people wanna go out a read a comic book, but this seems like a movement to a dark age. If Marvel doesn't change, ad if Kevin Feige doesn't make a decision to find a balance between the lightheartedness and the darker scenes we will see a day when the comic book era would have to be rebooted again.",8,1,4,29 May 2015
Selma," Not impressed
","I was not impressed with Selma overall. I honestly expected a bit more from the film and instead ended up watching every other Martin Luther King movie ever. Now this movie does have a few things going for it An amazing soundtrack- One that really goes with the impact of the story A few deep and emotionally gripping scenes. Yes there really powerful in many ways. However we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy. But I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all. I never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned. There are just other movies that do Martin more justice-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to ChinaThis film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe. Overall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me.",4,1,2,1 January 2016
La La Land," One of the greatest films I have ever seen!!!!
",La La Land is a joy to watch from beginning to end. I mean it is truly a love story to old school Hollywood and theater musicals. From the singing to the dancing and to the love story that goes throughout it. The film was really so much fun to see play out on the big screen. I am really glad I got see this movie. La La Land stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling who both have dreams they wish to accomplish in life. One wants to own a jazz club and the other desires to be a Hollywood actress. They each push one another with all there might to help the other succeed at making there dreams come true. While also finding solace in one another as well. The film combines the modern day idea of dreaming with the older style of it in a very well done way. Showing both the realities of being Los Angeles and the more glamorized version of Los Angeles as well. This makes for a more enjoyable experience when you come out the theater. Overall La La Land is a film I would highly recommend people check out. There is a lot of great fun here and a lot of enjoyment in it as well.,9,1,8,13 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A nice try that can't get up the hill its fighting against -slight spoiler
","I wish I could love this movie more. I wish that I could think that it is a nice new look at the story with some cool twists and ad ons, but sadly it is not for me. Beauty and the Beast is a try hard movie that just doesn't live up to the hype around it. The animated classic is a best picture winner ad this film tries to be a shot by shot adaptation of it, but it sadly simply doesn't have the spunk of the original. The film does do some very good things. I did find a lot of strength in the character of Belle and a lot of energy in Emma Watson's performance. It was a very good performance and one of the more positive things about the film as a whole that I really liked about it. I was really taken in by all the time and commitment she had put into this role. The set design of this film is also quite good. I loved how pretty this film looked and was one of the things that really grabbed me about this movie and made it more enjoyable for me. Every design of the film mad me more interested in learning about the world they inhabit and just staying inside it. Sadly we have to leave all that beauty for a lot of slow meaningless padding. This film just feels too long. With 2 hours in length the film just goes on and on. The animated classic was only a hour and about 15 mins and told it's story quickly and very welly. This film drags everything out and makes it all too lengthy and I hated that about it. Also people made such a big deal about Le Fou being gay well then all you gay haters can get over it and all you supporters can feel very whatever about it, because they do nothing with it. They literally just sit on it and have a few lines here or there, but for the most part if that is what your worried about then don't be. Overall Beauty and the Beast is a slow moving film that meanders a lot and doesn't know how to tell this story in a captivating way.",5,2,6,22 March 2017
Sicario," So much hype but was let down
","I don't know what it was about this film. but it just didn't work for me at all. The story wasn't that engaging and despite some great performances I wasn't brought in. The movie has a strange start as it tries to pull you right on into the action, but it just ends up feeling confusing and just leaves to viewers lost. Not to mention that the cinematography while great for the war scenes doesn't do much for those character moments at all. Denis Villeneuve also did Prisoners, and while a beloved film by many it is also lacking and gets hate from those who love it. This director needs to learn how to balance emotional moments with good plot development without making the film feel dull and boring. Sicario just isn't a very interesting and enjoyable film. Emily Blunt actually gives a pretty bad performance in my opinion. Instead of giving facial expressions of power and strength they feel more lost and diluted. That being said Benicio Del Toro kills it with this film. Giving a far superior performance, and having a lot more better character arc as well that feels powerful as well. Overall Sicario is not a film I would recommend for people to see. The whole film lacks emotions and strength making it a pretty weak overall film.",5,2,5,15 February 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," James Gun holds strong by breaking the formula
",This film is amazing in so many ways. This film does push away from some of the ensemble feel of the first one making this film not feel as strong as the first one did by giving more development to other areas in the world that Guardians inhabit. It is amazing what James Gun manages to accomplish in this film. In this short he has managed to capture all the most important parts of the original making it more interesting and dynamic. The first Guardians of the Galaxy was pretty much a 10 for me. I thought it was one of the funnest movies I had seen. Only being outdone by the Oscar wining film known as Birdman (which I watch once ever year). It is very naturally written and paced also extremely well. It was such a great film that was always going to be nearly impossible to outdo. And in some ways it is better. Vol 2 manages to give development to one of the lesser characters in the last film known as Yondu Making him a lot more interesting and a lot more dynamic as well. You come to care foe Yondu as a person. The relationship between Peter and his father is also very well done and has a lot of heart. And for the first time ever the Marvel movies actually manage to make a really amazing and captivating villain who matters!! This film also has a legitimate death in it. James Gun has done it people. He has broken the Marvel formula!!!Sadly it is still to the defeat of the ensemble feel of the first one as the rest of the cast while still great and fun aren't being as highlighted as they were in the first one. The jokes are more like Age of Ultron jokes with a few being really funny. And the final act of the film feels like every superhero movie ever. Overall though Guardians of the Galaxy is still a fun movie that you will still very much enjoy despite some of its flaws.,8,6,10,7 May 2017
The Witch," it is time for a witch hunt
","I had heard a lot of good and bad stuff about this film. It was strange that in this world of found footage horror films, bad cgi horror films, and really poorly made slasher flicks that we could ever get a period piece type of horror that seems like it would be closer to a true story than any past found footage movie. I don't think this is some artsy horror film like 'It Follows' was, but I do think it is in many ways a sophisticated horror film that uses a lot of language of that time period. Sadly I don't think that sort of old style speaking is going to appeal to the mass of people who wanted to see a horror films, but I do think that it will get them talking. This is a real treat of a film that should be watched. It is not a psychological horror flick, but rather a scary and yet neat look into the ideas of the Salem Witch Trails that had once happened and brought fear into many people of that era. It brings in the use of magic and witchcraft in a pretty new and different way. It is a film that works on all levels to make the reaction that the directors and writers want us to feel. The Witch is creepy and daring and has a lot of characters to match. It works on multiple levels to be a cool a neat flick that I think you can find some enjoyment out of.",8,1,5,28 February 2016
Sausage Party," A very smart film that sadly misses some laughs
","When the first trailer for Sausage Party came out I was shocked by both the name and the trailer. The concept sounded so amazing that I knew I had to check it out and so I did and while I enjoyed it a lot I also found myself not laughing a whole lot. Which was strange to me. The cursing and the violence started to blend into the rest of the film and in the end just left me more intrigued by what the movie was trying to say than what the jokes were. Sausage Party is a idea that was came up by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. This idea however came along while they were doing a little AMC show called 'Preacher.' Coincidence? I think not. Preacher is a TV show based on a comic about a man named Jesse Custer who gains the power to basically make anyone do what he wants them to do. This comic book is highly renowned for its commentary on the state of Religion at that time. It talks a lot on the idea of God and him being more of a dictator than anything else. Sausage Party does the same thing in this film. It makes a religious allusion that 'God' is the humans and the food is us in our world today. We see God as the amazing figure and don't ever question why he was put there in the first place, and I love that about the film. Its social commentary was so good and fun that I had to give this movie a 6/10.Now if only we could get more jokes that hit",6,3,9,13 September 2016
Parasite," Parasite crafts a dark but brilliant story about our society
","This film got a lot of praise going into the Oscars season this year for not only being a commentary of society in the same way Joker does, but doing it through the lens of a Korean family. by doing this it forces the film to have a different feel from any film of its type. Many Americans don't understand the class system of other countries, and getting to see another countries class system being represented on screen gives the film a very different type of feel.In Korea there are a lot of stricter gun laws that stop people from getting to them so in order to make a kill you would have to use other methods, and that does play a role within the context of this film and adds to the complete and utter fear that can come from it.There are also a issue for more flooding for the poor in Korea in which this film also addresses in a lot of big and massive ways throughout the film as it becomes the catalyst for why the family makes many of the choices that they choose to make within it.Parasite really does manage to capture the essence of what truly matters in our society for the poor and the rich and their differences",9,1,4,7 April 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," How far are we willing to go for art
","For this review I will defiantly need to have spoilers as I just can't talk about this film without it. I think everyone should watch this film at all costs. it is a truly inspiring film that is masterful written with a ending that is not only shocking, but strange and appalling for what it is. It pushes our ideals and look on the world that we have come to live in today.It pushes how we see our dreams and desires and just how far we are willing to take them. In today's film world we see that the superhero genre is growing with films like Man of Steel, The Dark Knight, and The Avengers, but we can't help but ask ourselves do these characters, actors, directors have anything for themselves outside of just being the big superhero beat em up movies that they are. Well Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance puts this question down on a silver platter and begins to ask these mind numbing questions that must be asked. We see Michael Keaton take on the role of an actor gone mad after leaving his franchise known as Birdman. He has started to see things now look at strange images in the mirror along with hearing voices as well of his former self. He tries to discredit the voices as he pushes himself to become a true artist on the stage. he takes a huge risk much like the director does with this story. He tries to tell a emotional story on the stage of a man as he desires nothing more than to shock his audience soo much. He goes through rehearsal after rehearsal trying to get his audience to enjoy what was going on while he was on the stage. The actor also deals with his daughter who feels he is washed up and finished as an actor and makes fun of him for trying so hard.When real blood is thrown on the stage then the stakes go high and the film has now gained a new dimension and has shown us just how far a person can go for art!The actors are truly what helps make this movie really work well as Michael as Emma Stone put on the stealer performances that help hold the movie together while Naomi Watts helps build the structure. However neither Naomi Watts nor Emma stone ever take the spotlight off Keaton at any point and help make the movie feel well rounded.Now what is stopping this from being 10/10 well while this movie is defiantly gonna win a Oscar it still has some hurdles. For instance the lesbian scenes and side story with Emma Stone was dry cut and never went anywhere aside from giving the audience loads of fan service to watch. Which is fine I just believe in having some balance in fan service, but I am not going complain to much. Though I wish there was more to this than what we got. Either way Birdman is a amazing film that you should get everyone seeing you know.",9,2,8,25 December 2014
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman brings Hope and Optimism to the DCEU
","It been quite some time since I have gone back to the theater to review a movie. It nice to come back with something that was this great and this enjoyable like Wonder Woman. First thing I would like to say is this movie touched me and made me feel so much better about the world we live in. It shows that in a world of darkness and depression like the rest of the DCEU has shown that we can get a film that shows that there is hope in our world and that there is hope in this franchise to truly be better than what it is now. This is what Superman really should be. So I wasn't shocked when I heard that Patty Jenkins models this movie of the original Superman films cause it really felt like that. There was so much love and care put into crafting who these characters really were at there core and that I really found myself connecting to. Each character was given such personality and felt like real live human beings. You can also feel Geoff Johns influence all over the film I would not be shocked at all if he was actually also writing the movie and juts chose to be uncredited cause this feels like something he would write. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor was such a stand out in this film. He was really one awesome character and was awesome to see a male in a movie about feminism still be shown like this. It helps male audiences and female audiences to be able to see each other as equals and not be radicalized like the Ghostbusters movie did. Speaking of which this is the way feminism needs to be done. This is the way that it needs to be executed. Showing a female character as a individual and also showing that she can stand besides her male counterparts. This movie does such a good job of making great and empowering statements that I think any woman can very much connect to. I mean I am no female myself, but I could see that maybe happening in this film. A lot of critics are hampering on the third act. And I don't see why. The third act I feel is very much needed and is what adds so much power to the film and the message it is trying to convey to the viewer that you really have to have it there. It is a really powerful climax and also a really epic one that I think you will enjoy. Overall I would highly recommend Wonder Woman to anyone. No matter who you are.I think there is a lot for you to enjoy.",8,7,16,5 June 2017
Creed II," Creed 2 beats the odds
","When the first Creed was released in theaters it had an explosion of success. With Coogler's expert direction the film managed to achieve an impressive amount of emotional depth from the audience. Every character interaction felt authentic, and you really could connect with them on some deeper more intrinsic level. Each of the fights carried with them some baggage that allowed us to really care about every confrontation.With these high standards set it was easy to become hesitant of the second film's ability to live up to its predecessor. This only worsened when when Ryan Coogler made the decision to leave the project and so he could work on the now highly acclaimed 'Black Panther.' With so much going against the anticipated sequel one could come to believe that Creed 2 had a shot at becoming one of the worst movies of 2018 or at least the most disappointing.Now after three years I can proudly say that Creed 2 does successfully capture the feeling of the first by choosing to be a story about a man becoming a father. Adonis's relationship with his wife, Bianca, is put to the test when Bianca gets pregnant with a baby. This is becomes a issue for the young Adonis as he wrestles with being a boxer and raising his son.Things become increasingly more precarious when his father's killer, Ivan Drago, comes to town wanting a fight with Adonis pushing the young man to make some pretty tough decisions in his choice to avenge his father's name or to give it all up so that way he can be a husband to his wife and a father to his child. This becomes the emotional hook to carry the story and help us get more enraptured with these characters. In the end Creed 2 is a exceptional film with a lot of intense drama and truly impactful moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more.",7,0,0,18 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Overall a disappointment for what she be the greatest film in history
","It has taken me a little bit of thought to finally just mark my review of this film and get my thoughts about it and put them into words. Batman v Superman should of been a film I loved, but instead it was film that I kind of liked but not really because it had all of these big glaring issues. These issues aren't like with Star Wars: The Force Awakens were I could easily brush them off and say the film overall worked. No!These are really major issues. From top to bottom. There are writers and directors who can do a million things in a movie and make them all fit and work in a really good way. Films such as 'The Avengers,' 'Serenity,' and 'Age of Ultron.' All where films that had to balance a lot of story and managed to do it in a fun and engaging way. However Zack Snyder can't do that. Yes he did it sort of with Watchmen, but that was just right off the comic book page type of film with already and story built in. Batman v Superman is basically a original idea that takes from a million comic book storyline, and tries to mash them all together why also being both a Superman and Batman movie while also being a build up to Justice League. And Snyder just can't balance it all in this film. But even bigger than that the issue this film really had was changing the motivation for the fight. I won't spoil it, but let me tell you it is one of the dumbest things that this movie did and it just failed on every level. Jeese Eisenberg as Lex Luthor also turned me off big time. In the trailers I liked his lines because they were good lines and very symbolic, but the way he delivered them made him seem like a silly mad man over a human being. He seemed just psychotic all the way around, and I hate a Lex Luthor who is like that. Now that all my anger towards this film is gone let me talk about why I am still able to give this film a fresh score in the end. Although this isn't a story Snyder, David Goyer and Chris Terrio weren't able to balance it is still a stunning film you gotta see. I love Snyder's films. All of them and while this may be his weakest one there is still some fun to be had here. The cinematography of this film is amazing. It is just stunning. If Snyder can do anything it is how to shoot a film. Every scene you see looks like this gorgeous art painting. And it looks just great. The fights look great, the way the camera zooms when people talk is great. All around the cinematography is well done. Larry Fong should get a high pay check for managing all of this beauty. And it should be scene in Imax too. This film looks best on a Imax screen, but be prepared to be completely blown away by it as well. The acting is actually pretty decent. With the exception of Jesse Eisenberg none of the actors really made me cringe when the spoke or made me bored. I feel like with the lines they had they all were delivered well and made for some great and powerful scenes between some of these titans. The fight despite the poor reason for it is still a pretty fun fight. I loved watching Superman get taken down by Batman then in turn Superman tries to do the same thing with Batman. It was a pretty cool thing to see. The nightmare sequence is probably the best part of the film. Watching a evil Superman face off with Batman and all the solders trying to capture Batman was great too see and it was just a really well done scene that I liked to watch Batman in doing battle with all these Superman lovers. Did I mention Batman and Superman were great. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil are both great in there roles as Batman or Superman. And deserve a lot of praise for becoming these might titans that go into battle as well. I also didn't mind Gal Godot as Wonder Woman either, In many ways she stole the show, but I am not giving the actress to much praise till her stand alone movie. It does make it seem like there is a good chance that Wonder Woman film will be a really good film overall in moving the DC universe forward. Overall Batman v Superman had some good in it and some bad. It should at least be as good as Star Wars, but it can't even get close. This film is just okay in many ways. I didn't leave this film hating it, but I didn't leave this film in love with it and praising it either. Still go out and see it for yourself and tell your thoughts on this film, and then perhaps you may love it or hate it, but give it a shot, and see what happens.",6,0,4,2 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," May the force be with you even if it is a flawed force
","Let me start by saying that this is a really amazing film. One that we all should sit and enjoy. It really is something to behold. JJ Abrams has made many great films. I loved the first Star Trek it was something new and cool to me, and while I don't think JJ made as good of a film with Star Wars as he did with Star Trek I still think he has done a really good job here and should be completely proud of what he made. That being said there are some flaws here. 1. This whole movie is a rehash of episode 4- A new Hope. From top to bottom it is, but it is a rehash that works very well, and is completely understandable. I mean like it or hate it we all now 'A new Hope' is a good story that the new generation is deserving of 2. Gwendolyn Christie was wasted here- I mean really getting a good talented actress like her and then having her do virtually nothing in this movie. I mean it was just a waste. 3. No answer on how the dark side came back we just know that they are back and are here to cause of a lot of Havoc, but really did we need to know all the stuff that happened. 4. There is a CGI scene that is just dumb..nuff said .. and actually that is all this movie's issue. No really I'm serious. This movie had a really good main lead known as Rey. Rey I found to be a really interesting character whom I wanted to no more about. I had soo much fun with her watching her grow from this girl who didn't believe in the force to becoming someone who was able to use the force and more. I loved how she just didn't want to go right in for her destiny at first and she tried to run from it when it had began. It made her more compelling as a character and interesting to watch so when she did finally accept her destiny it was a great moment. John Boyega also did a very good job with his character of Finn as he was funny and quite enjoyable to watch. Although I do think some of his dialogue wasn't that great I did get a good understanding on why he was doing what he was doing and why he was on the run. I also could understand the comedic choices made with him as he was just your normal everyday type of guyPoe Dameron played by Oscar Issac I fell in love with in this movie. I mean from beginning to end he is great. He is undoubtedly a merge between Han Solo and Chris Pratt's star lord and it works. He is the stand out human star in this movie Now while Poe is the best human star in the movie there is a great droid in the film known as BB-8. Who was just the cutest thing in the world. Really enjoyed watching little BB-8 doing his thing on screen. The villain Kylo Ren is not some Vader wannabe at all. He is probably the most compelling and interesting villain brought onto screen ever. Han Solo is back!!- No really he is back!!- It isn't just the nostalgia talking. I have seen this movie twice now and I believe that Han Solo is back, and he is still a overall fun character to see on screen. Snoke was also quite a interesting character too, and one that I can't wait to get to see more of in the future. Overall this a fun time at the movie and even with all of its flaws it still a enjoyment to watch. We should all be happy to get this great of a film.",8,3,13,28 December 2015
Unbroken," A truly shocking story that I am glad I went to see
","I am not a big fan of these types of films honestly. I don't care about war time films like 'Fury' or 'Saving Private Ryan' that doesn't mean there not good films at all there just not my cup of tea. However Unbroken had a lot of good reception around it, so I decided to go and see it and I am happy I did. The film starts of very slow and even drags its feet in the mud, but when the conflict really starts happening and the characters face many problems that would happen in WWII the film takes a interesting turn and becomes a movie that I really can stand behind and have a bit of enjoyment from. Will it be in my best films of all time... No?? But it is a good film all the same. It talks a lot on the overall endurance that people have to stand up for what they believe in at all times, and it is quite amazing to see all the hardships these characters go through in order to survive in the face of death and never break for even a moment. I do think that this a good movie to watch. Now I can't talk about a movie that takes place in WW2 without talking about how Japanese films on it differ from this one. While watching the film I found myself thinking back to 'Grave of the fireflies' which is a Japanese orientated anime film on WW2 that talks of the sorrow the japs felt as America came back to throw bombs on them, and all there sorrow on the issue. It kinda makes me think as a look at this film were the pain stops. Which is why I liked how the main character was able to see beyond the pain he was feeling towards them, and forgive them for what they had did to him for all that time. Making this a film that is also about forgiveness in the face of hardships.",7,1,7,28 December 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The fear is the dream
",Wow was this one well made film. It does make you fear your dreams in the worst way possible. With little real need to be a gore fest this film wins at all it sets out to do. It is a film that can truly inspire fear into our hears with the way this film does it scares and manages to freak us out in the best possible ways. I can see why this led to Freddy Krueger being and iconic horror movie villain who can terrify anyone whom he comes in contact with. The film is amazing and very cinematic in scope. As the film doesn't rely on jump scares like today's horror films do and instead inspires fear with its graphic imagery. The main girl in this movie is also great. She is probably one of the best female lead characters in a horror film that I have seen. Overall there is a lot to love here in this film. It is scary and really enjoyable to watch on a late night,8,0,1,23 February 2016
Deadpool," Not an Oscar and yet the best movie ever
","We didn't need to have a Deadpool movie with a exceptional story. Or at least I didn't. I was perfectly happy with a movie that had Deadpool making jokes and killing people in a by the numbers revenge movie, but this film went way beyond that. This was just supposed to be another Kick Ass movie, but for me this movie can compete with the R rated spy thriller known as Kingsman which I also gave the same rating as this film. This film has some great action stunts, good blood and a lot of death defying stunts, but that isn't what makes it a good film. This film also has a heart and it wears it on its sleeve. It is the most romantic film for a non romantic movie. It beats out Pepper and Tony in the Iron Man movie and can compete with the relationship between Peter and Gwen in the Amazing Spider-Man. It really is a film that can break boundaries. This film also keeps the spirit of Deadpool alive Giving us a perfect interpretation of the character. There were a few minor differences from the character created in the comics such as the multiple personalities and I am pretty sure Wade Wilson wasn't crazy before the weapon X project happened. That being said it was still good enough for all of us fans of the character to really have a good time with him. Deadpool wins!!!!",10,4,15,28 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," The best spy film of 2015!!!
","It is not only the best spy film of 2015 but right now for me it may end up being the best film of 2015. No seriously it really might. I haven't had this much fun with any film since the first Avengers movie and this is defiantly a lot more adult than that one, and even with its adult themes and a being a 'R' rated film it holds so much back from us. I mean there are times when you forget that its 'R', and then you watch a fight scene in it and you remember the reason why. Still with all that being said it still a film I highly recommend. I have personally watched the film at least six times maybe more. Colin Firth does a great job in it to the point were he should be commended for what he managed to do in the role. He truly gave a lot of life to his performance playing the hardcore spy who was been doing this for a long time. He also was a great father figure and a lovable character overall. Taron Egerton is defiantly going somewhere in the future with his career, and I myself can't wait to see where he finds himself at. I absolutely loved him playing this kid from the ghetto who was trying to make a life for himself and be something to someone who wanted him to be. So overall this is a exceptional film that deserves a lot of notice and needs to be on everyone's top 10 list even if it isn't number one like it will probably end up being for me.",10,2,7,28 December 2015
Joy," The hardships of business
","You know I was a little bit worried to go and watch Joy. I thought it sounded like a really nice and interesting movie, but it was not getting a whole lot of praise of recognition at all and a lot of people sounded pretty disappointed. But I must say this is a decent little film that we got here. I mean I really enjoyed it overall. I mean the first 20 to 30 mins of the movie is awful and cheesy, and really hard to get through, but once it gets out of that kinda over the top acting and story it becomes a really compelling film about a woman who really had to work, endure, and struggle to get to were she wanted to be. I feel like it talks to all of us as well. People peg this a radical feminist movie, but I am not so sure this is as feminist as it is just a movie about a person who decided to not take crap and get her life in order. The main character just so happened to be a young white woman and I also must say that Jennifer Lawrence gives another riveting performance that nearly brought me to tears. The film does have issues tho beyond its 20 to 30 mins it also has unnecessary narration that only came to be used for one scene and then was thrown away like it was nothing. It was a pointless move and didn't add anything to the film. They also brought up that Joy had a son, but he was never brought up in the movie so that was sucky. That being said overall this is a movie that is worth your time",7,1,6,30 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," A film a bit over-hyped but still wins because of characters
","To let you know I had not watched the original Mad Max movies when I had watched this film, so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis, and using that fact I must saw that George Miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it. John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. As for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. Now Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was 'Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman.' I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. Now with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. The lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to itThe entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. The villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10.",7,0,2,28 December 2015
