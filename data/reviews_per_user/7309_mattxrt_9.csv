The Expendables 2," Hilariously bad
","If you were a fan of the first films R-rated grittiness, you probably won't like this. However this is a lot more funnier than the last one and seeing all these over the top action stars together is pretty cool to be honest. And Chuck Norris alone is enough to warrant it a five star minimum,",5,0,0,9 May 2019
Man of Steel," Disgrace to Superman's character
","It's amusing that the movie is titled Man of Steel and not Superman because this film really isn't a Superman movie. I don't know who the main character in the film was but it's defininitely not Superman. It's pretty evident after watching the movie that Zack Snyder has never read a single Superman comic in his life. And no the new 52 version doesn't count, there is a reason why everyone hated that version of Superman, why DC rebooted with Rebirth not 5 years into the characters run because that version of the character fucking sucked balls. Superman is not Batman in blue, he is not a brooding uncharismatic punching machine and most of all he isn't a fucking murderer. Superman is supposed to beacon of hope, not some depressed guy who looks he finds it's a chore everytime he saves someone. If Zack Snyders idea of a Superman movie is where everything is bleak and pessimistic all the time, where Pa Kent thinks it might be acceptable to tell his teenage son he should have let a bus full of children drown, or where Superman snaps someones fucking neck then I have only one thing to say to him, fuck you. You turned one of the most iconic, bright and colorful characters in the comics into a half assed Jesus parallel. This is as bad as if not worse than when Joel Schumacher turned Batman into a wise cracking comedian with portruding nipples. Hopefully next time they get someone who actually gets the character to direct a Superman movie, not someome who's ashamed of the characters roots. Would not recommend even if someone held a gun to my head.",1,2,5,3 January 2018
The Revenant," Impressively directed but not much else
","The revenant seems more like a movie made to showcase Leonardo Dicaprio's acting chops than to tell an engaging story. The film is pretty by the numbers and while I sympathized with Hugh's predicament, it's something we've seen in films over hundreds of times. The film looks stunning and is beautifully shot though, I can see why it won the Oscar for Best Director and Cinematographer so props to them both.",6,2,2,9 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The Russo Brothers did it
","I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it.
Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one.",10,17,48,24 April 2019
Logan," Absolute Masterpiece
","Logan is a dark but beautiful tale of the end of the X-men. All stories must come to a close and Logan beautifully closed the first generation of X-men Movies. Set in a not so distant future with realistic technological advances and realistic characters, never before has a superhero move felt so relatable and human. A must watch for any film lover. Though be warned, this movie is violent and disturbing, not for the faint of heart.",8,2,7,10 October 2017
The Dark Knight," The most overrated film of all time
","This film does not deserve to be in the top 10, without Heath Ledgers performance this film would be thoroughly mediocre with weak action scenes and terrible screenwriting.And while I don't think this film is worth a 1 star, I'm going to rate it as 1 star to counteract all the Nolan fanboys giving The Godfather (best movie of all time imo) a 1 star too prop The Dark Knight to the top spot in the IMDB top 250.",1,3,16,27 March 2019
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Worth it for seeing the big battle but not much else
","If you are a big Twilight fan, you'll probably love this movie. For those who aren't big fans of twilight, the final battle alone is worth watching this movie for. There is a serious lack of good vampire vs wolf fight scenes in movies and television and if the twilight series is the only place I can get my fill of big budget vampire v wolf fight scenes, so be it. 5/10",5,0,1,9 May 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," One of the worst films ever made, Zack Snyder truly is a hack (Beware, this review section is filled with Hack Snyder fanboys)
","I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I mean it's frickin Batman meeting Superman for the first time on the big screen for god's sake, I have fond memories of reading their comics and watching the Justice League cartoons as a child but Zack Snyder just doesn't get these characters.This film is honestly a disgrace to the legacy and history of all the comic book characters it adapts, his brooding Superman is basically Batman with superpowers, Batman is a remorseless killer and Lex Luthor is a wannabe Joker mixed in with Mark Zuckerberg. It's like Zack Snyder thought how to best make these characters as unappealing and as far removed from their traditional portrayals as possible and then decided to make them the opposite of what makes these characters intriguing and interesting to people.People at this point might interject to tell me these characters were changed to fit the story that they were trying to tell, but I'm telling you that the plot is a nonsensical mess too. Batman is pissed off at Superman because he holds him responsible for all the deaths and destruction caused in Metropolis but then goes and runs over a bunch of criminals and people's properties with his Batmobile, what a hypocrite. Not to mention the worlds greatest detective doesn't even bother to do a background check on Superman despite meeting face to face and knowing his real name and where he works at earlier in the movie, which if he did, he'd know that Superman has a human mother named Martha and we wouldn't have to deal with one of the most poorly executed and hamfisted scenes ever put on film. Lex Luthor's 'genius plan' when he fails to get Batman to kill Superman is to unleash an unstoppable killing machine that in no way could possibly end up well for him, either Superman defeats Doomsday and Lex goes to jail or Doomsday kills Superman and destroys everyone and everything in it's path which just happens to be on the planet Lex frickin lives on, what the hell was he thinking.
Honestly the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. Some people might be going are you for real? What about abominations like Catwoman or Green Lantern? While they were terrible absolutely terrible films, I wasn't anywhere near as invested or hyped for those films as I was for this one. The fact that I had so much expectations from this just makes this film far more disappointing than any other poorly made run of the mill superhero film.",1,4,9,26 October 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fitting ending to a great series
","As big Harry Potter fan I was pretty satisfied with this movie. Some of the few issues I do have with it is it could have been a little more faithful to the book, and I wish it could have been a bit longer as well and there was more focus on characters like Fred, Lupin and all the characters who died. However the movie knocks all the key moments from the book out of the park, Snape's revelation, Harry's death, the ending etc were all really well done. The main leads also give their best performance so far in this one.",8,0,0,9 May 2019
