Blade Runner 2049," This movie could be just for you.
","It really depends on what you like. If you like overly long movie, with plenty of extensive and prolonged camera shots on pensive androids which have very little psychological depth to them. If you care for characters, except one, or so it appears, that are androids devoid of soul. If your eye sight is good enough for dark scenes that do not lend themselves well to 3D viewing naturally, if you love romance with virtual reality personalities. Furthermore if you like movies who have little to say yet take themselves seriously, than this movie is absolutely for you. Half way through the movie I was looking for the fast forward button, but in cinemas they are not available, yet. I even considered an early exit. Simply put, Blade Runner lacks total originality, and digitally created worlds have long ago cease to entertain many viewers. BTW, I think that Gosling was a bad casting choice, although he is enough of a professional to keep his chin up.",6,9,21,6 October 2017
The Village," Post movie feel good.
","I will not go into details about the plot of the movie, or how good or bad the movie was. What i would like to tell is how good i felt that evening as i went to bed. As I was resting my head on my pillow, i felt extremely good about humanity. My heart and mind were filled with hope about the future. That is what the movie did to me. In am writing this 10 years after seeing the movie, and i can still recall with clarity how i felt that evening in bed. Hence, the movie gets a 10 from this reviewer.",10,4,4,16 November 2019
