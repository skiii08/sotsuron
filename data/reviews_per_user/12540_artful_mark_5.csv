The Avengers," Overstimulated, yet Underwhelmed
","Ugh! 'Avengers' wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their 'advance warfare' includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn't boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of 'THOR'. PLUS, PLUS, he didn't even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don't think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of 'The Incredible Hulk', it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in 'The Avengers' that he wouldn't even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap's love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see 'Jenny Agutter' listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn't stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates.... No real philosophic underpinnings like X-Men had... It was kind of just DisneyWorld on Crack, but it was fun to see on opening night....",6,37,72,4 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," 'From Hoboken to Spokane.... He's the Star Spangled Man, with a Plan!'
","***Sepia-toned Spoilers*** If you love a virginal patriotic man in tights, you must see Captain America: The First Avenger. Plucky young Steve Rogers is beset upon by bullies. Don't worry Steve, It Gets Better! And how. Military is in Rogers blood, but a host of maladies plague his body. He's skinny, he's asthmatic, he's everything pharmaceutical companies look for in a poster boy, but he's got one thing other's ain't got... Courage. After numerous attempts at enlisting, our hero gets in the Army, with the help of a tipsy Fairy-German Godfather. Steve has trials in boot camp that allow him to showcase his ingenuity, resolve, and dedication. Not since Madonna has such Ambition grabbed America by the balls. With a little help from Howard Stark, who has one hand in the future, and the other on a random hot-dame's tushie, Steve is injected, erected, electrocuted, and pretty much comes out the other side as Marvel's American Adonis. It's like he read one issue of Men's Health, and all the tips worked! (!!!) The tone of the movie is self-effacing yet sure-footed. I was only annoyed by the line, 'This is not about me'. How many Marvel Movies about Chris Evans must he remind us that it's not all about him? (???) Peggy, the love interest is pitch-perfect as a tough-as-nails high-brass broad who doesn't just dance with anyone. Bucky is strangely Steve's Age, and almost gets a hero moment before he falls off the train. There's some fun Iron Man post-foreshadowing (wrap your head around that), and we see where Tony Stark gets his mojo, his moulah, and his machines. The Red Skull could have benefited from a bit more back story, but he is serviceable, and no one sheds a tear when he suffers Odin's wrath (wrap your head around that one, too). Captain America is a feel-good ego boost at a time when we are all at each other's throats. I honestly never questioned whether Cap was a Democrat or a Republican. He certainly didn't seem concerned with what tax bracket he was in. There was enough multiculturalism in the cast to feel good about. And for the first time, a 3D moment really got me, and I actually flinched. ***Big Spoiler*** There is 'The Avengers' trailer at the end, which feels kind of cheap and breaks tradition of having an credits end-cap scene. It was slick, and unfortunately only showed Scarlet Johannson as a female Avenger. So far from the female buffet Marvel served up in the X-Men flicks. I was hoping for some surprise like She-Hulk, Spiderwoman, or even The Wasp or The Scarlet Witch. Looks like The Black Widow will have her hands full of intrigue (good thing she's so flexible~ yawn). If you plan on seeing 'The Avengers' in May 2012, be sure to catch up on Captain America lore here, first. Oh, and you may never look at a red, white and blue freeze pop the same way again!",Null,1,17,22 July 2011
X-Men: First Class," The Freshmen 15: too many characters, too little development
","Read on to get *spoiled* on XFC! As a decades-long fan of X-Men, here is what I noticed. I do recommend seeing the film. Great intro. Shaw's and Erik's spot-on German gave me high hopes for the kind of intricately cultural world the X-Men can be. Then it kind of went downhill. The White Queen, here just Emma Frost, was listless and bland. She had no sarcastic and droll dialogue, she was 'top-heavy' with not enough rump to back up her legendary figure, and her face was kind of chipmunky instead of drop-dead ice gorgeous. Azazel, the character I was most interested in getting to know, may as well have been made of cardboard, he said almost nothing and we learned nothing about him in this film. Ditto tornado-guy (never got his name until the credits~ 'Riptide'). The biggest plot let down for me was Shaw having the helmet we see later in the series for Magneto. I had assumed that the metal surrounding Magneto's head allowed him to create magnetic fields so strong Xavier couldn't penetrate them. Guess anyone can have a metal head with the same effect (oh, wait, how does the Prof read Wolvie's mind?) Anyhow. There are so many other characters that get so little treatment personality-wise, it's almost like flipping through a deck of cards. Angel~Banshee~Darwin~Havok. We just assumed they joined the CIA team because they were asked- very thin motivation. Mystique, Beast and of course Eric and Charles fare much better. Erik is my fav performance in the film, handily beating Charles in the charisma field. His accent kind of flows into a Scottish tinged mess at the end. I was very pleased with the special effects. All were top-notch, but did little to quell bland team development. I kept waiting for Magneto to help Charles build Cerebro, or at least re-build it. Highlights were fun cameos by Wolverine and the original Mystique/Raven. Abysmal and totally taking me out of the film was Moira McTaggart. She had no accent, no discernible culture of any kind, and played a generic hot CIA-agent (?) The original Moira in her cameo in X3 had more gravitas in one scene than this one in the whole film. The one character I was surprised by was Darwin, and was disappointed he didn't 'survive' very well. Allegiances shifting at the end seemed kind of stiff. The music was often heavy-handed. The White Queen SHOULD have knocked this movie out of the park, and was the biggest writing/casting misstep. Beasts feet kind of grossed me out, but once he furballed, he was cute. Beast did more in one-week than seems possible: Fashion maven, courtier, rocket scientist, chemist, physicist, psychic 'brain surgeon', etc., but it was neat having him around. I'm not salivating for the second installment, but will watch it. XFC suffered from the Freshmen 15, it could stand to trim up and get serious about studying...",6,3,10,3 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Punky Bruce*ster gets Lights Trashed by Bane (& KittyWhipped!)
","Holy BatSpoilers!'Shrimp Balls?' utters Selina Kyle in the films opening setting. But, don't roll your eyes just yet, the main course is coming... Kitty gets pearl necklace from Playboy Billionaire, but, don't roll your eyes just yet...Poor Bruce is on his deathbed, but Kitty's prowess has him Make-A-Wish with Lucius Fox! BAM! The Bat is not just in the belfry but is all over Gotham as evil, wicked, mean and nasty Bane busts some heads. Alfred the Butler spills about Batman's fatalistic choice at the end of 'The Dark Knight'. Batman lets Alfred go. Bruce gets jiggy with a hot foreign tree-hugger. Bane busts even more heads. Kitty gets motivated to lead Batman to Bane. Bane trashes Batman's lights. Kitty almost cries over spilled milk. Batman, ends up in a country without universal healthcare and learns all about Bain Capital. Touchdown! Batman defies lack of universal healthcare and goes after Bain Capital. The Caped One punches Bain in the facemask, then kitty comes in and kittywhips poor Bane and throws in a nice kittyquip too!. The clock runs out for Batman, or does it? Kitty gets tired of Occupying Wall Street and goes for gold by credits end.... I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars. Lots of explosions, but too much exposition explaining Bane's origin, and not enough fleshing out of it. Kind of the same with The Cat. I preferred Burton's origin-handling of the Cat and the Penguin. But for popcorn fare, this can't be whipped.",8,1,3,20 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Fantastici!
","*Spoilleramhorra!* Well. Done. Potter. The audience was completely rapt. When the WB logo came on and the music swelled, I felt like my kid was graduating High School Valedictorian/Captain of the Football Team! Pooh-Pooh on the nasty Dursleys and the greedy banker Goblins (perfect political and economic timing on those fronts). Hermione got her hero moment and her man. Ron's Mom got to kick ass and the theater raised the roof on her invective to Bellatrix! Dumbledore was heavenly. And Snape, Severus Snape, undoubtedly one of cinemas all-time character roller-coaster rides. Is he? Isn't he. He did? He didn't! I really felt for this guy, and that he is Lily's soul-mate is beyond touching. It would have been nice to have had sentimental wraps for more characters like Hagrid, Buckbeak, even Draco, but HP7II is not about being sappy. I felt completely engaged, fulfilled, and even a bit exhausted after this excellent film. This experience has deep lessons to offer, and I'm on my way to check it out again now. Undoubtedly I will see this movie more in it's first-run theater showing, than any other film. Lifetime achievement Oscars for the whole lot, I say! Mischief Managed!",10,1,3,17 July 2011
