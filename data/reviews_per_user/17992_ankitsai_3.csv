Ford v Ferrari," One of the best movies of the decade
","Amazing performance by the lead actors - Matt Damon and Christian Bale, their chemistry is palpable. Christian Bale delivers another moving performance in this movie. The workings of a big ugly corporation like Ford was captured very well in this movie. I loved the small details such as Enzo Ferrari tipping his hat to Ken Miles while Ford and everyone else is congratulating the winner. Shows that Mr. Ferrari is the true lover of the sport and a thorough gentleman.",10,4,6,6 December 2019
Parasite," This is what passes for art these days...overrated, too slow
","It surprises me how critics have a taste for movies that may be artistic but are just awful or average experiences at best to watch. If you're a film critic you might like this movie for the reasons that all the other film critics do.If you're an average moviegoer who wants a movie with characters to relate to and a story to inspire and remember you would be disappointed.The first half of the movie is way too long in setting up the premise, you don't realize what the movie turns out to be until the second half making me feel like the first half consisted of too many irrelevant details and was way too long. By the time the movie picks up pace you're already tired. I found myself skipping every thirty seconds towards the end.Secondly, a great movie should leave you with a positive feeling, either a feeling of hope or inspiration or if neither of those are possible atleast the satisfaction of having had a good laugh. This movie does none of that, it leaves you with a feeling of despair and hopelessness. Sadly that is what passes for art these days.There were some good parts about the movie, such as the acting was top-notch especially from the sister. Cinematography was good too but the movie was just not deserving enough to be the best picture of the year.If it wasn't so highly rated I would've given it a 6/10 but giving it a 4 to bring the rating down to what it should get.",4,4,10,7 March 2020
Sully," One of the best movies I've ever seen
",The movie does justice to portraying the real life incident and all the emotions and decisions involved in the process. The storytelling is amazing and keeps you hooked and makes you feel what it might have been in their shoes.Capt. Sully is a hero and so is the entire rescue team.Do not miss it.,10,1,1,21 January 2019
