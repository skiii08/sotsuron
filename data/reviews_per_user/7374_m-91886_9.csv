Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferrari
","Ferrari stands in the stands and pays homage to Miles, who is a little silent on the track. That quiet moment is the most important moment of the movie full of motor roar: the winner in the title actually loses, but the loser really wins. Miles, Shelby and Ferrari are pure to the extreme, trying to preserve the last trace of self loyalty in this copper smelling world.",9,2,3,10 April 2020
Knives Out," Knives Out
","Hidden in the image of paying homage to the traditional British reasoning novels and movies, it is actually a wanton rebellion against this classic type. Such absurd settings and nearly naked political implications as a number of unreliable narrators plus an absolutely reliable narrator are rarely seen in hard core reasoning works.",9,5,9,14 April 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man: Homecoming
","After watching, I feel that civilians are so embarrassed even if they become superheroes. They are all carried by their bodies, and even their equipment is earned by their performance. It's true that the devil is hard to deal with. At least he has done his best. He was still sent by the iron man's exclusive liaison personnel. If the last battle had not been a hero's aura, he would have died directly.",7,0,0,7 June 2020
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange
","It's a very logical superhero movie! It's hard for all good and bad people to keep their heads. In particular, we praise the special effect of space change in the process of fighting in the mirror world, which is as dazzling as the kaleidoscope, and has the rigorous beauty of Monument Valley. Sisyphus's self deception is shameless but useful, thanks to the fact that the big villains are not bad enough to keep their promises.",8,0,0,21 June 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame
",It's the end of the story and the superhero. The old story is over and the new one is about to start. Let's take a few more steps on the path of memory. Old friends meet again. People who want to be superheroes become real superheroes. Lost time is also picked up in another parallel universe. There is no better ending.,8,1,8,22 April 2020
Django Unchained," Django Unchained
","This film tells us a lot of practical reasons, such as remembering to shake hands politely with people, to say goodbye to humanity without saying goodbye, to know a foreign language better than German, to get out of the gun quickly, to carry a few bounty notices in your pocket whenever you want, and never believe the words of strangers no matter the color of their skin, the story will not be so neurotic if it is removed.",8,0,0,16 May 2020
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight
","Even if this is the type of movie I hate most, I must praise the skillful and high degree of completion of a director's technique. This is no longer a normal superhero movie.",9,0,0,12 May 2020
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds
","The second half is too hasty and abrupt, many clues are not unfolded, and the ending is too fast. The first half is still the number of commercial entertainment films, and later I want to run on the line of family affection literature and art, but the result is not ideal. However, I like realism very much. There are many deep meanings hidden in the settings. Unfortunately, it almost became a super classic.",9,0,1,30 May 2020
Inception," Inception
","This story has a fatal attraction to me. It's so amazing. Although I feel a little impatient can do better, and should be able to go to the depth of characters and stories.",8,0,1,22 April 2020
