Captain Phillips," Incredible Story! Incredible Film!
","Captain Phillips is based on the true story of how Captain Richard Phillips got abducted by Somali pirates. From the beginning, the suspense sets us in the mood of the story. And with talent like director Paul Greengrass, the suspense is pulse-pounding. I'm not much of a fan of shaky cam, but like with the two Bourne films Greengrass directed, the technique is used to make it more suspenseful instead of dumbing it down and giving you a headache like The Hunger Games. The one who should be congratulated the most for this incredible film achievement should go to Tom Hanks, who gives an astounding performance as the title character. The last 15 minutes of the film is where he really nails it, especially in the very end. Barkhad Abdi also gives an incredible performance as the Somali pirate leader. Being based on a true story, Captain Phillips does what a biopic should go; give the facts and not sugarcoat it. What an incredible modern film achievement!",10,0,1,2 February 2014
The Hunger Games," Very Disappointing!
","I was a huge fan of the book about a group of kids who are forced to kill each other in a death match, but after watching the movie, I was immensely disappointed with the final result. Jennifer Lawrence was extremely excellent as Katniss, and there were some other good, solid acting throughout the picture, but the issue I had with this movie was that it lacked suspense, especially scenes in the arena. Instead of making the moments of slaughter shocking and suspenseful, the use of the shaky cam only dumbs it down to the point where you have no clue what's going on, even if I had already read the book. While I was disappointed by this movie, I am more optimistic about the sequels as there's different direction and there's no shaky cam.",5,3,5,7 February 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Overrated Classic!
","Paul Newman and Robert Redford star as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two notorious outlaws who strive to maintain power during times of social change, in a film that was extremely successful upon first release in 1969. As the film first opened, I was expected a western masterpiece, as the tensions were strong, the action was exciting, and there was some fun humor throughout, especially in the sequence where Butch and Sundance have to jump off a cliff. But when the characters go to Bolivia, the film starts to go downhill pretty fast. The pacing starts to drag heavily, the tension is poor, the score gets to be painfully annoying, the action sequences become tiresome and repetitive, and the worst part, the final act is weak and extremely disappointing, making me wonder why a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is regarded as a classic in the first place. I do give it credit, however, for its great performances from Paul Newman and Robert Redford, its wondrous Oscar winning cinematography, and that awesome song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head', but other than that, this film is a misfire, in my book.",5,4,7,28 February 2014
Gandhi," This Is True Epic Filmmaking!
","Obviously we all know who Gandhi is. He was a powerful Indian leader who used peaceful tactics to free India from The British Empire. To this day, Gandhi is viewed as one of the greatest political leaders in the 20th Century. As a movie, Gandhi succeeds bog time. Director Richard Attenborough had a 20 year dream of making a movie about Gandhi, and he creates a powerful epic unlike any other, about as strong as the epics of David Lean. The cinematography is beautifully sweeping, there's tons of extras throughout that would likely be CGI today, and the best part, Ben Kingsley's performance as the title character. When we witness his reactions to tragic events, Kingsley makes it so authentic that we believe that the real Gandhi has returned from the dead. There were some parts, such as the reaction that I mentioned involving the slaughter of innocent civilians, that actually made me weep during these emotionally powerful moments. And that's what I want to see in an epic movie. Something that's exceptionally realistic and emotionally powerful. And that's what Gandhi succeeds as a film.",10,1,1,22 February 2014
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Excellent Studio Ghibli Film
","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is about a Princess from The Valley of the Wind who has to risk her life to save her people before it is consumed by The Toxic Jungle. Hayao Mayazaki is truly a animation genius. No wonder why he has been described as the 'Japanese Walt Disney!' Like Walt, Mayazaki has a broad sense of imagination and his animation is simply phenomenal. Shots of Nausicaa flying on her glider are some of the most stunning animation I've witnessed that's made by anyone that's not Disney! The ending featuring a wonderful decision made by Nausicaa was simply moving. Some of the more emotional moments were a little weak, especially when the Nausicaa character is voiced by Allison Lohman, who was good in the role 95% of the time, but as a whole, Nausicaa is a wonderful film from the legendary Studio Ghibli, with an excellent voice cast, which also includes Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman, and Edward James Olmos, a powerful and thought-provoking story that's highly original, and full of grand imagination. I'm impressed!",9,1,2,31 January 2014
Rocky," Yo Adrian! It's Me Rocky!
","A cinematic icon was created in 1976 when Sylvester Stallone took on the role of the underdog boxer Rocky Balboa, who fights to become champion in an upcoming match against master boxer Apollo Creed. From the opening shots of the grittiness of where Rocky is living, Rocky is a sports drama that will never be forgotten. Everything about Rocky seems real; the characters, the locations, the drama, the boxing match, everything in Rocky seemed extremely realistic. Sylvester Stallone gives a very convincing and incredible performance as Rocky, very real and very believable. No wonder why Roger Ebert declared Stallone as 'the next Marlon Brando' back in the day. While Stallone is definitely no Brando in today's time, Rocky makes Marlon Brando feel like a chicken. This film is awesome, one of the best films of the 1970's. I would love to run down the streets of Philadelphia to the tune of 'Gonna Fly Now' any day of the week!",10,0,0,7 February 2014
Psycho," Hitchcock's Ultimate Masterpiece!
","In the most legendary (and most imitated) film from 'The Master of Suspense', Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, a chilling, disturbing, and crazy psychopath who causes terror to those who arrive at The Bates Motel. Originally released in 1960, Psycho's violence and implied sexual moments were the center of controversy, especially the now famous shower scene and the opening hotel love scene. While its definitely tame in today's standards, Psycho still manages to be filled with the ultimate suspense and thrills. Anthony Perkins shines as the notorious Norman Bates, and has a ton of maturity while doing it. With the excellent Perkins performance, a stirring and intense Bernard Herrmann score, and telling a horrific story that relies on suspense over gore, Psycho is the ultimate horror flick, and is the definitive film of the great Alfred Hitchcock.",10,0,1,2 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","Star Wars was that film that truly changed the world of Hollywood forever. Without it, I have no clue what movies Hollywood would be making today. George Lucas is a true visionary. Not only does it provide that excellent use of action and drama, but it features some of the most memorable characters to ever grace the big screen, excellent casting decisions, especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo, plus John Williams' score is incredibly awesome. Plus the visuals by Industrial Light and Magic, which was their first film, still hold up remarkably well for its time. With all these excellent things, Star Wars is the blockbuster in the most perfect form.",10,3,7,30 January 2014
