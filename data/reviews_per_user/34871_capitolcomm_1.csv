Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," IQ sapping
","To be fair, this flick may be a quality masturbation-aid for American Leftists and US-Obsessed/Hating Euro-Trash, but on the whole I was just waiting for the damn thing to end.To all the twenty-something-college-student-promoters of this terd out there. I'm no prude...I like my substances and gender-ambiguous sexual encounters as much as the next purple haired anarchist, but come on! Raise the bar...if only a little.And to suggest that this thing isn't PC. Lets attack Christians, Southerners and Country-Dwellers (of any country) that we consider beneath us.Its always open season on them. Hardly a brave attack.Get over your stereotypes of other human beings folks. Believing in them is a genuine sign of a limited intellect.",1,7,14,19 March 2007
