Mission: Impossible III," I sad to say that it was Painful!
","This is the last nail in the coffin for MI series! I am really to sad that it was a very very boring movie. If I can have money time and money back I would ask for them in a minute.Nothing! Nothing! Nothing good about it. Don't be fooled by other reviews... they are based on admiration than actual acting, script, animation...etc.Ahhhhhhhh what a waste of time....Even the script takes you no where and Tom's acting is actually closer to acting than good acting.THis is badThis is badthis is bad",1,0,2,28 May 2006
