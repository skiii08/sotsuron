The Avengers," Amazing!
","Flashback to 2008. I was clapping my hands along with many others in a packed theater as the end credits of Iron Man rolled on the screen. But as the credits finished, a hush fell over the crowd. A new scene played out, in which we were introduced to Nick Fury. A collective gasp was let out by those of us in the know when he said the word 'Avengers'.Four years and four films later, that little tease has become the biggest and best superhero movie of all time.One of the best things about the Avengers is that there's no need for an origin. Thanks to the other films, we already know these characters and have seen them in action. This allows the filmmakers to get the ball rolling quickly. And boy, does it ever roll. It hits the ground running and doesn't stop until the end. But that doesn't mean it's just a mindless action movie. The character development here is great and the chemistry is amazing. You feel their frustration when the group falls apart and share in their triumph when they 'assemble'.Simply put, it's the most entertainment I've gotten out of a film in a very long time. Seeing those characters together on the big screen spoke directly to the 10 year old in me. I can't recommend it enough. Even if you've never read a comic book in your life, you will enjoy this movie.",10,1,4,5 May 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not quite X2, but still worth watching
","After three hugely successful films, Marvel's X-Men franchise returns with a prequel of sorts for arguably the series' most popular character: Wolverine.Hugh Jackman once again dons the claws and sideburns to become Logan, a mutant with the ability to heal from any wound. It's this power that brings him and his brother Victor (also a mutant, but with more cat-like features and agility) to the attention of US government agent William Stryker, who is putting together a special forces team of people with abilities to carry out dangerous missions. After spending years with this group, Logan decides he's had enough and leaves to start a normal life. But that is soon interrupted when Stryker reappears to warn him of a new danger. Motivated by revenge, Logan volunteers to take part in the Weapon X program, where his bones are surgically enhanced with an indestructible metal. But once the truth about the program is revealed, Logan finds himself pitted against some of his former colleagues, including his own brother.X-Men Origins: Wolverine combines tons of action with good doses of drama and lite humor to make one of the more enjoyable X-Men films to date. Hugh Jackman turns in another great performance as the title character and Liev Schreiber's turn as Victor AKA Sabretooth is fantastic. He and Jackman have great chemistry and the scenes in which they appear on screen together are the highlights of the movie. The main flaw of the film is the use of supporting characters, especially Gambit. He just feels out of place in the story, as if the filmmakers included him merely to please the comic book fan-boy crowd. Plus the actor portraying Gambit, Taylor Kitsch, doesn't even bother speaking in the Cajun accent his character is famous for.All in all, despite some character issues, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is an entertaining entry to the growing franchise and a step up from 2006's messy X-Men: The Last Stand.",8,14,30,30 April 2009
