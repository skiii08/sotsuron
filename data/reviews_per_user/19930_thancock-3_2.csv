Requiem for a Dream," Minimalist technique a poor match for subject matter
","Spoilers== 'Requiem for a Dream' is a minimalist look at the degradation caused by drug addiction, in this case heroin and amphetamines. The technique and subject, however, match poorly. This causes the film to fail to genuinely affect the viewer.Technically the director is very clever. For example, for most of the film, the heroin shooting is shown only as a collection of objects, all shown in the same order: powder, spoon, flame, needle, dilated pupil. Or a popped pill.In keeping with the minimalist approach, the three young main characters are one-dimensional. The older character, who is the mother of one of the two young men in the film, is fleshed out more, but still doesn't rise to a level where we can identify her as a distinct person. (Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for this role in the film.) Like a piece of minimalist music, the film beats on the same instrument throughout, with slight changes in intensity as the only variant. The soundtrack was provided, appropriately, by the Kronos Quartet, which adds to the relentless, droning atmosphere of the film.But we are dealing here with drug addiction, an enormously complicated and personal thing that doesn't submit to the minimalist technique. No internal or external causes are provided for why the young characters picked up the needle in the first place. Fate isn't that interesting.The three young characters begin the film as happy heroin shooters, but when their supply is cut off, they become very unhappy heroin shooters. That's essentially the plot for them. The mother character is also broken at the beginning. She is a widow whose son is always off pawning her TV to score drugs. Her only solace comes from watching the recording of an inane TV infomercial that promises salvation through weight loss. She becomes obsessed with recovering her youth. On the advice of a friend, she visits The Most Negligent Doctor in Brighton Beach (the American Brighton), who prescribes buckets of diet pills.The film then shows the decline of all four characters into their various forms of degradation. Mom ends up committed to a mental institution. We are shown three of her electro-shock therapy treatments. The son and his partner in scoring heroin end up getting caught in a Southern state on a trip to Florida to score. The son is seen shooting heroin into a necrotic vein; the arm eventually has to be amputated above the elbow. His partner we see writhing in withdrawal symptoms on a prison bed, there being no treatment for him in the unenlightened correctional facility where he is held. The son's former girlfriend becomes a sex worker at private parties to support her habit.Which is all very gruesome of course, and earned the film notoriety for its harrowing last 20 minutes. Still, it seems mechanical and pointlessly cruel. The ends each of these characters finds is of course realistic; the fact that all of them meet such horrific ends is less so. So the artificiality of the movie eventually works against it. The lack of any knowledge of the characters' motivations is unsatisfying. There is only horror instead of compassion.There were no dreams, and a requiem is an entirely different kind of music.A much better film in the genre of heroin-will-ruin-you-seriously, is 'Trainspotting'. Better music, real people, and even humor.",6,0,2,12 May 2015
Dark City," Begins well but degenerates rapidly
","===Spoilers==Since this is a genre movie, I would give it a 7 rating for people who like science fiction.This movie was pretty high on a list of all-time favorite science fiction movies, so I checked it out.Like most modern movies, it looks great, and looking great gets people onto social media quickly to call it their favorite movie, until the next one. Every quick shot, and they are all as quick as a pop music video, is just so, down to the strand of hair that falls prettily across Jennifer Connelly's face.Today's movies' 'great SFX,' however, are simply the effects used in a bank advertisement on TV in 6 months.Also like many ambitious modern movies for a general audience, the writers couldn't figure out what they wanted to accomplish. They started with some interesting ideas and then couldn't find a way to resolve them satisfactorily. Story threads were spun out, never to be integrated into a fabric that was satisfying. Characters more interesting than the leads made appearances and were then dropped. (The psychopathic detective being the main one. Why did he even exist?) The film's world, for some reason, is noir-ish. (Cough, cough, Blade Runner). It's just a style, though, and an obvious one for a world that is always night. Otherwise it's not organic to the film. Here's one place the writers could have challenged themselves. Since the world is being run by aliens trying to figure out humans, in order to save themselves, why not make the setting 'inappropriate,' the opposite of noir? I'm thinking the set of 'Happy Days,' but in sepia. How much weirder would that have been? But of course the requisite sci-fi tropes must be obeyed, unless you want to do something new and more interesting.The first appearance of the aliens almost brought me to laugh, but that's a personal thing. I was reminded of the aliens in the first Star Trek original series episode. The aliens are almost all interchangeable, except for a really powerful one, a somewhat considerate one, and a young one. All the scenes with them are wooden and terrible.The moral of the story is practically in quotes, with big flashing arrows, toward the end of the film. The lead character tells the last alien that the soul isn't located in the brain's memories, but in the heart. And then he clicked his ruby slippers and sailed off back to Kansas.Our hero bests the powerful alien--the 'boss' at the end of the highest level of your video game--then uses the spaceship city's structure to create the environment where he can re-meet the luminous but vacant Ms Connelly.The movie had something of a classic Twilight Zone vibe to it, and the mystery of the Beach is interesting at first. It's interest comes crashing down when it's revealed to be a poster on a brick wall. This wall serves as the fuselage for the city/spaceship. When it's broken down, however, there is no catastrophic decompression. The detective just lazily drifts out into space, while the rest of the cast stands around. This leads, obviously, to the idea that we haven't reached 'reality' yet in this universe. The writers though, apparently didn't see this or . . . . what? So Twilight Zone-ish, but Rod Serling could have done it better in half an hour on a shoestring budget.",4,3,8,11 May 2015
