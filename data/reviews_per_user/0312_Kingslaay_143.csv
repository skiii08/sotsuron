Ford v Ferrari," Exciting film
","Ford vs Ferrari is a truly exciting film, one that delivers an experience. While it contains plenty of technical car or racing jargon it is enough to follow to be taken along for the ride. Suspense is built up nicely and we got to experience a rush at key moments. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are great and literally take this film all the way to the finish line. You don't need to be a car enthusiast to appreciate this decent film. One can honestly appreciate the history, classic rivalry and heart that goes into something. A great experience and well made film. 8/10",Null,2,3,23 February 2020
The King's Speech," First Class Film
","The King's Speech was an exceptional film. A film so beautifully made that it never lost track of what the film was about. Viewers are treated to a true story of perseverance, courage and humanity. This story is delivered with grace as a result of stellar performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush arguably deliver one of their finest if not finest performances of their career. The film was based on the integrity and strength of their performances and the result was a close to perfect film. A film very worthy of the Oscars it received, however Geoffrey Rush should have received a best supporting actor award for his performance and character brought out the best in Colin Firth. This beautiful film is uplifting and a great film experience. From start to finish it captivates and entertains. It was the best film of the year, despite Inception being a close runner in that category. It is highly recommended.",Null,0,0,10 May 2017
The Benchwarmers," Funny and enjoyable
",The Benchwarmers is definitely worth a watch if you are interested in some light heated fun. An unlikely trio led by Rob Schneider put a baseball team together and challenge the local bullies. David Spade does a great comedic role as one of the incompetent team mates. The humor effortlessly flows and the film doesn't try too hard to be funny. The look and situations of the characters are a riot. The scene where Spade and Schneider were hitting mailboxes with a bat at the back of a car was easily one of the funniest scenes in the film. Physical and silly comedy when done well is a treat to watch.Despite its humor it also touched on the serious topic of bullying and how its sadly prevalent. It was nice to see the bullies put in their place in the end. It's an enjoyable experience where you don't have to think too much when watching it and enjoy a good laugh.,Null,1,1,28 April 2017
First Man," Not a leap in film making
","I had high hopes for First Man. Sadly this was passable and forgettable.With films about great historic figures or events you need to show interesting or unique events and create 'moments'. By moments I mean elevated scenes, great build ups with a good soundtrack so you create an experience. What we got instead was rather boring and lackluster. It did not feel like a blockbuster film but a miniseries broken into 4 or so parts.The acting and lead could have been better. Gosling is a box office draw but he did not have the chops to pull off this role. He is an average actor with no noteworthy roles under his belt, this film can be added to the list. Somebody in the category of Tom Hanks or Christian Bale could have been suitable. Despite some good performances from Claire Foy and the other cast this film does not hit the mark. Neil Armstrong was a hero and the moon landing was iconic for humanity. A film should have lived up to a high standard and paid good homage.",Null,3,5,4 November 2018
Changeling," Great film
","Changeling was a captivating and well made film. Angelina Jolie playing a desperate and frustrated mother gives a stellar performance as she looks for her missing son. The film also cast light on the dark past when the police and authorities could often be negligent in their duties and try to cover up their mistakes. This thriller keeps you engaged from start to finish as the audience and Christine Collins (Jolie) search for the truth. Based on real life events viewers can relate to the plight as a woman searches for her son and justice. The supporting cast deliver great performances, Angelina Jolie should have been awarded the best actress Oscar for her great performance. This film is definitely recommended for those who enjoy a well made thriller that is actually based on historic events.",Null,2,3,30 May 2017
Requiem for a Dream," An absolute mess, extremely overrated
","It bewilders me why this film has received acclaim and is included in the list as one of the best movies ever made in IMDb. In reality it is one of the WORST movies ever made. There have been some great and artistic movies made that illustrate some sad and harsh realities of the world, this movie is definitely not one of them. One of the main messages is the illusions and hallucinations people experience due to drugs. The only one developed sufficiently enough is Ellen Burstyn who imagines she is on a game show and her acting is very good. The other dreams are shambles, this uninspired film follows the lives of 3 junkies trying to make a score. It really conveys nothing and is extremely dull, your trip to the supermarket was probably more meaningful and eventful. The hallucinations for Jared Leto are barely developed to ascertain the concept of a dream or illusion nor is the illusion of Marlon Wayans. This movie is an absolute and utter waste of time, it is beyond comprehension how such a piece of worthlessness has this rating. If anything, it proves you cannot always trust critics. The shallow plot and mundane story goes nowhere, it is empty and pointless. I have given it a 1 because it is absolutely awful, shame it couldn't be a big fat 0.",Null,3,6,20 August 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," A great combination of mystery and suspense
","10 Cloverfield Lane is extremely engrossing and entertaining to watch. From the start it gives you a shock and shows you a version of reality that is dark and disturbing but you have no choice but to see it and even believe it. Within the confines of a small house three actors give great and believable performances. The film is great in taking you through a series of phases from panic, to calm, to normal until all hell breaks loose. John Goodman is fantastic as the so called protector and preacher of the evil that exists outside. As the film goes on the mystery and questions increase and you question what is and isn't real. The ending might make a number of viewers laugh in disbelief. This film is one of the best apocalyptic films I have seen to date and it is recommended.",Null,0,0,13 May 2017
War Dogs," Fantastic!
","When I went to this movie I had little expectations, I was expecting some average or sub par movie with a plot holes, silly laughs and the odd nudity. It was certainly marketed to be like this to some extent. But what I got was a very well executed and entertaining film, its safe to say it far exceeded expectations.War dogs is a great story about two friends who partner up and become international arms dealers landing a huge Afghan contract to supply arms to American allies. The film contains the right amount of drama as well as some good doses of humor thrown in such as Jonah Hill's eccentric laugh throughout the film. The humor works very well but at the same time it is an entertaining drama with some very good scenes such as the one where the two protagonists escape gunfire in Iraq when they were delivering weapons. The film has elements of a Greek tragedy similar to what we have seen with Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street that depicts the rise, glory and eventual downfall of the characters with the FBI eventually showing up at your door. The soundtrack was also very good and the performances were great. Teller and Hill may not deserve an Oscar but they deserve a nomination. Their characters were developed nicely and you could feel the tension throughout the movie. I would say this movie would definitely satisfy the viewer and leave you pleasantly surprised. A strong 8/10",Null,2,6,19 August 2016
Source Code," Another great time travel thriller
",I love films about time travel or films to that effect. It often brings about a creative way to explain a concept and the execution is quite entertaining to watch. Source code is a great example of this. We start off with limited information about how a person can travel in time. As the film unfolds we get more of a sense of what's going on. The person is not essentially alive but his consciousness lives on while a small remainder also exists of his body. The scientist's task him with going back to the last 8 minutes of train explosion to find the bomb and the bomber. As the film goes on we see him know every 8 minutes and come close. What is interesting is what the scientist tells him and what he experiences are two different things. The beauty of the film in the end shows him emerge with a new life and identity having survived the train incident. Since time travel is novel the directors nicely show that even the scientists didn't know the potential of their own inventions. Superb acting from Jake Gyllenhaal who steals the show in this one. Highly recommended if you enjoy time travel movies and science fiction.,Null,1,2,1 May 2017
Skyfall," Skyfall pays excellent homage to the iconic Bond series
","After 50 years of having the great 007 portrayed in film Skyfall was released as the 23rd edition to mark this grand occasion. Ever since Sean Connery played the great 007 in Dr No (1962) the series has some great and some okay films. Skyfall not only rebooted the series after a small break but will go down as one of the best James Bond films ever made. Daniel Craig cements himself as a great 007 in this film. From start to finish Skyfall captivates and entertains. The unique start shows Bond being shot and injured. The story that follows is close to home for Bond as he goes to where he grew up, M also is at the centre of this story as the Bond villain looks to settle a score with her. Javier Bardem is an excellent villain and enhances the film. He will certainly be remembered as one of the better Bond villains with his elaborate plot to face M. Continuing as a film of firsts the Bond girl is killed quite early and we know Bond won't be sailing off into the sunset with her. All the classic Bond elements were incorporated such as the iconic Aston Martin and some memorable scenes with Bond and M. Q is played by a new actor who surprisingly holds his own in this film. The end was beautifully directed and the Bond villains death and Ms death was dramatic and beautifully portrayed. This great film also included an award winning theme song by Adele. Its fair to say Skyfall had all the right elements and drama to be celebrated as one of the best Bond films. I cannot think of a better film and way to pay homage and tribute to such an incredible and beloved film series.",Null,2,5,22 June 2017
Ghost," One for the ages
","Ghost is definitely one for the ages. From plot to acting to soundtrack, this film certainly pulls it off. Patrick Swayze does a great job as a ghost who not only seeks justice for his own murder but looks out for his true love and protects her from danger. The supernatural element of his character makes for an interesting and sometimes humorous film. His interactions with Whoopi Goldberg, the only person who can see him, are magical and hilarious. One might say he shares the most chemistry with her throughout the film. Throughout the film viewers are treated to an interesting conspiracy, the supernatural and good performances. Ghost also includes the immortal Unchained melody song in what is now a memorable film scene where Demi and Patrick bond in the pottery scene. It is a simple and well told story that does not seek to over complicate Swayze's supernatural presence and viewers can go along with his journey because his story is far from over. Even as a ghost he manages to save his true love from danger and rectify the wrong that was done to him.",Null,5,8,5 March 2017
It," Decent and enjoyable
","It was not a bad film and not as scary as expected but with horror films its the anticipation that is nerve wrecking and It had plenty of that. The comedy worked surprisingly well given its morbid nature. It also peaked everyone's interest. If you can get over the obvious flaws such as kids being able to be kidnapped and killed by a clown every 27 years without being found out its a decent film. The kids of this film did a great job and showcased their fear quite well. This is not one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's novels as some of those films (The Shining, Misery etc) were outstanding. Overall decent film.7.5/10",Null,3,5,23 September 2017
Rocketman," Decent
","Another ambitious movie about one of the most talented and colorful people of our time. This is a sad and complex look at the life of Elton, how he struggled to love and be himself. The music is on point and never have I enjoyed so much music every 10 or so minutes, after all whose music is it. The acting is top notch, Taron Egerton shows he's got acting chops and he's supported very well by Jamie Bell. Also love the inclusion of so many great hits from Elton that we all love.We see Elton's tumultuous life come full circle when he emerges out of his meeting and embraces who he is. Some good additions could have been a Freddie cameo with Rami Malek reprising his role. This would have been a beautiful crossover. Or even George Michael and some Lion King. While was a well told and sad tale it could also have celebrated the music of such an icon. This may not be as good as Bohemian Rhapsody but it comes close.

A Star Is Born," Not even nearly as good as it's made out to be
","A Star is Born was a mediocre film. The only redeemable quality is the decent acting by Bradley Cooper and Lady Ga Ga.The script is poorly written and executed. Jack's backstory is barely touched upon. We see a spiralling drunk but the reason he got that way is not fully explained. The lack of development, dull scenes and overuse of unexplained emotion made a weak and depressing film. Even the end was underwhelming as she just performs to an audience and the film suddenly finishes.In this story is a great film, possibly a masterpiece. If rewritten, change of directors and pace it could have been great. But the outcome is an unimpressive film. I stand by the principle that one must judge on a film's merit rather than be one of the many sheep screaming praise.",Null,1,7,16 November 2018
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Quite a bit is lost on me
","British comedy is one of the best in the world, if not the best. The Monty Python team also have some of the best comedians such as the likes of John Cleese. But watching this 40 years after its release a lot was lost on me. I struggled to find many parts funny and to be honest found it exhausting. It would have been funnier if Brian really did ape the life of Jesus in a humorous way, similar to how they started with the 3 wise men and wrong stable. Yet we had a somewhat inconsequential tale of Brian. Despite the high praise and status the humour isn't always there for me or I must have missed something. 6/10",Null,0,2,9 February 2020
The Death of Stalin," Has its moments
","The Death of Stalin starts with a bang. It is hilarious, witty and contains some decent acting. However it lost its momentum in the middle and without a really serious plot this film falls apart. The humor and comedy needs to be sustained throughout the film, it's as if it changed genres and turned into a boring mockumentary. 6.8/10",Null,0,2,17 March 2018

The Big Lebowski," Absolute rubbish, very overrated
","Saying this film is overrated is an understatement. Why are some ludicrous films rated so highly? One might wonder if most of the viewership is amateur film goers or just stoned. Films like Forest Gump, The Wolf of Wall Street, Schindler's list or even art house ones like Birdman are great films. But The Big Lebowski is a Big Disappointment. It is a disjointed and abhorrent mess, sorry I'm using the word abhorrent here which might too big a word for most of the big raters of this film. I'll use simpler language for those who loved it, it stinks. This film made no sense and has to be one of the biggest disappointments of cinema. What an odd bunch of people it would take to make such a mess. It takes an even bigger odd bunch of people to love this film, write rave reviews and praise it. People obviously get a kick out of explaining something that isn't there. A spade isn't a spade to them.",Null,5,10,24 April 2017
Fight Club," Ahead of its time
","I cannot believe it has taken me so long to watch this film. I assumed the title would indicate what it was about. When I watched it seemed that was the case, part of me was thinking this is just trash getting into mindless fights. Skip. Don't see what the hype is about. Then towards the end, it hits you and things come full circle. It is a brilliant film and mind blowing. After years of seeing thrillers and similar concepts in films this still delivered a curve ball. Great performances and this film was well paced. I can only imagine how ground breaking this must have been when it came out 20 years ago. Even the ending sequence was done so beautifully and simply it just couldn't have been directed better, a moment was created.8/10",Null,0,0,19 January 2019
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman Shines in this film
","The darkest hour showcased some great performances. The best was Gary Oldman himself who portrayed the memorable Winston Churchill. Oldman is not simply acting as Churchill but he is Churchill. The film was slow at certain times, especially the middle but the acting carries this film to make it a good experience. It manages to make the politics and backroom struggles engaging and exciting without any war battles.",Null,1,4,26 December 2017
Captain Marvel," Passable but not the strongest Marvel film
","Captain Marvel is not the strongest edition in the Marvel franchise. It was a safe and passable film but it didn't hit it out of the park like previous films. Brie Larson is good but the pacing, story and direction could have been better. Marvel films tend to include some killer soundtracks but not much happened here. This was a trip back to the 90s and not much music accompanied many scenes, missed opportunity. The film also could have done with more humour to lighten the mood. The beginning of the film failed to stimulate too much interest in the story and we could have had some better fight or action scenes.Marvel may be dominating the comic or superhero movies but as it stands DC has had the better female superhero film with Wonder Woman. I will be keen to see how things play out in Endgame. 77/10",Null,0,4,31 March 2019
Passengers," Creative, unique and captivating
","Passengers is a very entertaining film that should captivate its viewer from start to finish. Its novel approach, direction and acting makes it a memorable movie that could still be enjoyed in years in to come.Passengers is a well made futuristic film that takes place entirely in space. 5000 people are on a very long journey journey to another planet in a sophisticated spaceship. A malfunction results in Chris Pratt's character being awoken with 90 years left, his pod is the only one. After a year he cannot bear the loneliness and decides to wake up and stop the hibernation of the most beautiful girl he's seen and read about. I have never been a fan of romantic stories in film as often they are unrealistic, ridiculous and plain unnecessary. Rarely do they make a well paced and believable romance that adds value to the film as a whole. Passengers is one of these exceptions. Not only is it well paced, it is believable and realistic these two would start a romance. Things become very complicated when Jennifer Lawrence's character finds out that he purposely woke her up and they're the only two awake aboard.Passengers is more than a love story. It's unique nature and challenges are bound to keep viewers on their toes. This film delivers some great moments. As the ship gradually declines it becomes a great fight for survival in a complicated ship in the middle of space. We see chilling scenes when almost all is lost for all passengers. The two passengers put their lives at risk and sacrifice themselves to fix the space ship. Passengers exceeds expectations and is in many ways ahead of its time. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence give stellar performances in this space film. Sadly it was overlooked by critics and the Award ceremonies. Its quality has been downplayed even on this site which is a shame. It has similarities to the futuristic film, Gattaca, which was also unique, ahead of its time and overlooked. I feel in years viewers might discover this gem and give it the praise it deserves. It is definitely recommended.",Null,0,0,4 May 2017
12 Angry Men," Wow great film
","12 Angry Men is a terrific film. It captures your attention from start to finish. All it took was one thoughtful man to challenge the group. It is also an illustration of human nature. People bring their own experiences and feelings to a case affecing someone else. The way the men deliberate and challenge each other is what should happen in any jury, truly look at the facts and arrive and the best decision possible. The beauty of this film is we didn't need to see the murder or even scene to visualise the murder. It's brought to life in a small room. What is great is there is no big or fancy setting, just a simple jury room. This is where great performances shine true. A powerful cast and passionate performances. This is a true example of great acting.",Null,0,1,21 November 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Decent

Knives Out," Great and Entertaining
",Knives Out is entertaining and quite a win. It has a stellar cast and uses them well. The story and mystery has echoes of Agatha Christie in this decent whodunit. What you think is straightforward has a few interesting twists. It also doesn't take itself too seriously and has the odd dose of humour. It was also easy to understand and follow the series of events. Not unnecessarily complicated. The film did feel a tad bit long.

The Irishman," Vintage Scorsese: Another classic
","Ever since I heard of this film and cast I awaited with eager anticipation. The director who made the iconic Goodfellas and Casino was back again with his usual crew. The Irishman does not lose a step, its pace is quick and information is hurled at you. You are taken on a big journey and experience a great deal of infamous mob history. This is a fantastic film from start to finish and this stellar cast hits it out of the park.Al Pacino steals the show and every scene he is in. We get an intimate look at the lives of Hoffa, Frank and a number of key figures over time. The beauty of this film is the depth and connections of all these figures. The Irishman brings history and organised crime to life. I will be watching this film another time to experience and pick up even more.We should count our lucky stars that we got to see Scorsese team up with the likes of De Niro, Pacino and Jo Pesci for what will become a classic. 8.5/10",Null,3,7,22 December 2019
Billy Elliot," Dreadful
","I was forced to watch Billy Elliot when I was younger in high school as part of film study. I disliked it then but as time goes on and you grow up I thought I would find some appreciation for it. It didn't happen, in fact, I see further frustrations in this mediocre and terrible film. While it may be grounded in realism, the story and setting of rural England does not make good story telling or directing. It is a painful experience to watch a boring child who hails from an even more boring family and town try and be a ballet dancer. The story was so bland and dull and none of the acting performances really stand out. The funny thing is this film could have been made beautifully. Directors have done wonders with less interesting stories through good directing, symbolism, storytelling and soundtrack. This was a horrible and terrible mess. An absolute travesty that must be avoided.",Null,3,12,30 May 2017
The Fifth Element," 7.7? Maybe I missed something...
","This is a very silly and unusual film, actually saying it is unusual is an understatement. In its own bizarre way it showed something that resembled a plot and its saving the world, how original right? I won't criticize the special effects because it was the 90s and CGI of today is nowhere near the CGI in this film. So its fair to say its not aged too well in that department. This film was a bizarre and jumbled mess. It was quirky and silly and an absolute waste of 2 hours. The acting is still good because of Bruce Willis and Mila, Bruce Willis? What was he thinking? The future looked unrealistic and unattractive. We also had a very odd performance from Chris Rock which I do not know what to make off except he was very annoying. The viewership and people who assign ratings is an interesting one. They assigned the same score, 7.7, to Titanic which was an incredible film that won almost every Oscar, a fan favorite. How do you explain the rationale for rating this jumbled mess with no awards to its name a 7.7?",Null,1,4,23 April 2017
About Time," Great time travel film
","Films about time travel always intrigue me especially when done well. About time is a good example of that. What starts as a simple time travel story to improve a person's life becomes a story about family, heartbreak and life lessons. The protagonist shows that he never takes a day for granted and the people around him for granted. From the outset the film takes a positive note and shows a positive character that is tolerable and likable for the most part. Not only is it interesting the events that unfold in this person's extraordinary ordinary life are quite entertaining to watch. The drama is also well executed when Tim finds that there are trade offs and challenges he faces with his ability. The supporting cast especially, Bill Nighy do a great job. If you can get over the technical feasibility of time travel and the romantic or heartfelt fluff you will certainly enjoy this film. I feel this might have scored very well with young married couples.",Null,1,1,25 June 2017
Aquaman," Not as good as I hoped sadly
","Besides Wonder woman I have not been too impressed with DC movies recently. But growing up and loving those superheroes I always give those films a go. There were things that worked and didn't work for Aquaman. Sadly more things didn't work. The CGI and fight scenes were often over the top. The biggest issue for me was 'buying into' this universe. If you look at Guardians of the Galaxy we easily bought into into that crazy space journey with funny looking creatures. Aquaman in that respect is more believable but sadly it comes across as far fetched and you're not really immersed or taken on a journey.One positive is the somewhat decent plot. On one side there is a human rivalry and the other is an oceanic empire wanting to strike back at humans. Jason Momoa does what he can with the script but its not enough to carry the film. It tries to pull off too much of the unbelievable and passable. This is not a terrible film but its not memorable. Let's just say if viewers saw it showing on TV years from now they would probably keep flicking channels compared to tuning in for a few minutes. It's passable and not the win that DC so desperately needs to respond to the huge success and formula used by Marvel.

","Deadpool 2 was an enjoyable experience at the movies. It could be fun to watch but cannot be regarded as a great film. The overall humour, story and action scenes worked well. Cable was a great villain. There were some funny moments that were crazy enough to be pulled off. Often I felt there just too many jokes being thrown at you so it was hard to fully get what each scene/character was saying. A good set up with fewer jokes to deliver the message would have been better. In this way Deadpool tried too hard to be funny and it was a bit hit and miss.

",Thor: Ragnarok was great fun to watch. I never felt at anytime that I had to think too hard but could sit back and enjoy the fun filled film. Marvel seems to produce high quality and enjoyable films with ease. The key is to make a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and have fun with it. The jokes were well placed and it had some great characters to enhance the story. Cate Blanchette makes an excellent villain as Thor's forgotten older sister and is transformed and unrecognisable. A great treat and good experience at the movies. 7.5/10,Null,0,7,18 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," Enjoyable and nostalgic
","Midnight in Paris was an enjoyable film to watch, stories about time travel and great historical figures is always a treat to watch. The protagonist (Owen Wilson) perfectly fits into this story as a writer who fancies the past and the city of Paris. Woody Allen has shown his great talent through his direction, symbolism and letting the audience experience Paris in different times. It was fun ride to watch Gil (Wilson) travel back in time to the 1920s in Paris and Midnight and interact with some of history's memorable and significant figures. As the film progresses you see Gil's life and time become happier and more exciting but at the same time his life in the present is in decline. The first half of the film was magical and a joy to watch. The only criticism I have is the part where Marion Cotillard's character also has the opportunity to travel to an even earlier time in Paris in the same manner as Gil by accepting a ride at midnight. This somewhat made the film confusing and harder to buy into. How many people can slip back into time besides Gil so easily? While the past was celebrated well in the film the ease with which people could go back and possibly even change past events underscores its importance and significance it has played. I feel they could have omitted that element and it should have only been Gil's ability and journey. He could have still reached his epiphany that people in the present always look to the past and nostalgia is a feeling that each generation will continue to have. Overall still an enjoyable and creative film. 7.5/10",Null,0,0,14 July 2017
Hotel Rwanda," Gripping, shocking and beautifully made
",'There's always room' was the phrase uttered by Paul Rusesabagina at the end which captures the essence of this great film. Hotel Rwanda is a well directed and beautiful film. It captures a shocking and brutal period in human history. Despite a Rwandan genocide in 1994 carried out the Hutu militia as revenge for being oppressed by the Tutsi in previous years Paul's humanity and bravery still prevailed. His qualities and actions could sound like a fictional hero yet it is very real. In the most dire situations the bravest and most humane stand out. Despite different conditions and circumstances Paul Rusesabagina in the film shares similarities with Oscar Schindler in Schindler's list who used his factory to save so many Jewish people. Don Cheadle gives an Oscar worthy performance and more than carries this beautiful yet shocking film as the brave hotel manager who housed and saved so many refugees. A once charming hotel is transformed into a temporary refuge safe haven for many. Despite showing the harsh realities that once existed this film pointed out the sad truth about the rest of the world in this period. The west and the rest of the world refused to intervene even though there were so many pleas to be saved. A bright light was shone on human nature. Overall this eventful and tragic film was well directed and educational about a dark period in history. Often many forget how many innocent people are affected by civil war and unrest. It only takes a number of instigators to disturb the peace for millions of civilized people. Hollywood and society can benefit from well made and accurate films rather than looking for the nearest gravy train. One can only be thankful for not being stuck in those tough times and for their freedom.,Null,1,1,1 June 2017
Ready Player One," Expected more from Spielberg
","I love futuristic and unique films that create their own realities, realms or worlds. From iconic films such as Inception to even great tv shows like Game of Thrones they can allow us to escape reality and have a unique viewing experience. Ready Player One certainly has its moments but it is not anything special. The pop culture references are great and I'm sure many would have loved The Shining references and scene. It was a treat to enter the setting and location of such a great film. Not to mention other references to other films. The plot is also reasonably unique and somewhat flows. However the downfall is the childish and unnecessary love story between the two main actors. This did not work at all and it was nauseating to see Wade close the doors to the lawyers to kiss the girl in what was a very childish and unneeded scene. A lot of teenagers and amateur film goers might have enjoyed it. Romance can work well when it is done to enhance a film and adds value. Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of our time yet this is not some of his best work. The great soundtrack is also not enough to save the film.",Null,1,3,7 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Not too bad, had higher expectations
","I, Tonya had its strengths and was a decent film. However it did not live up to its hype. The acting and performances are the strongest part of the film. Margot Robbie does a great job as Tonya Harding and fully immerses herself into Harding's troubled and spiraling out of control life. It was hard to not feel sorry for Tonya and the abuse was not easy to watch. It also had a great soundtrack.The film could have had more laughs, been better directed and definitely contain less reflections from their older selves. Nothing kills the flow of a movie than disjointed confessionals from the cast that added little value to the film. A critic called this film 'The Goodfellas of Figure Skating', it definitely is not and does not have the same caliber or quality attached to it. The biggest weakness is this film lacked flair or style to weave it all together. Overall decent but lets not kid ourselves its nothing to brag about. 7.5/10",Null,1,2,5 February 2018
Molly's Game," Not too bad, could have been a Royal flush
","Molly's game had the potential to be great. You had a great cast and plot. You had the rise of a successful independent woman hosting elite private games which led to crossing paths with the Mafia and dangerous people. Then you had the downfall and decline of her empire with the FBI knocking on her door. The biggest issue with this film was directing and writing. Careful directing, writing and perhaps a killer soundtrack could have made this a great film because it had all the elements. There were so many unnecessary elements such as Molly's skiing which had no material part to play besides she used to like skiing as a child, so what does it have to put with running Poker games? There were also family issues with her father that were kind of unnecessary, I could see it was to give more depth to Molly but this wasn't explored as much so those scenes didn't add value. It seemed this film was trying too hard to be many things at once. It would have worked better if it was more about the rise and fall of Molly's empire and it might have made more sense to have a linear story instead of a back and forth. Overall decent but needed a few tweaks. 7/10",Null,1,5,11 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Enjoyable film
","This was a great and enjoyable film. Some strong performances and hilarious dialogue. The build up was done really well and one could say it was a good outcome in the end. It takes skill and good film making to take an issue and show it in an enjoyable, humorous and almost relatable manner. The part at the end showing real footage and tension really was juxtaposed to the film, too heavy, intense, sad and no one in the theatre made a sound. We all saw the last part with great discomfort. Other than that great film.8/10",Null,8,16,19 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A great and fun filled Spider man film
","Marvel has done it again and produced a really great Superhero film with a fresh and younger spin. The film was funny, entertaining and well made. One of the things that stood out for me was how well this film worked with a very young teenage protagonist and other young cast members. Usually films with kids as the stars are meant for a younger audience where kids unrealistically try to pull off stupid and unbelievable stunts. However this film didn't shy away from the fact that Peter Parker was just a kid and the beauty of this was it allowed him to mature and grow into Spiderman. Unlike most Superhero films we have seen for the last few decades this shows a very young aspiring superhero grow into one and learn the ropes. It also gives the audience a chance to connect and like this Peter Parker. The plot was good and Tom Holland made an excellent Peter Parker. The humor and funny situations worked really well and showing Spider man trying to pull off something when he didn't know how was entertaining to watch. A great twist was introduced towards the end of the film which was quite well done. Iron Man's involvement also worked well with Tony Stark taking on a mentoring role and exercising tough love. The only criticism was the final fight scene involving the plane as it was hard to make sense of what was actually going on. Overall a great film and a big improvement on the disastrous recent two Spiderman films with Andrew Garfield. Toby Mcguire's time as Spiderman in the early 2000s gave us some very good films that set a high bar. It is nice to know that standard has now been met with a great new and fresh Spiderman. 8/10",Null,3,7,8 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Decent and well made
","Dr Strangelove does not take a breath from start to finish. At first you might think its a short or standard 1.5 hours but it covers a lot of content. The apparent dark humour is there amidst a very serious plot. It also shows the dangers that can unfold when people in command lose their minds. Also interesting that the President doesn't have as much power as you think. This is an intelligent film, great story and good performances. Peter Sellers shines in his 3 different roles. Kubrick carefully and meticulously shows the workings that lead to such conflict. A classic that can be watched again and a beacon of good film making. 8/10",Null,1,1,16 November 2019
Blades of Glory," Hilarious, great story and acting
","Blades of Glory was an absolute thrill to watch. It takes some intelligence and care to pull off a great comedy and this film certainly does it. The story and direction was great to watch and the cast deliver some of their finest performances. Thoroughly enjoyed and a bit disappointed to see its low rating here on IMDb, guess some folks don't enjoy a big laugh. This film was some of last good films of Will Ferrell as lately his films are quite horrendous and over the top. Blades of glory doesn't try too hard to be funny and ends up hitting it out of the park. The two main cast members have big and different personalities and the film is littered with comedic gold. 8/10",Null,1,4,8 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Absolutely terrible
","This was a mess of a film, a travesty. I do not know where to begin because so many things do not work and make this film fly. Will Smith does all he can to carry this movie. The plot was weak and hard to buy into. One of the biggest problems is the squad themselves. It's like they decided to put together the most unimpressive and dull creatures in one team. Was there a half crocodile half man? Seriously? Katana also shows up and barely utters a word, it was like they added too many useless members to the squad. Each one was more unimpressive than the other. The villain was also equally bad and it was one train wreck after another. The scenario where the squad who is made up of bad guys forced to go after a mistake that the good guys made in the first place was just too hard to buy into and poorly sold. This is storytelling at its worst. Everyone also looked forward to Jared Leto's Joker who gave a weird and mediocre portrayal of the joker. It was so unimpressive and sad to watch, he was given little screen time but if they cut him out it would have not made a difference. This movie is not recommended but I do recommend that Zac Snyder be prevented from having any involvement in superhero movies. Each one is a train wreck and disappointing a number of fans across the globe.",Null,0,0,25 April 2017
Shutter Island," Great thriller
",This was a really enjoyable thriller and honestly it's a lot simpler than people make it out to be. Leonardo's character is investigating a murder and as the film goes on the plot thickens and becomes more mysterious. He is on an island that harbors insane people in an institution. We should note that we see things from his point of view and get immersed in his world. His point of view suggests that he encounters difficult and strange people who prevent him from solving a mystery. This is very well done because we later find out that he himself is an inmate and the whole investigation is in his head that the doctors or help indulge him in an attempt to help his condition. It comes full circle in the end and we see his character trapped in an ever ending mystery. It was well done and not predictable at all because we didn't see that coming.,Null,0,2,28 April 2017
Lost in Translation," Why the hype?
","This movie was just poor. Dull, uninspired and boring. It never really takes off. The characters are unlikeable and unrelatable. How depressing and silly the scenes were, if Bill Murray did not want to keep doing what he was doing he should just retire. It portrays and paints a one dimensional and cynical view of life. Bill Murray films are odd and unusual and often not worth the hype. They are overrated and just plain bland, this is no exception.",Null,1,5,14 July 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Not too bad but not worth the hype
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would suffice as a nice past time film that is good for a short while but forgettable. This film certainly has its moments and the lazy southern setting has its appeal. The acting is quite good, the cast deliver good performances. A number of people complained about the tone and how loathsome everyone is but that is the theme of this story. It hits the ground running with a blunt but grieving mother wanting some kind of retribution. While it has its positives it never really crosses the mark into a truly great or captivating film. Something more was needed to get it across the line, whether a surprising twist, conspiracy or revelation of sorts. It never quite gets there and has a number of plot holes, besides the three billboards it lacks symbolism and it never is really resolved in any form. I do not think the viewers have to interpret or 'read into' anything further but the director has left loose ends and incomplete story lines. This is not a bad film, I could an aspiring film maker winning the top art or film prize at a school or festival. Possibly even the Cannes film festival. However to take home the Oscar for best film would be a stretch. Then again the Oscars have lost credibility when it gave Best Picture to Moonlight last year.",Null,2,4,30 January 2018
Lion," Tear jerker and good for Hollywood
","Lion was a good story and definitely contained some emotional moments. The western audience's fascination with poverty in other countries, especially India is an easy gravy train for Hollywood. Often films are made to highlight and heighten every poor part of India that can be found which resonates with an unfamiliar Western audience who feel better about themselves and their lives. This shock value is where the directors grasp their audience and where the money lies. The purpose is not to educate audiences and give a complete account of life in India but manufacture certain reactions and surprises to boost the ratings of the film. So off course this film was well received. India is a beautiful country with raw beauty. It definitely has serious problems but it also has real strengths, charm and a rich culture. I was born in India and have lived in a developed city along with millions of fellow Indians. This city as many other parts of India was quite developed in most parts. Yet sadly this is not documented in any movie, no stories are sought from here and believe me there are tons of moving stories. I shouldn't be surprised because there is no shock value and Hollywood is only interested in showing India in a negative and poor light. It exploits and uses the stories of poor Indians because that would be better for the bottom line. So off course Westerners think the entire country looks like this and that these are the lives of all Indian people.Lion was a good film but adopted the standard formula Hollywood uses when making Indian related films, showcase a huge amount of poverty. Close to one hour, around 45 minutes, is dedicated to poverty. The same emotional value could have been delivered but the film wanted to emphasise poverty for almost half the film. It also dragged on in parts. The last moments were the best part of the film. I have to admit that when Sheru reunites with his mother it was one of the most emotional moments in cinema. The same story could have delivered with a lot more finesse. No doubt Lion is a beautiful story but Hollywood could not resist the opportunity to use this poor son and his story for commercial purposes. The filmmakers couldn't help themselves from showing excessive poverty. I do not detest this film's story as it is a moving story but I detest Hollywood for exploiting such a story for its commercial value. You can always expect such stories to be made into films. India is full of rich and successful stories that show this great country in a good light. If Western audiences want to get a 'complete' picture of life they should not lap whatever Hollywood throws at them.",Null,1,1,11 May 2017
Forrest Gump," A film about humanity and living in the moment
","Forrest Gump is truly a remarkable film and one of Spielberg's greatest achievements. Its beauty is the simplicity with which the story is told through the eyes of a simple and unassuming character. As a character Forrest is difficult not to like and many can understand and even relate to him. This is a film that transcends a single plot as it showcases many important events in American history that Forrest experiences. The pace is simply brilliant as it does not slow down at any certain time period, it moves fast enough for the viewer to appreciate it. Through Gump's living in the moment and unassuming character this film conveys volumes about humanity and how simple values like kindness and respect really matter. Forrest values the key people in his life.These are one of those films that should be on most people's bucket list. The direction and performances are first class and both Spielberg and Tom Hanks were very deserving of the Oscars they won. This is a truly beautiful film and one that has easily stood the test of time.",Null,1,1,1 June 2017
Fargo," Decent
",Fargo was an enjoyable film and probably could be best summed up as a comedy of errors. This definitely has the stamp of the Cohen brothers on it with its tangents and side plots. The strength of this film to me is the strong performances from the cast. This film is well put together and culminates in a bit of tragedy for almost everyone. It is memorable enough but I wouldn't go as far to say it's iconic and I know I'm the minority with that. A stronger plot and more focused scenes I feel works better during screen time. A number of people are fond of the various side plots/tangents that kind of lead to nowhere and don't really add value. For example the scene with Margie and person she went to school with trying to chat her up added little to the story. This is a simple and ironic story but it is certainly not of Shakespearean proportions.,Null,0,1,2 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Decent tribute to a musical icon
","Portraying someone like Freddie Mercury is no easy feat. The same goes for the band Queen. The director was also wise to use Freddie's voice as no one can come close to this. Rami Malek is passable and pays great homage to Freddie as he looks and acts the part. You really feel you are watching Freddie and Queen. I got goosebumps throughout this film as we relived some moments of Freddie's life especially the live performances. People can easily challenge how accurate some of it was. It shyed away from many controversial and crazy aspects of Freddie's life, the wild parties and affairs. It seemed quite PG friendly and contained no swearing, Freddie definitely swore. The ending also seemed somewhat rushed. We see Freddie at Live Aid and nothing about his last days. A number of events happened after Live Aid such as Wembley and his final album. All would have been great viewing.This film was great, the music was great and finally a crew had the guts and skill to pull a fitting tribute off. 8/10",Null,2,2,11 November 2018
Baby Driver," A great blend of action, humour and music
","Baby Driver gives us a fresh, exciting and fun experience at the cinema. From the very start the film goes off with a bang and we are straight into it. Baby's unique personality and set of skills gives the film its edge. Not to mention the mix of great actors who hit it out of the park. You feel the danger, intensity and thrill of the ride throughout the film.Unlike traditional or previous heist movies this film has a novel approach and pulls it off with great style. A number of scenes are synchronized with the music which really works. The beauty of this film and its music is that the audience joins in on Baby enjoying some great music from Queen to Lionel Richie. The story works well too with showing Baby and his various crew members pulling off some heists that showcased some impressive driving on his characters part. The love story also worked well and it nicely intertwined with the main story. Some criticisms of Baby Driver are we could seen or heard more about how he came to be involved in this life. We got a brief reason from Kevin Spacey but maybe being shown these scenes as a flashback would have worked well. Another thing could have been better locations or situations for the heists as they seemed quite ordinary such as the post office. Overall a very enjoyable film and not one to be missed. 8.5/10",Null,1,3,28 July 2017
Justice League," Another let down
","Justice League was definitely better than BvS but the bar was never that high. The film was a slightly better, less dark and lighter film. You could tell they were trying to pull of the humor that Marvel did effortlessly. The acting was decent but it was woven together by a weak story and villain. Except for sharing a name with a great rock band, the villain failed to impress and create a sense of danger. The plot was the standard I want to destroy earth and raise my kingdom and the heroes need to band together again. Ben Affleck seemed uninterested in this film and didn't have as much of a presence as I would have liked. Wonder Woman as always worked like a charm and captured everyone's attention. The flash actually worked and the jokes were not that bad. Cyborg and Aquaman were a disappointment. While they looked the part, they failed too impress. Another big flaw in this film was the importance and hype the overpowered Superman was given. While I don't mind Superman as a hero but he has too many powers and it is only some ridiculous alien monster with no personality that presents a challenge. When he finally returned in the last and lackluster fighting scene he was more formidable than his opponent and easily fought off the villain. Where was the intensity and challenge if this overpowered hero easily beats down the villain. It's obvious Snyder has a crush on Superman.Sadly there was a lot of potential but it was wasted in a movie that will likely be forgotten in a year. Zac Snyder should be prevented and blocked from making superhero movies. He has ruined and stopped the DC universe from taking off except for Wonder Woman. 6.8/10",Null,2,5,18 November 2017

I am astounded by the low rating on IMDb, I guess people can't appreciate a great film. I had high expectations before I watched it and this film more than exceeded it. It had some iconic scenes and was just beautifully made. I wish I was old enough to have watched it at the theaters because it would have been a life changing experience. The beauty of this film is was uplifting despite its sad moments. Many felt emotional when Bruce Willis made the ultimate sacrifice and his speech from out of space is probably one of the best in film. I am worried for those who can't appreciate the beauty in this film. The movies are an experience and this was larger than life. Despite its silly rating on here it is still popular and memorable. Highly recommended, this should be on your bucket list.",Null,1,4,22 April 2017

The Revenant," Saying this movie is Overrated is an understatement
","The academy has been known to give its awards to undeserving films over the years. Classic and acclaimed films such as Shawshank Redemption or Goodfellas have been passed over for other films. The Revenant certainly takes the cake. Leonardo is a great actor but for some reason the Academy decided to give him a best actor Oscar in this film over his performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. This film has very little substance to it besides the fact that it is about revenge but to see how this revenge unfolds we have watch a long and dull film. A number of viewers raved about the nature and cinematography which was good but award an Oscar for cinematography and be done with it. Instead this ended up being the impetus for garnering praise for a very mediocre film. It absolutely bewilders and even saddens me that watching footage of nature for a quite a while I might add makes a good film. It doesn't matter that the plot was weak and one dimensional, it was hard to understand what was said, it was too long, boring and fruitless as long as the film is 'scenic'. Using that logic a porno film could be made in nature with beautiful scenery and be deemed a great film, it might even win a few Oscars. Perhaps those who are blinded by this 'nature' and scenery should watch the Discovery Channel and National Geographic more often or take a trip or two to some scenic areas in New Zealand or Switzerland. Maybe then you could watch movies and accurately judge its worth. This was a very mediocre film but at least Leonardo finally got an Oscar.",Null,1,3,13 February 2017

","James McAvoy gives a great performance or performances as a person with DID, a person harboring multiple personalities. Each personality tries to hold on for the light to appear. McAvoy delivers each differing personality with precision and is believable. He delivers the personalities with ease and we see how much talent he possesses. Aside from James McAvoy's great performance the film was average. Not too bad yet not too great and certainly not memorable. As a thriller it serves its purpose as the audience is glued in to see how and if the last girl will escape and the emergence of the last personality. A twist or some big mystery that was revealed would have made it more interesting since it was close to two hours and it had enough time for this. The link to the film Unbreakable was subtle and well done as we see Bruce Willis's character refer to his nemesis Mr Glass and the link between Glass and The Horde. Speculations are there will be a sequel to the film but if they are looking for a franchise I do not know how much currency Split has to carry or lay any interesting groundwork for future comic book films.",Null,0,5,30 May 2017

Hugo," A big let down
","A number of critics on this site have regarded this movie as enjoyable for cinematic fans. The opposite could not be more true for this disappointment of a film. The history of cinema is something to behold and fondly remember. In the space of a century since the Lumiere brothers made some of the earliest films in history cinema has advanced greatly in all aspects. However one does not need a boring and unimpressive history lesson. This story drags itself for far too long and does not deliver. This film would have been much better if they had actually focused on George's days as a film maker rather than showing us archive footage. As a film it was poorly put together and does not connect too well with the audience. This certainly does not cater to film lovers as it does nothing to bring the senses or interest alive. Hugo has to be one of the most annoying characters in the history of film. His ridiculous periods of silence and stupidly looking dumbstruck frustrate the viewer.Film has made great strides and directors, producers and yes even 'Cinematic fans' have played a part in maintaining the great legacy of film.

When I spoke to friends about this film they said the novel and previous adaptations were pretty good and enjoyable. Puzzled, I told them what I just saw and they gasped. The events were twisted and quite degrading.

Dunkirk," Decent but expected more from Nolan
","Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and easily a very talented one. I had high expectations when I heard he was making his war movie and taking on a significant Battle during the war. Many great directors like Spielberg have sought to make great war movies and now Nolan was adding this to his resume, I was excited. Dunkirk had a great start but that's where it ends. The film was somewhat disjointed and did not flow too well. The film was ambitious and looked at the Battle from different views but sadly this did not seem linear and while viewers could get the idea of the battle a number of unnecessary and even confusing scenes distorted the overall premise. As in real life the majority and most of the focus should have been on Dunkirk and the rescue effort but instead we had other scenes from Tom Hardy and an unwanted cameo from Harry Stiles that did not add value to this film. The acting was also sub par, we didn't see any breakthrough performances to carry the film. Overall a decent film with great cinematography but the exciting trailer, subject content and Nolan's involvement did not make this a great film. This was my honest take on this film, I see people are acting like sheep and giving high ratings. This is nowhere near the masterpieces Nolan has made like the Dark Knight Trilogy or Inception but its not too bad. 7.5/10",Null,3,5,25 August 2017
Jackie," Interesting look at an iconic figure but passable
","I have been a fan and intrigued by the Kennedy family for years. It is a dynasty full of great personalities that many people admire. So when Jackie was advertised I was eager to watch it and interested to see how Portman would pull it off. Jackie is a film where certain elements or parts are better on their own then the film as a whole. The filming techniques and soundtrack stand apart as being extremely well done. Director Pablo Larrain wonderfully merges some scenes with archival footage such as the motorcade and Jackie shown staring at the actual crowds from the car. The music was powerful and matched the seriousness and drama that was shown. Perhaps the biggest flaw is Jackie herself played by Natalie Portman. She was not convincing in her portrayal and sadly failed to rise to the occasion. Her performance was safe at best where she looked the part and emulated Jackie but she was never Jackie. The audience was alienated from her throughout the film especially when we were supposed to relate to it. At the time of the assassination the world related to her and felt great respect for the real Jackie via a television or radio. Yet we find it hard to connect with Jackie from a more personal and private viewpoint. Even the scene where she changes her dress and listened to Camelot acted to show a childish and immature side to her. I am unsure whether this actually happened. Pablo also goes for moments or stills where he focuses on a shocked Jackie but the problem here is that the film hasn't built up towards those scenes and Portman hasn't won us over so these moments fall flat. Perhaps the film would have benefited if it cast somebody else, a great performance would have made this a great film perhaps in the same league as the Kings Speech and Oscar worthy. I do not agree with the other critics who pointed out her one sided outlook during the film and how her loss and feelings were heightened compared to those around her. Might I remind viewers that this is Jackie's story and the film is centred around her and not the Kennedy family. In fact it makes it clear at the start because the story is told by Jackie to a Journalist about her account. If the acting was up to scratch you would have connected with Jackie rather than see a grown up throw a tantrum. Peter Sarsgaard was unimpressive and badly cast as Robert Kennedy. He looked nothing like him, sounded nothing like him, looked older than JFK his older brother and was even taller than JFK. In real life JFK was older, broader and taller than his brother.Jackie mainly looks at a certain period in Jackie Kennedy's life, the aftermath of JFK's assassination and funeral. It has parallels to Spielberg's Lincoln released a few years ago that also looks at a certain part of his life. Based on the title one could easily assume it was about her life or parts of her life however if done right it could be impressive. 13 days is an example of a great film about a small period in the Kennedy's lives. Overall Jackie is a passable film. For all the criticism of Portman she has done a safe job and is passable as Jackie. We have to acknowledge that she had very big shoes to fill. Don't be in such a rush to watch this one in theatres or even video, it can act as a good pastime one day.",Null,0,0,21 March 2017
Yesterday," Not too bad
","I was very excited to watch this film because of its great and novel concept. I'm a huge Beatles fan and imagine if there suddenly was no Beatles but you had the ability to sing and perform. Love the music and how it was shown that even after all these years these songs would hit it out of the park. The corporatisiation of Jack Malik's image was done quite well.While this was not a bad film I couldn't help but feel it was a missed opportunity. The film regrettably became somewhat of a rom-com. Emphasis was on his relationship and the one dimensional romance we couldn't care less for. With a unique and brilliant concept I felt the sky could be the limit, performing the Beatles hits. Historic moments could have been created and other music legends could have been involved. I think Forest Gump is a good comparison with Yesterday. It was a simple story about a simple man who got to meet icons and experience huge moments. Yesterday however is about an extraordinary and magical situation happens to a musician who reduces himself to a simple love storyline.",Null,0,3,30 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Somewhat decent
","Avengers is easily the most hyped film this year. In reality it is somewhat decent and a big improvement on Infinity war. The heroes assemble to bring back their loved ones and defeat Thanos.

The pacing seemed a bit slow and again Thano's motivation or goal is never fully explored. He now wants to destroy the full universe instead of half, quite cliche. More humour could have helped since Marvel have made a name for themselves by adding humour. I do not think this is the best film in the franchise by a long shot.I believe many of the fans in the universe who laugh and clap nonsensically at every scene voted 10s over here.

Dirty Dancing," Nobody gives Baby a low rating
","Dirty Dancing is a classic film that is so memorable that it is hard to say anything negative about it. It has a reasonable plot but is accompanied by an immortal soundtrack and moments that make this film remarkable. Herein lies it's value as it can be revisited for positive memories and a soundtrack second to none. While many will argue Schindler's list or 12 Years A Slave is a superior film not many will agree you can revisit or watch it over again. The songs featured in this classic will be included on our iPod's and play on the radios for years to come. We will never forget when Patrick Swayze hoisted Jennifer Grey up for the dance sequence at the end, timeless moments that keep this film alive and memorable. Dirty Dancing in its essence is a film about letting go of strict societal norms and letting the music embrace you. You dance and feel the beat as opposed to observing rules and steps, the music dictates the rhythm and mood. Perhaps this iconic film was significant in the departure from traditional dancing as fewer people know dancing. Dancing as we see in modern movies or real life is people moving to the music without any defined steps, perhaps started by this iconic film.This film is a must see and should be on your bucket list.

How did this film even get approved to be made? The studio must be desperate for quick cash and approved something that could cater to a number of people.

Jim Carrey doesn't excel at playing Andy because he becomes Andy in the film, won't be surprised if he idolized him. The real Andy Kauffman was a unique and brilliant comedian who was ahead of his time. His comedic sketches on Saturday night live and performance in Taxi was incredible which displayed his foreign man character. He was arguably the most creative comic in the twentieth century who was well ahead of his time. Often his creativity and eccentricity was misunderstood by many as Andy was a purist in his comedy. Many saw his wrestling with women as taking it too far but never realized the joke was on Andy and not women. Jim Carrey fills large shoes very well as he impersonated Andy who impersonated a foreign man and even his other personality Tony Clifton. We saw the often misunderstood Andy through most of his career and how a few of his stints were always an act. His tragic end is also well acted by Carrey which captured the tragic end to a legendary comic. Andy Kauffman once said he would fake his death and return years later. Sadly he or Tony Clifton have not returned.",Null,1,2,5 April 2017
The Princess Bride," I know I'm the Minority
",The Princess Bride felt like it was told by 12 year old's for 12 year old's. I do not find this film all that good and it certainly doesn't fly with me. Its silly linear story telling and predictability is quite unnerving. This would be a great movie for fans of Sesame Street and I think they forgot to include the Muppets in this tale. But as for a movie to cater to adults it is very mediocre. The cast felt too protected and it was silly childish fun. I cannot emphasize enough the predictability and lack of substance this film has. I know I'm the minority to just sees this film for what it is but it was a waste of time. It is good news for high school or college students studying theater because the next time they produce a lackluster play at the theater there is a chance it will be praised to the heavens.,Null,0,2,30 May 2017
Saving Private Ryan," Setting the standard
","Saving Private Ryan become a standard or yard stick by which to make war movies. Instead of recreating a battle or event it added depth or a unique story. We see some modern war films aiming to achieve the same standard. A good example is the modern epic 1917, a truly great war movie. Similar to Saving Private Ryan the mission was not the war but the man or delivering something or someone. Tom Hanks gives a strong performance and it is a fitting tribute to the American effort during WW2. The film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of war. Again setting a standard with the amount of detail and gruesome chaos that ensues in a conflict.",Null,0,1,5 April 2020
The Favourite," Not too bad
","The Favourite has been getting a lot of buzz. It was overall unique and a different take on historical events. The humour is done very well and works naturally. The performances are very good and believable, this is a strong cast. The story and plot and what is illustrated should receive mixed reviews. Politics and power struggles is a great theme but this was a bit sloppy to follow on screen. This film is a dramedy but the drama aspect was a bit weak and lacking. A good dramedy has a good mix of comedy and drama. There was a lack of flow for the plot and drama, one could get the basic gist but so much was not explained or left out it felt disjointed and all over the place. For e.g. even a short text on the screen to set the tone or setting could have worked. That way we take the time/setting seriously but with a twist. This is a fine film but I do not think it deserves the hype it has got.",Null,1,3,19 January 2019
Legend," Underrated
","Legend was an entertaining and decent film. It tells the story about the notorious Kray twins who were infamous gangsters in England. Tom Hardy delivers a memorable performance as he portrays both the twin brothers and their unique personalities. Sadly both Tom Hardy and Legend were overlooked at the award ceremonies. Legend was a coherent and well paced film that told a true story. It showcased great moments, suspense and action scenes. Some would say it slightly resembled a Greek tragedy that a number of great organized crime movies have displayed. We saw the rise of the twins with opening a new club, striking lucrative deals and securing love interests. Then we saw the demise and train wreck that ends with jail time. Arguably one of the most entertaining films of the year that deserves a higher rating on IMDb.",Null,0,2,10 May 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Not too bad
","Avengers: Infinity War packs quite a punch and after 10 years manages to tie together its universe. This was a good film, it had strong points and it had disappointments as well. The fighting scenes and some touching moments were well done but at the same time the elements that have led Marvel produce some of the best superhero films were not there. Granted this was a more serious film but the humor was lacking. Captain America did not have his shield, the Avengers didn't fully unite but fought in different parts. Steve and Iron Man didn't even share a scene together. What might have been better could have been having those separate fights in other realms and later having the whole team fight together on Wakanda. To me the biggest issue was pace, Marvel films excel at having great space and making great use of their time. This film had a slow pace at the start and sadly a bit boring sometimes. To me the film to beautifully tie their universe together was Civil War. This was a great film that devoted time to each hero, pitted them in a great match up and showed off their strengths. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but after all the hype I expected more. Pretty good but not great, other films such as Thor Rangarok, Spider Man and Ant Man hit it out of the park. Thanos was a great villain and Josh Brolin deserves praise. It was sad to see our heroes disappear but I am excited to see what's next. This was surely part 1 and part 2 will be the film that might live up and exceed expectations. It was realistic to have him win round 1 to make for an even great round 2. 7/10",Null,0,3,19 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino film true and true
","Tarantino is such a unique director. His unique style comes in full force in his latest film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. He also has a stellar cast to deliver this tale. Tarantino does well with the pace in this film, despite it traditionally being long you don't feel it. There is depth covered in normality as he sets the scene well, no over the top special effects or moments needed. It's almost as if he creates a deep and complex tale that the characters define and he sits back to watch. Even though Sharon Tate was a real person you feel like she could have been a more fictional character compared to Rick or Cliff.Factual events form a nice back drop to this interesting tale. Another strong feature of Tarantino films is the deviation from history. Usually humorous and works out badly for the real villains who got away. He did the same with Inglorious basterds and does the same with Sharon Tate.Overall the pace, depth and context provides great build up to an explosion of a finale that provides a funny and alternative history. 8/10",Null,3,5,31 August 2019

",The synopsis of Get Out doesn't give a clue as to what the film is really about. I was expecting a modern deep film on interracial couples. There have been a few films made about this topic already and we're in the 21st century already. I was pleasantly surprised. Get Out gives you a great thriller experience with a unique twist. The traditional kind of racism or ignorance you expect is not what you think. People are somewhat fascinated and want superior physical bodies.These kind of cult or secretive groups in film are very interesting. This is a great new spin on it.

Room," Shocking, emotional and creative
","Room was an impressive from the start, it unveiled more and more mystery and intrigue as it went on. In the confines of a small room and space a great story of struggle, sacrifice and sadness is conveyed. The film is effective in getting the viewer to formulate numerous thoughts as to why a young mother and her son exist in this small room. We gradually wonder until a shocking and unspeakable truth is revealed to us. After this revelation a number of things makes sense. Like little Jack is slowly coming to terms with reality it gradually sets in for the audience. Lenny Abrahamson cleverly keeps his audience within the confines of that room until he reveals its cruel reality. Its a shocking truth to most who perhaps conjured up all kinds of science fiction related reasons, the reality is bleak. The first half of Room was suspenseful, intriguing and became increasingly poignant as it went on. The strength of the film was in the build up and longing of the mother and her son to escape into the world. The second part of Room while pleasing at the start took a dive as the mother went through emotional turmoil and took the audience through this sad journey. The film wasn't long enough to explore the long ranging effects and aftermath such entrapment would have on the mother and son. Hence it was an unnecessary emotional downward spiral. If the film had built up the need for escape, the difficulty of it and painted a fairy tale picture of the outside it might have been even better. Escape happened far too soon, perhaps this could have been prolonged and intensified so when they finally escaped it would have been a lot more rewarding and satisfying. The outside and final scenes could have been drastically shortened to show a happy and free mother and son. Overall a decent film, Brie Larson gives a stellar performance and one can see why she earned the Academy Award for best actress. 7.5/10",Null,0,3,30 May 2017
Schindler's List," Heartbreaking and powerful
","Schindler's List has to be one of the greatest films ever made and it establishes Spielberg at the top of the ladder when it comes to directors. The portrayal and setting of WWII is brutally accurate. Spielberg does not shudder from the harsh cruelties that existed at the time. From various vantage points we watch the horror unfold. A film does not need to build towards something as it starts with such a horrible setting, it was the reality at the time. Oscars transformation from an opportunistic businessman to a heroic saviour is one of the best transformations seen in film.As tough as it is to watch it is a beautifully woven masterpiece by Spielberg and one does not know how much time has passed as he/she has been fully immersed in this dark tale and reality. 9/10",Null,44,79,7 January 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Simply Brilliant
","Great directing, exceptional acting, the right dose of humor and a great story make a winning combination. This is unlike a bank robbery you have ever seen and years before numerous directors made films about bank robberies. Pacino and John Cazale hit this film out of the park. Their stellar performances make this film iconic, I am not sure if any other actors could have had the same impact. Essentially we see a bank robbery that is badly planned turn into a media circus. After seeing the unstable and excited personalities of Pacino we understand why. For a film that escalates and a situation that increasingly grows out of control it flows perfectly. You are carefully taken through a chain of events. The humor is also brilliantly done and also flows effortlessly as to not take away the drama and intensity of the robbery. The unplanned robbery, virtually no money being robbed and the unlikely bonding with their captors endears the bank robbers to the audience. You want them to succeed and possibly root for their escape. Despite the circus and things going out of control it appears the duo will succeed as the film nears its end. The film also delivered some shocking moments. I had the same expression as Al Pacino's character at the end of the film. Al Pacino steals the show with his fits of rage, expressions and always being on the edge. This film is highly recommended, 8.5/10",Null,0,1,7 May 2017

Hidden Figures," Hidden Treasures
","Hidden Figures was a great film that shed light on some of the not so well known people who helped America make great strides in Space Travel. It is truly a beautiful story that showcases three brilliant and courageous colored women who made their voices heard and improved things for themselves. Katherine, Mary and Dorothy each made progress and subsequently their mark. Dorothy became proficient in the use of IBM machines, Mary got a court order and fought racist rules and traditions to become the first African American engineer. Katherine also fought racist attitudes and got a seat to classified meetings and provided perfect numbers for NASA. The film highlights how NASA was held back from achieving its goals because of racism and not using all its human intelligence. Racism only hinders human progress and the best ideas rising to the top. Three brilliant women overthrew these racist traditions in an organization that is supposed to value intelligence and innovation. How far the human race would have gone if we valued Merit over superficial qualities. A powerful message is delivered that intelligence can be found among us all regardless of color. It is not concentrated but distributed naturally. The only issue with this film was the soundtrack. It did not fit well at all with the time period and did not suit the mood. What's funny is the 60s had some of the greatest music. Understandably many films now use these songs in their films but the soundtrack could have included not so popular tracks of that time. Modern music and mashups undermine the quality and mood of it. We see some stellar performances from the main three cast members who portray Dorothy, Mary and Katherine. This film was appropriately named to illustrate the great contributions made by women who are not given all the credit they deserve due to the time period and so are hidden in history amid other names. Besides being brilliant woman they were also mothers who supported their families, true backbones of American life and society. Their bravery and courage to challenge ignorant racist customs and bring progress perhaps make them the Rosa Parks of NASA. Definitely recommended, 8/10",Null,3,6,30 April 2017

Lincoln," Not bad but a bit of a let down
","I had high hopes for Lincoln, one of most respected figures in American History. We know there was a lot of material that could be dramatized regarding this great man's life. However I was quite disappointed. The film only focused on a certain part of his life. Now if you direct it with enough finesse and make it captivating then it could be a great film. This has been done successfully with 13 Days about the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. However this period of Lincoln's life was dramatized in quite a dull manner as it followed the legislative hurdle Lincoln faced. It was disappointing to take such a large figure like Lincoln and make a film about his battles with Congress when there was so much more that occurred in his life that was more eventful and entertaining. If one were to make a film today about JFK with the tag line JFK or Kennedy one would expect a more complete and eventful dramatization of his life. We would not expect Kennedy spending most of the film fighting with Congress and observe a 100 days worth of this legislative battle. Therefore it follows that a film called Lincoln or about him should have been more complete and eventful or if it were about a period, choose an interesting period. Congress and political battles are not worth dramatizing. Perhaps the title should have been renamed to 'The Bill' or Emancipation Bill or something specific. Besides the big flaws the acting was very good and DDL deserved an Oscar for his portrayal. 6.5",Null,1,5,25 April 2017
Logan," Decent and enjoyable but lets not go overboard
","Logan is very entertaining to watch. We look at an aged and more vulnerable wolverine and later introduced to an even more vulnerable Charles Xavier. The maturity in terms of language, violence and darkness definitely works well and adds to the realism. The child actress, Laura, who plays Logan's unknown daughter also does a great job. The setting and story line also deserves to be commended as it was a unique look at the world of the X Men. We have gone from the limitless possibilities of the heroes in X Men First Class and Days of Future Past to a more fragile existence for the last remaining mutants. We are informed there are no mutants and Logan and Xavier are possibly the last of their kind. Unlike previous films that have seen Wolverine as a dominant force he is portrayed as a dying and often weak hero who is often on the receiving end. However as entertaining as this film was it is not deserving of the over the top praise from critics. Some have cited this as the best X Men movie and some said it was in the same league as the Dark Knight. This was a good film but not one that was better than its predecessors such as X Men First Class or even Apocalypse. The X Men films have improved significantly in recent years but Logan would not be its best. The film often felt slow at times and the plot seemed disjointed. There was nothing overly unique about this film to set it apart. The story about creating future soldiers with abilities has been done before and there were no twists to be seen. Essentially it was a film about survival and when that fails we wait to see Logan die. Critics and users can sometimes act like sheep and rather than see a movie purely for its worth their minds are made up in advance. This is a good film but not an iconic film, a strong 7/10.",Null,2,6,28 March 2017

You can feel the frustration and despair of people and real footage is used a number of times for realism. A truly heartbreaking event and absolute act of cowardice from the terrorists. Some great moments of triumph and moving on were captured as survivors and dignitaries honored the victims and paid homage to Mumbai and the great Taj hotel that still stood strong.The moral is the Taj and its people will not be brought down.

A joker portrayal like this has truly set the bar high. Nolan excels in making a strong and engaging film that keeps you on your toes. His purpose is to convey chaos and he does this beautifully.

Into the Wild," Why are terrible movies rated so highly?
","This film was just terrible. It is about an ungrateful person who throws away his future to live in the wild. Based on the true story of an actual person who wasted his life away. The concept, motives and decisions by the protagonist and the real person are misguided and futile. It achieves no great purpose, I feel a lot of us who live in an ivory tower found this fraudulent and pretend Man vs Wild appealing. It is the opposite. I can think of countless people who would gladly trade places with this buffoon who threw his life down the toilet. This is not a positive tale, of a selfish person throws his privileges away when so many in this world will never get those chances and it was all for nothing. In reality this buffoon barely survived much in the nature, he died after a short time. If he had survived a long time or was still alive and doing some good there would be merit in this film and his life. Sadly that's not the case. An idiot who throws away a promising future and turns his back on family should not be praised but scorned and looked down on.",Null,2,6,21 April 2017

","2001 is the deepest and most thought provoking film I have ever seen. I had to read a lot about its hidden meaning to truly appreciate what Kubrick was trying to show us. Kubrick relies on limited dialogue and conveys a visual experience instead. It will take the average viewer time and reflection to figure this movie out, if one can figure it out. 2001 is so ahead and transcends so much that we are used to in terms of plots, twists and so on when it comes to film.2001 is about the human experience and the spirit. It delves so deep into what we are as a species. It also shows how AI can be a hindrance to human evolution. It is only until the astronaut cuts this off that he can get closer to the next level. Kubrick shows that AI is not true human evolution, we are semi-civilised and never thought about our own progress. Philosophers have hinted at it but we've not considered the metaphysical and spiritual. A truly momentous film.",Null,2,2,31 December 2019

This film is a remarkable tale of humanity and courage of a simple man who travelled so far to achieve his dream using a sled he worked on for many years. Anthony Hopkins does a stunning job and gives one of his finest performances as the record breaker who dared to dream. His journey is beautiful and the humanity of those he met is quite admirable. This was a true feel good movie as it had a very pleasant and happy ending for the late Burt Munro who broke many records. It had a beautiful message that you should always cultivate your goals and never lose heart no matter how old you are. The location and scenes of the Bonneville Salt Flats were a treat to watch.

Selma," Great film to remember a brutal period and American hero
",Selma does not disappoint and safely delivers its message. David Oyelowo is the spitting image of the great Martin Luther King Jr however he may not have portrayed him to the full extent. When actors take on monumental figures in history they have very big shoes to fill. Having said that he manages to pull of a nice tribute and likeness to Dr King. The supporting cast did a great job in carrying this film. The film excelled in showing the brutality towards many innocent African Americans and the inhumane behavior of law enforcement. However it felt a bit slow at times and did drag on. Some will argue how accurate the portrayal of LBJ was. Also accusations against MLK being unfaithful were never substantiated and the rumors do not match with the reality of those times. Perhaps this could have been excluded. This was a good film but it could have been a great film. The best part of the film was probably the montage of scenes at the end and actual footage shown from Selma. 7.8/10,Null,1,3,2 July 2017

This musical cannot obviously be compared to powerhouses like My Fair Lady or Mary Poppins but it is somewhat decent. Arguably Chazelle's best work to date, his films have not been particularly good.

Stanley Kubrick has put his stamp on this film with great cinematography, techniques and use of music. This is not an easy film to watch but yet its got artistic merit. It is gracefully directed and presented to us so that even if we are repulsed we cannot stop watching. It is definitely not black and white and one can't help but question what is the solution to juvenile delinquents? Who says what rehab should be?I prefer more wholesome or less gruesome films that are thought provoking versus something of this flavour.

He nails his role as the cynical and self-absorbed Phil Connors and he treats everyone badly. He one day wakes up and finds he has to relive the same day over and over. We see a great transformation in Phil and it takes great talent to pull this off. I had seen Scrooged last Christmas which was a spin on A Christmas Carol. I have to say the plot of Groundhog day was quite similar with a different twist. Both involved characters transforming from mean spirited to happy and cheerful except this film was more enjoyable. The supporting cast give some great performances which enhance the quality of the film. Perhaps the film would have been more enjoyable if the day that Phil relived was more eventful or notable. Besides the event of Groundhog day it seemed quite plain and ordinary despite his great performance. We also are unsure why he relived the days and why it suddenly stopped. I have seen a number of lower rated and similar films that have actually explained their fiction or twists to make them more believable. I think the majority of the voters have positive associations with this film perhaps because it was part of their childhood or nostalgia which makes it a great film to them no matter what.Thankfully for the story it ended when he became more humane and pleasant.

The pace, action and intrigue of this film is ongoing and never stops. Barry's world of dangerous flight missions, a loyal and beautiful wife and tons of money will entice and fascinate many. Like a Greek tragedy his rise and fall was well captured on film. The film showed the blurred line between the CIA who initially got Barry involved in this and the Drug lords. We were left wondering who the real criminals were, at the end of the day we are all self- interested parties.8/10",Null,2,6,8 September 2017
12 Years a Slave," A Powerful film experience
","12 Years a Slave is a shocking and brutal look at slavery and the reality for many during those horrible times. It does shy away from the harsh realities of slave life and viewer does not get a veiled look of their lives. It is this journey and story of Solomon Northup that makes this a beautiful film. Without warning a respectable and free man is taken away from his family to the inhumane life of slavery. Harsh truths of life during those times are shown at a nonstop pace. It is also interesting to note the disparities that existed within a country from free states to slave states. On some level viewers might even relate to Solomon's plight. What if one of us was displaced from our comfy lives and put in an unknown and foreign place where people didn't care about laws and men? The performances are simply first class. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o give award worthy performances and belt it out to the back row. You feel their frustration, fear, anger and other emotions. This film is also beautifully directed and has a masterful soundtrack to accompany it. Steve McQueen manages to immerse his viewers in the lives of slaves and slave owners in those times. We are captivated by the beautiful storytelling, direction and cinematography. This film is not something you can watch over and over as it is a powerful dose. Despite being an incredible film it is not easy to re-watch just like it was not easy to re-watch Schindler's list. 12 Years a Slave has to be one of the greatest films ever made and is truly a cinematic experience. It definitely earned its best picture Oscar. Definitely recommended if you want a thought provoking and moving experience, 9/10",Null,3,4,23 April 2017
Sausage Party," A waste of time
","I had hopes for Sausage Party, Hollywood has churned out some good animations for decades. However this is not one of their better animations. It was a perverse and sick film in the end, it started with promise but had an end that would suit sick perverts. We have had porn and soft porn but degrading animation with these sentiments is quite sad. The film had something that resembled a plot for most of it, it became dull and unfunny and it certainly saved its worst for last. It included a disgusting animated orgy that did no one any favours. I will never get those precious hours I wasted at the cinema, I could have been doing something better like nothing or staring at a wall for this time. This film would suit immature and perverted teenagers or troubled or twisted adults who get sick kicks from watching such a mess.",Null,0,3,6 April 2017
Joker," Great film from start to finish
","Joker has to be the best film I've seen this year and could be regarded as one of the best films ever made.This film is beautifully made, it has great pacing and some of the best character development. We see a journey of a troubled aspiring comedian who takes blow after blow. Previously it would have been throw him into a science experiment gone wrong, now it is more throw him to society until he snaps. This is a very dark film, not for the faint hearted. The realism and beautiful build up is harsh, the angles taken are unique. It was great to see how the Joker started a movement and in the end got a following.Last but not the least, Joaquin Phoenix gives an incredible performance. This is method acting at its best. He deserves the best actor Oscar for his performance and Director Todd Phillips deserves recognition for such a great film.

Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow manages to keep you on the edge of your seat
","I personally love films and stories about time travel, when a film manages to explain its feasibility reasonably enough then it makes for great viewing. Edge of Tomorrow is a unique time travel story that takes place during a modern war where mankind fights an unknown and alien enemy. Tom Cruise is in top form once again as he plays a general who has the ability to relive the day after he dies. His ability is the same as the foreign entity that has the same power. He is assisted by decorated soldier Emily Blunt who once had the same power. Not only does he try and kill the source of the enemy's power but he also tries to save Emily Blunt in the process. The action and special effects are a thrill to watch. Even though the day repeats itself you never get bored because each repeated day is more interesting and action filled than the last. Definitely recommended. People who enjoy sci-fi and time travel stories will particularly enjoy this one.",Null,1,1,30 May 2017
Pitch Perfect 2," Bad sequel
","The magic and allure from the Pitch Perfect movie has gone in this poorly made sequel. Elizabeth Banks has poorly directed this film and should stick to acting after this mess. In fact, her involvement in the first and second film was unnecessary as well. She came across as an annoying judge whose opinion no one cared to hear. The film sees the Bellas take their competition to the world stage. The internal conflicts and issues the cast faced were artificial, shallow and just plain silly. They couldn't figure out what they were doing and who they fancied and the audience couldn't care less.The opposition was also very unimpressive and not funny. A German group who were quite frankly terrible on their own. The first movie showed great covers of classics but this one showed terrible covers of mostly terrible songs. Sadly they have made yet another movie which could possibly be worse than this one.",Null,0,0,6 April 2017
Whiplash," Great performances but the same can't be said for the film
","Whiplash delivers some great and intense performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. They conveyed an intensity throughout this film and the audience can easily understand how much being a great musician means to the young Andrew. In the same respect the audience can appreciate how the teacher wants to uncover the next best thing and push for greatness. However the performances are the best part of the film because the film seemed slow and disjointed. It also felt incomplete in the end. We got the sense that the plot was about a relentless teacher striving to push his students to their full potential and you have a student striving to be the next big thing. However the film abruptly ends with Andrew's fate not being revealed. There was no text to reveal the outcome of the entire movie. Apparently this was a satisfactory ending. I understand others may not share my view but it is quite disappointing to see films made like this are considered art. We are starting to let go of coherent, deep and well thought of films in favor of incomplete, slow and dull films. What makes it worse is you have so called film critics in magazines who struggle to form basic sentences calling it art. In its essence Whiplash is characteristic of new art films that ask you see something that isn't there. To conjure up a feeling or a depth that simply does not exist in the film through its writing, symbolism or directing. Some of the critics for this film will go so far as to say you didn't see the point and then fail to explain it coherently themselves because the reality is you can't. Hot air only gets you high enough. Sadly these films are attracting more sheep or bees to an artificial honey. It's no surprise Moonlight won the 2017 Oscar for best picture.",Null,1,2,30 March 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great film and worthy of a few Oscars
","The Wolf of Wall Street takes an interesting look at the life of Wall street broker Jordan Belfort and his rise and fall. The film had and used some its ingredients to make a wildly entertaining film which included exceptional acting, great plot, narration, addictive soundtrack and the rise and fall of the central character in world of Wall street and finance. These elements have been used masterfully by Scorsese in former classics. Leonardo definitely deserved an Oscar for his performance as he lives the role of a shady Wall Street broker that is corrupted over his tenure as a stockbroker. The first person narrative works brilliantly as we are told Jordan's story. The portrayal of brokers is interesting as cut throat and money grabbing who use on it on all the vices life has to offer. The film excels at showing this lifestyle in excess from hookers, heavy drinking to living in mansions and sailing on yachts. Jonah Hill and the other cast and crew also hit some home runs to make it enjoyable and humorous at times. The achilles heel when it comes to the cast is easily Margot Robbie. While some of the world seems infatuated with her, she was unimpressive and mediocre. She was very annoying and Leonardo had to carry most of their scenes. The film would have benefited from another talented heroine who brought the best out of Leo and could meet his intensity in the scenes. While this is a great film it also had a few issues that stopped it from being an absolute classic. Scorsese can be creative when he makes his films but in this one it appears his creativity got the better of him and got ahead of itself. So instead of making a carefully coherent film like he has done before it is a film that incorporates unnecessary scenes, dialogue and screen time that distracts from the story. The result is a film that is 3hrs long and scenes that add no value to the plot. Scenes could have easily been reduced in length, the gay orgy scene could have been cut as could the scene with Brad living at his mothers and the list goes on. Cutting these scenes would have made this films great plot richer and less distracting. When I started watching this film I thought this was going be the greatest film Scorsese has ever made but the additional and unneeded scenes changed that. In my humble opinion this is what makes this a great film but not an Iconic film. An entertaining film but not legendary. A strong 8/10 that should have earned a few Oscars.",Null,3,6,17 March 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Quite entertaining but doubtful it will stand the test of time
","Kong Skull Island is enjoyable to watch. From an easy plot, interesting characters to the allure of the mighty Kong himself this film should satisfy. If you've had a long day and just want to watch a movie this would be the right choice. However it appears quite forgettable in terms of the other Kong movies and other films in general. King Kong has been a cinematic classic for a long time. The different story line sadly was not better than the original. The ancient people who inhabit the island and live in Kong's protection pales in comparison to the classic Kong being transported to New York and climbing to a skyscraper with the female he's fallen for as he battles planes. Peter Jackson's remake and the 1933 original are better in plot. The unusual romance was so grand and remarkable to watch. The CGI and special effects for Kong were interesting. The mythical creature closely resembled an erect male which questioned its realism. Jackson was more realistic in his portrayal of an actual beast like Kong and 1933 cannot be cited so much because special effects were limited to what they are now. In 2017 it was surprisingly unimpressive, I have a feeling that in years to come this Kong might be used as an example of how limited the effects were in the past and how far they have later come. In all these respects it definitely will be forgettable and its rating on this site might drop over time.",Null,2,5,15 March 2017

Inception," Creative, Intelligent and Brilliant
","Let me say this first, I had to watch this film twice. The first time I watched it I hated it, it was confusing. The second time I watched it I was simply awe struck. This is easily one of the greatest films ever made.Christopher Nolan has outdone himself. He has created a unique concept and adaptation that is unprecedented in film. We have never seen such creativity brought to life in such a way and executed so brilliantly. The plot is well thought of and flows well. We are introduced to a world of dreams that harbor great secrets and there exists dream explorers who have the technology to explore and steal these secrets. Never before has corporate espionage reached such unique heights. The plot intrigues, impresses and captivates.The acting was first class as well. Leonardo arguably gives his most convincing performance to date. His internal conflicts due to his wife interrupt and complicate the dream mission and the plot Nolan has introduced. Supporting cast such as Tom Hardy also give strong performances. The film includes a memorable and fantastic soundtrack that always suits the mood of the film. Great moments and scenes are included in this film, Cobb on the beach, flash backs and the beautiful Non, Je ne regrette rien which is a cue to wake up. The final scene was so uplifting and rewarding to the viewer.This film might be Nolan's finest work to date and his magnum opus. Please do not hesitate to watch it twice, it is life changing.9.5/10",Null,0,1,1 June 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Decent adaptation and great cast
","I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie's work and watched all of her adapted Poirot novels. In my opinion David Suchet is the definitive Hercule Poirot. Having said that the shock value and mystery element was removed. This did not prevent it from being a decent and enjoyable film. Poirot was portrayed really well and praise is deserved.The pros of this film are its star power, great CGI and filming locations. However one must not hold the story against the film as the story itself is complicated with a few holes in it. It was an accurate adaptation but the source material had its issues. Still a decent film and experience, hopefully this would be a one off experiment.8/10",Null,0,2,26 December 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Iconic film
","The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the greatest films ever made. We see the survival of an innocent prisoner over a period of time who survives with the power of hope. From the effortless acting, a near perfect story, great filming and symbolism this film is a treasure and hits it out of the park. The filming techniques used were masterful. Darabont uses various camera angles and shots to give an image of an institution and explore one of the themes of institutionalism. Andy uses hope to free himself, the pickaxe is a symbol of that hope and the projects such as the library are the ways he sustains himself. In some ways he makes prison life more humane by getting beers for his inmates and playing Mozart for the prison in iconic shot showing the inmates stunned when they hear it. Although we see him escape in an iconic scene we have to understand that he had freed himself and even if he spent time in the hole he was not institutionalised. However Brooks was not able to overcome this and could not survive life outside the institution and its rules, it had consumed him. We have seen this theme in other films where just like it got the better of Brooks it got the better of McMurphy in One flew over the cuckoo's nest. We see and feel the overpowering and grey on grey prison. One of the most beautiful moments in the film and probably film history is Andy's statement that he had to come to prison to become a crook. The corruption within the large prison walls is carefully explored by Darabont.The only tragedy is that this film won 0 Oscars. A film with a plot that was flawless and stood the test of time. A film that was ahead of its time. At least the other biggest Oscar snub in history which occurred for Goodfellas at least resulted in one Oscar being claimed by the film. The Shawshank Redemption deserved to clean up at the Oscars.",Null,0,0,19 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not everyone's cup of tea
","Let me first say that the first time I watched Birdman I hated it and gave it a low rating on IMDb. However something didn't feel right and I felt I missed something. I watched it now a second time and have to say Birdman is a great movie. It is very well made and very distinctive but at the same time relatable. The film is about a faded actor whose best years are behind him and who seeks to make in Broadway on a different medium, theater. We get a unique and messy behind the scenes view of the dramas that come with hiring acclaimed actors and those close to you. However despite all these dramas the biggest fight is with himself, he has risked everything financially, professionally and personally. Michael Keaton proves his character and ironically himself as an actor are more than relevant with a great performance. The camera work, angles and shots were masterful. I love how the camera moves so loosely with the actors backstage to capture their intensity as it swerves left and right. The passage of time is done well as we effortlessly go from scene to scene. The unusual presence of drums also works well. The use of Birdman, his alter ego, represents his ambitions and visions of grandeur. Since he achieved great success in the past with Birdman, Birdman is a personification of his dream of success and greatness in his new venture. This is an unprecedented and great use of this alter ego in film and in my opinion the strongest part of the film. In reality we each have a Birdman of our own that represents our dreams of big and great achievement. The presence of superheroes in the film towards the end and the man of steel poster in the background outline the presence of superheroes. This why his Birdman worked so well because it was Michael Keaton's Birdman and with it he was a superhero who could fly. This prompts him to channel and 'listen' to Birdman when he goes all the way using a real gun. Just like the student, worker or sportsman goes out of their way and takes a leap when they are invested in their work so does Michael Keaton's actor in his final scene. I understand a number of people and their reviews attack Birdman but they may want to watch it again. The issue for most, including me, was people had a traditional mindset of film. They are used to classics that told coherent and structured stories but if you watch it with a different lens and see where it takes you you might change your vote. I adopted a different lens and appreciated it. There is definitely something to see in this film. It is not a piece of rubbish like Moonlight that asks to see something when nothing is there. To those who are confused with the end it's really not too hard. It was evident when Birdman was channelled in the film because we saw his alter ego Birdman and heard music. The scene where he flies to the theater is a good example because we see a cab driver running after him and can assume he took a cab all along. The same happens in the final scene. Notice that Emma Stone only looks temporarily at the ground before gazing upwards, normally everyone would look below. The purpose was she finally saw her father soar and fly and become a superhero of his own.",Null,0,1,2 April 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman hits it out of the park
","Wonder Woman was an exceptional film that highly exceeded expectations. From story line to acting and directing this film was perfectly executed. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine give stellar performances in this entertaining film. At the outset we see a world of gods and legend that coincides with the world we know. The film beautifully merges these two worlds in a way that makes it realistic and plausible. The story of Aries and his existence is well woven in the film and it pulls off a nice twist that explains him being the dark force behind war. Gal Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and brings back to life a heroine that has been absent for some time and buried under numerous superhero films. This film has its moments and does a marvelous job in living up to those moments accompanied by the right music. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine did an excellent job in bringing these moments to life. Thankfully an unnecessary and fully fledged romance was not used. It is as if Wonder Women exists firmly in its own universe and nicely executes its story without too much attention to other films or even a franchise, it exists in its own right. Perhaps that is a successful strategy in making films that are part of a series.When this film was first announced I was unsure about how it would perform. Batman vs Superman was a disappointment for many fans. We also had Wonder Woman in this film who seemed mysterious and possessed powers and tools most were unfamiliar with. Her fighting scenes left many asking how questions. This film explains this somewhat forgotten heroine with clarity. It is easily the most successful installment in the DC franchise. Thankfully Zac Synder was not the director and it shows because this was a very well made film. He should be prevented from making others and other directors should take the lead. Overall Wonder Woman has the right amount of intrigue, depth and uniqueness to make it a memorable superhero film. It should very well go down as one of the best Superhero films made in recent times.8.5/10",Null,6,15,13 June 2017
The Queen," Nothing more than a historical account of some of the darker days of the Queens legacy
",The Queen made a promising start but as time went on and each event or milestone was portrayed it lost its film appeal. It felt more like a BBC documentary special rather than a feature film. Ironically the use of archive footage from the news stations acted to affirm that idea. As tension mounts later in the film over the Crown's inaction the second half seems more like a chore than a film to enjoy. The beauty that lies in historical films is how the film delivers the finish or result even though you already knew the outcome.The acting was first class and probably the strongest aspect of the film. Helen Mirren was very worthy of her best actress win as one never doubts that she is the queen and Michael Sheen did an excellent job as Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Queen is worth a watch but one shouldn't have high expectations. 7/10,Null,0,2,25 June 2017

","This is a truly disturbed and terrible film. There is no real plot but just some sadistic moments. Why didn't you just make a porno? This was almost everything short of a porno without any real story. Most of us are adult enough to watch nudity within a broader and coherent film. In this case we have cheap nudity that pretends to have a story. Someone as sick as the male lead would never be in charge of such a large company, large companies are run by actual busy and hardworking adults.The writer of these books must be truly disturbed to write such worthless filth. The director of this rubbish is even more disturbed to adapt these books that are not good enough for toilet paper into a film. What is bewildering is the number of women that are into it. The female psyche will forever be an unending mystery.

The Dark Knight Rises," The best Batman film in Nolan's trilogy
","The Dark Knight Rises in my humble opinion is the best Batman film in the Dark Knight trilogy. It showcased a thrilling plot, an exceptional villain and epic moments throughout it. Watching it is a powerful experience, you are captivated from start to finish. Bane is an exceptional villain and one who jumps out at you from the screen. While being the most dominant villain Batman has faced to date he is also intelligent and resourceful. His purpose is not to just destroy Batman but Gotham city. He wants to bring fear and terror to the city. Note that while he uses his strength often he does not always use it, he is a calm and calculated villain who uses it when he needs to hence his power. Batman must not only dominate him physically but also take him on in a game of wits. Bruce/Batman's climb scene when he is in the pit has to be one of the greatest moments in cinema. The camera-work and techniques Nolan uses to build up Batman as he makes the climb so he can escape was a masterstroke and made this scene epic as he climbed the pit to the top. Nolan shows Bruce being attacked from all angles from losing his company, wealth, his batman legacy to a city he fought to protect. It is for these reasons that make Bane his greatest enemy and when he emerges from the pit he is the strongest Batman he has ever been. The twist was beautifully done and ties in well with the story. We see that perhaps there was another force in the dark behind the biggest and most challenging villain. It was a fitting and satisfying end to a very enjoyable and memorable film series.",Null,0,3,30 May 2017

The film definitely had its moments and plus points such as great CGI and effects. The fight scenes were a treat to watch and it had a great exotic feel to it. However the story was very predictable and linear in that there were no surprises and nothing too original. The villain, despite a likeable actor, was a weak and uninspired one. The son of traitor who trained in the army and has returned to take the throne. There was a lack of humor and hence the drama felt forced and weak.

","Creed 2 was a great and enjoyable film. It was a good story line to bring back Drago and have a match up to settle the score. The film was great in pace and intensity. Creed had a big foe to face just like Rocky did all those years and had things to prove, great to tie these legacies and stories together.It is no easy feat making a new Rocky film which is why this was well made. A number of previous Rocky installments had used various angles and stories but using the same formula would not work today. This was also not a simple good vs bad like Rocky 4. Depth and meaning was given to Drago about their loss and how making it in boxing was important to them as well which gave the film weight. Even the final fight was slightly different and showed some growth on the opposite side. For me the Rocky of the 80s will always be my favourite so it was great to see a new film pay homage and do a great job.Great film.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good moments but poor story line and execution
","I eagerly awaited this film, what could be better than seeing Superman and Batman face off. I was sadly disappointed. The fundamental flaw with this film is director Zac Snyder strives to create moments in the film rather than focus on a coherent set of scenes and story line. We some great moments and photography such as Bruce visiting his parents grave but these moments lack gravitas and substance because we haven't seen the journey to that moment. A good story line and powerful scenes can build up to an epic moment in the film. The audience will understand it and feel it because it has geared towards this moment through well acted scenes and stories. This why I felt the film was disjointed because it lacked sufficient scenes and executed story line to arrive at epic moments. Moments don't exist by themselves, they are the result of key scenes woven together. Synder does not seem to follow this concept and hence we saw a disjointed film that received a mixed reaction. It is sad to see DC be humbled and dominated so much by the Marvel universe that has created many characters people connect with. DC has created distant characters. Zac Snyder should be replaced in making these films by another director as Man of Steel had the same formula like this film.",Null,0,1,8 April 2017
The Greatest Showman," Enjoyable film
","Out of all the films to come out I was most excited to see the greatest showman. The film was entertaining and showcased some great singing but this was at the expense of a plot which felt a bit thin. There were a bit too many musical numbers that took away precious time from a plot, a deep plot even that this film was capable of. Also the side plot with P T and his affair with the American singer was unnecessary and took the film in different directions. One could not tell whether this was about P.T or the perils of introducing the first circus itself. Nevertheless, it somewhat undermined the perils of the circus and its unique performers. This I feel was the films main attraction. Some creative and careful rewriting and directing could have made this an iconic film.

","Many of us consider Marry Poppins a classic, one that has endured and still entertains audiences today. Saving Mr Banks takes an interesting look at the author behind Mary Poppins and the film adaption. Not many would be familiar with the background and difficult personality of the author. We also learn the inspiration behind the timeless classic. The film excels in getting you to dislike and maybe even hate Emma Thompson's character, P. L. Travers. She is disagreeable, stubborn and peculiar. Even though she is in need of income to save her home she is not willing to make a deal until all her demands are met. One important demand is the absence of animation which is central to many Disney films. Over the course of the film she warms up to the writers and Walt Disney who write the songs that we all know and love. When she cancels the deal and flies back to the U.K. she is visited again by none other than Walt Disney. We learn that her hopes for the film as in the books were not to save the children but their father which fictitiously based on her father. Mary Poppins was the nanny who saved everything that her real nanny or aunt could not do in her life. She lost her father as shown in her flashbacks. The real reason behind this classic creation endears her to the audience as we are told Mr Banks will be not just be saved he will be honored. While Mary Poppins brought joy to many to many children's lives the author also sought to bring joy and solace to her inner child and fathers memory. Excellent acting from Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Thompson who deliver star performances.",Null,0,0,5 March 2017

Pitch Perfect," An enjoyable film but had the potential to be great
","Pitch Perfect is surprisingly a good film. It certainly hits the ground running from the start by introducing us to the world of Capella singing and the prestigious prize groups compete for. The singing is very good, it includes both old and new music. However older music would have been better than a rendition of modern beats we call music. Viewers are treated to some exceptional singing throughout the film as the groups sometimes show it is effortless for them to sing. The humor is also not bad and lightens up the film.What brings this film down is the romance. Not only was it dull it was completely unnecessary. It completely holds back this film from being a great and deeper film with great music thrown in. The Breakfast Club is a classic that explored certain themes in a simply way and it was referred to now and then but Pitch Perfect failed to come up to that level. It was brought down by a cheesy, light headed and silly romance. Instead of realizing the potential to make an artistic and well thought of movie, what was below the belt guided a big part of the film. Anna Kendrick was also an unlikable character who seemed spoilt and uncaring for others. Once again if the romance was dropped and more focus was on character development or other deeper themes this movie would have soared. Overall an enjoyable movie with great singing and performances.

",Matrix is quite a dull and uninspired film. It was quite boring to watch and contained no groundbreaking notions or idea. It is a film that has done well due to the time it was released. Had it been made and released today it would receive a fraction of its hype or praise.,Null,1,1,7 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A product of its time. A classic
","When Star Wars came out in 1977 there was nothing like it, it came out of nowhere and was so different. It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era. As a film it is very simple and easy to follow. There are no big twists, dilemmas and the good forces come on top. The special effects and film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements. Darth Vader, the army of storm troopers and the mighty light saber is unlikely to be forgotten. Star Wars as a franchise clearly benefited from coming out at the right time, this was the day before competitive television, streaming services or films like Inception. The immortality of Star Wars lies in its simplicity, linear story and vast imagination. This appealed to millions of kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series.",Null,3,3,20 February 2018
Get Him to the Greek," Ridiculous and funny thanks to Jonah
",This was surprisingly funny for quite a few parts. I don't care much for Russell Brand but the funny Jonah Hill carries it home. He is truly funny and has proven this in many films. While Russell Brand is the Kardashian of film (exists with no good purpose) Jonah enhances its comedic value. The two make a good combo in this film. Some over the top scenes are handled well and it takes some alright direction to make a doable trip full of drugs and crazy behaviour. Not too bad.,Null,0,0,12 May 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Nothing special and fails to impress
","Kingsman is a very unimpressive and dull film. The only things going for this film are the eye candy and good actors (Firth and Samuel L Jackson) that attempt to carry this poor film. It barely passes and is not worth the time.This should be a good film to immature, undeveloped teenagers who are amateur film goers. Otherwise for the rest this should be a bit of a disappointment. Some have even tried to compare or 'link' it to James Bond, this has to be the greatest insult to make this comparison. This film is ions or planets from the acclaimed film series and 007. If you went to watch this film in the theaters you may have a strong case for demanding your money back.",Null,3,5,8 February 2017
Green Book," Great film and worthy of it's Best Picture win
","Green Book is a captivating film that contains the right amount depth, story and humour. It is then delivered well by outstanding performances. A beautiful story is told here. It is one of unique friendship in tough and unsettling times. Two different people from different worlds collide and form a bond. The beauty of a film is it doesn't try too hard to sell its message it effortlessly delivers it, you just have to join the Doctor and Tony for the ride. Every few years a few great films are produced and Green Book is one of them.This journey and film started with the two both agreeing it was important to do every tour. At the last tour they are able to walk away from it when they realise the tour and contract was not so important anymore.8.5/10",Null,1,3,17 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Not all that bad
","The Empire Strikes Back is not all that bad and has its moments. Once again a simple film which is easy to follow. I can see why a lot of kids, probably 10-12 year olds or even younger loved theses films as there was nothing like it at the time. It would also appeal to many sections of the public as harder or more intellectual films often divide their audiences. Star Wars is quite simple and never goes over your head which is why many children and many adults as well like it It is quite amusing to note that one of the most quoted lines in movie history is actually incorrect. Darth Vader actually says 'No I am your Father' in reply to Luke protesting otherwise. However so many fans have got this wrong, even in films and shows that reference Star Wars.",Null,2,3,20 February 2018
Her," Creative and ahead of its time
",This was a great and creative film. I love it when Hollywood produces creative and futuristic movies that stretch the imagination. This is true of Her where a romance begins with an Operating system and a man. Once you understand the world they live in and the setting a romance in this world is not so far fetched and quite interesting to watch. Artificial intelligence has reached a new level and can relate to us. This film includes some great performances and can be quite sentimental. Definitely recommended and hope more films of this type are made in the future. 7.5/10.,Null,0,1,12 May 2017
Slumdog Millionaire," Terrible film, disgrace to Hollywood and film
","How can this film be described? A number of things pop up quickly such as Inaccurate and Exaggerated. The plot just like the portrayal of India is completely unrealistic While film has the ability to be imaginative and creative it should never cross the line where it insults the viewers intelligence. And boy does it insinuate a lot. We have to believe that some person from a poor background has a memory that just so happens to answer every question in Millionaire. First the movie puts down a great country and people who do not have very good lives and then it is plausible for this person to know all the answers because he has 'experienced' life. Unless he is similar to Michael Ross from Suits and has a photographic memory this is ludicrous.This movie portrays a flawed but beautiful country in a very poor and negative light. It focuses on the negative aspects of India such as its poverty and sadly that is all we see. However in reality Mumbai has a number of beautiful parts and in certain areas it is quite heavenly. A number of key settings and themes is completely exaggerated. Bribery does exist in government but this is mostly at an administrative level, where a 'gift' can expedite something. Slums are a problem and exist on the outskirts of the city - very important to note. Over time they developed as a result of people with no education, prospects or savings who started living on the outer side of the big city because they found it hard to earn a living. Sadly India does not have welfare or assistance in the commercial and capitalist capital of the country. They lived illegally and still do on city grounds and rake in income by an means possible, sadly this involves having many children to beg for money. As you can imagine this behavior has compounded and out of control but - not a central part of the city. Slums and slum live is not Mumbai or India and is a lie in film to show a country exists in this state. What is disheartening is Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto and the Indian production staff who exploited their own country and they know is a lot better for some Hollywood stardom. When you have cowardice and people with no backbone within the country what do you expect? They were too happy to serve India's head on a platter to a Western audience that is constantly happy to see poverty and sadness in other countries to feel better about themselves. An audience that would like to see differences of a third world so they can ignore the shortcomings in their own backyard which is why this film was well received, lets not deny it.This movie showed waste in India but the real waste is the film itself. It is a disgrace to a great nation, a lie broadcast to Hollywood and an over exaggerated movie. I think I can pin point when the Academy awards lost its credibility.",Null,6,9,5 February 2017
The Nice Guys," A decent laugh
","This was not a bad film, Crowe and Gosling make an unlikely and charismatic duo. The supporting cast does well, especially Gosling's daughter who holds her own against the two stars. Criticisms are the confusion around the story and murder. The plot has a few holes and doesn't flow so well. Your still piecing together what actually happened and why. When you do get some sort of picture it doesn't really make sense. This film's strong points are its comedy and delivery. It excels with its funny moments and the two male leads have great personalities that work well together. Overall not a bad flick, I'd recommend it for a laugh but don't have high expectations.",Null,0,1,4 June 2017
Gladiator," An epic film like no other
","Gladiator is a great experience to the film viewer. It is a beautiful and well told story that keeps you intrigued and at the edge of your seat from start to finish. A great cast, story, visual effects and soundtrack are the right ingredients for this iconic film. The story is simply mesmerizing and beautifully told of a respected General who became a slave, who became a Gladiator, and, who then won the praise of many and defied the evil emperor. Just as the spectators in the Coliseum cheer for Maximus so does the viewer as you support his vengeance and justice. Justice against an evil Emperor who killed his family and wants to prevent a Rome governed by the people. The dream that was once Rome as envisioned by his great late father is pushed aside for his selfish wishes. The fights he organizes in the Coliseum are to distract the people as he knows too well that Rome is not the Emperor or the Senate but the mob. Little does he know that soon Maximus will return as a Gladiator to defy him and win the praise of the mob.The final moments are simply masterful. The scene showing Gladiator about to be reunited with his wife and son in the next life and him reaching out to this before he falls is probably one of the best scenes in film history. The soundtrack is simply epic and transports you easily to a time when Gladiators battled in ancient Rome. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with his work and it works perfectly with some great scenes.Russell Crowe's Gladiator won the hearts of many in the film as I am sure this film won the hearts of many of its viewers.",Null,1,1,28 March 2017
The Great Gatsby," Good but could have been great
",I quite enjoyed the Great Gatsby but felt it had all the ingredients to be a classic and these ingredients were not all used. Leonardo gives a great performance as Gatsby and so does the rest of the cast. The cinematography was outstanding and made the film alluring and graceful. However better direction could have made the film more dramatic. Perhaps the film could have been arranged differently with the use of voice overs or other techniques to heighten some parts and not others. The Great Gatsby is a classic novel but bringing it to life in a different medium is a different story altogether. Still a great watch and entertaining.,Null,0,0,12 May 2017

Valkyrie," Great war film
","I really enjoyed this film. Tom Cruise gives a great performance in a thrilling film that plotted the demise of Hitler. The film also cast light on the fact that not all Germans, including high ranking officers, wanted Hitler in power. The beauty of this film is that despite knowing the outcomes of this period in history you are still on the edge of your seat. For a brief moment you might even expect or hope for the plot to succeed. The film also begs the question of what could have been had it succeeded.",Null,0,1,30 May 2017
Up in the Air," Dull and uninspiring
",Up in the Air couldn't be a more fitting title because that's where this film's story and direction lie up in the air with no grounding. It lacks any proper story. It's as if a bunch of talented actors were thrown in a film with a story written last minute. Struggling to see what the takeaway of this film is. At first I thought it was a cheesy deadpan romance but even that was taken away last minute. The only saving grace is the strong performances from George Clooney who is good as always. A 23rd old Anna Kendrick is also quite good as is Vera Famiga. Yet this film is a boring and dragged on mess.,Null,0,0,8 May 2020

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not too bad
",This film is definitely entertaining and has some good laughs. Will Ferrell excels at what he's good at which is over the top characters and that style of comedy.
