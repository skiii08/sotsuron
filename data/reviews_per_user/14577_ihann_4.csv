Antz," A review of all political models
","That movie is amazing. When I went to the movies to see Antz (8 years a go), I expect to enjoy a movie for children. There wasn't the time of Incredibles, Shrek or Madagascar, movies that parents an children enjoy together. But Antz was really a surprise in it time. There wasn't just animated ants with the voices of famous stars, there were characters in the fight for the prevalence of their ideologist... Yes!!! this is not a joke... is true!!! In this movie the audience can see a Kingdoom, then an state in emergency, then a dictator and then a democracy... and all the tricks and strategies necessaries to win. Antz has all the elements that we can see in other animated movies, but I think that was the first one to introduce elements that only adults can understand.",9,0,0,13 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Why is this movie a revolution?
","Yes, maybe my comment will surprise to the readers, but I'm going to be sincere and say just that I saw, excluding the golden globes and the Oscar nominations. Brokeback Mountain for me is a good movie, but is not a cinematography success. The direction is great, the cast was good, the ambientation is good too, but the script is not different to other love stories except for the homosexual relation. That I try to explain is that if it wasn't a love story between men, nobody will talk about this movie. So what are we trying to project if homosexual relationships are seen like a normal thing in these days... what's is the sensational thing of this movie? Sometimes slow, sometimes boring... I'm just an objective spectator, and I din't find nothing extraordinary here.",6,2,29,1 March 2006
Psycho," Just the best
","There is a before and after of this movie in the history of movies. Hithcook may be the director with more 'new things' in his time. Is difficult to know how big could be he now in this special effects time. Psycho is a perfect combination of a great director, a great cast and a great script. Perkins makes his best job in this movie. Norman Bates is a legend. A lot of people did not see Psycho but everybody knows who is Norman Bates. The movie has a lot of symbols and the music is the best. Hitch confirms in this movie that good actors and good staff is enough to make a good movie. North by Northwest was excellent, but it cost 3 or 4 times more than Psycho. It is more than a cult film. Psycho is really a masterpiece. Psycho is a movie that you can watch 20 times and every time that you see it, found new elements. Is full of details. The subliminal presence of the mother figure is present in all the movie. The color of the under ware of Marion changes to black after she left the town trying to express that she feels dirty. And the scene of the bath... is maybe the most famous scene in the history... is difficult to perceive after that yo never saw a naked body and never so a knife inside of the victim. But during the sequence you're sure that it is happening. Psycho is magic... is a lesson to everyone who loves movies. I think that is necessary to watch this movie before to comment another one.",10,1,1,22 December 2005
Wedding Crashers," Very funny
","Yes... it was a very funny movie. At times I could forget problems and just laugh. Owen Wilson was great and Vaughn found his target. I hated him for a lot of years after his sacrilegious interpretation of Norman Bates, but now I can understand. He was born for comedies. He is one of that comedians like Buster... they make you laugh but looks always angry. I'm not going to stop in details like script mistakes. Perhaps my congratulations to the edition work... but I think that this movie wasn't made to analyze, it was made just to enjoy and everybody in the cinema did it. I didn't see anybody after the movie without a smile and that is enough to say that is a good work.... sorry director... congratulations too.",7,1,1,27 December 2005
