10 Cloverfield Lane," Derailed Writing
","I will not spoil the ending of this movie in this review. I will, however, tell you that the ending will leave you extremely disappointed. 85% of this movie is absolutely brilliant. Its pleasantly unpredictable and if you enjoy psychological suspense, you will enjoy this much of the movie. It was on the road to receive 10 out of 10 stars. The writing and acting were both brilliant on every level. Then... out of nowhere ... and I mean literally out of nowhere, the movie goes to crap. You will know it as soon as you see it as though its a sign from the heavens. The writers decided to not only change the direction of the movie, but the genre of the movie. While some would call this brilliant, most would argue that those people are smoking something and ruined their movie. I spent hours pondering what could have possessed these people to end this movie the way in which they did and the answer has not reached me. All that I can do is write this movie review in hopes that I save people like me in search of good writing in movies in a time period in which its hard to come by. I have also taken the liberty of writing my own ending to appease myself and my significant other in a sort of fan fiction type of way.In conclusion, rating this movie was so difficult because I felt like I was rating two different movies. The majority of the movie gets a solid 10 stars. The ending gets a very flawed 2 stars. As I said, not only was the ending terrible but it was cheesy as well. When I weighed the ratings together, I originally gave this movie a 6 out 10 stars but that's just too high for a movie that ends this poorly.",4,2,4,12 February 2017
If I Stay," Take My Man-card
","If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be the word 'Breathtaking'. The movie itself was nothing spectacular compared to any Nicolas Sparks-like movie. There were no fancy effects, no extraordinary performances, and no unbelievable moments of suspense (like mission impossible; tom cruise hanging off a building). However, the storyline is what made this movie. We meet a young lady who is going through something life changing over the course of the movie. We flip back and forth between the present and the flashbacks of her life leading up to where she is today. Throughout both, you will cry your eyes out (man or woman). I must have cried at least 3 times as this movie pulled on my heartstrings time and again. You will find yourself in a whole mess of emotions and will require a sort of sugary comfort food or a snuggle buddy with whom you can watch the film. It is difficult to watch in some places, but as you reach the ending you feel this amazing sense of satisfaction that many movies these days just don't give you. I could only applaud for the ending of this film. The only reason this film doesn't hit a 10 out of 10 for me is because its a full-blown chick flick with a ton of drama.",9,0,0,26 March 2016
Creed," My Movie of the Year
","I am a pessimistic and heavily critical human being. With that in mind, I want the readers of this review to realize that this movie is still one of the best movies that were released in 2015. If I were responsible for giving out a movie of the year award, I would hand it to this movie (though 'The Martian' is a more complete movie and a close second to this one). This is not 'just another Rocky movie'. Instead, the focus shifts onto a man developing into his prime as realizes the legacy of the father that he never knew. Ironically, of course, everyone else is awe-struck by his parentage because of the great man that our main character's father was in life. There are plenty of Easter Eggs for those of you who are Rocky fans and want to reminisce in nostalgic memories of the Italian stallion! I will say that Rocky is no longer the man that we all remember him to be as old age has caught up with him and all of the other characters we knew and loved have passed away. This movie is emotionally moving, action packed, and it does justice to the Rocky movies. More so, this movie instills ideal values as it goes along and teaches the viewer that 'yes life sucks, but you can choose to look life in the eyes and punch it back.' Definitely worth the watch! I hope you enjoy!",8,1,4,20 December 2015
Justice League," Primitive at Best
","Marvel fans will like it. Thats all I need to say. Disappointed that DC decided to abandon their darker atmosphere to try to appeal to the crowd but I guess you have to make money somehow. The Good: Superman's few scenes are excellent. The Flash, with whom I have never identified, was the best thing about the movie. First time big picture embodiment of Aquaman and Mera is surreal. The Bad: The story-line was average at best. I understand this is just a set up movie which is the only reason I gave it something as high as a 6. The writing and acting were not good. The Ugly: The CGI special effects in comparison to Man of Steel and BVS were incredibly bad to the point where it added a thin layer of cheese similar to that of Wonder Woman. Overall: Huge disappointment.",6,16,29,16 November 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Extended Version Shuts Haters Up
","When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: 'Pick up a comic book!' Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!",9,28,40,21 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney Fail
","Does anyone remember when Star Wars was first purchased by Disney and the reaction was less than positive? Well there was a reason for that. I bring you back to modern day in which Disney released their new kid- friendly version of Star Wars. As a major lore buff, I for one was not pleased and if you have read any books or know something beyond the movies you will not be pleased either. I will go over 4 main points that will enlighten you as to why you should save your movie money for an extra Christmas gift this year: 1) Disney's Star Wars is cheesy. VERY cheesy. The acting is not great (on exception of the lovely leading lady who did an excellent job in a terrible role). There are plenty of unexplained and unnecessary points that fail connect. I believe this can be attributed to the movie being aimed at a younger audience. While it is rated PG-13, the only reason is because there is tiny little bit of blood. I would take a five year old to this movie. *points beyond here contain MINOR spoilers that will not give away anything of significance*2) Darth Gollum. Andy Serkis (well know for his role as Gollum in the LOTR) plays a supposedly evil character which really felt more like a dark side jar-jar binks for me. He looks and sounds like Gollum. He is supposed to be a mastermind behind this illegitimate faction that copied the Empire and built a super death-star which is basically less than unexplained before it meets a similar fate to the first two death stars. 3) Does something seem familiar about this film? Yes? Oh well that is because they stole the plot line of a New Hope and added their own twists to it. Same movie, different names. No really. Id list the points here but for those of you who choose to see it, I would rather not give away big spoilers. 4) They kill off someone (no I will not say who) that they CAN'T kill off. That is all I can say about it. You will understand if you are a lore buff. That is all. Don't waste your time. Revenge of the Sith was still better.",6,16,33,19 December 2015
