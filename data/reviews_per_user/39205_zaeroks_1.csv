Requiem for a Dream," Amazing. Just amazing.
","This movie really got my heart pumping. It's a ride through hope, succes, defeat and dispair. It visualizes 4 people and their ways of living lives and living them with drugs. The soundtrack is brilliant, the pictures are amazing. Aronofsky has made himself an own style of movie-making and I like it. And I'm sure you will too.Rent the movie and watch it. then go out and buy the DVD and Soundtrack like I did.",10,0,1,11 November 2002
