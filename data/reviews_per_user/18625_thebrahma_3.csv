Avatar," 9 stars for FX -4 stars from the story line
","Some of the movie was WOW, and some was a disappointmentAt least the 3D version was hard to watch in some places. But the FX in the movie was awesome, would give 9 stars from that. Sadly the story did not hit me that well and I have to take 4 stars away because of that. Worth to look, but it amazes me if this movie was so expensive, how the story was not better. It was almost 3 hours, it went by, but I tell most of things what was going to happen in the movie when it played... it was so predictable.So no surprises there... 5 out of 10...",5,6,17,18 December 2009
