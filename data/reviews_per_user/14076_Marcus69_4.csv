Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No longer a Star Wars fan now
","This was positively the worst movie I have seen in quite some time.  It is very unfortunate that Lucas let this get through the editing process. Some decent special effects, but they were so blatently computer generated that it detracted from the movie.  The acting was ok.  The light-saber fight scenes were good, but Jackie Chan is at least 20 times better at choreographing fight scenes.  I will never again watch this one, and probably will write off the next 2.  I am hoping that the third trilogy follows the Heir to the Empire books, even a bad director could make those books shine.  All in all, I must give it two thumbs down.  I wish it was better, but it really was the biggest disappointment I've had in a long time.",2,0,1,25 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," For a good laugh!!!
","There is more farting in this movie than a movie about intestinal problems! You will laugh at the non PC way this movie does it thing.  You'll only want to see it once though. It is not a movie per se, it should be classified as a musical 'cos more than 50% is the characters singing.  Even the devil has a song. If you feel strong about racism, don't see this movie....m'kay",Null,0,0,7 September 1999
The Mummy," Awesome and then some, Best movie of the Summer
","Words won't do it justice.  Five minutes into this movie, I could tell the special effects would put the new star wars to shame.  And it did!  The effects alone were enough to make me want to see it again.  The characters were well played, and the humour was put in at the right times.  Some good stunts and fight scenes too!  Jackie Chan would like this movie. The sandstorm scene is out of this world.  When the plane dives behind the mountain, and the storm rises from behind, damn! To all those who canned this movie: come on, I have yet to see another movie this year, besides Tarzan, that I would really want to see again.  starwars was so abominable, that I won't even see the next one... This movie is a must see on the big screen, see you there. Enjoy",10,0,0,7 September 1999
The Waterboy," Forest Gump remake fails to make it to Sandler standards
","I can't believe Sandler allowed this movie to go to the theatres like it is. After seeing all of his other movies, I expected quite a bit more from him and his script.  When I heard that it was a take-off of Forest Gump, I thought it would be much more funny and entertaining, and definitely not as stupid as it turned out to be.  Bummer!  I'm sure his next film will be better, but I might wait until it hits the dollar movies just in case.",5,1,1,18 November 1998
