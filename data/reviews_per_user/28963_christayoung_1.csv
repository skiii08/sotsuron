The New World," Cinematography certainly is good, but story handled poorly
","The characters were not well developed and there was entirely too much walking around, looking at the ground and not enough dialogue to maintain audience interest. Over fifty people walked out of the theater before the movie was half over. The music in spots was out of place and became irritating. The acting was mediocre, at best. There was much Indian conversation and so few subtitles, one had a hard time understanding what was going on. So little historical information was given, one had to work way too hard to figure out the plot. A great concept for a story, but not handled as well as it might have been. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone. The reviews I read left me confused as to whether or not the reviewers actually saw the movie. The one complement I can offer is that there was no profanity or explicit sex and that was refreshing.",2,2,6,26 January 2006
