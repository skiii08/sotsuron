Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino - multifacted film maker
","Here we are, rejoining The Bride's vengeful journey to take down all of her former colleagues who attempted to kill her at the wedding chapel in El Paso.  However, Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a very different movie from Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  We are brought back into the story with The Bride (Uma Thurman) speaking directly to us as she is driving the final leg of her quest to Kill Bill, which she assures us is exactly what will happen when she gets there. Mr. Tarantino then takes us back to that fateful day at the wedding chapel that set all of this violence, vengeance and viciousness in motion.  We do not, however, re-live the actual massacre but, instead, are treated to a tense, frighteningly calm and also sweetly emotional exchange between The Bride and Bill before the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad stroll in and eliminate the entire wedding party.  This opening chapter and Tarantino's restraint show us one of the striking ways that this movie differs from the first Volume.Quentin Tarantino has given us two very different movie-going experiences, yet they are very clearly telling different portions of the same story. Volume 1 gave us The Bride's initial sound and fury after waking from her coma, finding her baby lost and lighting out to exact her revenge on those responsible.  We were given a violent and over the top fight movie as she battles her way forward.  Volume 2 gives us the other side of Tarantino's storytelling.  This film is much more about emotion and character and dialogue.  One of the consistent elements that make Tarantino films more than just violent play toys is the dialogue that he writes.  Whether it is Steve Buscemi expounding on why he doesn't tip, John Travolta discussing the intimate nature of a foot massage, or Darryl Hannah discussing the abilities of a snake, Quentin always gives us dialogue that is fuller and contains more than a standard conversation would normally have and yet does not feel false or contrived.  It always fits naturally within the context of the scene and the characters.Another of the elements that make Tarantino's films unique is the way that he films using different styles and formats within one film.  This not only pays homage to the styles of the past but also keeps the audience just a little off balance and thus the scenes have even more impact on nearly a subliminal level.  It makes you adjust and start paying attention again at each change, ensuring that each section of the film gets full attention. Not only does his filming style in this movie harken back to the Chinese Kung Fu movies of the past, but he also pays respect to them by having the fight scenes beautifully choreographed.  In Volume 2, he even keeps those scenes very short and intense, as opposed to the elaborate and lengthy fights that we witnessed in Volume 1.  In Vol. 2, the scenes are absolutely necessary but they are not central to the film.Quentin has another hit on his hands and this time he should not have to suffer the critics that pull out their stock comments about too much violence, blood and foul language.  Hopefully, this time a reviewer or two will actually see the intricate film making, thoughtful dialogue and well developed characters that Quentin has created.",Null,0,1,14 April 2004
