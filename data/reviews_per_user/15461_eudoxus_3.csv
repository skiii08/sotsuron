The Blair Witch Project," Wait until you can rent it.
","I finally saw this film, after hearing much about it from my friends. Everyone I talked to loved the film, so I am afraid that my expectations were a little high.If you've been told that the hand-held camera might cause motion sickness, believe it. I had a splitting headache by the end. If you tend to get motion sickness, you may wish to avoid this film.The Blair Witch Project represents the maximum result with a minimum budget. Unlike many low-budget films, it stays within its means. The film could not have been improved by putting more money into it. The acting was likewise very good.I'm not sure, however, that this was cut out to be a feature film. At 80 minutes it falls well short of full-length, but it felt more like 100 or 110 to me. The dialogue was repetitive, but little could be done to vary it. I would have enjoyed the film far more if it were 60 minutes. And maybe paired with another shorter film.I would also recommend not viewing this in the theater. The picture is filmed completely on videotape and 16mm, so the wide screen gives you no advantage. Unlike most horror films, The Blair Witch Project uses no shocking visual effects to frighten the audience. I found it difficult to be frightened by pure suspense in a crowded theater. The imagination runs much more freely at home. I reserve final judgement on this one until I've seen it after midnight at a party with just a couple friends in a house in the middle of nowhere. . .",7,1,1,31 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bit of a disappointment
","Although this was a reasonably good film, it was not nearly as good as it could have been. The first Star Wars film was very good, but they have been going downhill since. My biggest problem with episode I was Jar Jar. I couldn't concentrate on the film because all I could think of was 'Wow, is that guy ever annoying.' The acting was for the most part poor, but I doubt that the actors are to blame. It is difficult to act when so much is missing because it is to be created digitally later. The actors had to deal with missing sets, props, and even characters. The dialogue was often very choppy, apparently not from bad acting, but from bad editing. The best performance was by Ewan MacGregor. I had reservations about his part, since he doesn't look much like Alec Guinness, but he made up for it by making his voice sound like Guinness's. Although the digital sets were very effective, the characters looked a little too deliberate to be believable. This is, however, still new technology, and it might be a while before we see it work just right. I'm looking forward to Episode II, hopefully the makers will pay attention to complaints about Episode I.",7,0,1,1 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Surprising
","Although I was used to hearing really bad broadway-style songs on the tv show, I didn't expect the film to be an all-out musical. The numbers were quite good, and some of the composition was actually very good. For instance, listen for the battle scene where the songs from earlier are mixed together. I had the tunes in my head for weeks. Believe it or not, the animation seemed better to me in the film than in the tv show. Watch for the flames especially.",7,2,2,1 September 1999
