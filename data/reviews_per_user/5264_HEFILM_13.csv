Hereditary," FULCI LIVES
","And if you don't know why I say that you need to see some films directed by Italian writer director Lucio Fulci. Not that you have to know that to enjoy=be scared by it.Now you should be warned going in that crazy and illogical behavior and a sullen grieving family are hard to 'warm' up to, but thanks to good performances, I and I think, you'll stay with it and much will be explained if you are patient enough to go along for the scary crazy ride that follows.Yes maybe it goes on a little too long but it does build well and though at times it could go off the rails and become silly it stays just this side to remain horror.An audience helps it, as I saw it with a pretty full house of people who were definitely into the movie reacting nervously and in dread in the right spots.This doesn't transcend the genre, I would stop short of saying the film has much to say outside the usual, but unusually effective, supernatural playing field the film remains within.There are however some mother, child, tensions that resonate--if also test reality. The son character in particular could get silly but works thanks to acting and atmosphere.Certainly a significant horror film because it know how to play by the rules and make them work--lessons many pretender horror films fail to do.Effective music and ironic use of a semi famous ballad for the end credits help a lot. Two lead females characters hold it all together along with the photography and direction. Does get gorey at times--nothing wrong with that CGI elements are well done when they need to be.",8,11,20,16 June 2018
Public Enemies," Nothing much
","In the last few minutes there are a few minor things not in the other better and much shorter Dillinger films made. Minor meaning for instance that the famous woman in red was wearing a different color. Does that make it worth the 2 hours you have to spend to get to that moment? No. These tiny new things don't affect the basic story that's been done better almost every single time it's been done before in various formats.Attempts to make Dillinger into some kind of true love story aren't convincing and slow the story down.Though many names are dropped of other gangster pals in the film none are explained in a way that will make any sense to someone who isn't a big Gangster buff already. The whole thing feels like a cliffnotes version of a story that then you take the test and find out all the questions on the test aren't in your cliffnotes that you wasted time reading.There are many but not no exciting shoot outs in this film and in between not much that tells you anything deeper about Purvis or Dillinger other than the failed attempt to make Dillinger out as a one woman man--which by the end it's clear he isn't.Recreations of some of the scenes at the real locations again may be fun for the buff, but recreation is a good word it all feels passionless and dry. The shooting on HD and the style of the audio even seems dank thin and slip shod. Perhaps an attempt to have some documentary energy to the film. It has none, the HD is murky frequently you can't see into the actors eyes and most of the night and action footage looks like home movie material. Very little music and then rather ponderous music where you don't need it. Director of photography has worked with Mann before but seems to have no sense of how to make HD look good. If you ever wonder what THE GODFATHER would look like shot on HD here it is and it's a contrasty unforgiving look with some green tones and total blackness and blown out video look coming and going. HD, this time, is not up the the job for this high contrasty look.Depp doesn't make much of an impression, Bale comes off better but he's not even in the film for the long mounts of time that are spent on the non love story aspects. It sort of seems that Purvis story would have been more interesting, or at least more of him to balance out the story.Not as ugly look visually that Miami Vice had in director Mann's hands but this is a way long shallow slog and frankly pretty dull movie. Really poorly editing and oddly shot; it's a mix of hand held and locked down shots that don't justify either use or cut together well.Warren Oates starring version remains the best by far.",3,0,0,23 January 2010
Nacho Libre," has some charm can seem forced
","This is, in a way, a bit too slick for it's own good, being essentially a parody of South of the Border Masked wrestling hero movies. It plays it just straight enough to be a bit tedious and there are cartoony sound FX that clutter up the start of the film in a way that makes you worried until the charms help make up for it.The problem is the comedy is either really obvious--those sound FX, or the parody so muted that it sort of strides along at middle speed never gaining speed or laughs while always being a bit diverting.But it's sort of seedy in a way that seems kind of true to life and part of the real world, rather than taking place in the fake sets and lovable cheapness of real Masked wrestling movies. And can you parody something that's goofy to begin with? Jack Black shows his willingness to look fat and silly at his own expense, this helps you route for him to win the day, and come on this is a comedy that plays it safe to the definition of comedy so the story certainly, aside from quirky moments, plays it really by the numbers. Regardless, and the musical theme song for Black's character helps this, you are satisfied, even touched, by the way things turn out even though you know that's exactly how they will turn out pretty much from the start.Too bad they didn't play it a little more wild and loose with reality, or give the story some edge. Still sort of a risky movie for Black to agree to make,and maybe the type that can only be made at the height of an actors popularity when they can make anything they want. Though one hopes Black doesn't go the career and life path of John Belushi and Chris Farley, and to a lesser extent John Candy, with films that are essentially watch-the-fat-guy-be-abused-and-look-gross, type affairs.Whatever you may expect, don't expect a laugh a second gross out comedy. That's not where the movie's head and heart are at. If you look at it that way you may well get the most out of it. Both a worthwhile little film and one that should have been better. Forget the forced advertizements and sit down and give it a chance and you won't feel you totally wasted your time. The too few quirky moments may stick with you after you forget the clich√© elements that drag it down. Odd, downright ugly looking supporting characters help out in this regard. There are definitely outside the mainstream elements, just not quite enough and just not enough truly funny comedy either to make it a total succcess.",6,0,2,29 June 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills Have Boredom
","A really cool precredit sequence and title sequence set you up for a long long wait until there are any real scares in this film. The 'normal' family characters are, like the original films, pretty hard to be with, they bicker and nag each other and are generally unappealing and with not much going on it's a pretty tough sit. Nice locations adequately filmed helps as do some nice, matte painting style CG elements. But there just isn't much going on other than a few fake scares and a not very good dead dog prop. Then suddenly lots of stuff goes on, none of it very coherently staged, then another lag. The night photography is kind of grainy and occasionally even slightly bluish in a, not exposed right, kind of way. The whole thing sticks relatively close to the original, the makeup work is uneven--rubbery looking with blood that looks like candy--and just nothing in this remake is very thrilling or horrifying. The characters, both good and evil keep the plot going long after it should have ended by doing stupid things and you don't get any sense of the mutant family as to size or does the film offer much in the way of interesting mutant family behavior. Their home is cool when you see it, but what goes on inside isn't interesting. During one fight scene the one mutant seems to be more interested in chopping up the cool set than actually chopping up the good guy, who could easily be chopped to death many many times. Retro bad music doesn't help, but the film isn't too much in the jump cutty style that is so trendy--though that might have helped.I suppose some of the shocks work if you haven't seen the original but this film lacks the rough edge that made that rough violence more convincing. Given the number of torture and violence films lately there's nothing here that you haven't seen done better in SAW or the like.The audience I saw the film with opening weekend grumbled and scoffed loudly at the non ending and shuffled out bitching about the film. All and all a pointless remake, there are lots of those, but this one is just dull and dumb aside from a few sparks of strong production design the movie doesn't show much competence or feel for the material.Anyone who finds this film overly shocking really needs to either see more movies or just stay home. This film offers nothing of much note in the shock and gore department.",2,1,4,12 March 2006
Batman Begins," New problems begin, does that make it better?
","It does take a really really long time for Batman to appear as such in this film. The serious and dark theme of the movie 'fear' is really hammered into the ground. The word 'fear' must be used at least 50 times in the first 30 minutes of the movie and I don't know how many times after that. Bale makes a very good Bruce Wayne, but when he is 'finally' in the Batsuit he does sort of a whisper shout line delivery which is sometimes way over the top. Of course being in the Batsuit is about kicking Bad guy ass. In this department we get confused shortish fight scenes against bad guys who obviously have no chance. The cast is full of good actors all of them have their moments, though that's about all they are allowed. Katie Holmes is miscast and not especially good in a not too well written part. Most of the special effects are very good, save a sort of 'island of the crazies' part of town that looks like a big half rendered CG thing. This is too bad as much of the later part of the plot takes place here.Batman begins is a new start but it still has some of the problems of the last series and though it has a newish take on the material it's not so novel or convincing a take not to keep it being just a shade dull as we wait for the big scenes to arrive.SPOILER WARNING.Okay there's this whole segment in Tebet to somehow inspire Wayne to be Batman. This seems totally out of place really in the overall lore of Batman. But the thing is Wayne is afraid of bats. There is a very extensive use of flashbacks to how Bruce feels he killed his parents and this is connected to bats also, though I won't give that away I'm only giving enough info to explain my point. So in the Asian retreat section of the film there is talk of fear this fear that. It's all KUNG FU type dialog, but Wayne never makes the connection or assumes the role of Batman during this section. He only thinks of it, almost by accident after all this. Shouldn't they have tortured Wayne with bats to master his fear? They basically babble about fear and then kick his ass over and over that's the training. They don't follow through on their own fear concept they just repeat the basic concept over and over again. Set up an idea. Pay off the idea. That's what the audience is waiting for.Speaking of set up. It turns out that all the super gadgets that Batman has are just basically lying around in the basement of Wayne Enterprises headquarters. They just happened to make all this stuff for the military but never sold it. Sort of a happy accident isn't it? I don't know if this is convincing, though the new Batmobile is pretty cool its one big car chase scene is long but not too exciting.So they don't just happen to have Bat helmets in the basement. What is our hero to do. Well the plan is that they will order 10,000 of them from some military producer in Asia. They have to also order 10,000 helmet type things and 10,000 Bat ears with listening devices inside because this will somehow attract less attention. What? Can't they just make one bat helmet in their high tech sub basement where they made the prototype Batmobile. I guess not.Okay right at the start of the film a untrained Batman beats the crap out of either 6 or 7 guys depending on who you believe. So towards the end of the film the villain ( I won't say who that is) is confronted with Batman and is going to escape by leaving two Ninja type henchmen to fight Batman. Batman makes some remark about 'only two'? Suddenly two more super ninjas drop form the sky and the villain leaves. Okay, so what. He kicked the crap out of 6 guys before he knew anything. A short bad fight scene follows. Let me point out that Batman in several other scenes has easily beaten many more men than 4 men every time. If you set up a hero like this you need to also be able to set up real challenges for him and they don't.Finally the plot hinges around a rather shakily set up but decently paid off super weapon. The villain is racing on a train to the center of the city to turn it on and destroy everything. The device is the immediate and large danger and all you do is flip a switch to turn it on. There is no positive use for the device. Batman gets onto the moving train at last. What should he do? Destroy the device? All it would take it some good kicks to render it useless. Or does he engage the villain in a protracted fist fight. He doesn't even really try to stop the train--though he sort of does--I'm not here to give that away or ruin everything, just to mention odd gaps in the script that ruin some other good ideas. Batman fights and fight and fights and the device just sits there in the middle of the train car. Oh yeah the villain gets to mention fear a couple of times again in case we haven't figured that out by this point in the film now that it's almost over. Here in order to have an elaborate 'ticking clock' ending they ignore a simple simple solution. Batman would break the machine and then kick the guys ass given the choice. And the screenplay gives him the choice which is the mistake.",3,5,12,17 June 2005
A Quiet Place," effective scares nonsensical ideas work against it
","Essentially this is an excuse for a bunch of SHOCKINGLY LOUD sound effects. Which will make you jump. On the whole Krasinski shows himself to be a better director than writer, and or the multiple writers added enough elements that the follow through doesn't work out.As I left the theatre I could already hear people complaining about things that didn't make sense in the film.It does involve you in the family's plight, but a key main plot point doesn't really make sense and keeps not making sense as it creates various suspense scenes.There are both questions that aren't answered and answers that don't make sense and raise more questions that are better left not asked. Once you are done being shocked by some enormous noise and mostly effective set pieces--sort of like those in Jurassic Park, you keep getting distracted by the nonsense.Technically and from a craftsmanship point of view the movie is slick in a good sense with the needed good sound design and with a better than average Beltrami music score that helps the scares and connects the family love elements.Creatures are all CG but for the most part well done, they get a little less interesting the more we see of them and for creatures that have sensitive hearing they make an awful lot of noise, an awful lot--just one of the movies logic problems. By the end SPAWN fans will wonder what he's doing running around in this film.You could say this movie has that Hollywood weakness of wanted an effect more than a reason for those effects. And in this case there is drama and melodrama the film is wanting to create and does.There is very little dialogue in the film though a bit too much subtitling--as they family uses sign language to communicate, the few real dialogue scenes are ok with one poor exception being a phony father son talk with the kid talks like 70 year old worldly woman.You'll be on the edge of your seat until you aren't and then it all starts to fall apart, too bad.Let me put it to you this way what's the first thing you'd do with your wife in a world where silence is key to survival?Yeah, well, you're answer won't be what these parents do. Never.",6,3,6,4 April 2018
Mission: Impossible," only gets a 2 because the sequel is even worse
","Ego centered and senseless movie. Brian Depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the Tom Cruise star has faded. If you love Tom (and he can deserve your love, just doesn't this time) you'll like the fact that for a 'team' movie there is no Team it's all just Tom. That's fine if you don't remember the original concept of the cool TV show, and let's face it the makers of the film were betting you don't. Best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots. Dangling wire scene is a steal fro Topkaki--which for Depalma is a signature moment. What can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments. Here though he really gets to do very little, he certainly was taking the job hoping (and getting) a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal Hitchcock rip off films ( don't get me stated) anyway he doesn't get to work much style into Mission. Final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing CGI action scenes that have followed and dominated American movie making. I don't mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films. Cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script (written and rewritten while they were shooting) doesn't not hold together, leaving Cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a 'isn't this fun? Don't take it too seriously' attitude that might have saved at least him. The film was a hit, feel free not to listen to me, or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is. For those who see Brian DePalma's cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style, this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from Topkaki. Unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one. Most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme music--that moment leads into the Topkaki riff. If you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch, I'd say watch this one, otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescue.",2,5,8,16 December 2005
The Descent," What THE CAVE should have been
","The director of Dog Soldiers is back with a less jokey and even more scary film. It does however retain a Brit aspect to the acting though not as heavy on the 'what did they say?' accents in Dog Soldiers, and lacks any American names, which will probably unfairly limit its exposure in the United States where it has all the thrills that were lacking in THE CAVE. This is a more realistic climbing, crawling and caving movie than that, which makes it more effective. The film has personal drama and perhaps just a touch too much grimness when it's all said and done but it is miles ahead and much more involving than most horror films. Solid drama aspects and tough minded true to the heart of the matter drama also keep it ticking.Creatures are cool and mostly briefly glimpsed. They seem to be based at least in part on some 'real' cave demon photos that have been circulating, and recently discredited, on the web for the past several years.There aren't many Caving horror movies, though this does remind me of WHAT WAITS BELOW which unfortunately fell apart when it was about half way through another film that comes to mind is the seldom mentioned, not bad, THE STRANGENESS.Weakest element is the overblown, Howard-Shore-like music score,though it sounds great it is really all volume and little musicality. However the cave bound elements of the score, which comprise the bulk of the film and music, are effective.Well made on a limited budget this film also shows you can make something totally pro and slick if you're clever with your concept and execution--and at the same time you'll make a movie that has scares, guts, heart and logic. What's the last monster movie you saw that can make that claim?",9,1,3,22 January 2006
Les Mis√©rables," Poorly directed frequently out of focus approach is distracting
","This movie makes history as being the musical with the most out of focus shots on record.The trailers for this film are careful to present the visual style of the film as looking as big and classical(David LEANish) as they can. What they are hiding is almost a Blair Witch like style that director Hooper uses. Most of the film, when it doesn't involve some CGI work, is shot with a very unstable and frequently out of focus in large or very large closeup with the actors staring into the shaky camera while it goes it and out of focus randomly. Anne Hathaway's big solo runs as one long take this way, it's completely distracting and for a movie that runs this long to have the same approach to every scene is dull. Hooper also, as he did in the better-overall THE KING'S SPEECH, also will put an actor way off in the lower corner and/or against the edge of a the frame making you stare at at wall or dead or out of focus background and have to force yourself to watch the performer while your eye keeps getting drawn off of them to the majority of the frame that is meaningless. He also in ED WOOD like fashion will cut to wide shots when you least expect them only to have someone eventually come into the frame. It's like he's interesting in anything but what's currently going on. The movie is mostly very well sung and acted, with the only problem being that Jackman's upper register of his voice gets very pinched and nasally. He gives a good performance but the music isn't written for his best tones and it falls way short of the excellent singing of '23601's in the recent Broadway revival. Another thing that makes these closeups off putting is the overly dirty faces and teeth or almost everyone. One the big screen the fake grunge on each tooth is as big as your TV at home you can't help but go, 'Wow their breath must stink.'Hooper really almost ruins the film with his approach, he has no feel for an epic and sometimes doesn't seem to know how to cover action of the scene or of the overall story. The opening with the gang of prisoners trying to pull the boat into dry dock is a good example. The scene and song goes on and on the boat never seems to move then suddenly we cut and it's later and the boat is in place already. Wasn't the scene about them pulling in the boat? Why just skip that part.Les Miserables was not a big dancing type musical but there's even less of that here. The film's approach to everyone singing live is the one good idea Hooper has but he even sort of spoils that in the big final number where it's clear they aren't singing live. He has a massive scene of everyone singing but also, as he does, cuts almost randomly to giant close ups and we don't hear that characters voice at all,only still the whole chorus instead. For a musical the editing has no sense of timing certainly it rarely cuts on the beat. Additionally each music number feels like it's waiting for applause as it just turns silent and then lingers on the otherwise over scene. You almost feel a stage-like 'time to move all the scenery around' In many other moments the music will swell to some huge dramatic climax of moment and the camera will lazily be one some random close up of some extra or unimportant detail.Don't sit up close in the film or, like BLAIR WITCH, you're likely to get motion sickness and end up rubbing your eyes from the strain of fighting against the out of focus approach. Don't get me wrong here BLAIR WITCH used this approach and it worked for rather than against the material. It also works great in the BOURNE movies. But it takes skill to time your shaky camera and 'bad' framing in a way that it propels the film and the editors/cameraman/ and director don't have that level of skill to make it work here.One more thing of interest and a first is that the MASTER OF THE HOUSE number as sung by BORAT/COHEN is sung with a french accent and is quite funny. The rest of the time however that character and many others speak in a low English accent--which is true to the stage version--but of course makes no sense as the whole story is set and about pure French people. An odd thing. On stage you just sort of buy it but as a film being much more obviously in real world... Several of 'The Master's' songs from the show are cut from the film version.Although the film does show a number of blacks(I won't say African Americans because this is France) realistically mixed into the crowd scenes, but a major supporting role, always sung by a person of color in the stage show, is given to yet another Brit White Gal. Odd. Especially as there are plenty of great black actress singers who could have played and sung the role.Hooper Hooper, what were you thinking? It's nice to have new approaches to material but this one doesn't work and it should be about expressing the material not reminding the audience that this director's vision is always there by shaking around being just a bit out of sync with the actor's movements and drifting in and just as often out of focus.Notice, just as a final focus problem, all of the end credits are nice and sharp until the credit roll starts and then all then are out of focus because the font and speed of the roll is too much.The whole thing on that level just speaks to inexperience. Hard to believe but true.",5,10,28,20 December 2012
The Shape of Water," A deranged low budget Spielberg movie
","The movie has no sense of balance. It tries to do too much and doesn't do enough of what it does very well.Del Toro seems to always insist on R ratings--which so far sunk his Lovecraft adaptation AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS from happening. He likes to mix ugly and fantasy--sometimes this works, this time it doesn't.In this case you have rather graphic nudity and violence mixed in with Spielberg type elements. Or maybe it's just that the design and performance of the fishman looks like skinny guy in a Ok monster suit.Mix this up with Cold War crisis and artificial period ambience and a frustrated gay sub plot and what do you have, I guess like water is has no shape and pardon the pun but a snail-like pace.Other problem is the villain is overdone, it'd be more interesting if the villain wasn't one dimensional.Oh and did I mention the musical scene? It's a bold idea executed in a flat fashion that is unintentionally funny--or like too much of the film it wants to have it both ways, be funny but true in spirit, ugly but fantastical.Del Toro's English films often suffer from clunky dialogue, this one does too and mixes in too much modern foul language for the period story.Yeah what are all these things doing in one movie? Adding up to a movie that doesn't work.",5,11,28,9 January 2018
Lord of War," Time will be Kind to this film even if 2005 wasn't
","Sold as a black comedy--in which the laughs are the main point, it's really a satire or satirical drama/tragedy. This is more along the lines of films like UNDER FIRE and SALVADOR than DEAL OF THE CENTURY. And all the better for it. Easily the best film from this writer/director. It's free of the irritating trendy jump cutty style of the day but is very stylish and evocative. It's I suppose a comedy of the absurd and of the inescapable in this (the film's and our's to a great extent) war happy world.But the tone is perfect throughout and there is nice use of songs in the film and a fascinating scene where poor people take apart an airplane--it's like watching ants eat a dead animal, leaving only the skeleton.It feels like an honest movie about the greed and wheeling and dealing of selling guns. It's fun to watch someone succeed and that keeps your interest even as you and the character realizes the horror of what it's really all about. You may say, of so it has a preachy or mock heroic ending. No it doesn't go that way either. A perfectly made movie about the commerce of war and that's the element that this film argues drives the whole thing. Cage's character says once, 'I'd rather they fire my guns and miss as long as they fire my guns.' I won't go on and on and tell you it's an important movie, but it is very involving entertainment. Not amusement. Entertainment, it's about something without feeling like a sermon. Forget the bad ad campaign and give it a chance. In years to come this film may well be remembered long after the 'hits' of this rather weak movie year have faded.",10,5,9,27 October 2005
The Big Short," convoluted
","Famous writer director, Bill Wilder said if you are telling a complicated story you have to tell it in a simple way. He was right. This film wants to be funny and savvy and meaningful those are all great goals but it doesn't really achieve them. The story telling is as spastic as the camera-work is jerky, and the more it tries to make the back room dealings of corrupt banks make sense the less it does.Another key thing is that our main characters goals are to profit from the impending doom of the economy and though a few moments are supposed to make us care about them we really don't. They still come off as amoral socially odd business men out to make bank so why do we care? We don't.The attempts at hip comedy fail and are distracting--characters suddenly talking to the camera--directly to the audience, celebrity cameos trying to explain what's going on. These are just distractions. I guess they wanted an almost Michael Moore type vibe but in a more fictional type presentation. It's especially frantic on the big screen almost headache inducing during some of the 20 sec flash cut montage scenes that keep popping up.It's great the director wanted to go for a 'real' movie, that he doesn't succeed is too bad. A for effort as they say does not mean he gets an A.",5,48,99,10 January 2016
V for Vendetta," Very long, Very obvious, very verbose, very silly, very tedious
","When you have a movie with this much talk in it and one of the main talkers wears a mask the whole time you court silliness. Fans of Bad CGI will wow at the bad explosion that kicks things off. Sure the 'not' current political and social figures being made fun of or killed I guess is fun on some level for those who feel powerless to change things they don't like about this world but can vote highly for a movie that is sort of about current issues here and feel vindicated.Could well be that the graphic novels work but the film totally grinds to a halt about halfway in and never recovers. I had been warned going in that it wasn't an action film. Okay no problem there, though there is enough action and of a type of action to keep it from being taken to seriously and way way way way way too much talk talk talk talk talk talk talk to be engaging mentally. Ideas if repeated many many times do not become deeper.Character motivation is likewise repeated at every key moment that you might have forgotten. This is a movie that is concerned it's too smart for you dummies in the audience. In its arrogance it forgets to be much good or have any narrative drive. Characters on several occasions get magically kidnapped to keep the story going, a protracted flashback to a subplot right in the middle is really the time to turn it off.A misfire, good intentions I guess, aren't really deeply thought out nor is anything in this ultimately. The subversion here just seems kind of childish. The bombers are our friends? Gutsy premise but they don't pull it off. Silly Portman underwear sequences belong in another movie perhaps one more entertaining and sure of itself than this ultimate mess.This will all seem really odd in future years, for now it's just for the armchair crowd who can't be bothered to really study current events but can, I guess, get some vicarious thrill from this. I don't mean to knock fans, only to say if you really think about this it won't hold up. I gave it a chance but felt ultimately angry for bothering.",1,3,11,27 August 2006
