Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absolutely stunning and totally amazing.
","Star Wars Episode One is an absolutely amazing addition to the Star Wars saga. There is a definite SW feel from every aspect of the film. From the familiar opening title crawl to the multitude of droids and aliens that inhabit the SW universe. Finally, we are given a glimpse of the true abilities of the Jedi. The acting is top notch, with particularly stunning performances by Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman. The movie is equally enjoyable through multiple viewings, as there is a great deal of things happening amidst the backgrounds you might not catch the first time out. We are treated to the Republic, as mentioned in a New Hope, and given a view of the noble Jedi Knights in their prime. The Phantom Menace is reminiscent of Return of the Jedi, in  some ways, but is indeed its own story. Truly a worthy, and completely amazing, addition to the Star Wars saga....",10,0,0,22 May 1999
The Mummy," Great film. Left feeling completely entertained. Great summer film!!
","The Mummy was a great film. Granted, it was not the original, but it was still thoroughly entertaining. It had elements that inspired a variety of reactions. It had its thrilling moments, amusing moments. The special effects were excellent, some of the things they did were absolutely stunning. The sets were really lavishly done. The monuments and locations portrayed looked extremely authentic. While there were a couple of graphic scenes, the humour was placed in just such a way to break any frightening scenes for children or younger viewers. Went to it not expecting much, but I left feeling far more satisfied than I had intended. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,9 May 1999
