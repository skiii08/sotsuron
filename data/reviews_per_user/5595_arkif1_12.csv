The New World," A short while for history
","The New World is my favourite film of Terrence Malick's. I liked the Thin Red Line alot, because it depicted war as war should be depicted and was, to the best of my knowledge, first depicted by Ernst Jünger in In Stahlgewittern (1920). But here we have a film that isn't just depicting a moment in time, but the eventual joining of two lines of human evolution after a seperation of more than 10000 years.While watching The New World cannot be accepted as an equivalent substitute for having actually been around all over this planet for the last 10000 years, it does open the mental pathways that allow a man to ponder the question what man has been doing all of this time.Very few films do that. Very few films give you a chance to reflect and compare. Not everything in The New World is quite believable, but there is enough texture, enough undeniable detail, that a realistic appraisal of the value of civilization is triggered.And although the film does take a side, it doesn't do so in a way that would prevent you from contemplating the virtue of the other side.While watching the Making Of I was amazed about how much more engaging Christian Bale is in real life than on film. I think he's muting himself too much. You can also do it too little (e.g. Tom Selleck), but I think he's doing it too much.Plummer plays adequately. Farrell looks sad as always, makes me wonder why anybody wanted him to play Alexander or Crockett. Here it fits better, but he still got on my nerves.Aynway, all the actors could do is to sink this film and they didn't. It is not a film that hinges on stellar performances like Le Dîner de cons, for instance. No, the achievement here lies in the appearance of actuality, in doing away with the idea that you live in the 21st century and looking at a set or some plot of land set aside for scenic beauty next to a motorway. The achievement also lies in the sense of curiosity the film instills and that comes from not knowing why the director is showing you what he's showing you, i.e. that the plot of the film is not some transparent construct to make some specific point, but rather like a list of highlights on a sightseeing tour, which includes the necessary stops.",10,0,0,30 January 2020
Scarface," If you ever suffer really bad from some lasting pain...
","...Scarface becomes one of the very, very few films indeed for which you'll still find taste watching. (Pretty much like with Parsifal in the opera business, though for slightly different reasons, as follows.)Dressed in the suit of a gangster film Scarface is in fact a frontal attack on society, pleasure and the human condition in general. The beginning sets the tone for the whole film, we see real TV coverage of Fidel Castro declaring that criminals are better off in the U.S. than in Cuba and then their shipping over to Miami.The film continues to show the veracity of this in the most cynical way imaginable, namely that Tony Montana does not only rise to the top, but that the big players in the U.S.' economical and political life even profit with him. What a waste, if he'd stayed in Cuba, on which all of his qualities would have been lost.When it comes to money laundering and the legalisation of drugs you can clearly hear the political convictions of the people behind this film. But it doesn't stop there. 'Me, I want what is coming to me.' - 'Oh well... what is coming to you?' - 'The world, Chico, and everything in it.' You want more? Yet, what is satisfaction? How elusive is it? Can somebody, in whom there is no lying, be satisfied by means of possession? Tony can not, Tony is wrath, ebbing away when he gets trapped in settled circumstances. Irrationality as all of human's joy, strength, suffering and action.The world Tony needs to be natural can never be his, yet the world like it is, is pretty much so, only in another sense, made for him, not to be owned by him. It is the world to be owned by the peaceful, in which the devil rules. Ends don't meet.A hymn to Schopenhauer and in Tony's case Schopenhauer's eternal justice even becomes credible, he's exactly the kind of melodramatic figure that is needed for that. But in this fate and its lesson there really is rest for the tormented, pain loses its teeth if it all wasn't meant to make sense anyway.A huge film, no doubt, one of the best.",10,0,1,30 April 2007
Howl's Moving Castle," Mut und Willenskraft, besitzt du sie?
","(German: Bravery and volition, do you own them? - Recruiting poster in Sophie's city)I had to watch this three times. The first time to memorise the different themes in this film, i.e. curses and preparation. The second time to really understand what all this is about. And the third time to become emotionally involved.'Spirited Away' is by comparison pretty straight, this film is a little overcrowded. If this would be a Wagner opera, then it'd be 'Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg'. But I like this film more, it only shares its complexity and the corniness of its love theme with that opera. Speaking of music, that's quite a job on this one. From second Vienna school à la Berg over cosmopolitan à la Korngold to Vienna operetta à la Strauss, a fitting counterpart to the visual amalgamation of European architectures and machinery presented in this film.It's an indifferent could have been land, mixing German, French and English influences, located for most of its aspects around 1900. There is one major deviation from this setting, namely the battle ships, which are a clear WW II reference. In WW I it were the soldiers themselves who had to face the unspeakable, not the civilians.Now, the film is about love. It makes a vital point. That 'Mut und Willenskraft' are necessary to steer your course in life, but that you are facing a double challenge, not only to be brave and determined, but also to use your virtue for the right purpose in a world that is specialised in harvesting inexperienced young men for any kind of purpose. It might be for sexual consumption, like the Witch of the Waste is doing it. Or it might be to channel their strength into inhumane efforts, like Lady Suliman does.The film tells in fact many such stories, stories about people that subscribed their force to aims that make them both unfree and inhumane. And it tells stories about the tasks those face who want to rise to the occasion of their own lives.It is a wonderful film. Poetical, rich, true. Perhaps too rich, you have to take some effort and time for it to work.",10,3,5,24 February 2007
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Choir democracy
","Spooky seeing South Park today, what a prescient, insightful film.Jump on board. Sing our song. That's the way politics are made.It shows high artistic standards to use the form of a film, a musical in this case, for the message of a film, very good structural thinking there. Although the spectrum of the film is limited, concentrating on a social codex that could be called hypocritical, it's almost an uninterrupted joyride thanks to a sufficiently short running time on the one hand and a sufficiently over the top story development on the other. I counted just one lame scene, the emergency room.The criticism is of course both correct and necessary, just by cheering your own position you'll never get something akin to dialogue. It's almost insane. And it's real.Go and watch this!",9,2,2,21 November 2007
Hot Fuzz," Bonum Communae Communitates
","'Hot Fuzz' is a wonderful film about people who take their matters very seriously in a world that doesn't, about them being imprisoned by their own goals and about the great liberation that comes with the opportunity to make their cause public and publicly fight for it in their own way.As such an uplifting film and besides that very funny. The self reference here is ruthlessly choreographed, there's not one word of dialogue, not one name, that wouldn't be there for a reason, that wouldn't relate to another part of the film. And the actors do a superb job letting the characters become real life persons, no matter how weird they are, they are so intensely portrayed that they grow familiar inevitably, so that, all together, it is almost a theater play of great inner texture, from whose arbitrary inadequacies its humour is derived.This is a wonderful film, I already said so, a present day 'Arsenic and Old Lace'. Congratulations!",10,1,2,15 July 2007
Spirited Away," The Richard Wagner of the animation business
","Hayao Miyazaki has an ambition that is seldom met these days in popular art. He uses every element of his films to bear a meaning that is part of the film's vision of society.Spirited Away is about the working world. The English translation does castrate him here and there - in the original there's no talk of 'a deal' between Haku and Yubaba, which, in effect, changes Yubaba's character from benevolent to malicious and also removes an important lesson that Chihiro has learned - but the entangledness of relations, the almost mystical whole, a world whose true meaning lies in the places that its inhabitants owe it, overwhelms the viewer even so.A world that might be endangered by those, who subscribe to ideas forgetting about themselves. This single thing, used in the film in a twofold way, as both the beginning and the end of this world, on one end Yubaba and her lock on names and individuality and on the other No-Face and his seduction by something that looks more valuable than it really is, is already reason enough to consider Hayao Miyazaki a t r u e artist.It makes no sense to rate other great films worse only because there is one Hayao Miyazaki, so I'm not doing that. But what I do, and I can only encourage anybody to do alike, is to look at his films with the same respect that I look at a Picasso or listen to a Wagner opera.",10,1,2,10 February 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," How can I fight a bloody war without artillery?
","Reading 'The seven pillars of wisdom' does enhance the film experience indeed. Several times you have to hear 'No, I didn't know him well, you know.' at his - T.E.Lawrence' - funeral and it will ring some more bells inside you, if you've read his biography. One might accuse the film here, that it missed the opportunity to show what his extraordinarity consisted of other than his control of pain and fear. But at the time, 1962, it wouldn't have made too much sense to include those things. Today though... the man is so severely against the modern grain that it would have been a delightful thing to have him privately portrayed. He is an anti-future, so to speak, a glimpse on a branch that history just didn't pursue any further.So much for Lawrence, now to the film itself. 'Lawrence of Arabia' seems to be a monumental film, but all the wide shots do nothing to disturb its personal tone, probably because there is nothing that they capture, just the emptiness of space. Anyway, as such, as the exhibition of emptiness, they don't really work, that's better left to the imagination of the reader or the eyes of the tourist. The important thing though is that they do not disturb the personal tone, which is the quality of the whole film.That statement might surprise after my prelude, but personal isn't the same as private. In this film we see only ordinary stuff, people getting shot at, arguing, riding horses or camels and laying bombs. Yet artificial as it - as any film - is, it radiates warmth. The characters are convincing. Their dialogue is essential and sometimes, where you'd least expect it, namely in Auda, it is even philosophical, touching Lawrence' religious considerations 'It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rum!' This exposure of hedonistic thought illuminates a wider principle. What it means to be truly free. So free that you can even choose what you want to believe in, what you want to make the religion of your tribe. And what it means to be truly tolerant.Now, having stated all that, I still haven't even remotely begun to tell anything about the film's plot, about 'big things' in Arabia. How 'big' these things were in Lawrence' head, you won't be able to tell by watching the film, the term 'New Asia' doesn't occur once, a shame, considering the influence of more recent ideas on the same subject. Still, a 'big thing' remains essentially a 'big thing', no matter how far you drive your fantasy. And standing against 'big things' there'll always be the common things. Verily, both sides do their best to drive each other mad.And then, there's something more, something elusive that is never clearly mentioned in the film... o.k., enough of that parody. I missed the quote 'Preaching is victory. Fighting is illusionary.' I did miss that, because it captures the soul of this whole thing and gives the answer.",10,8,11,15 February 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," I am that I am!
","2001 is one of the odder films ever made. You could call it a stone plate-Nietzsche-waltz-obsession. If you are willing to dive into such a thing, then please, go ahead! The Blue Danube serves as a vehicle to let you feel both the loss of orientation in space and the loss of orientation in culture, in the sense that what we call culture is already the product of a disorientation, a sophisticated play that betrays our elementary nature. I AM! ALL THIS IS MINE! The introduction brings this point about pretty concisely, and most people will certainly imagine the becoming of man along the lines of the depiction here. It's a dark fantasy, 'the you is older than the I' said Zarathustra, um, Nietzsche, and in this spirit, that with self obsession came power, 2001 establishes the role of consciousness.The ultimate cause for this turn stays a mystery, an unknown by principle, an act of God, like the handing over of the ten commandments, at least in Kubrick's vision. It's a consistent and effective vision. But it's not much of a basis to create a film upon. The repetition of the birth of consciousness in the space ship's computer was worth showing, but after that point the film simply runs out of substance. The rest is just common half-sense, a disappointment after the start.If you're willing to let the film simply work on you, in a purely poetical way, then it's definitely worth watching. Otherwise it is to be shunned, since it would bore you to death!",9,2,6,24 March 2007
Some Like It Hot," You've got to love it!
","What makes a film funny? If we were to be completely honest, we would probably admit that the film has to make us want to laugh and that there are several quite different ways to do so.'Some Like It Hot' hooks you with its characters, who are all small and very sympathetic fish in a wild current of events that they never control and still dream that by them they'll find their luck in life.Little pleasures of little people, set during the prohibition the film misses no opportunity to show ordinary people secretly drinking, thus furnishing an echoing background of its major theme, the quest for love and money. There are a lot of great punch lines, like 'Nobody talks like that.' (Cary Grant does indeed!) or 'Well, don't look now, but the whole town is underwater!', but where the film touches the sublime is when Joe and Sugar tell themselves badly masked lies, everyone of them hoping to profit from the other in an extraordinary relationship, while in fact its just the repetition of the same kind of relationship that Joe and Sugar are having all of the time.Besides, it's a pleasure to see Jack Lemon throwing himself into his role as he does. If it wouldn't be for his childish enthusiasm, the whole wonderful 'crowded bed scene' wouldn't be half as funny as it is.Because of this and because of its wonderful music and its marvelous pacing that leaves you no moment uninvolved 'Some Like It Hot' is one of the best comedies ever made, if not the best, but since I saw 'Kin-Dza-Dza' I don't want to claim that any more.",10,2,3,7 March 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," The inner values of The Matrix Reloaded
","The Matrix Reloaded is a film full of social, philosophical, religious and developmental allusions and the main criticism is that those allusions are superficial, cheap and incoherent, while most critics agree that it's a fantastic action movie.I'll report an example of an allegedly superficial philosophical line; it's quite famous: 'There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose.'As for me, this is simply brilliant, i.e. concisely put. I'll elaborate this a little, just out of itself. If 'I' am a 'state' of 'energy-matter' that is 'caused' by a 'reason' there is indeed no way 'I' could 'be' without a 'reason'. And if the 'form' of 'myself' is 'defined' through its 'interactions' with other 'objects' and these 'interactions' are at the same time the 'purpose' of my 'form' no action could ever 'deny' my 'purpose'.If you've read Schopenhauer's 'Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung' this will remind you of certain things, but I don't want to misguide anybody here. The line I quoted isn't really about will, it's colder, more scientific. But my point is this. It's pretty easy to dismiss things and takes some effort to interpret things.And those who are willing to take the challenge and go through this movie in search of weltanschauungen and motivations shouldn't miss this film as it offers much.",10,0,1,22 May 2004
Prometheus," The riddler
","People are saying that Scott has lost his ability to make good films apart from 'the craft'.I understand the point, but Prometheus is a very good film in its own way.Watching it is a little like being slapped in the face. You hope for all kinds of developments, but nothings happens and at the end you are forced to piece the information together that you've got.It is enough information though.At the core there's of course the clash of giant people and giant squids.Well, what kind of metaphors are that? I think one gets the idea, systems are usually equated with octopuses and the like, whether it's tax revenue or something else.Something else... something else... what might that be? Looks innocent at first, wrestles itself around your arm, if you resist it breaks it and at the end comes the beheading.'Big things have small beginnings.' Says who? Where and when? And what answer does he get? So, I think it's a very good film after all. There's hardly talk about this clash elsewhere. Does humanity prevail or do we fall victim to systems that are stronger than ourselves? And don't complain. What's better to wake you up, than being slapped in the face?",9,2,7,12 June 2012
Blade Runner," Human ambition
","There are several extraordinary things about Blade Runner.1) It does not state who's good and who's bad. 2) It throws you into a scenario that you'll probably not enjoy. 3) It doesn't bother to explain why things are the way they are. 4) It shows us something that, although it doesn't exist anywhere, still has an existential meaning to us.Apart from that Blade Runner has the best score ever. Vangelis created a style that in its simplicity strikes you far more as being of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do.The thing I was referring to in 4. is a grown up without experiences of his own. That is a logical impossibility, a paradox. But paradoxically it's one of the most powerful stimuli of existential reflection that were ever shown in cinema. The point being that it lets you ask yourself what all your experiences were good for.Not quite so subtle, yet still of interest, is the idea that you could be born into life knowing full well what your purpose is and how long you'll live. What does that do to you? The film answers that though, it's unacceptable, you'll deny it, seek something else, something more. It just cannot be that everything will be lost like tears in rain.But human ambition is a much broader theme of this film. The world itself, in which Blade Runner takes place, is a statement about the human longing for progress and power, his forwardness and his backwardness. Some concepts seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective, but the overall atmosphere is right on the spot. And in this respect I have to say that the original cut has the better ending, because of the contrast, because of all the emotions that are awakened by that contrast, which does not appear cheesy, but rather estranged, a release into the completely unknown.",10,33,65,11 February 2007
