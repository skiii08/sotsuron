Catch Me If You Can," A very entertaining film.
","I found this to be a film that was very enjoyable to watch. You can't help but admire the ingenuity of the main character. Yes, he does things he shouldn't, but there is no sense of any kind of mean spirit. In a lot of ways, the only person he hurt is himself. He is eventually redeemed, however.",8,1,2,28 February 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This is still a very sweet and enjoyable film.
","I really enjoyed seeing this film in the theatre again. It was my favorite as a child and it made me want to get into the movie business. It's a sweet, moving film about the importance of understanding between beings from different worlds. It's a lesson the world could use right now.  It's nice to see a film that isn't based in violence and has a magical quality to it still. I hope more people go to see this again. It's absolutely worth it.",10,1,2,5 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," I thought this was a wonderfully imaginative film.
","This film was a breath of fresh air for me. It was unlike anything I'd seen before. It showed such imagination and energy and yet allowed me to relate to the characters. I think it's a crime that Baz Luhrmann and Ewan McGregor weren't nominated for Academy Awards.  It was very brave for a film like this to be made. Hopefully, Baz Luhrmann will make more like this.",10,1,2,9 April 2002
