The King's Speech," Personifies Brilliance
","The Kings speech is an excellent example of a movie that infuses warmth and beauty with your blood. You let out a smile just a little while after the movie begins to execute its screenplay and this smile persists all the way till the very end. It is one of those movies that vaporize any form of anger or sadness a person possesses. The scenes are very deep. It isn't an exhilarating screenplay or a harsh-bloody scene that makes its scenes deep, it's the dialogues. And these aren't dialogues that utter in a loud, symbolic voice, these are dialogues that come from the most subtle voices, but strike your heart as if you just heard a nuclear explosion. You get an Adrenaline rush the moment these dialogues are said. That's the power of words - that's the power of The Kings Speech. The dialogues are brilliance personified on one end, but what else is good, is the acting and the script. The acting deserves a million simultaneous clapping of hands. Colin Firth executes helplessness initially, with a rather oppressed character, while Geoffrey Rush plays his hypothetical snake-charmer who must set the snake in motion. He makes the oppressed rise from his snake-basket to the outside-world and face them and leave them starstruck. And all this is carried out beautifully. The story is simple, yet powerful, meaningful, deep and extremely well written. So The Kings Speech is basically a movie about shackles. The shackles that tie a person down and how that person must break free. For some people these shackles may be some of their personality traits while for some they are the society, family problems and what-not that subdue a person down and leave him stripped from his abilities and skills. It is also a tribute to the 60 million people who stammer, the men and women who have to face difficulty while doing the one of most important thing of ones life - conversing. He must fight with the flow of his words every day. It is a battle with oneself that must be faced every day of a persons life. These men deserve a tribute, a homage and the kings speech gives it to them. It is also mixes a decent amount of humor and attempts to showcase the importance of men who aren't of royal blood to those who are, and how they must be given equal treatment. It is a movie that glorifies 60 million people, it is a movie that extinguishes inequality between royal and normal blood, it is a movie that dignifies the power of words, it is a movie that expresses the importance of breaking free from life's shackles, It is a movie that personifies brilliance.",10,2,4,27 February 2011
