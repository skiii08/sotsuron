Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Far Superior to ROJ...
","I went into this film with mixed information. Some people had said it was fantastic, whereas others had described it as a travesty to the other three Star Wars films. There were good points and bad points, this I will admit: however, I feel the former far outweighed the latter.What was wrong with it?1. Jar Jar Binks. I know this is film particularly for younger audiences, but puh-leeez. I am fifteen years old (I'm allowed to say stuff like 'puh-leeez'), and to be honest, I doubt I would have laughed at some of the jokes Jar Jar made (or ended up being the butt of) when I was seven. That said, he did make me laugh. Occasionally. But seeing a malcoordinated character whose lines were often incomprehensible lost its humour value after a while.2. Anakin. I guess his age makes this complaint rather difficult, but I did find some of his deliveries a little inauthentic. The two times he said 'Yippee' at hearing some news, I cringed - does anybody /really/ do that?And now for the GOOD stuff:1. The fight sequence. Darth Maul vs. the two Jedi knights was outstanding. This section pulled the entire film up a couple of notches in my opinion - maybe it's something about the sound of lightsabres making contact.2. The short shots of Naboo. These scenes were beautiful. Knowing that it was all computer-generated did not affect how authentic those distant waterfalls appeared. This actually leads on to a more general point about special effects. At no point in the film did I feel special effects were being overused, except, perhaps, for the underwater chase sequence and the battle between Jar Jar's people and the Trade Federation forces.3. The pod race. Wow.4. The 'Intergalactic Council' (?). Not sure about the name, but the scenes on the planet where the meetings were taking place, and the actual meeting itself, was very impressive. I wonder if anyone else noticed that E.T. (he of Steven Spielberg's creation)'s race were represented (look to the bottom left hand corner when the delegates are shown reacting to the motion to replace the Chancellor).I won't bother questioning the sanity of a director who decides to tell a story by starting half-way through, goes to the finish, waits a bit, then goes back to the start and tells the first half.",Null,0,0,17 July 1999
Full Metal Jacket," A film of two halves
","The opening scenes of Full Metal Jacket seemed full of promise. Having seen many of Kubrick's previous works, I had extremely high hopes for the film, and was not disappointed. The Drill Sergeant was a great character (the constant barking was hideous and yet at times could be incredibly funny), as was Pyle. However, once Pyle's descent into insanity was complete and the Sergeant and him were both dead in the Head, I began to wonder where the film could go.Downhill seems to be the answer. Sure, the Vietnam scenes were decent, but they did not belong in a film with such a fantastic opening. 'Joker' irritated me - though I felt I was supposed to identify with him. As for the other soldiers: they seemed a little too 2-dimensional, being divided roughly along the lines of 'cool-headed' and 'blood-thirsty lunatics'. To its credit, the Vietnam scenes seemed realistic enough in some cases (Kubrick highlighted this by actually giving part of the film the form of a documentary being made) - but they simply did not seem to fit in with what had gone before. There were several points when the screen faded to black and I thought it was the end, only to discover that there was more to come (I seem to remember sighing at this).I suppose I shouldn't really complain about the ending not having been sooner though, since the end, when it did come, was beautiful, and complimented the dark tones which were far more evident during the Island part of the story than any of the rest of the action in Vietnam. Having the soldiers sing 'Mickey Mouse' was an inspired choice.",8,0,0,8 July 1999
