Blade Runner 2049," Long and boring!
","How can this movie have 8,2 i think there is a mistake! Seriously the graphics are beautiful but that was painful, it's way too long, wayyyy too long!! Apparently this movie can also win an oscar for best picture, maybe that explain why i don't like it so much, we're not on the same page the academy awards and i. It's not because is almost 3 hours long that it's a masterpiece you know! 
I wanted to like it, but the pace plus 2 hours 43 minutes of Ryan 'pokerface' Gosling is too much for me! That guy is unbearable, he has no facial expression, no emotions, it's like watching a robot it's so annoying!",1,6,10,4 March 2018
The Witch," Probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen...
","I don't have much to say... it's slow, annoying, god fanatic crap, it's a wonderful piece of s***! Do not waste your time with that awful film unless you want to sleep or be bored as hell. 6.8 on IMDb is an absolute shame! 1/10 because i can't give a zero! I need 5 lines but i have absolutely nothing else to say!",1,7,15,23 June 2017
Arrival," Overrated much?
","That was painful to watch and seriously i don't understand how this movie can have such good reviews! It's nonsense, it's just boring as hell and really not that smart even if you can think otherwise at the beginning! The way they decode the alien language is totally arbitrary, not explained at all! But never mind they discover an entire vocabulary for the sake of communication. Characters are stupid, they can't understand the aliens so enough we show our balls let's go to war, against giant spaceships and giants aliens even if we don't have a chance and they don't threat us! Usually, the ratings here are quite appropriated but this one...one of the most overrated film i've seen in my life! What a disappointment! (sorry for my English) 2/10",2,10,18,8 June 2017
Halloween," Come on...
","The scariest movie of all time? What a joke! Maybe if it's the first time you watch a horror movie. A classic? Why? Because it's old? It's just not good, period. Nothing in this film is good, it's boring, laughable, and NOT SCARY AT ALL!!!",1,5,12,6 November 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," By far the worst of the 3!
","The second movie is the best and the one with the lowest ratings... i don't get that! Madagascar 3 is just not funny, and even irritating. Yes Frances McDormond thanks for destroying the french language seriously wtf are you doing here that was horrible!!!
Again the funniests are the penguins but we don't see them enough and they're less funny than before. The music is unbearable, this movie is really exclusively for kids or teenagers i think. They brought Bryan Cranston and give him the voice of the russian tiger who doesn't have a single funny line! Anyway:
Madagascar 1: meh but okay
Madagascar 2: funny
Madagascar 3: garbage2 stars for the penguins!",2,1,2,27 September 2019
Back to the Future," Best Movie Ever!!!
","I could watch BTTF all the time, it's just perfect! The definition of a cult movie!
It has everything! I always come back to this movie i think i've watched it more than 50 times! That's heavy! 10/10",10,1,1,19 November 2018
