Iron Man 3," Better 2nd or 6th time around!
","Didn't think much of Iron Man 3 at first but after rewatching it (probably 6th time, but first time since Infinity War came out), it really does give Tony Stark a better story arch by him not using the Iron Man suit as much and more of 'gadgets' and 'spy-technique'. And we get more of Tony's different suits. And it's funny as hell. AND it's a Christmas movie :)",7,0,1,28 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It was worse than cancer!
","Worst thing to come out of Hollywood since Aids in the 70's... Next time Disney will hopefully have a vision or plan for the next trilogy.. literally no logic behind this creation, it aaaaaall about the Benjamins for Disney..",2,6,9,20 December 2019
