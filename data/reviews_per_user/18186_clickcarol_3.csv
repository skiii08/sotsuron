Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What are you people smoking????
",This movie was SOOOOOOOO slow.... and did NOT compare to volume one AT ALL..... I left the movie being extremely frustrated ... I wish I would have rented this movie... was not worth seeing in the theater at all.... Dont get me wrong.... I loved the first one.... loved it.. but the second won cheeped out as it went for the traditional warm fuzzies... like no... thats not how this film should end... *siigh* ...both movies were so different you would think they were made by two different people.. yes... volume 2 had a few high points... but very few and they didnt last more than a min.. and considering the movie is 2 hours long... def does not = good movie... disappointed to say the least,1,4,15,23 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Slow!!!
","As far as I'm concerned I could have just seen the last 20 min of this movie. Nothing happens for almost 2 and half hours. I have not read the books, but I dont think it mattered. This movie was sooo boring that I almost fell asleep and I love movies. The movie stayed on the same topic for way too long. I mean .. I dont understand at all why watching hobbits walk around for 3 hours is exciting .. or a rollercoaster ride.. or even a bit interesting. Some of the special effects were good.. I must say .. but if thats all that was good about the movie .. then it sucks. I could have cared less if any of the main characters died. I expected sooo much more out of this movie. I would suggest seeing any of the movies of Narnia over the Two Towers any day.",3,0,0,11 January 2003
