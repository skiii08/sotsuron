Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," TPM furthers the saga, but has flaws
",I love Star Wars and because I love it I can't gloss over TPM flaws. Jar Jar Binks is jarring at first but forgivable. The main flaw I feel is Anakin's age. Lucas say he made Anakin nine he is scarred deeper by leaving his mother (which factors in later episode's) but it also sacrifices the versimiltude of every scene he appears in. Nine-year-olds don't act like Anakin. Jake Lloyd is a fine actor but he is unsuited to the role of Anakin. Darth Maul was under used but terrific. He is among the most menacing villians ever put on film. Despite my qualms I welcome TPM into the Star Wars saga because it furthers the overall plot flawlessly.,10,0,0,26 May 1999
To Be or Not to Be," It has 'it'
","I have seen this film probably over ten times and each time I see it I still think it is one the funniest movies in all of film. What makes me pull out my ratty tape and watch a half a century old film over and over? To tell you honestly I don't know. It works. It has that quality that has never found a good name, perhaps just... 'it'. If you've never seen it watch it and see if you can put your finger on that 'it'.",10,4,11,10 September 1999
Fight Club," Desperately seeking something
","The movie fight club for me was summed up in by one line from Tyler Durden. Our image of God is our father and if our father's dumped us what does that say about God? (Roughly Paraphrased) This is a film where the main characters and those they influence are looking for some sort of meaning, any sort of meaning outside of Ikea furniture. Brutal violence and monkish asceticism provide one way out of the hellish reality the film portrays. In a strange way the violence in fight club almost becomes a fellowshipping between men. A forum to simply let it all go regardless of who you are fighting. The film directly relates the endless varieties of self-help groups to the idea of  fight club. In a way they are the same. Both attempt to purge by sharing communal pain and letting go of inhibitions.     The fight clubs touch a chord and quickly swing wildly out of control spreading like a cancer throughout the nation. The members of fight club become like pods from invasion of the body snatchers - human in form, alien in nature. This film suggests that the masses are so desperate for meaning beyond popular entertainment and yuppie culture that they will do anything to find it. They will die to themselves and live only for the cause. Using the medium of film seems an odd choice to convey this message, since it is effectively incriminating itself. However, the film makers self-conscious style suggest that they are aware of the irony and perhaps the film itself is a comment on the impossibility of organizing a secret society dedicated against the all principles of society. It is just as useless as making a pop film about the emptiness of popular culture. The irony of hearing Brad Pitt say that not every one can be a movie god or a rock star hints at this paradox central to the film. Ultimately, the film is an entertaining vehicle that conveys the hopelessness that seems so widespread in society today. As Tyler Durden says this generation has no great war and we have no great depression. WE only have a spiritual war and our lives are a great depression. A generation with no more purpose, no more struggles, with peace without effort will create it's own struggle even if it's just a bunch of guys beating each other to near death. This film does not cop out. Even if you disagree violently with it, Fight Club forces you come up with your own position on the issues it raises and for that fact alone, you should see it. Also, I think this movie could have a negative effect on liposuction and soap sales in the near future...",7,0,2,17 October 1999
Memento," Best film of the year?
","I am impressed how this movie doesn't simply present a puzzle it becomesthe puzzle. The plot twists and flits until it finally converges into aconclusion that explodes outward leaving all of the conclusions that youmade in the movie open to reevaluation. An innovative, must-see film",9,0,1,28 April 2001
Chicken Run," A lovingly created masterpiece
","I throughly enjoyed Chicken Run. I have not seen a more detailed, humorous, dramatic and downright joyful film in a blue moon: unendingly clever, appropriately cute but not cutesy, entertaining without pandering - eventually truly moving.
As I left the special showing, the management asked me if I enjoyed the movie. As I wasn't able to condense my thoughts, I only said 'really good'. But after time to think about it, I believe that Chicken Run is a rare film that can be many things to many separate people. For children it is a rousing adventure, for movie buffs it is a witty tribute to dozens of classics, for teens and adults it is an engaging story with shameless puns and innuendo, for lovers of animation it is the best big screen clay animation ever released. Kudos to the cast and crew and to Dreamwork",10,1,1,17 June 2000
We Were Soldiers," Best Vietnam movie
","I was disposed to dislike this film because of the horrible trailers. I was pleasantly surprised however during the advance screening. This is a meaty film with plenty to admire, provoke and digest.  Sure there are about half a dozen lines that might make potential script writers squirm but Randall Wallace has succeeded brilliantly in the goal he set for himself (he spoke after the screening). And that was the goal of telling the soldiers stories... devoid of any extraneous political complications. These men fought for each other. Wallace also doesn't make the mistake of dehumanizing the enemy. The Vietnamese are given a great deal of sympathetic screen time. As Wallace said, the only enemy is war itself and he made a conscious effort to have no 'evil' characters. This is a story about the men who have to fight the politicians' wars... and how they do it. The epic scope of Braveheart is here transposed to the modern day and for me... by the end of the movie it really worked. This is the best movie about Vietnam, that is actually about Vietnam. Other great films on the subject are about the filmmaker's psyche more than the war itself (Apocalypse Now, Deerhunter, even Platoon). This film while sometimes graphic and sometimes controversial (Wallace's inclusion of Hal Moore's catholicism may offend many) is an excellent work of filmmaking. Don't let the trailers deter you. This is a",9,0,0,27 February 2002
American Beauty," Twisted! Brilliant?
","Is this film a work of genius or perversity? Firstly, Kevin Spacey deserves all the credit for everything good in this film. Few performances have moved or puzzled me more. His character is sympathetic and sickening, hillarious and terrifing. The movie revolves around him, the other characters are merely his foils.  His performance was spellbinding and because of it I want to like this film. But I can't... well, not entirely.Sam Mendes and Alan Ball seek after perversity and controversy too methodically. It is the difference shock art and art that arouses controversy. The underlying force was attracting attention rather than showing us a personal vision. Perhaps that is why Spacey's performance is the core of this film. It is in a sense the vision of the film. Another actor might have destroyed the film by simply acting the material for an Oscar nomination. Spacey is the film.Only Spacey and Wes Bentley seem to care about their characters. The other actors and the direction feels exploitive. I was especially disturbed by the Col. Fitts character. He was too much an intentional counter-stereotype and not enough a real person. He resembled a one-dimensional villian from typical Hollywood fare, scripted only for plot development. First, he behaves in a completely stereotypical manner, even grunting at a paper 'the world's going to hell'. Then his character's reality is sacrificed by the film for shock-value. In other words, first he only does what we expect, then he only does what we do not expect. Rather than a character he is a convenient cipher who can be sacrificed with out arousing politically correct controversy. I am disappointed that a film that in other respects was so innovative had to resort to cheap tricks for plot development. The gay neighbors too, are only stereotypes. They are caring, genteel, urbane and completely manufactured. The film's strange finale approaches the spellbinding level of the best films of all time. It combines the strengths of the movie and turns a sickening tragedy into a strangely poignant and hauntingly uplifting conclusion. Just for that 'American Beauty' is worth seeing even if it falls short of its true potential.",6,0,0,24 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Practical Incarnation
","This movie examines who we are. Am I still me if you are in my head? Are you still you if I am in your head. Who is you?With questions like these you might expect that BJM is a deep movie plumbing the dark recesses of the cosmos. Not really. True, it is a comedy that bends the lines between genders and species. It plays havoc with the truths of existence and the sanctity of the human soul. It even bends the mortality of man into something like practical incarnation, yet it's funny.Disturbing yet hilarious. What WOULD happen if someone could enter a portal into their own head? The answer the movie provides is both gut-wrenchingly funny and bizarre. The small door that serves as a portal to John Malkovich's head is similar to the rabbit hole in Lewis Carrol's 'Through the Looking Glass'. A portal to a strange new universe. A universe right behind your eyes. Who knows what lurks in the soul of man? BJM knows. (deep laughter)",9,0,0,6 November 1999
Pi," The most intellectually satisfying film since Kubrick
","One thing I enjoyed about this film is that it takes the mystery and intensity of its plot and allows it to build slowly and purposely leaves holes for the audience's mind to play in. The black and white photography clearly delineates the black and white world of numbers and mathematics that both enslaves and fascinates the lead character, Max Cohen. But the film has the true mark of an artistic endeavor in that it does not attempt to be easily understood or understood at first viewing but allows several possible definitions.Aronofsky cleverly mimics his own storyline in his storyline, in other words the mystery of mathematical patterns within every aspect of life is mimicked in the patterned editing and layout of the film. It would be interesting to know if there was an intentional meaning to the editing patterns and repetitions in the film. I suspect that there is.However the best aspect of the film is the freedom it allows the audience to mull and think on the aspects that the film introduces. Does chaos exist or is it simply a maddeningly complex system of patterns? IS mathematic the only language? What the hell are numbers anyway, symbols for what? All in all an excellent film.",8,1,2,4 March 2001
Pretty Woman," Exactly as it should be
","This is a great movie, because it succeeded in what set out to do.  It sets out to create a fairy tale and place it in a modern setting. Thecharacters know that this film isn't realistic, the audience knows itand the movie makers knew it. Anyone who critiques this film fornot being realistic enough is missing the film's point. It is a mythas old as human psychology and I see no harm in updating it for amodern audience. The true test of the film is the chemistry of the lead actors andthe effectiveness of touching the core of the human longing forsomething better. I found Gere, who is often painful to watch, to bequite well matched with Roberts and I felt the story, althoughsometimes trite, to be very effective in communicating the undyingCinderella fantasy.  If one more user comments on this site toremind us that dreams like these never materialize, I believe I willscream. Film and stories sometimes to show us what we are, butsometimes they are meant to show us what we would like to be.This film does that quite well.",8,0,2,15 June 2001
Goodfellas," Machavelli is loving this
","Machavelli would have been proud of GoodFellas. No characters are glorified or given unreal motives for their actions. This movie is not driven by fantasy or great one-liners, yet it is totally engrossing. The violence is sickening but motivated. These men are ruthless, they are not characters in a movie jockeying for attention. They are pure Machavelli, what is expedient is necessarily right. In this life, if it is more convenient to have you dead... watch your back and never trust your friends especially if they are smiling.This is the real Mafia; life at its most dangerous. A complex game where everything is for sale and anyone is expendable. Whatever works is right. Machavelli himself couldn't have a better movie demonstrating his theories.",7,0,0,28 October 1999
