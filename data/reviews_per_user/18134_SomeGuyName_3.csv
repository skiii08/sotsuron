It," Tries to do everything at once
","I loved Stephen King's It, as I am such a cultured critic, and I'd always wanted to watch it in movie form blah blah, on to the real review:This movie was not really that scary. I love horror movies and sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers too young to even be here. I refuse to believe that they could in any way be scarred by this experience, as each scare was undercut by humor, and the scares themselves were not really that intense. In fact, I'd recommend this movie to people aged 12-15, as the toilet humor and sexual jokes seemed to be right up their alley, and I'm saddened to hear that the language apparently was enough to warrant this movie an R-rating. One of the problems is that this movie - beautifully shot and heart-warming as it is - fails to both build up the tension and provide something genuinely scary as a pay-off. Sometimes, it did manage to do one or the other, but never at the same time. It doesn't help that the monster appears way too often, and with all the kids fighting, running, throwing rocks and what-not, it often felt like I was watching a particularly gritty action movie, not an actual horror. As for the music, it sucked. Not because it was exclusively bad, but because it was too loud to have any subtlety, and because some of it didn't match the tone of the scene(the loudness making it even more grating).Now, the kids. As others have stated, their acting was great, in fact I found them better than most of the adults. They had actual screen presence, and the casting and dialogue between them is where this movie shines - their personalities and actions really did ring true most of the time, at least for me. One thing I continuously took issue with, though, is the treatment of the character, Beverly Marsh. I've read the gross-out controversial scene between her and the boys in the book, and was thankful that they left this out of the movie - but this is still no excuse. I know we are supposed to watch her through the eyes of the teenage boys, but they overdid it. The collective sum of the many full body shots, the red lipstick and the way the camera follows her around is not only kinda gross, it also hinders and changes her character development. They could have chosen to make her just as much a part of the group as she was in the book, but instead they made her almost exclusively an object of desire, and - in the end - a damsel in distress. Beverly is still presented as a complex and brave girl - but unlike the book, she is first and foremost a 'woman'. Like how they changed her father from a controlling physically abusive man, to a hair-sniffing pedophile. What's the issue with this, you say? Oh, nothing, save for the fact that the boys also continuously point out her hair, writes poems about it, and so on. It's supposed to be cute, but it can't be, because of the newly introduced context of sexual abuse. When Beverly is unconscious and is awaken by a passionate kids from one of the boys, how can you feel anything other than uncomfortable, when you've just seen her crying over the sink, cutting off her hair in deep shame and fear of being desired? So many situations here reminded me of the book Lolita, but in a bad and exploitative way. I also did find it strange that they didn't just set the movie in the 50s, as I think the unsupervised children and the dark violence the entire city inhabits, had more to do with an era gone by. I know, I know, things like this still happens now, as it does in the 80s, but it would've just been more believable this way, what with the evil cop and people getting burned to death just because they're black. Besides, It is a story of innocence lost - and what era has been viewed more through rose-colored lenses, as the 50s? I really wish they would've avoided the 80s trends here, and just focused on the truth of the story. In fact, this is the reason why It never completely works, and you can't fully blame them. They had the running time of a movie, and they tried to do it all - but it's impossible to sum up a 1000-page book with 8 fully-developed main characters, even when you split it in half. And it is crucial that you get inside the character's heads in this particular horror story, because their personal deepest fears is all you ever get to see. And how can you be scared by this, if you don't understand them? They would've been better off sacrificing even more of the source material, in order to have a more consistent tone, and more well-developed characters. It was doomed to be a mess from the beginning.",6,0,5,21 September 2017
Prisoners," Deserves it's high critical acclaim(minor spoilers, warning)
","Something I need to get out of the way first - there are certain people who should stay away from this movie, if they don't want their evening ruined. It also demands a certain mood. Because sometimes, you don't want to think and analyze, sometimes you just want popcorn and a feel-good, black and white whodunit. I know the feeling. And it's impossible to tell on the description which way this one it will play out. It's not that it's a pretentious, wordy, artsy-fartsy snooze fest - but it is heavy, it is dark, and it is a thriller/drama. Be warned. If you liked the first episodes of True Detective, you can go right ahead. I could start by summarizing all the action that takes place and who the characters are, but this movie is at its heart only about crime-solving and kidnappings on the surface. Behind all of this, it is about evil, and what happens to people's psyche when they become victimized by it. How everyone needs a scapegoat, and how people will judge/punish other people for various forms of perceived evil - swiftly, emotionally, without thinking things through - simply because they have an instinctive need for doing so. And how this traps them in a vicious cycle,(a 'maze') of evil, that none of them can find their way out of. I loved the themes of this movie. There's a lot of Alice in Wonderland-references,(LSD, mazes, rabbits) and the atmosphere is at once heavily realistic, and very surreal. There's a lot of prayers and preaches throughout the movie, especially about how we are all born sinners, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for the characters hit by sorrow and despair. But Christianity is not at all the point; in the very beginning, a criminal detective is shown judging other people by the year they are born, simply because he believes in astrology. It follows the same message without tying itself to one religion. The only innocents are the children,(whom also come in the shape of severely damaged 'adults') who understands the metaphorical 'maze' - which, to many reviewer's annoyance, is not completely literal - and finds their way out of it, time and time again. The children tries to communicate what they know with the adults several times, but these so-called crime-solvers are too busy finding sinners to actually listen. I loved the performances,(save for Hugh Jackman, who did not seem to connect with his grieving father-role very well) I loved the music, and I loved how this movie was about the 'victims' for once, not the often boring perpetrators. It's atmosphere and mysterious tone was something out of the first episodes of True Detective, and it stayed consistent the entire way. But because it was so concerned about message, symbolism and character, it sometimes lost the realism in the form of a few plot-holes, and was not always completely realistic regarding the actions of several characters. For example(early spoiler) some detective finds the door to a hidden cellar behind a fridge by obscure coincidence, and it strains the suspension of disbelief. I can forgive most of the other stuff, though, and I'm not quite convinced some parts are as illogical as other people have stated; to me, it was believable for certain characters to become trapped in their own bad decisions, and to lose their way in a misguided attempt to do right.",8,2,4,23 September 2017
Arrival," Ambitious movie squandered by improbability and plot holes
","The entire movie is spoiled in this review. The movie starts with Amy Adams being a linguist professor, who's so unimportant that students doesn't even pay attention to her in the university lessons she teaches. Then, an alien invasion happens, and she's suddenly the first person the government can think of, when they need someone to decipher alien language. I don't have to explain why this doesn't make sense.Then, she meets these aliens, who look like squids. (Much have been made by the design of the space ship and the aliens, and I'm probably the only person on earth who was satisfied by their minimalist appearance. It was meant to look otherworldly, yet not enough to be a distraction to the story, and I think they did a fine job. Aliens can look like anything, so why not a giant black squid, with other little black squids for hands? The filmmakers know nothing about what an alien looks like, but neither do you) This is where to movie truly falls apart, and the reason for all of the hyperbolic one-star reviews:At the end of the movie, you know that the language of the aliens allow them to understand time as non-linear(which apparently also means that they can see the future). But for some reason - sometime in 3000 years - the aliens are going to need our help. And to assure loyalty, they give us the gift of understanding time, by forcing us to decipher their language; taking their time to ensure that the conflicts around world leaders are resolved in the process. But WHY did Amy Adams possess the ability to see the future without having learned the language at first? What made her so special? There's no explanation for any of this, and I also think it's lazy to not tell us whether we are in control of our future or not. It seems minor, but this is a sci-fi movie that clearly places emotions and character above colorful, advanced space-ships. And soooo much time is being spent on tricking you into feeling sorry for the main character, by showing what appears to be flashbacks of a child growing up and dying of cancer - only to realize at the end, that she doesn't know what's going on, either, because everything she saw was something that happened in the future. I also don't think that romance is the most beautiful thing that ever happened in the entire world, or even the most touching thing about humanity. This may be why I also wasn't impressed with the reveal that one of the guys from The Avengers turned out to be her future husband. I don't care! I want to know about the aliens!The movie could make the romance-thing interesting, but it never takes the obvious chances to do so. Best example I can think of is, that our main character knows that if she gets a child with future husband, then that child will die of cancer. But she also knows that in the future, she will keep this a secret her husband, and chooses to have the child anyway. When she eventually tells him the truth, he will leave her and the child. So many things could've been done with this. It's an interesting moral question, because even though the daughter's life was very beautiful and valuable, her husband might think otherwise. And why shouldn't he? Why should she be born, only to die before her life begun? But the movie never tells us outright what our main character will do with this knowledge, or if it condemns/applauds her for her actions.In short, it's annoying to watch a movie that has such an emotional feel to it, but never takes a stand regarding it's characters. It also doesn't always make sense. I think someone very brilliant behind this movie wanted to do too much, and lost their way.",6,7,11,21 October 2017
