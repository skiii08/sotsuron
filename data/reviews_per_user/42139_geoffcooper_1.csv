The New World," A Painful Reminder of the Trouble With Imperialism
","This picture is quite simply a gem in the aspect of cinematography. The way in which Malick crafts his shots throughout the film, making wonderful use of light and color, brings this epic story to life before our eyes. The powerful performances from Colin Farrel, Christian Bale, and the angelic Q'orianka Kilcher bring out strong emotional responses from the viewer. It is indeed a well written and well crafted piece of work.The most impressive angle on this film that I can see is the way in which the rich and beautiful culture of the Native Americans are depicted. Imagine a society without greed or fear. No struggles for power or acts of useless violence. A place where people have no concept of personal property because there is real equality, freedom and opportunity for all. An existence in which people share, love, and live in mutual respect for each other and nature. A truly classless civilization.We in the West, have no perception of what a society like this is. We are so busy with our addictions to wealth, power, and personal gain. It has been proved time and time again throughout history, that when a society such as the Native American's exists, it is not long before an imperialistic power will seize it and plunder it in the name of reform, betterment, or religion.This film is a painful reminder of the trouble with imperialism and the death and destruction that it brings. It shows us that the only truth is in love and understanding, and that despite an Establishment's attempt to replace freedom with false hope, natural freedom can never be changed or broken.",7,1,3,21 August 2008
