Black Swan," Intriguing
","I had know idea what to expect, when my sister called and asked me to go to a movie. But since I love most everything about Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman, I absolutely was going. Black Swan is worth watching. Natalie Portman battles with her characters demons so convincingly, that I felt a need to donate to NSF. The transformation process from white to black swan, made me wonder how functionality is maintained in that reality.She absolutely had me going from confused, to only slightly confused to what is and is not. I know that makes not a bit of sense, but I stand by it.Mila Kunis is seduction made flesh. Enough said? No? Watch the movie then. My normal viewing palette of ESPN and cartoons, was momentarily pushed aside. And in no way is that sad.Wonderful movie.",Null,7,19,6 October 2010
