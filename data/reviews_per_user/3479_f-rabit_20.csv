Blade Runner 2049," Awesome Soundtrack!
","The original 'Blade Runner', back in the eighties, is one of the best movies ever (It features in my 'top ten ever' list). Not only the mood, visuals, effects, actors, story are good, but the music....all of the sound tracks are absolutely amazing. Again, in my opinion Vangelis - 'Blade Runner' is the best Soundtrack ever, the best vangelis album and the best electronic album ever made! That could be the reason why Vangelis didn't participate in this '2049' sequel. A masterpiece like that couldn't be beaten. I figure it must have been hard for the director to chose the right composer for the sequel. Maybe harder than to chose the leading actor - Gosling delivered very well, by the way. So, I was in a very high expectation state about this aspect, but when the movie started I immediately relaxed, because you could feel the same ambient and deepness which facilitated the immersion in the movie and eased the link with the previous one. I loved the soundtrack. It's absolutely majestic and great and one of the most interesting aspects about this film. It's also very present, from the beginning to the end, and you feel that it is vital to the movie that it happens that way. I watched it in an 3D IMAX Theatre. The image was astonishing and the sound....incredible. The Perfect setting for the Perfect movie. About the story and the asthetics, I loved the visual effects, the wardrobe, the city ambient, the light, the pace, the actors, everything. And I must highlight, that I'm not a R. Gosling fan, but he was very, very good, and very convincing. The right actor for the part, no doubt about it. I loved Harrison Ford's acting also. So convincing. So good! But I must say that the original movie is more Epic, more convincing, more incredible in almost all of the chapters and aspects. I loved the movie, and give it a 10. But I would love to 'see' what Vangelis could have done! Nevertheless, like the original, this sequel is also a brilliant masterpiece!",10,2,10,17 October 2017
The Hangover," I couldn't believe my eyes...
","As everybody was saying that this movie is great, i decided to check the rating on IMDb. Uau! (8.5) there's no chance (I thought!) of getting bored at the theater. So I didn't even blink when i suggested it to my friends on a Friday night, so sure i was about the real good time we would spend laughing our eyes out! The movies begins, and with it the first disappointment: retrospective guided! We saw the end when it had nearly began. No suspense at all... Then, nothing happened...just a bunch of jerk offs doing stupid things and the worse: no fun! no laughs! nobody laughed at all! zero! (the only half fun scene was the one where the chicken appears behind someone's head lying on the floor). I honestly can't understand how someone enjoyed this movie; and how is it possible to rate it with 10! absolutely ridiculous! I'd rather watch 'the monster of black lagoon' 10 times in a row than this one only once!",1,22,47,15 July 2009
Aquaman," they just forgot to tell a story!
","If you want to see fish, colored, all forms of and you do not have time to go to an oceanarium, this might be the movie you're looking for.
In the other hand if you like to watch movies that tells a story, forget it all about...
This is not the movie you need.
Why did Willem Dafoe accepted being part of this ....... movie?! So fine actor...sometimes I just can't understand. He's just there...he trhows 2 or 3 stupid lines and that's it! gosh! deplorable.
And Nicole!! Nicole?! what are you doing? I just cant understand!
Oh! and spoilers? does this review contain spoilers? Is it possible? What are you talking about? theres nothing to spoil about! They completely forgot about telling a story here.",4,0,2,12 March 2019
Interstellar," My favourite movie
","This is actually my nº 1 movie in the best ever list. Absolutely astonishing. Mathew delivers the best performance of his career. Everything about this movie is great and near perfection. The picture is awesome, the soundtrack breathtaking, the story is very griping, the actors are superb. I guess this movie will make a fuzz at the Oscars. Can't understand how some guys rated it so badly. The premiss of the story is scientifically very strong also and I've heard that it's one of the most accurate movies concerning to astrophysics. I can't understand why there's a minimum of ten lines to post the review. Sometimes you don't have to say much to say that this movie is one of the best sci-fi ever.",10,4,11,9 December 2014
American Sniper," Average movie with serious fails
","Personally I do not care if the movie is faithful to the original story or if there was a valid purpose in Iraq invasion. This is just a movie, not the real story. It's suppose to entertain and you can tell the story anyway you like. You don't have to stick to the facts. This is not a documentary. Now, the entertaining value here is very poor. The actors are not great. Bradley is not a good actor. Never was. The story is not engaging enough. You don't really care about what's gonna happen. A lot of clichés. It's almost unbearable for me to see a war movie portraying the pos traumatic stress disorder...again and again. Just too predictable. But the best (worse) scene is that one in which Bradley holds a baby in his arms. My God! Is that even possible? to make it so badly? Everybody can see that is a doll. Horrible! This is a nominated film (6, I guess) to the Oscars!Unforgivable and, by the way, Clint: unforgiven!",6,1,13,25 January 2015
Southpaw," Worth a watch
","The movie has its moments. There are good and bad scenes. There are good and not so good actors. There are good and bad ideas. I wouldn't kill the wife, for example. Too dramatic. That was totally avoidable. Forest whitaker is a hell of an actor. Loved. Jack G. wasn't as good as in nightcrawler. He performs far more better as a psycho than as a bad boy, obviously in my opinion.The fight scenes weren't that good also. All the Rocky saga is far more better. I also expected another reaction for the main character after the death of her wife, towards vengeance or at least that the final fight would be more dramatic and tense, but no. That didn't happen. I liked the story about the relationship between father and child very much. To me, that's the best part of the film.",6,1,1,6 October 2015
Climax," Absolutely disgusting
","Disgusting!
1 - What's the idea with the stupid camera angles? some guys are calling this art! Incredible. How could some guys watch this film thoroughly?
2 - Theres no plot whatsoever. I heard that the actors were told to act randomly and say whatever they wanted. The job was to keep rolling and see where it was heading. Well, it went nowhere.
3 - There are no drugs like that one, that can cause that amount of disruption and to all of the users...it's absolutely ridiculous.
4 - The setting was horrible. It looked just like a garage.
5 - The actors were medíocre.
6 - What's the point of this? none!
7 - Stupid idea.
8 - Disgusting film.
9 - I hated it.",1,2,8,17 April 2019
It Follows," wait...7,3? ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! One of the most stupid movies ever done!
","I was expecting this movie for so long, and when I finally saw it I was totally disappointed. What is this? It's not horror, it's not a comedy,though it has its comic moments. How is it possible that some people felt fear when watching it? It has nothing to do with terror, horror,fear or stuff like that. Not a single frame of this movie is scary...neither the soundtrack helps...very boring. The 'it''s that follows are not scary at all; They are slow, normal people, that just keeps following someone..and some of them are half naked in topless!Uh! scary! If there's something that can really scare me that would have to be a woman in underwear with her boobs off..uh! run away for the killer boob! run for your life...there's a woman outhere.Wait...she is runing...no just walking...she has her sleep dress on and her boobs off...this can only mean one thing: she wants to kill you! Run for your life. Wait! if you can get to your girlfriend first and have sex...problem solved. Next, please! The idea of this movie is so dumb; but even so, it could be much better explored. NOTHING happens whatsoever. Zero tension!One of the most stupid movies ever! 7,3? really? Are the adults voters on strike? This must certainly have to do with the effect of skewed voting by unbearded immature teenagers. Please! give me a break!",2,31,92,6 May 2015
Jurassic World," Jurassic Crap
","The movie is bad. The acting is OK though. The movie's atmosphere is strange...the actors are trying to look cool and funny while dinosaurs are eating people?!?! strange, at least! The plot is: One dinosaur has freaked out and started eating all the others and everything it could find on the way. Boring! All Computer-generated imagery and almost nothing else besides that. Again, I had to fell asleep... It's impossible to watch it without! When I woke up, I find I didn't miss nothing...oh! wrong! I missed one or two dino-kills. I have to say that i liked the other jurassic movies. This is the worse of them all and one of the worse movies i saw this year.",2,62,124,14 August 2015
This Is Spinal Tap," This is final crap!
","Oh! My God! This movie is awful. Almost as bad as 'the hangover'. Some people find this movie to be funny. Some dare to call this kind of filming: Humor! Obviously in my opinion they are seriously wrong. There's no humor in here. No laughs. Nothing is funny about the movie. It can be really annoying at times. It's the same empty, humor, over and over again. So annoying. I couldn't watch it till the end. I think no one has ever finished viewing the movie. It's impossible. Hum...maybe if someone forced me to watch it the way they did in clockwork orange; but then I'd had to throw up. 8.0? Is it possible? Utter crap!",2,12,40,20 February 2015
Inception," crap!
","This is not a good movie. This is not an original movie. The story is not entertaining. There is no moral support to the behaviour conduct of the characters. There's a bunch of stupid rules one must obey to handle with certain subconscious layer. Can this movie be compare with Matrix? yes. But is comparable? no! Why? Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever; this one is not. It pretends to be a great movie, it pretends to be smart; they try to make intelligent dialogues and original plot...but they are just trying...nothing gets out of there! It's very easy to get it...the story...the layers...the subconscious, the ego, the alter-ego, the id...but what do they do with this concepts? the usual cliché...the struggle between the instances of the personality. Nothing original...no entertainment...no good action. This is just another sci-fi movie, nothing else",2,4,10,30 August 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 8.0? gotta be kidding
","The actors are good and did well. The movie sucks big time! This is not Oscar material. No way. Too boring. Some say its a satire. O.K. maybe; I don't care. I'm not in showbis. I want to be entertained, and that didn't happen.O.k. I'll admit: I could not see it through the end. I tried. While I was watching it I was always thinking: 'wait...this movie won the best picture Oscar...it has to be good. The actors are good...wait...something will happen.' Well...I waited and... Nops. Nothing. Very hard to watch. Almost unbearable. Too painful. I really tried, but I had to quit. This movie is even worse than last year Oscar winner 'argo'. I have to say that the academy is going the wrong way. Deliberations are too political and somewhat cosmetical. This year the best movie was: Interstellar. There!",3,7,13,1 March 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Warning! Read this If you liked this movie! Seriously important!
","If you liked this movie either you are a female in hunger or a man with personality disorders. I read in a newspaper that a recent study reported that the woman who find this movie to be good have serious repressed sexuality issues. On the other hand, the guys who enjoy this movie apparently had problems in early stages of sexuality development. So if you had psychological growing issues during the organization of your individualization (separating from your mother) you will, for sure, like this movie; you can even feel some kind of pleasure by watching this perverted man (with serious sado-masochism disorders). It goes deeper in the early stages of the sexual development as Freud described it. I'm referring to the anal phase. The retention and lose of the faeces. The way you deal with it, and you cope, could determine sexually fixations, such as this. To the woman who wrote this story, this is also true; but, anyway, all the movies tells a lot about the ones who wrote them. Actually it seems that the movie could act as some form of catharsis, helping the writer to externalize her deepest, repressed and not fully-understanding desires. I must tell you, also, that this sexuality behaviour is not normal. Most of the people don't engage in this type of sexuality (wich in fact consists in a behavioural deviation) as the main form of satisfying their desires. Thankfuly! So, be warned. If you are one of those, there's still hope. Find a good analyst and deal with it. The world is full of people in psychological need. Don't be ashamed to ask for help, or cry for freedom.",2,3,10,18 February 2015
Mother!," Run to your mother
","This movie is awful. The story is awful. The pace is awful. The tension is awful. I totally hated it. I think that I never felt such an urge to stop watching a movie like this time, and I think I didn't do it because of one thought only: 'The actors are good, the director is good...there must be something in it..lets give it a try...'..gosh! it never ended...too long...too boring...annoying...irritating. At times I felt I had to scream: horrible! They were always repeating the same idea...over and over again in a two hours movie. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't...not one bit. I hated it. I will never see it again and of course I don't recommend that you watch it.",1,25,41,7 December 2017
Blade Runner," Can't touch this!
","Best movie ever. Can't be beaten. I've heard that someone wants to remake this masterpiece. Why? There's nothing to rebuild, there's nothing to add and there's no scenes to cut. Every frame is Epic. This is the best interpretation of a character by Harrison Ford. No other artist could play a soundtrack of this grandeur like Papathanassiou did. In my opinion, the best soundtrack of all. The scenarios are majestic, the pace is the right one, the mood is incredible and the story still touches me. Visually this movie is absolutely stunning. My advice: don't remake the movie. It's not possible to do better; so why bother? Maybe a sequel or a prequel... This is THE MOVIE! like Hammer used to say: Can't touch this!",10,2,6,3 July 2014
Cloud Atlas," Wachowski 'Matrix' brothers... really?
","I'll start by state a cliché (like those in the movie): This was the most pretentious film I have ever seen. The idea with telling different stories serving a bigger and common purpose (which would form the big picture at the end) is not only overused as it's...I don't know.... (another cliché: boring?) The whole movie reeks of wanna-be intellectualism...and it's so sad that it has to be like that. All of the story lines are really boring...(annoying)like...nothing happens. The idea they're trying to sell is so simple...how could anyone thought that this poor idea could bring a fine and entertaining movie? Like: 'everything is connected and your past actions will influence the future'. Hum! I've never heard that before. Really? Could that be true? I never thought of that! Please! Put some serious effort on it...we are talking about the 7th art....try, at least, to make artistic, original, beautiful.... This is just another pseudo-intellectual movie...only this one is full with babytalk dialog and really bad makeup!!! Many of the 80's sci-fi movies are better than this one. The characterization is so poorly done. there are some visually stunning scenes; not enough to safe this crap. My final question: ' How or why the Wachowski brothers accepted being part of this....I don't even know how to name it....babe movie? There's only one idea in the movie. And it's an overused idea, and very very simple...I'd say ingenuous one.",3,4,10,10 January 2013
Green Book," Normal, average...actually a bit boring!
","This movie is just average. It's too soft, too slow and almost nothing happens. The acting is just ok. Nothing to remember in years to come. The storyline is way too predictable. The sound effects are almost zero; like the background music. I didn't feel strong emotions in either way...positive or negative. Medium movie with medium feelings associated to it.
'GreenBook'; 'Moonlight'; '12 Years a Slave'...it seems that Hollywood has found a way to purge American's Guilt over years of opression. These are definitively not oscar material movies!",6,5,10,28 February 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," I hated it, but I can totally understand why people would stay in the theater and find it good!
","If you want original plots, watch 'triangle' or 'the caller'. Very good movies.This is just boring; adds nothing new. If you've already seen 'the hunger games' - which i also didn't appreciate - or many others sci-fi class b movies, you will find this one boring and absolutely unoriginal. In fact when I realized what was really going on, i couldn't care less about the destiny of the characters. It's absolutely ridiculous and no tense at all.If you're one of those who find this movie funny...either you're 10 years old or you have brain damage! There's nothing funny - And I enjoy comedy a lot. Good comedy: not 'hangover' type though. 'Shaun of the dead', for instance....'evil dead' another good one. 'Tucker & dale vs evil' or Peter Jackson's 'braindead' - this are great! Don't waste your precious time on this one. Absolutely Ludicrous!!! p.s. - Can you believe that they kept ghosts held in a compartment room? unf...believable!",4,1,4,20 August 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," Maximize your expectations
","First of all, I can't understand why some people walked out of the theater (some of them after 90 minutes). Some other are saying that it's only action with no storyline, and therefor hated it. Others are saying that the trailer seemed like a very different thing, and much better than the movie. This doesn't make any sense at all. If you saw the other mad max movies, you should know what to expect. If you saw the trailer, the deduction is the same, and if you appreciate solid movies with great storyline, you probably should watch drama, and not action. You go to see a movie with this name: 'MAD MAX', you saw the trailer, you probably watched or at least have read something about the previous mad max movies, and still you wanted to see a movie with a great storyline!...something is escaping me...whatever! Well, I loved it...the action is great, the sound superb, the scenarios and color wonderful, and all the actors delivered. Oh! and if you could wait 1 hour and a half to walk out, you probably could wait another half hour and see it through the end. That's just my opinion.",9,4,12,17 July 2015
The Proposal," Uau! I saw Sandra Bullock naked!
","You can actually see Sandra Bullock naked in this movie!!! and man, she gets better and better as she ages! Besides that, the movie is very entertaining, although with the cliché dialog and the usual and predictable finale! But did I say that Sandra Bullock appears really naked? and...Jesus...she's so beautiful! About the movie..about the plot, about the acting...bah! that's not very important!...the important about this movie is that you realize your life is going to change when you leave theater, because you capture the message of hope and honesty, and you learn that you can only feel complete when you stand for what you believe, no matter what....or is it because you saw Sandra Bullock naked and now you can walk all the way home with a smile on your face?! Damn! she is gorgeously hot!",8,4,13,23 July 2009
