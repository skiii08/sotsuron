Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," me speck Jar-Jar taste like chicken
","Hype.  Too much hype.  Not enough time behind the pen.  We don't care about special effects.  When will they get it?  It's fluff, do it when it makes sense, stop writing scenes around it.  And a 10 minute pod race? What the? A great trumpet player could hold a high E for 60 seconds, that doesn't make it art.  Lose the weird alien versions stereotypes of earth, e.g. Jamaican Jar-Jar, Asian Traders, and Italian Junk man.  That's just stupid-creepy. A tip for Lucas, who wouldn't listen, although he has more money than the Pope and could afford to take a chance at losing marketing:  Write dialogue, develop the characters, give your main bad guy a speaking part.  Give your main good guys  a chance to act with out S-FX help.Lucas sold my childhood, but the Wachowski Bros. bought it from him. See the Matrix.  THE MATRIX, I promise you, The matrix is the new Star Wars. But good luck finding an action figure for it.  The Matrix doesn't have Ewoks.  If you like the mythology Star Wars is based on, you'll love the Matrix.  The Matrix.  See it.  Right now.  Or, better yet.  Do like I did and go see it right after you see Phantom Menace... it'll cheer ya up!",5,0,1,17 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Ewoks taste like chicken.
","Okay, I give up.  Apparently George Lucas thought that Star Wars did so well because of the merchandising.  Thus, from his head did burst forth the Ewok. (Ewoks seem to be based on Australian tribes people, which is actually a lot better than the crazy Jar-Jar primitive race alien in Ep. 1.)  The story for this movie is excellent, the movie itself is just so half-assed.  I think the entire movie can be judged on the scene in which Luke is fighting off the giant monster creature in Jabba's lair.  The blue screen my weatherman uses looks better than that.  There was really no point in adding new scenes to this film, if not to clean up at least that one shot.  And although Lucas never expected to shoot Empire or Jedi, I'm sure that somewhere in the back of his head he must have been thinking that Mark Hammil would mature into an actor with a more Jedi-like screen personality. Please vote for this movie, I gave it a 5 out of 10, help get it out of the top 50 at least.",5,8,15,17 June 1999
The Matrix," It could happen to you
","Remember the movie 'It Could Happen to You?'  It starred Nick Cage as a cop who wins the lottery and splits the winnings with a local waitress.  Well, I thought this movie was much more believable overall.  Not a bad feat for a sci-fi flick.  I've read several negative reviews by other imdb members, notably one that said the matrix was trying to be a William Gibson novel movie.  I found pretty much everything this person wrote to be unsubstantiated gibberish.  I'm not sure what the author would have done differently had he/she (I don't know any females this bitter) been given the script and budget... but I bet it would resemble 'Wing Commander.'",10,0,0,21 May 1999
