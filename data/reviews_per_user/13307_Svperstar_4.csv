The Ring," One of the best horror movies I have ever watched.
","I just got home from seeing The Ring. OMG This is one of the most unique and freaky movies I have ever watched, to talk about it in depth would give away the plot so I won't do that but this is one of the most enjoyable movie going experiences I have had in a long time.No big name actors, no over the top gore, no predictable plot that has been done 100x before, I was 100% entertained. Fantastic. 10/10.",10,0,0,23 October 2002
The Others," Better then most horror movies.
","The Others is a great movie to watch if you want great visuals and no lame special effects. It really annoys me that people will compare this movie the the Sixth Sense, when Jacobs Ladder is a better comparison to make(much better then the Sixth Sense and came out years before).It is very paced but it works out well. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,8 September 2001
The Usual Suspects," Good movie, if you just watch it as a movie and not as a way to stroke your ego..
","This is a good movie with a good ending. Now if you look through these comments you will see person after person ready to rip it to shreds to prove how they are just SOOOO intelligent compared to average movie goers, this happens with almost every plot twist movie.The amusing thing is how almost all of these comments state something to the effect 'I heard friends tell me this is a good movie and had a great plot twist but after sitting down and examining the movie the plot twist is stupid.'When you go into a plot twist flick ready to pick it apart no plot twist in the world is satisfying, I am a huge fan of Jacob's Ladder so to me the Sixth Sense was no surprise at all, I figured it out in 5 minutes, and was rather disappointed. Does this make the movie an 'insult to my intelligence?'No, I was just already familiar with that kind of plot so there was no twist in it for me. Almost the same thing happened with Fight Club, I overheard people discussing the fact that it had a plot twist so when I sat down and watched the DVD I figured it out rather quickly.The Usual Suspects was totally different, I had never heard of the movie and picked it out of my friends collection since I had never seen it and was in the mood to watch something new, I knew of no plot twist and had heard no hype. I am sure if it had been hyped up by friends and family I would have figured out who Soze was as soon as that character was mentioned but I wasn't in 'catch a plot twist' mode. I was in 'sit back and enjoy a movie' mode.The ending came as a surprise and I enjoyed it immensely.So anyway, watch this movie to watch a movie, not a way to prove your superior intelligence to your friends.",10,1,3,22 May 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Boring pretentious crap.
","As soon as I saw the dancers singing Smells Like Teen Spirit I started laughing at this movie and couldn't stop till 30 minutes till then end, then it just bored me.I can't believe this made it as high as it has on the IMDB top 100, if you want a real classic from the top 100 watch Seven Samurai, this movie is a waste of time.",1,1,4,3 April 2002
