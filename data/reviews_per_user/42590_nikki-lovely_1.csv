The Avengers," A great action packed movie with the hero's we have come to love and know.
","It's really exciting seeing an actor in a movie then seeing them again in a different movie, you get a little bit excited that you know something or someone. Well when characters from movies are in other movies, just like with The Avengers, you feel more than excitement, it's very joyful. When your watching Iron Man and you see Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), then you see her in The Avengers, it's just a 'wow' moment. As well as all the other movies, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk,n even seeing characters like Nick Fury or Agent Phil Coulson, even Pepper Potts, also seeing Hawkeye, all come together to be in one movie, is really amazing. To see how their characters get along is very comical and brings you together. It makes you feel as thought we are just looking into their lives through separate movies. Even with the new television show, Agents of Shield.A group of S.H.I.E.L.D Agents including Iron Man find a Tesseract, a power source with unknown abilities. It is a cube like structure that Steve Rogers in Captain America took with him in a plane to the bottom the a freezing cold ocean. This is bad news. Loki, the brother of Thor and God of Mischief, comes to earth with the promise of ruling with the Tesseract's power. Thor arrives to stop his brother and then is recruited to the S.H.I.E.L.D team. Hawkeye is already working with S.H.I.E.L.D at this time, Loki then breaks free with the Tesseract leaving director Fury and Agent Coulson stuck. They have no other choice but to initiate the Avengers protocol. This will bring in Hawkeye, Black Widow, then Bruce Banner, who has contained Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. They work together to find the Tessaract and stop Loki from destroying the city, and then the world. The Tesseract suddenly activates and then creates a wormhole above New York. Loki uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and several agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. Thor captures Loki to try to convince him to stop what he is doing and to go back to Asgard with him, he then agrees to take Loki to the S.H.I.E.L.D aircraft to be imprisoned in a strong glass cell. Loki is just a distraction while the team are trying to locate the Tesseract. Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers try to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.The Avengers rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location, but quickly realize they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together he, Rogers, Stark, Thor, Barton and Romanoff battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed of Loki's control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mother-ship and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into free-fall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing to the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard. Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.Overall this movie has a wonderful cast, interesting plot line, action, romance, emotion, and humor. It is enjoyable to watch and a great time if your watching it with friends. I give this movie a big thumbs up it is definitely worth buying on blue-ray, no alcohol required to enjoy this film.",7,1,5,13 November 2013
