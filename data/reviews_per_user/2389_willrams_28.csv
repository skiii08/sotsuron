Miracle," exciting miracle
","The Disney film is the true story of Hal Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, the player turned coach who lead the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team to victory over the invincible Russian hockey team squad.  I am not a hocky fan, but this particular film held my interest and excitement.  The troubles and obstacles he had were not only his wife and family, but once she understood his way was the only way,  he knew to strengthen his selected players and obtain their explicit loyalty in order to win the Olympic victory.  Those in the audience as well as myself whooped and clapped at the final ending.  Kurt Russell plays a tough coach, but he gets things done.  Strong cast and exciting musical score. 8/10",8,0,0,1 March 2004
Catch Me If You Can," enthusiastic
","I saw this yesterday and entusiastically embrace any of Steven Spielberg's movie!  They are all unique and exquisitely produced.  Again I pay tribute to the actors involved, and the true story involves a super con-artist trained by his father, who becomes a pilot, a lawyer, a bank robber, and a super counterfeiter being chased by the FBI as the worlds most wanted; eventually the chief of FBI and the boy become close friends.  I enjoyed this movie very much.",9,1,1,29 December 2002
The Ring," Scarey Nonsense
","Supposedly based upon a true story, I found it confusing and much too long. However, it held my interest because the stars whoever they were, were very good; especially the children.  The interesting thing about this movie is that everytime something scary happens it is accompanied by loud percussion, or some weird musical sound.  Inotherwords, the scary sounds come before a calamity.  I think the editors could have done a better job; showing us the priorities in time sequence; not in back clips.  This is not a movie for kids under 12!",9,0,0,9 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Nefarious & scariness.
","A lusty loud and funny pirate tale.  Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is an unlikely ally of Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp.  He is so funny with his loose antics, and wild scary appearance.  They battle together against the most treacherous pirates led by Captain Barbossa, in order to save the lovely Elizabeth, played by Keira Knightley, the love of Will's life.  They recover the lost treasure that Jack wants.  A clashing of swords between Will and Jack reminds me of milder sword fights in 30s films with Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone.  An exciting film with good score, but it is scary and may be too much or too long for little kids.  As a big kid, I enjoyed it!  8/10",8,0,1,17 August 2003
Stripes," Zany comedy
","Two friends dissatisfied with their jobs join the army for fun and meeting girls, but they get into a lot of trouble and many misshaps before they win their stripes.  Bill Murray and Harold Ramis are two zanies and so are all their buddies.  It is rather a long film but time passes on to better days. I was glad to see John Candy and John Laroquette in it.  They were fine and funny actors.  Good to see some good ole comedies  7/10",7,1,2,26 July 2003
Troy," A Big Fat Eight!
","If you want a rousing Big Fat 8, go see this exciting and eventful film based upon Homer's great epic.  The siege of Troy by all the Greek forces. After ten bloody years, the Greeks are not going to leave without taking Troy.  Even though the CGI is recognizable in big huge battle scenes, there is much to be said for the fast pace and fine acting in this epic.  The film is 162 minutes long, but your interest will be held by the fast pacing and fine acting.  Laurels go to Brad Pitt as an audacious arrogant personality unforgiving until the end.  I understand the location locales were made in Mexico, Malta and London.  Directed by Wolfgang Perersen, the only criticism I can give is that the musical background rarely fits the action.  Too bad; somebody like John Williams would do much better directing the music.  It was good to see Peter O'Toole back again; he plays the part of Priam.  In fact he did so well and was so disguised with beard that I hardly recognized him at all.  8/10",8,4,8,17 May 2004
Malcolm X," Interesting
","At the time he was alive, I was not interested and not aware of really went on.  I saw this last night on Ch 54 YX.  It is interesting to note that most people in this country shy away from anything controversial.  Our country has spawned controversial people of all kinds, but no matter, we cannot blame the blacks for some of the outrageous things some of them do.  This film made me think about all this, and Denzel Washington who played Malcolm X Little did such a commendable performance!  He truly is a remarkable actor!  As Malcolm X he projects so well, but it was his attitude of revenge against the whites and authorities that brought him down.  It had nothing to do with what he said but it was the way he said them; his anger was so deep. It was his own Muslims who killed him which made him a martyr.",9,3,10,9 February 2003
The Caine Mutiny," historical drama
",Bogart plays a fanatical skipper in a war movie based on real life.  He made me a nervous wreck with his nervous give away at the end of the film. Van Johnson does a superb job in this too.  It's seldom you see him in a picture like this.  He was a song and dance man.,9,1,2,21 September 2002
Cold Mountain," Historical & Romantic
","It is based on a romance after the Civil War. It is a terrific story, but it took me half an hour to really get into it.  The first part was a bit boring but once I caught on (too many flashbacks), it became very exciting and heartbreaking.  Compared to Gone With the Wind, I'd say Cold Mountain is much better.  Now I know what all the hoorays are about; Nicole Kidman was terrific as well as her leading man Jude Law, and what a strange love affair they did have.  But the one who stole the show was Renee Zellweger.  In fact it took me half an hour to realize who the actress was; playing a distinctly different role, that of a strong self-willed southern gal, she stole the show as well as my heart.  If anyone gets an award, Renee Zellweger should definitely be that one to get it.  The war scenes are brutal and bloodthirsty, but they do not take long, thankfully, and the rest of the two and a half hour show is definitely a must see.  The musical score is mostly piano which I do like, and there are a couple of hillbilly character songs in it.  It's also at least a one hanky film if you are a sentimentalist. 9/10",9,1,1,10 January 2004
Spider-Man," Fun!
","When being bitten by a genetically modified spider a nerdy highschool student becomes like a spider with great power which he uses to fight evil and becomes a superhero.  Played by Toby Maguire as Peter Parker, he is magificent and mobile and really extends his superpowers for all.  I still remain a kid and thought this a great film - much better than Superman, and totally enjoyable.  9/10",9,0,0,16 June 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Intriguing
","Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, picks 11 men friends and after serving time in prison, plans on a big heist of Las Vegas Casinos; The Bellagio, The Mirage, and The MGM Grand.  They all belong to ruthless Terry Benedict, who by the way, has an interest in Danny's wife.  They are out to rob $150 M in a safe hidden below the Strip. This is a well produced and acted story, but it's not exactly the same story as the one Frank Sinatra was in.  It really was NOT AS FUNNY and exciting as the original film.  I was spoiled on that one; and I see it once in a while. Caesar Romero actually stole the original film!",7,0,1,30 April 2003
Gone with the Wind," Indominable!
","There was no better film depicting the American Civil War and how it affected certain people, both Yankees and Southerners. Gone With the Wind may have had several directors, but it certainly came out all right!  The self-righteous desires of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler and the troubles they had together and separately.  The sweeping drama of the war and it's miseries are all there!  Such a fine cast:  Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Olivia DeHaviland, Thomas Mitchell, Evelyn Keyes, and dozens more including Hattie MacDaniel, the first black person to win an Academy Award.  The film did win best picture for the year 1939.  9/10",Null,0,0,21 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Fantastic Awesome Adventure
","Yes this movie is a fantastic, awesome adventure, I found myself wrapped up in it and wondering why it took so long to end.  Well, they could have cut out some of the big war near the end which could have left an Intermission for 15-20 minutes to go to bathrooms, but since the studios don't do this anymore what can we do?  This should really be taken into consideration by all of Hollywood with films over 2 1/2 hours long. The tale is quite complicated and one has to listen very carefully to understand the story of the Middle Earth, and it's creatures.  The winning creature is the hobbit, a computer generated character who teases and cajoles and has a winning personality; one has to listen to him to really know what's going on.  Sam and his buddy Mr Frodo are continually beset upon by this hobbit who is practically in the nude.The acting is superb, photography is beautifully done, and the music is grand!  The editing is very good, too!It also helps for one to know a little bit about medieval history or witchcraft to understand this movie.",9,0,0,5 January 2003
Singin' in the Rain," singin and happy in the rain
","How could I forget the most happy and best musical of all 'Singing In The Rain' with wonderful dance routines by Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor (he just passed away at 81)his funny dance to 'Make 'Em Laugh' is hilarious; Jean Hagen, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse (another great dancer); the fabulous movie with wonderful music, and all that great talent will always be remembered.  The story is how the talkies began.  10/10",10,1,4,28 September 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," Not much to say
","This is the dullest, slow moving, gangster film I've ever seen.  Saw it on TV tonight, and wondered why I watched it all the way through even though there were plenty of commercial breaks; yeah, breaks up the film's intensity and story line; and such good actors are Robert DeNiro and James Woods.",6,4,10,24 December 2002
The Last Samurai," Fighting for Honor
","A Civil War veteran played by Tom Cruise gets to train troops of Japan's emperor in 1876, and how to use modern weapons to defeat the last of the samurais.  He is captured by them and learns their traditions and code of honor.  The picture is a magnificent piece of gorgeous photography, the musical score is great, and the acting is superb. I got a bit bored by too much warfare and destruction, although I know that's the way of war.  I found it much too long at 3 hours.  8/10",8,0,0,14 December 2003
Titanic," commendable
","An exciting story about the sinking of the 'unsinkable' Titannic on February 4, 1912 with the loss of over 3,000 passengers.  The story is viewed by 95 year old rescued woman played by Gloria Stuart. Her viewpoint of her love affair with Jack Dawson who gave her strength to carry on.  Jack Dawson is played by Leonardo de Caprio and his lover played by Kate Winslet.  She tells of an exciting escape from the vessel on that dark cold night.  The film lasts 139 minutes with an intermission..  Fine acting, music, and some very intense moments.  John Cameron is the director, and he and the film won several Academy Awards for 1997.   This is one of Leonardo de Caprio's best movies.  7/10",7,2,4,21 April 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Delightful Story
","Yes, indeed, this is a delightful story and the images for kids of all ages to see.  I wouldn't recommend it for very young kids, though, some scenes are too violent or scary.  Haven't read any of the books, but I'm keeping abreast of the movies, and looking forward to the next phase for Harry Potter.  The young man who portrays Harry Potter is a good actor and very engaging.  His facial expressions are so natural with each emotion.  Story and music are also beautiful!",8,0,0,26 November 2002
The Untouchables," spellbound
","Federal Agent Eliot Ness played by Kevin Costner sets out to nail Al Capone, played by Robert de Niro, the chief of rampant corruption in Chicago during the 1920s.  This film I understand is not entirely factual, but the intensity and fine acting are superb.  Sean Connery won an Academy Award for his robust role as a cop.  The film is one of the best of Brian De Palma's, and the writing credits are attributed to two novels; one by Eliot Ness, and the other by Oscar Fraley.  I had never seen this before until today on TV, and it had me spellbound by the intense emotional acting of Costner and Connery.  9/10",9,1,2,19 October 2003
Mystic River," Overbearing!
","Highly overrated and much too long.  I looked forward to a better story, but the music and acting held my interest to almost to the  very end when I had to GO.  To me it was such an overbearing story with 3 too many victims in a murder mystery.  A 'who-done-it' with too many gory problems.  The 3 are childhood friends who grow up with such hatreds you'd never believe, altho we the audience know from flashbacks 'who-done-it'.  Best acting job was Tim Robbins who I hardly recognized.-- 6/10",6,0,0,4 November 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," Merry Chhristmas
","I have seen this movie many times since I was a child, and it is still an awe inspiring comedic drama, and really the spirit of Christmas!  Despite the holiday it is good for any spiritual faith to grow.  Frank Capra was at his best for direction; the acting was superb with James Stewart and Donna Reed, and many of the old-time favorites including Lionel Barrymore, H. B. Warner, Henry Traverse, Beulah Bondi and Ward Bond.  9/10",Null,0,4,24 December 2003
When Harry Met Sally...," Cute Fun Romantic Comedy
","They had known eachother for years and were close friends, but they had to discover who they were and could they stay friends with or without sex. Harry, played by Billy Crystal, and Sally, played by Sally Kellerman, were both headstrong and willing to understand eachother.  Even their best friends played by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby were a real match, so Harry and Sally had to learn the hard way.  It took their best friends' marriage plus Harry's willingness to admit he really loved Sally --- and so he proposed marriage on New Year's Eve.  In other words, they were two of a kind.  This was a cute fine wonderful love story and so very unpretensive; enjoyable!  One of those 'feel good' movies.  It reminded me of 'Sleeping in Seattle 1993'.  7/10",8,2,4,17 January 2004
Raging Bull," Riveting Life Story
","I hate boxing pictures with a passion, but after seeing this biography of Jake LaMotta, played by Robert DeNiro, and Joey his brother, played by Joe Pesci, I found myself rivetted to the TV.  It was on Channel 4FX Sat. March 1st.  The language is atrocious, but the direction is extremely well done by Martin Scorsces.  It was a black and white film and some actual fight scenes were in it.  Although he was a winner, his life was full of crooks and family and a tragic ending",6,1,6,2 March 2003
Ben-Hur," Fantastic
","Aside from Gone With the Wind, Ben Hur is my favorite of all spetacular movies..  It is the story of a Jewish aristocrat who is jailed by his long lost buddy for an accident, and thrown into prison; but he excapes to Rome and becomes a Roman.  When he returns, he finds his mother and sister banished to a Leprosy colony.  He finally wins his revenge on those who were against him.  This Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace is a wonderful experience!  the acting by Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, and Haya Haraheet is superb; the music and photography is beautiful; and the directing by William Wyler is excellent.  10/10",10,2,5,20 June 2003
X2: X-Men United," Fantasm
","I saw this yesterday and I'm not sure how to describe it, but it is a fast and exciting film to watch; every minute!  Plot is a little confusing about mutants fighting mutants and others with exraordinary powers.  You have to listen very carefully.  The war is between humans and mutants after a tentative murder in the White House against the president of the United States.  On and on with many action scenes and revelations.  Very imaginative; good photography; and CGIs; and great musical score. Lasts 2 1/2 hours. 8/10",8,0,0,11 May 2003
The Producers," crazy
","The only way Max, a producer, and Bloom, an accountant, can make any money on producing a Broadway show, is to make a colossal flop.  Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder and very funny, but when it comes to producing 'Springtime for Germany', their tremendous flop, did they make enough money to pay everbody off.  Dick Shawn won a Globe Award for his performance! I saw this on AMC TV today, and it is still extremely funny today!",6,1,3,8 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Beautiful Fantasy!
","I saw this film today with trepidation because it was the longest film I ever sat through without going to the bathroom.  I was thrilled and glued to my seat by the story of two pals, Fredo and Sam, as they approach Mount Doom to destroy the one golden Ring, unaware of the great battle that was to befall them.  The Hobbit is a real deceptive menace.  The medieval war between humans and barbaric ugly men is an unending story.  Several anti-climaxes, but still the whole production is a beautiful fantasy with beautiful music and choral passion!  The acting is super!  I've never seen anything like it.  Nothing can really compare to this film 10/10",10,0,0,25 December 2003
Gladiator," spectacular film
","I had seen this film four times because I was so excited about it, but never got around to reviewing it.  This is the story of Maximus, played by Russel Crowe, who won that year's Academy Award.  Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, the wicked Commodus, played by Joaguin Phoenix, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death.  The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies.  The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.  9/10",9,0,1,6 May 2003
