Come and See," Best Anti-war movie.
","This movie has reached the excellence in dramatizing the horror of the War in that contemporary (specially in that burning scenario), through the eyes of an innocent child. Who bit by bit turned into an exhausted partisan. As the movie goes on the the sequences gets harder and ends up getting you on the edge of your feelings. This is definitely one of the best anti-war movie ever made, though some-what ignored due to foreign language.I find myself lucky enough to give this movie a try without skipping it for the sake of those uncomfortable subtitles. This movie can be easily classed with some of the best antiwar movies ever made by many well know houses.",8,1,1,4 November 2012
Life Is Beautiful," (COME/trage)DY
","It is perhaps the only muvy on WWII where u experience & can feel all the horrors, pains n sufferings of holocaust yet with an curious smile in the edge of ur lips. It is a rare muvy which depicts tragedy in the ink of comedy. Benigni is just masterpiece at his work both as an actor as well as director. Perhaps this muvy is somewhat neglected due to its foreign language though we appreciate the awards (oscar) it won. Its highly dramatic & the escapes of the odd situations as done with the might of humor keeps one anticipating. I wud ask all WWII & quality muvy lovers not to go by the foreign language and rather give this a try otherwise u r really at a LOSS.",9,1,1,22 October 2012
