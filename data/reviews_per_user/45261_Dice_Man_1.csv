Come and See," A Relentless 'rite of passage' in the face of Nazi War Crimes
","'Come And See' - The title is taken from the Book of Revelation where people are invited forward to bear witness to the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, is a relentlessly mounted assault on our personal sense of justice in a war without rules. It is harrowing in places, disturbing in others, but never less than watchable - indeed, you may feel as I did that it was impossible not to look - you owe it to yourself to watch. The film follows an adolescent man from naive partisan recruit to the traumatised wreck he becomes through the experiences he undergoes as the German War Machine advances through Belarus in WWII.The Film itself has been criticised for it's own Partisan approach, yet it still (truthfully) lays to rest certain myths, particularly the one about the supposed non-participation of the Wehrmacht in Nazi/SS War Crimes.DICE MAN",8,2,4,1 May 2006
