The Ring," Hope Betrayed
","One thing gave me hope. As I sat through Naomi Watts' first few scenes, I knew she was playing the character wrongly, too strong, too directed, too much the antithesis of fearful. I think she could handle the Sigourney Weaver role from 'Alien.' But, thanks probably to the magnificent transformation Lynch gets out of her in the audition scene in 'Mulholland Drive,' I kept waiting for her character to change, to learn fear and grow in it, especially to show the effects of the social responsibility 'Ringu's' tape forces onto each it touches. She ever does. Maybe these things are in 'The Ring's' too-faithful script. But they're never in her eyes.Hideo Nakata I consider a clever hack. 'Ringu' is neither as visceral as 'Evil Dead Trap' nor as cerebral and horrific as 'Kairo.' Even so, my comment at 'Ringu' manages to back into some strong praise. No one who has a chance in hell of seeing 'Ringu,' even on a small screen, even your computer screen, should see this remake.What if Lynch had directed Watts in 'The Ring'? If only he had! Maybe draw a rule of thumb, something like this: Great directors can remake the works of hacks. Look at all the trashy mystery novels made into great films. Maybe hacks can remake great works. Roger Corman's Poe series. (Lucas' trashing of 'Hidden Fortress' must be the exception that proves the rule. Oops! No! Here's another one: Besson doing Jeanne d'Arc.) But hacks probably shouldn't remake the work of hacks. 'Ringu' simply doesn't support a careless, overly faithful remake like this one.",3,0,0,4 November 2002
My Neighbor Totoro," Beware the VHS
","After rewatching this recently on DVD, part of the box set from director Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, I wanted to buy it for my elderly mother. She'd been enthralled by Princess Mononoke at my place not long before. Since neither she nor my father can handle subtitles, I ordered the best I could find, a dubbed pan-and-scan VHS. What a disaster! But, a disaster with a fine message.Totoro, like every Miyazaki film, is a glorious soundscape. No less than the script and visuals, sounds--her own, verbal and not, and those around her reflected in her every squeak and movement, every sigh, every audible breath--establish the younger child, Mei, as protagonist. Without her unique pass, we have no entrance into the film. This old VHS, besides lopping off so much of the frame that ambient sounds too often make little sense anyway, mutes that part of the soundtrack in favor of vocals, killing nature and Mei along with it as surely as the 'villains' in so many other Ghibli films kill Nature. Mei's words are dubbed, but she's hardly alive here. Untampered with though, this may be Miyazaki's finest and Mei his truest characterization.",10,0,0,7 June 2002
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Okay, See it. But Not 'Til You've Done This Homework
","Shocks the hell out of me, but this is a negative review of a Miyazaki film. I loved it once when, not too long after its release date, it played a single day at Berkeley's UC Theater. It may have been only the second subtitled anime I'd seen, after 'Hi no tori 2772.'Last year I read Miyazaki's 1,050 manga of Nausicaä. The manga drew tears that rewatching on DVD simply did not. Watch the film, by all means, but watch it after, not before, you've read every page. The manga, much more so than the film, carries the roots of 'Mononoke' if those are what you're looking for. Find links there also, mainly in Volume 4 (or 6 and 7 of the Japanese), that don't make it into the film, to the woman/god flux of 'Serial Experiments: Lain' and 'Evangelion.'That said, the film is full of visual wonder, an extraordinary and necessary primer for everything Miyazaki would do thereafter. Reading those 1,050 pages won't absolve you from seeing it. Just, read first. Then see.",8,2,5,19 August 2002
