Deja Vu," Strong beginning and strong end, the technology spoiled it
","I am a true gear-head. It started by leading use to ask many questions. The point of Deja Vu, was never truly pointed out. It would have been better to play that point by slight of hand. The technology, while believable in the a theoretical realm, is not practical, but after all, that is what movies are all about. Doug Carlin offers many insights into what is really going offers many twists as to story line as the movies progresses. Doug will go to any length to save a woman for who he have fallen for. I enjoyed the two hour escape from reality. It is a movie worth watching. It had a great finish and it was worth every minute of it. Spectacular performances",8,1,3,25 November 2006
