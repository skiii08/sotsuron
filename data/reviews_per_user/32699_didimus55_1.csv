Lucky Number Slevin," Slevin gets caught up in a gang war
","Lucky number Slevin was a refreshing gangster movie with a great cast. Whenever you put Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, and Lucy Lui in the same movie your in for a treat. The performances are very good and the plot only adds to the excitement. Hartnett plays his obnoxious care-free character very well and Bruce Willis is cast well in his assassin role and once again comes through with a great performance. Lucy Lui provides a refreshing personality in the movie and as always Morgan Freeman play 'the boss' beautifully. Ben Kingsley may not be the most convincing rabbi, but he too plays his part well. The plot makes many twists and turns, some expected, but many surprising, and it's only in the last ten minutes when you finally realize what is going on. These last ten minutes of the movie allow you to leave the theater satisfied and happy. This movie is not a waste of time and if you're in the mood for a good time i strongly recommend it.",8,2,9,21 April 2006
