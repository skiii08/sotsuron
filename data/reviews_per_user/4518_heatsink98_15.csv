Skyfall," Fan fiction made into a big budget movie
","If you are looking for a smartly plotted spy flick, this is not it. To reference another film, this movie merely attempts to insult the intelligence of anyone who attempts to watch it.Some of the biggest problems stem from the technical aspects the writers chose to ignore with regard to plot devices. The main antagonist is a ticked off ex-spy with a penchant for hacking computers. So far, so good, until said ex-spy is given the ability the make computers misbehave in cartoonish fashion. He can access secret and secure networks that are not (or at least not in the real world) connected to the outside internet. He sets off an explosion in a secure building by hacking into the gas delivery infrastructure, which also seemed a bit silly and contrived. The main implementation of computers and networks in the plot is as magical technology the bad guy can command at will.Toward the end of the film, an armed military helicopter with the bad guy and his armed degenerates flies across Scotland to attack Bond at the old manor. Are the residents of Scotland accustomed to seeing this sort of thing? It's not a remote atoll or middle-of-nowhere location where the attack takes place, it's Scotland.Speaking of the Skyfall manor, the film made a strange detour into Home Alone territory with the defense of the location. The attackers were written as complete idiots, ala Home Alone, and I can't imagine the script writers did not notice the similarities.Overall, this movie might barely be worth a one night check-out from the Redbox, but don't expect much.",4,4,9,22 March 2013
Iron Man 3," Goofy writing sinks this Iron Man outing.
","The short version of the plot is: Tony has PTSD and has spent all his time building autonomous armor suits. Mandarin attacks Tony's house after Tony taunts him with his Malibu address. Tony goes into hiding and rebuilds, then attacks Mandarin's Miami estate. The final confrontation occurs on a ship where Mandarin has the President captive, and Mandarin plans to kill him.This film had problems in the departments of plot/logical consistency and tone. Some examples: The armor suits became mysteriously flimsy at the writer's whim. The writers also injected awkward comedy lines which didn't work. Tony's armor pieces flew across the country at between Mach 5 and Mach 10, which seemed a stretch even with the idea of flying armor parts. He decided to blow up his suits at the end of the film as a mechanism to provide fireworks, I suppose. The bad guys ability to heat things somehow disabled the mechanized armor, but only when it was convenient. I could go on.What we ended up with was a unsatisfying, sometimes strange, and ultimately disappointing Iron Man experience. I'm not sure how this script got green-lighted, but it needed to stay in the oven a while longer, if not scrapped altogether.",4,3,6,18 January 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Starts a little rough but gets there, sort of
","It's Star Wars, and the events that led up to Luke setting off on his heroic journey. And there's no Jar Jar, thank the maker.The first half of the movie is muddy on plot and could have used streamlining to go straight for the goal of finding Galen Erso, reluctant Death Star engineer. It involves a convoluted storyline of the rebel alliance randomly finding and rescuing Jyn Erso from an Imperial work colony, or was it random? I couldn't tell.Moving on, the plot next involves the rebel alliance convincing Jyn to work with them to find rebellious rebel and sometimes crazy person Saw Gerrera. They also want to find a traitor Imperial pilot who's working for Galen Erso to point everyone to getting the Death Star plans for the rebel alliance. Or something along those lines. The bottom line is: get the Death Star plans to the rebel alliance by using the traitor Imperial pilot as the courier of a message about the Death Star's weakness and Galen's family exposition meant for Jyn, only the courier goes to Saw Gerrera instead of the rebels and didn't bother looking for Jyn for some reason.Right, the plot bobs and weaves until Jyn and her rebels track down Galen Erso, who promptly dies during a rebel bombardment of the Imperial research station where he's been working. Jyn and her companions then try to convince the rebels to do something about the Death Star, but they refuse. Our heroes then attack the Imperial data storage facility planet that houses the Death Star plans on their own, drawing in everyone for a fairly significant battle. The movie picks up here with the space combat and the assault on the storage facility, and was more interesting than the first half.The film was mostly enjoyable, but there are a few logic problems that turned up, so it takes a strong suspension of disbelief to get into it. The Death Star plans and its weakness are summed up by Galen Erso in his hologram message smuggled out by the Imperial Pilot, so why need the plans if everyone knows the rebel pilots could fly down the trench and drop bombs in the thermal exhaust port? Also, why bother going after Galen Erso in the first place, if the Death Star is already built? If the space station were still in planning stages, this might be more understandable. A certain important character later ends up with the Death Star plans, and she's just been hanging around during the big space battle at the end for what reason? Anyway, stealing the Death Star plans as the story goal is another problem, since this a prequel and everyone on this planet probably already knows the outcome of the mission. I suppose that leaves us wondering about what happens to the heroes of this story as a reason to watch it. But it's Star Wars, so watching is fun. Just don't focus on the logic problems and enjoy the big battle toward the end of the movie and remind yourself there's no Jar Jar.",7,1,5,15 December 2016
Knives Out," A mystery without a hook
","KNIVES OUT starts as a murder whodunnit, but it quickly answers the question and leaves little reason to keep watching. We also fly off into first-hand accounts of what actually happened by peering into the minds of the suspects. If you're a movie-goer who enjoys watching oddball characters flail about in dry comedy, this is probably for you. For viewers looking for a story with plenty of mysterious or murdery goings-on, there's not much here. As other reviewers have mentioned, Daniel Craig's southern accent is a misplaced prop that gets in the way of the shots.",5,1,1,27 June 2020
Aquaman," This movie's heading changes with the breeze
","Inconsistent. That's a problem that plagues this film from start to end. As a prime example, some CGI effects are spectacular, some not so much. Compositing is atrocious. Amber Heard's red hair frequently has a white glow around it because the composite work looks like it was done in minutes on a $5 budget. And what's with the horrific anti-aging effects at the start of the movie? The actors looked like they had rubber masks glued to their faces.The direction is just as up and down as the script. Tone is all over the place. Goofy one moment, serious the next, and then back to complaining about missing happy hour at one point by our hero. WONDER WOMAN'S excellent story provided some hope for DC's film universe, but AQUAMAN didn't carry on with the work.",2,1,3,11 August 2019
Begin Again," Music interspersed with a weak plot.
","Short Version: Mark Ruffalo plays Dan, a music industry has-been, and he is dumped by the label he helped found. Keira Knightley is Gretta, a musician and dumped girlfriend of Adam Levine's Dave in the film. Dan and Gretta meet in a bar when Gretta's friend prods her onto the stage to play a song she wrote, and then the pair work to produce a demo album for the rest of the movie. Dan takes on the role of Gretta's mentor, which gets a little weird when he recreates his first date with his wife with her.Dan is a rough-around-the-edges alcoholic and is on the outs with his estranged wife and daughter. Gretta is in recovery mode after Dave dumps her. Both characters are working to fix their relationship woes in the film subplots.What sinks this film is weak story drivers. Dan lost his job, but so what? We find out he's tight with Cee Lo Green not far into the movie, and Cee Lo is more than willing to help him monetarily with the album he's working on. There's no big threat looming for him: Dan's wife and daughter aren't threatening to move far away if he doesn't straighten up. The IRS isn't hounding him for back taxes, so he really needs a big score or else. Gretta is in the same boat, plot-wise. Her ex-boyfriend is a jerk, so why would she need to get back in his good graces? There's nothing driving her.Verdict: This film is maybe worth the money to watch if you only care about the music scenes. The plot behind the music is weak and drama-free, so for movie-goers looking for a real story, it might be better to avoid. That's hard to say, since I like Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley quite a bit.",4,25,44,14 July 2014
Man of Steel," Loads of potential wasted
","The first forty-five minutes of this movie makes it look like we're going somewhere worthwhile, but from there it's a train wreck. The flimsy plot suffers from bad writing, but the occasional scene sneaks in with a snippet of decent story.The quick version of the plot is: Kal El comes to Earth; we see some back story; General Zod comes to Earth; there's a big fight; the end.I decided there must be missing scenes cut to make room for pointless fights. The thread of Clark's relationship with Lois Lane is an example. They have no development time between them, then smooch toward the movie end.The dialog was clunky. Lines from Clark and Zod came out sounding like something a sixth-grader might say. I can't fault the actors entirely for that, either. The lines were just bad.The science of the film stood out for the wrong reasons. The thing with science fiction is to make the reasoning of the science in the fiction sound believable, even if it is totally fabricated. For example, Clark boarded the Kryptonian ship and the atmosphere weakened him. The atmosphere is just magic that way. The importance of thought in the science department was traded for fight scenes that resulted in nothing but broken background scenery, and no plot advancement. About forty-percent of the movie was useless pugilism, which took up most of the second half of the film. If it weren't for the CGI environments breaking apart, the characters might as well have been standing around beating each other with Nerf bats for an hour. That might have been more entertaining, I suppose.",6,0,3,15 November 2013
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," What a letdown
","It's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out of this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to say.Plot-wise, things are a mess. Newt and his luggage full of magical creatures are a side plot to the important things going on. The real story is that an auror in New York is searching for a powerful and dangerous magical force that manifests within a teenager. His plan: turn the destructive energy the teenager carries into a weapon, I assume. Enter Newt Scamander, who is trying to transport a thunderbird(?) to Arizona for release back into the wild. Some of Newt's other creatures escape in New York, and he has to round them up, all while becoming entangled with the auror and his teenage target.The plot sounds sort of okay, but it's not well integrated. The characters don't add up to much of anything, either. The sidekick baker is fairly likable, though, along with his brewing romance with Queenie. Newt's a bit thin as a character. Eddie Redmayne's dialog also tended to come out mumbled, which made him hard to understand at times. Throw in a few acronyms and oddball words like MACUSA, and that makes for more confusion.Altogether, the film needed more work to tighten the story lines and make Fantastic Beasts a story focused on Newt and his menagerie, instead of what we ended up with.",4,411,636,18 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Too long, too...ugh
","Rian Johnson really did a number on Star Wars, and it's not in a good way. First, the nonsensical premise of this film: the rebel fleet gets in over its head against the First Order, turns tail and jumps to hyperspace. The First Order fleet follows, and then it's a chase until the rebel ships run out of fuel because the First Order can track them through hyperspace. That's the main plot of the film: get away from the bad guys, and it's not super interesting.The rebel fleet runs at sub-light speed and instead of splitting up and going in different directions, the fleet stays together to make them one giant target for the First Order guns. Yeah, brilliant tactician work it isn't, but Mr. Johnson thought that would be great for a plot. It's not. The First Order behaves stupidly as well by trailing the rebels instead of having a few ships jump ahead to blockade them. So that mess of idiocy is the backdrop.Meanwhile, Luke and Rey are learning Jedi smackdown techniques on Luke's private island, and Finn and new girl Rose hatch some ridiculous plan to find a slicer to hack the First Order tracking system. Did I mention Finn and Rose just fly away from the rebel fleet on a ship to carry out their plan? Yet another ding-dong writing choice.While Rey is training for a few hours with Luke (apparently he's developed a patented Learn-to-be-a-Jedi system that works instantly), the fleet is running away and Finn and Rose are working on recruiting their slicer. Then everyone goes back to put themselves in harms way and let the movie drag on some more until a climatic battle on Crait. And Luke pulls a remote-control Houdini to delay the battle and allow everyone to escape. That's right, Luke doesn't actually show up to battle, but he's there in spirit. Wonky.To wrap up, we've got a waaaaay too long script, screwed up main plot, and a few interesting side scenes. Not good. The best part might be the Star Wars universe and the flavor of lightsabers and stormtroopers, but other than that, the writing is a mess.",4,10,19,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A pretty good outing with a less known Marvel property.
","Short Version: Peter Quill AKA Star Lord, played by Chris Pratt, recovers an engraved metal orb from a barren planet. Said orb contains an infinity stone and Ronan, a renegade Kree, is after it so that he can wreak havoc on the galaxy. Quill hooks up with Gamora, Rocket and Groot, and Drax while they are in prison after a scuffle for the orb. The patchwork team works at first to sell the stone, but then later they try to keep Ronan from destroying the planet Xandar using the stone's power.The film has great visuals and plenty of action, but the acting and dialog flag in the first half. That's not to say the movie is awful, but there are some cringe-inducing lines sprinkled about. Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista are the major culprits with acting that gets pretty bad in spots, but they pick it up in the second half of the show.On a more positive note, the film plot is solid and there are snappy scenes with dialog that is spot on. Bautista's acting and lines are awful in some bits(see above), but in other scenes he gets Drax's literal interpretation of language and the comedy that results just right. Rocket and Groot are another source of laughs, with Rocket's sourpuss snarkiness holding up well as he translates Groot's three word vocabulary. Chris Pratt delivers a good performance with dialog that edges on cheese, but the joke is that the character knows it and lays it on thick.The film also contains comic book action, so extra suspension of disbelief is needed in some scenes. Pratt goes outside in space in a couple shots and only suffers a minor chill. Saldana is blown up in a spacecraft and floats in open space as well with no ill consequences. Science purists will likely grouse, but the film is about superheroes doing super deeds in a fantastic universe.Verdict: The writing is intelligent with just a few rough acting patches, and the action is great. And there are high quality gems in the dialog between the characters. Although Bautista's Drax has some of the poorer line deliveries in spots, he drops genius dialog in other scenes. Overall, the film is well worth buying a ticket to see.",8,2,4,1 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A whole lotta backstories
","In short, Peter Quill's father finds him in this movie. They spend time together on a far-flung planet, getting to know each other, and then we learn the family has a secret. And it's not good. All the while, the Sovereign and their drone fleet have it in for the Guardians, but that doesn't matter a whole lot. More on that below.Plotting on the second outing with the Guardians is a lot weaker than the first movie. This one spends quite a bit of time filling in character histories. The beginning also slips into wooden exposition of what's going on and what the Guardians are doing. The dialog has moments of snappy interchange, though.As for the overall plot, it needed work. Peter's father, played by Kurt Russell, is a character with immense power, and that causes a problem. He's so powerful, in fact, that he completely removes any threat to Peter and his friends for most of the movie. That makes for a dullsville plot. With a character like that in the mix, writing a strong plot is a huge task to pull off successfully. In Guardians Vol. II, it didn't work out well.What we ended up with was a dragging section from 1/3 of the movie on, at least until we learn what Peter's father is really up to. Then, we're back in business. The problem is that it takes waaaay too long for that to happen. The Sovereign and their drone fleet, as well as Yondu's bunch, cause some problems for Rocket, but they're a non- factor to the rest of the Guardians until the very end of the film.",6,2,6,4 May 2017
Wonder Woman," DC finally gets going
","What's going on: We see Diana Prince at her current job, working at the Louvre, and then launch into the backstory that sees her leaving the island of the Amazons and heading off to turn the tide of World War I. The journey starts with a fairly large dollop of exposition on Zeus and the Greek gods, then on Ares--the main troublemaker--then heads to the crash of Steve Trevor's plane, which catalyzes Diana to head off to war in an attempt to find Ares and end his corrupting influence in the world. So, this movie is one large flashback. The problem with flashbacks is that they remove all worry over our hero, since he/she is clearly fine in the present.The plot does have its logical issues, but the story is easily the strongest of any recent DC efforts. Notably, Zack Snyder didn't write this screenplay, and that's a positive thing. Gal Gadot does a fine job portraying Diana and showing her character's child-like delight in discovering the world she's never seen. Ice cream especially. Action scenes are really good. No problems there.Back to plot logic issues. Ares is a big question mark as to what's going on with his character. We find out he despises humanity and resents Zeus, which led to the original spat with the other gods that ended them. Ares likes to prove humans are destructive prats, so he goes around prodding them toward warfare. Since the other gods are now gone, that eliminates his motivation to thumb his nose at Zeus. Ares then states he wants to rid the world of humanity and return everything to a much nicer state--a pitch he makes to Diana at one point. Ares is a powerful Greek god. Why not just wipe out humanity and skip the behind-the-scenes prodding to give humans ideas on how to make weapons? Ares also seems to work against his own interests in various parts of the film by helping our heroes along. Other than providing a plot twist, why does he do that? Then there's the casting of our main villain, which didn't quite fit, but I suppose that's a matter of taste.Anyway, Wonder Woman is worth seeing. It's much better than Batman v. Superman by miles, and the recent DC films before it. Toss the logic for a few hours and watch Gal Gadot beat the tar out of the bad guys.",7,3,9,2 June 2017
Lucy," Great visuals but missing a solid plot.
","Short Version: Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, is a student/party girl in Taipei who hooks up with an unsavory character, Richard. Richard locks a briefcase onto Lucy's wrist and sends her to make a delivery. Lucy ends up as a coerced drug mule and is exposed to the drugs she carries, which naturally give her super powers. Lucy spends the rest of the movie tracking down the other drug mules to ingest the chemicals they carry, while evading the gangsters who initially grabbed her. She plans to use the drugs to push herself to 100% brain usage, because that's when the magic happens, apparently.The film has a decent initial hook which plays out like an origin story for a regular superhero, but things don't go anywhere after that. Lucy chases down the other drugs, but her character rapidly becomes unstoppable, which doesn't lend well to showing a character struggling to succeed. There are plenty of gunfights and Matrix-like scenes of digital weirdness mixed with reality, but the show is just a veneer with no substance underneath.The science espoused by Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman is a mishmash of facts bent with fiction, particularly the main premise of the story about the percentage of brain use in humans. Lucy's speech and demeanor become more robotic as her brain usage increases, but many of the characters have wooden dialog as well that is way too on the nose.Verdict: The movie is missing a true struggle by its protagonist, and the ending goes nowhere. It's worth buying a ticket if you're just looking for a shallow film with flashy gunfights but not much substance underneath, and you can tolerate sketchy science.",5,2,11,25 July 2014
Godzilla," Don't waste your money
","Short version of this movie: Godzilla fights two other monsters trying to lay eggs. Humans get in the way. That's it.The two hours this film takes up is mind-numbing. The bulk of the movie is meaningless scenes filling space between a few monster fights. And I mean meaningless. For example: the lead character has no stakes or motivation for an hour into the movie. This finally changes when monster #1 heads toward San Francisco where his wife and child live, and even that is weak when the city could just be evacuated.Verdict: avoid and maybe try a $1 rental when Godzilla exits the theaters.",3,6,13,23 June 2014
Annihilation," Logic holes sink this boat
","The film centers on exploration into an alien expanse called the Shimmer that has taken over a national park. It's a mix of horror elements, survival, and sci-fi mired in a strange choice to tell the story as flashback from the main character. So, at the beginning of the story we know the main character survives, and now the film is supposed to get by on a why-did-this-happen question. That doesn't work well. The horror elements, however, are reasonably unsettling through the middle of the film. Things go downhill toward the end in a far too drawn out allegory of sorts that finishes up in a ridiculous way out.Logic is a major factor in pushing this film's score way down. The setting is a national park that has been walled up for three years. Nobody notices. The search party (of seemingly semi-stable personalities) decides to go the extreme long way on foot to reach their target for no reason. The Shimmer has strange effects on radios and tech, but somehow video cameras work just fine. Memories and sense of time are affected by the Shimmer, but nobody bothers to write notes or keep a journal. Little bits like this make our fearless heroes seem like airheads lost in the jungle. Overall, this film could have been better.",3,1,1,28 March 2019
