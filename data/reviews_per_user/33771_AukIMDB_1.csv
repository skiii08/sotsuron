","I keep up late for watching this movie .. but its nothing but vogues .. at the end of this movie, at the same night I watched 'Just Like Heaven' it was awesome than( rating : 6.2 , till 28-aug-09) this.. By the way , story begins when a person wanted to get married and his friends wanted to throw a bachelor party to him.. We all know, its a common concept from various movies .. And they made lame jokes in every moment , I couldn't found anything interesting in this movie expect the ending.. but not much interesting.. In their bachelor at party they took drugs and lost mind and lost their one friend who is getting married tomorrow.. In the whole movie, they tried to find their lost friend and at last they found him at the top of the roof .. And at last he got married .. Simple and boring story ..Just a lame movie.. please don't watch it..",1,11,22,27 August 2009
