The New World," Has its moments, but...
","I loved 'The Thin Red Line' as well as Terrence Malick's earlier movies, and 'The New World,' which I saw tonight at a guild screening, is very similar in style to 'The Thin Red Line.' It is intensely visual, with many wordless sequences, and uses interior monologues/voice-over from several characters. Also like 'The Thin Red Line,' it creates a tapestry of nature and the elements to define its characters. The landscape, rivers, fields and forests are very much prominent characters here. The film is at times utterly mesmerizing and captivating on a visual level. However, it saddens me to say that overall, 'The New World' just isn't THAT emotionally involving. At 2.5 hours, it's long. And what's worse, it feels it.The cast does a fine job, and Q'orianka Kilcher is especially talented (and lovely), but the script isn't as strong or as focused as it needed to be. Still, I admired several sequences of powerfully visual storytelling, especially those depicting the lives of the native Americans, so in the end I would have to call my opinion mixed.",6,14,34,10 December 2005
Memento," Original and intellectually stimulating
","Very few if any modern movies can justifiably be called 'film noir.' MEMENTO is one of them.It chronicles a man's search for his wife's killer.  However, the man has a memory condition by which he cannot remember anything for longer than 15 minutes, so he constantly takes Polaroids, writes notes, and even gets tattoos to remember important information.  To place the audience inside this man's head, the filmmakers tell the story backwards so that we, too, never know what just happened.  It is a brilliant use of this device, for it's not just a gimmick -- it's the main way the movie achieves subjectivity with its main character. And in doing so, we share his paranoia and displacement, and that is a key element of 'film noir.'It's purposefully ambiguous even to the end.  You will be thinking and talking about it long afterwards.  Very good film, well worth seeing.",8,0,0,7 March 2001
The Thin Red Line," Mesmerizing
","Superb film, made with a dreamlike quality, which contains intense combat. The film emphasizes the utter fear of combat very, very well.  Before the soldiers even land at Guadalcanal, there is much screen time devoted simply to capturing the fear in their faces.  This carries over to when they're on the battlefield, too.  And you really feel like you are experiencing combat. It's terrifying.In the meantime, the film presents voiceovers of several characters, representing their interior thoughts and emotions about what they're doing and what they're thinking.  It's remarkable that a film of such great scale (hundreds of soldiers in the frame at once; huge battle scenes) could at the same time have such an interior, meditative quality.The film is also strong in presenting combat as a part of nature, as part of the natural cycles of life and death. We are all living things on this planet, the film seems to say, and even though war is a man-made event, it nonetheless happens, and we live and die like other creatures.On the one hand, this is the most expensive art movie ever made! On the other, it is a beautiful poem of a movie which presents gripping combat sequences while managing to stay true to its powerful, antiwar feeling. Try to see this on the big screen if at all possible.  It really loses a lot on TV.I also must commend Hans Zimmer on his excellent score.  It perfectly captures the strange, dreamlike quality of the movie as a whole.  It is one of the most haunting and beautiful scores I've ever heard. (And it was used in a PEARL HARBOR trailer.)",Null,0,0,8 March 2001
Windtalkers," lousy
","Saw an advance screening of this movie a few days ago. I love war movies and I was looking forward to this one, but unfortunately it is simply lousy in all regards. This is basically a 'Rambo' movie set in WWII, complete with glorified combat sequences (so glorified that they are almost offensive). There are spectacular fireballs and endless, absurd images of Nick Cage machine gunning dozens of soldiers without getting a scratch. The windtalking (codebreaking) should have been the central focus of the story and this could have been fascinating; as it turns out, we barely understand the significance of the work the Navajos did, and the Navajo characters are for the most part banal, dumbly grinning shells of characters. You will learn a lot more about the windtalkers from reading articles about this film than you will from the film itself. That is pathetic. This movie does nothing to honor the Navajo codebreakers. A good script, good acting, and involving storytelling might have been a decent honor, but they are nowhere to be found here.",Null,0,0,23 May 2002
