Ali," A Good Movie Except For One Problem
","It is a good movie except for one problem. The movie Ali is a story that should have been told a long time ago. The production can not be criticised. Michael Mann direction is fabulous. Ali, the movie does suffer under the casting of Will Smith as Ali. Smith does not have the range or ability to portray this 'living legend'. In many scenes he look nervous and completely out of place. I am afraid that many people will like Smith as Ali because he is playing Ali. The other cast member suit there roles much better than Smith who unfortunately is the downfall of the movie. Smith does play Ali well in the boxing scenes.",2,2,4,12 December 2001
