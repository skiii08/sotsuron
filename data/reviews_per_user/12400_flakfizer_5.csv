Requiem for a Dream," Mesmerizing
","Directed by Darren Aronofsky, who made a name for himself in 1998 with his art house success Pi, Requiem for a Dream is virtually a continual montage which apparently has more single cuts than any mainstream feature ever made.Comparable to a cinematic fireworks show (with a grand finale included), it is distinguished by an unexpectedly poignant center, the hopes and dreams of a pitiable group of drug addicts longing for a better life. Ellen Burstyn, who's been erroneously ignored by Hollywood lately, is heartbreaking as a bleary-eyed Brooklynite who, in the movie's only tranquil scene, sobs about her fruitless quest for happiness.Yet even she is at the mercy of the film's visual style, a clobbering assault on the senses that makes the experience of watching it nearly interactive. The Magnolia of 2000, which, depending on your taste, could be a good thing or a bad one.",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A Postmodern Masterpiece
","Nothing satisfies like watching a pig out of its pen, running rampant in the parlor--especially when that parlor is not only Hollywood but mother America as well. The movie South Park, based on an overrated scatological cable show, was an absolute declaration of war, an robust indictment against America's bulging irresponsibility, vile narrow-mindedness, and arch-conservatism.The humor is foul-mouthed, cynical, and very funny, but more than anything else it's subversive and topical, unprecedented even by the standards of satire. What movie has even commented upon the MPAA rating system or the television V-chip or the US military or Bill Gates or Barbara Streisand (among others), no less attack them so unabashedly?The crude aesthetic, of course, was integral, as were the fabulous musical numbers--on top of everything else, South Park is the best musical, as well as the best musical critique, in decades. I have met people who, quoting that old retarded adage, say that they 'just know they wouldn't like this movie'  But I predict that history will reward South Park the way it has Dr. Strangelove and Network--as a thunderously realized, albeit cartoonish, reflection of its time.",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
The Beach," Shallow waters
","Less than sixty-seconds into Danny Boyle's paradise-lost story The Beach, and we already know we're in dangerously shallow water. 'My name is Richard,' announces the tedious voice of our protagonist. 'So what else do you want to know?' Presumably the question is rhetorical, but it surely doesn't make our souls feel less tested two hours down the road. Based on a mildly acclaimed 1997 novel by Alex Garland, The Beach has absolutely nothing to say, not a sentence, not two words, not a cough of profundity in its entire length--but it's going to talk away anyway.But the movie is nothing more than harmless junk.  Leonardo DiCaprio, in his first major movie role in two years, does have his moments and, while none of them are perfect, this film ultimately proved that his supposed mighty post-Titanic power over Hollywood was wildly overestimated.",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
The Insider," Flawed but memorable
","Despite way too much so-called 'fictionalizing for dramatic effect' in the third act, Mann's riveting whistle-blower epic is high drama of the finest pedigree. It's a soft subject matter for the creator of Miami Vice and Heat (minimal violence, no one dies, no one really gets hurt), and Mann has been roundly accused of self-importance because of his overblown styling. The movie is indeed too long and too tumultuous--but if this is a product of a filmmaker's self-importance, then I wish more directors would wake up and start thinking more of themselves.",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Easily one of the Coens' weakest
","O Brother Where Art Thou is much too episodic and anecdotal to offer a strong narrative, though it does get better as it goes along.  Then again, I should mention that the story is based on Homer's The Odyssey (he's even credited in the opening titles), updated to the Depression-era deep South.Costarring John Turturro, newcomer Tim Blake Nelson, and a very uncomfortable George Clooney (and Holly Hunter, who's utterly wasted), the film succeeds mainly on the level of production design, cinematography, and music, but not much else.  All Coen films suceed technically; the mediocre ones like this do nothing else.",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
