Despicable Me 2," Awesome movie!!
","Even better than the first one!I have been looking forward to the movie so much and i am not disappointed.I love Agnes the best actually, and she has more scenes in 2 than in 1.And the minions were really amazing!!!!! There are more different types of them coming out! McDonald's Happy Meal have the toys by the way~ Gru is becoming more welcomed and father-like!PS: love Kristen Wiig and her voice~ Want to watch it again!!! Hope there will be a 3 next year!!!!! I think Gru and Lucy will have a baby of their own!!",8,1,3,6 July 2013
