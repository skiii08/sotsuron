Deepwater Horizon," Right up there with Titanic, The Revenant...
","I've certainly seen my share of incredible disaster movies (Titanic, Gravity, Twister, etc.) and epic masterpieces (The Revenant, The Dark Knight, Avatar) but for the first time ever, I couldn't convince myself that this was 'just a movie'. Somehow, Deepwater Horizon got right into my soul, and brought out the deepest and most intense emotions I have ever experienced. For the first time ever, I almost couldn't handle it and almost had to leave. I was absolutely blown away at how Peter Berg was able to create this movie with such incredible realism. This is the finest example of movie effects I have ever seen.I left the theater completely drained, and had to sit on a bench for nearly a half hour, to recover from what I had just seen. If you think you can handle this movie, I implore you to see it ONLY in IMAX. There are no 'standard' screens or sound systems out there that can do this film any justice. I must warn you - it is incredibly intense and easily the most realistic recreation of any disaster I had ever seen. I honestly never cried so much at any movie before - ever. And I am a 46-year old male. Go see this movie in IMAX right now, if you can.",10,3,8,12 October 2016
