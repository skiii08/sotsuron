Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It gets better every time
","Okay, I have seen at least 50 reviews from you people on this movie, and funny thing is, like it or not, they are all basically the same criticisms. I saw the film last night for the fifth time, and I loved it more each time. The first time I was disappointed, but the more I see it the better it gets. Perhaps it is simply not fair to judge such a big story after one viewing with too high of expectations. I am a classic Star Wars fan, saw Episode IV at 8 and grew up with it. Now for my comments. People have been complaining about Liam Neeson's performance, but I thought he was great. I love Qui-Gon, a very original Jedi character, a bit of a rogue/ronin, but totally dedicated to the Force. I eat up every line. Jar Jar. It was unfortunate Lucas decided to go for forced humor rather than let humor come naturally of the circumstances, like the dialogue in the original trilogy. I wished Jar Jar would have been a serious character like Chewie, another alien owing a  life debt to a human. I would have liked Jar Jar to be competent, not Jack Tripper. This stuff is never funny in any situation. Physically he was not funny at all, but his dialect and some of his lines were very funny. I find myself laughing at different things each time I see it. I almost wept for joy when I saw that Ian McDarmid would return as Palpatine, the true villain of the saga. George PLEASE give us the full poop on Palpatine. Don't let the movies go by without giving us all of it: how did he become a Sith, how does he train Anakin, etc. Natalie Portman has a real grasp on her role. She is a very talented young actress and very beautiful. Ewan was perfect. I look forward to him growing into the person he is in Star Wars. I liked his emotional devastation when Qui-Gon died. Everyone is complaining about the midichlorian thing, but I totally accept it as part of the whole myth. Bring it on. The notion that midichlorians conceived Anakin is a fascinating development. I look forward to more. I too was disappointed that Darth Maul didn't do more, but again he was, like Vader later, muscle. Palpatine doesn't want too clever of a pupil or he would be a threat. Having seen it over and over, he was used just perfectly. And what a duel. Here are my DOs and DON'Ts for Episode II, and I would be happy to help write the screenplay for no pay. DO cast a talented unknown to play Anakin. He must be physically large. DO allow John Williams' score to be heard! You literally cannot hear the music in most of TPM because of the dialogue and sound effects. A waste, because this is another great SW soundtrack. DON'T go for cheap laughs. DO demand more emotion from the actors. Finally, prepare to meet Mon Mothma, a young Tarkin (I hope!!!), Bail Organa, and don't be afraid to make it a little less 'kiddish.' For Episode III, I want to see a thoroughly corrupted Anakin, the triumph of Palpatine, and the slaughter of the Jedi. Obi-Wan will be utterly devastated by his failure. 'I thought I could instruct Anakin as well as Yoda. I was wrong.' I can see that Obi-Wan will try to emulate the defiance of his own mentor Qui-Gon, but it will backfire. Lighten up folks, this one had to set up everything, and for all its flaws, I welcome it as Episode I and look forward to the next two.",Null,0,0,20 August 1999
The Godfather: Part III," Every bit as good as the first two
","Okay, I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but here goes. First off, there are in fact, two flaws that hurt the film: casting of Sofia Coppola and the missing Robert Duvall. If you can look past these things, you will discover this movie is a masterpiece. For so many years, I would watch Part II and lament that Michael killed Fredo, that he lost his wife, and allowed the power to consume him. Part III addresses all of that. It is Michael's story again that one needs to watch and forget the things going on around him. I also liked the way the movie continued to borrow from reality with the Vatican plot. The movie is about guilt and redemption. Michael's confession, the meeting of all the mafiosos, the final scene on the steps, and the horribly tragic epilogue are all easily as memorable as anything in the others. Perhaps because it wasn't as much as a period film as the first two and so much time passed between II and III that it didn't feel like a 'real' Godfather movie to some. I say the music, direction and themes of the movie are right in there. After all, Puzo and Coppola wrote this one as well. The scenes with Diane Keaton are sad and full of regret. Andy Garcia is excellent and a worthy addition to the characters. I was moved by this one more than the others. Part I is entertaining in a cartoonish way, Part II takes about 10 viewings to get everything, but Part III settled down and addressed Michael and his real feelings of loss. Forget the obvious flaws and look a little deeper. The irony is delicious.",Null,0,2,23 August 1999
