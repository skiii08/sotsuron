Hereditary," What the HECK was this?!
","Slow, boring, overly dramatic draw outs leading up to pretty much nothing. Nothing gets explained, nothing gets talked about pretty much at all. This could have been cut down by at very minimum 45 minutes with all the drawn out dramatics and pauses with zero script just silence or begging for this that or the other. The very beginning showed promise, then, after the 'accident', it went extremely downhill. None of it makes any sense and of course they don't bother to explain anything either. So at the end it's just a huge WTF was that?! moment. Thankfully we didn't pay to see this at the movies....",3,0,1,31 January 2019
Bird Box," Very similar to other movies yet still with an original twist
","I really liked the movie however it was very similar to The Happening and A Quiet Place combined. Not saying it's a bad thing, just if you've already seen those then you'll know what I mean. I just hate how these types of 'freak happening' type movies never explain what the heck causes it to start with! They also don't seem to explain why some of the people who have looked, and lived, run around trying to convince people to look.....how did they look and live? Why are they trying so hard to convince people to look? What the heck?!",8,6,11,2 January 2019
