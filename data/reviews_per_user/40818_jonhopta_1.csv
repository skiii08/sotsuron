Lucky Number Slevin," A twist that blindsides you
","If you have seen and enjoyed Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Boondock Saints, or The Whole Nine Yards you will almost definitely enjoy this movie.This movie is smart, funny and cool. It grabs you from the beginning and brings you into a story that is fast paced and complex, yet you never get lost and are always ready for the next step.Lucy Liu is cute and bubbly, Josh Hartnett is cool and quirky, Bruce Willis is cold and dead-on. The supporting cast fits in perfectly around the story and main characters.The film is visually stunning and although it might totally stand out on its own, it definitely strenghtens the film category it falls into.The story and plot are remarkable, and you'll never see the hit coming.",10,1,7,9 April 2006
