Blade Runner 2049," Sensational
","I can't write one of the eloquent reviews that I've seen regarding this movie, but I was thoroughly impressed.One of the best movies I've seen in years - possibly ever! Okay maybe I'm getting carried away but I couldn't find a flaw in it.Definitely one for the best cinema you can find. Great sound and visuals. Great acting performances and thoroughly entertaining. Beforehand I was a bit wary due to the film length but now I hope to go back and see it with my wife. Hell no, I WILL go back and see it again.",10,7,17,7 October 2017
