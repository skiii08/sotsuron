Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An equal-opportunity offender
","In 80 minutes Borat manages to make fun of nearly every segment of American society from New York to California. This movie has something for, and against, just about anyone who would watch it, and with a huge dose of shock thrown in for good measure. I couldn't believe what I was seeing on the screen, and that made it all the funnier. Sacha Cohen is either fearless, crazy, or has a death wish, but either way he is my new hero.BTW - This movie is definitely NOT anti-semetic. The Jewish people shown in this movie are depicted in a positive light. Instead it makes fun of ingorant anti-semitism by showing it in an exaggerated form (like Borat's belief that Jews can change shape at will).And now, All Rise for the Khazakstan National Anthem:Kazakhstan greatest country in the world. All other countries are run by little girls. Kazakhstan number one exporter of potassium. Other countries have inferior potassium.Kazakhstan home of Tinshein swimming pool. It's length thirty meter and width six meter. Filtration system a marvel to behold. It remove 80 percent of human solid waste.Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan you very nice place. From Plains of Tarashek to Norther fence of Jewtown. Kazakhstan friend of all except Uzbekistan. They very nosey people with bone in their brain.Kazakhstan industry best in the world. We invented toffee and trouser belt. Kazakhstan's prostitutes cleanest in the region. Except of course Turkmenistan'sKazakhstan, Kazakhstan you very nice place. From Plains of Tarashek to Norther fence of Jewtown.Come grasp the might penis of our leader. From junction with the testes to tip of its face!",8,2,8,11 November 2006
Erin Brockovich," An inspirational story for foul-mouthed white trash everywhere.
","The message: Curse like a sailor, dress like a slut, verbally abuse your co-workers, demand respect and show none, viciously attack anyone who dares criticize, and expect special treatment because, somehow, you can claim victimhood for having 3 kids and not much else. In general, act like everyone owes you and you will live wealthily ever after (oh, being a former beauty queen helps also).What utter nonsense. Erin Brockovich belongs on Jerry Springer, not the silver screen. And as far as Julia Robert's acting goes, if her goal was to make me want to reach thru the screen and give her a hefty smack, she succeeded brilliantly.I want to say that the story of this movie is unrealistic, but maybe it isn't? If a person can really succeed with her tactics and credentials then our culture has serious problems.",3,11,21,27 October 2005
The Notebook," Guys Â– a good 'chick flick' to appease your woman
","The ONLY reason I went to see this movie was because I owed my wife a chick flick. She sat through that disaster known as Van Helsing with me (which she seldom lets me forget) so I owed it to her, and I only hoped that it wasn't going to hurt too badly or be too boring. I was quite pleasantly surprised, and must admit that the end of the movie left me in tears.I've read other reviews and have seen the words sappy, sentimental, manipulative, and shallow, and that some of the situations are hopelessly unrealistic. And yes, all that is true, but done in such a beautiful and sincere way that it didn't bother me that much. The two leading actors had excellent chemistry, but still not as good as between James Garner and Gina Rowlands.I'm glad I watched it. It didn't hurt.",9,1,2,22 October 2004
Predator," Unique storyline for an action movie
","Although in many ways your typical 1980's blow-em-up movie, I found the storyline to be refreshingly different.  It starts out as a movie about an 'elite' team of macho mercenaries on a covert rescue mission in South America (typical crap), but then weird things take place and pretty soon the hunter becomes the hunted.  If I hadn't already been aware of the story when I first watched it, the plot twist would have taken me by surprise. Although the acting is mediocre (the alien was by far the most interesting character), it was overall entertaining and well worth watching.",Null,0,0,12 January 2004
Van Helsing," Highly entertaining - for all the wrong reasons.
","My gamut of emotions while watching this movie went from interested, to confused, then to disgusted, then finally to amused.  This movie is so hokey and over-the-top that I finally gave up making any sense of it and spent the last hour laughing.  Van Helsing is low-brow Hollywood flash at its worst; a lot of fancy CGI effects with the barest minimum attempt to give the characters any, well, 'character'.  Van Helsing himself reminded me of some room-temperature IQed Fabio wannabee who thought his looks would get him through any situation.However, I must say I did like the new twist the director put on Frankenstein's character.  Instead of a lumbering, semi-aware goon that he's usually portrayed as, Van Helsing showed him to be a wise and highly intelligent creature with a quick mind and a sharp tongue (although somewhat grumpy and antisocial).  They should do a sequel with him as the star.",Null,0,1,27 July 2004
Bad Teacher," Two hours of wanting to throw a shoe at my TV.
","'It's just a movie, stop taking it so seriously.' my fiancé said as she made me watch 'Bad Teacher' with her. Unfortunately all movies must reflect some aspect of our culture in order to be successful, and the fact that this movie was even made I think reflects quite poorly on that culture.The lead character is a conniving, foul mouthed and shamelessly opportunistic gold digger that's been forced back into the classroom after being dumped by her rich boyfriend. She hates her job, her students and her co-workers and doesn't care who knows it, yet we're somehow supposed to root for her when she embezzles from a student car wash, smokes pot on school property and sleeps off hangovers in class. She wants a boob job in order to land a dorky but wealthy substitute teacher and resorts to theft, extortion, vandalism and outright felonies in order to raise the money to pay for it. Seriously dedicated teachers and parents are portrayed as clueless simpletons that she is able to dupe with relative ease.In the end she secures everything she sought by framing another teacher and destroying a budding romance, then decides she doesn't want it after all and walks away unscathed. I'm not someone who demands a moral message in the movies I see, but come on!",2,10,16,9 November 2011
1941," Why on earth did this movie bomb?
","My only guess for the dismal box office performance is that it was just too far ahead of its time. The superb movie-making abilities of Spielberg combined with an elaborate, star-studded comedy probably proved more than your typical moviegoer could digest back in 1979. '1941' is the only movie I can remember seeing that I thought was funny as hell when I watched it as a kid, and still thought it was funny 20 years later. The gags, characters, and elaborate sets lost none of their charm in the transition between preadolescence and adulthood (which is not usually the case).The story takes place on the California coast less than a week after the Pearl Harbor attacks. Both civilians and soldiers are skittish, paranoid, and seeing Japanese soldiers everywhere they look. In no time they lose all self control in a desperate effort to fight off a (mostly) imaginary enemy. I think with the sole exception of General Joe Stilwell (Robert Stack) there is not one person in the cast who stays sane or levelheaded throughout the movie.I am, of course, greatly oversimplifying the plot. The movie actually follows about eight or nine different story lines that eventually converge and feed off each other in a way seldom seen in cinema. The first 30 minutes are a bit slow as the movie sets itself up, but once it gets rolling you'll laugh till it hurts.",9,4,5,22 January 2004
Enemy at the Gates," A Big Disappointment
","Firstly, I must say that my review is not unbiased. I am an avid WWII historian with a deep fascination of the Russian side of it. The Russians suffered over 20 million dead in that war and bore the major brunt of the Nazi defeat, yet their contributions are virtually ignored in this country. So when I learned that a major movie was being made about the pivotal battle of Stalingrad, and from the Russian perspective no less, I was giddy as a school boy and counted the days till its release.What a letdown. I walked out of the theater feeling cheated.A brief storyline. The movie follows Vassili Zaitsev, a young Russian soldier thrown into the hell of Stalingrad. He turns out to have quite a talent for picking off Germans, and his story is latched onto by an ambitious political officer who inflates his deeds in the Soviet press to almost mythic levels. The Germans catch wind of his fame and dispatch an expert marksman of their own to bring Zaitsev down, and a duel of the Stalingrad snipers begins.First I'll point out what I liked about the movie. The technical accuracy was superb. The uniforms, equipment, and scenery were all dead on the mark (I did catch a glimpse of a Soviet helmet with a post-war Czech liner, but that's splitting hairs). They even made the effort to replicate some famous Stalingrad landmarks, and the special effects and cinematography were masterful. The highlight of the movie was when he gets off the train and sees the battered city for the first time from across a corpse-strewn river, a river that he must now cross.Now for what I hated:1. Even though the movie was taken from the excellently written and entirely factual book of the same name, the movie itself is pure fiction. In fact Zaitsev's story takes up all of two pages in the book. Much like with Braveheart they took a bare skeleton of actual events and pretty much made up everything else. This to me is a great and unforgivable sin.2. The love scene. It was totally inappropriate and unnecessary, not to mention it looked like he was killing her rather than making love to her. Did the producer hope to draw in women viewers with that crap? Certainly no war movie buffs that I know want to see that kind of garbage.3. Zaitsev's character. Vasili Zaitsev was in his 40s when this story takes place, and he was a trained sniper. He wasn't a Hollywood pretty-boy with gel in his hair.4. The ending sequence. I don't want to spoil things for anyone, but these two supposedly 'expert' snipers violate every known rule in sniperdom. They weren't quite Johnny Rambo, but the sniper game is one of stealth and patience, and neither one display it.But I guess my loudest complaint is that this movie had sooooo much potential, and this story sooooo needs to be told in this country. However, instead of sticking to the facts and appealing to purist nutcakes (like me) they had to pollute it with their Hollywood 'improvements' in an attempt to market to a mass audience, which only succeeded in alienating everybody. This could easily have become a great classic war movie like Patton or Band of Brothers, and I truly mourn for what could have been. Go out and buy the book, you will be a better person for it. Overall 2/5.",4,18,33,6 January 2004
