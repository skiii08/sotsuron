Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Visually stunning, but a messy and boring story.
","I didn't expect this to be the greatest of the series, because Dead man's chest was already showing signs of story stretching, but I hoped they would've been able to squeeze one more decent episode out of the franchise before all ideas about pirates and ships ran out.But it seems it was already too late. The movie started with a short introduction to the basic plot, but quickly moved onto a chain of action sequences with short interruptions, most of which weren't even relevant to the story. That's what this movie leans on heavily: lots of action, not so much a well written story. Most of the things that happen are very random, as if the script was actually thrown together from a handful of brainstorm session blurts. The worst part is that Jack Sparrow hardly has any decent lines, or antics, while his character is what makes this series so great.This means that even while the movie has loads of action, it's actually very boring. What kept me going was the eye candy, because it was definitely beautifully shot. Practically every scene was art, that's what kept the movie interesting for me, but that's it.All in all it's beautiful, but disappointing final episode of a great series. That is, assuming part 5 is actually canceled, which I think was a wise choice.",6,1,1,17 September 2011
Public Enemies," I wanted it to be good, but I couldn't finish watching it
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I first heard of it. Usually I won't see a movie just because of their actors, but in this case two of my favorite actors were up against each-other and that in a movie based upon a true story. That couldn't go wrong I figured, this had to be a great movie.It wasn't.The opening was OK, even though I rather have movies that start out slow. After that it just went downhill. The movie jumped from scene to scene and I had the constant feeling of having missed something, constantly hoping that things would become clear later, but that didn't happen. It was a simple linear story and it felt like it was told with multiple pages being skipped constantly. The love-story part felt very fake, unnecessary, uninteresting and even though it was probably meant to show who Dillinger was, it failed to do so. They could just as well put up a bullet-point list of his characteristics and it wouldn't be much less interesting. This already made me want to fast forward quite early in the movie.And about the acting of both Bale and Johnny. It was boring. Somehow I got the feeling they were both bored too and couldn't hide that 100%. Even the scene where they first stood face, which I was looking forward too, was also very disappointing. It was more of a stare-off, while you'd expect them to have to say a lot to each other. I can understand that they couldn't have made much more from a shallow script, but it makes me wonder why they accepted playing this movie in the first place.About the rest, the shots, the sound. Even though I saw a few comments on those I thought they were good, and made me watch as far as I got. The sound dynamics were annoying though, from whispering soft to incredibly loud and back again, but that seems to be the standard of movies these days.Anyway, even though I understand it's not at all historically correct, the story might have had an OK ending. I just couldn't watch anymore after being thrown in yet another one of the many long unexciting shoot outs. Wanting something to be good can in many cases give you the idea something is better then it actually is, but in this case it was not enough to even keep me watching it. And a movie has to be very bad for me to turn it off, I usually finish everything.So my advice is to skip this one, you're not missing out on much.",4,0,0,14 October 2009
