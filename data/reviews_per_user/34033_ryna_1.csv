"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Fabulous fun!
","This movie was so entertaining. It was full of great lines, and the actors were superb! Terrence Stamp was terrific as a transexual who was recovering from the loss of her lover. How he was able to keep a straight face through Guy Pearce's antics is beyond me! If you liked Memento, you really should check out Guy Pearce in this very different movie. He was completely over the top and fabulous as an flamboyant drag queen! Don't miss this one!",10,1,2,30 November 2001
