The Devil's Advocate," I hated this movie
","I hate anti-religious and PRO devil type movies. I hated it this movie!!! I hated the ugly and hideous faces -- the monsters. I will never recommend this movie and won't watch it again. It's a good thing I saw this on a FREE STARZ station this weekend because I wouldn't rent or buy it. Why do promote and glorify sin?? If I got a quarter for every time they used the F word.....I would be rich. The language was horrible as was the acting. As for the actors, Al Pachino is not one of my favorite actors but I've always liked Reeves. You guessed it, I'm a light weight and I like happy movies. This movie rates a big FAT 1 for AWFUL.",1,14,65,30 April 2006
