The Devil's Advocate," Painfully bad
","Where do I start? This movie was so dry and blank that it nearly put me to sleep multiple times. I'm glad I didn't see it until 8 years after its theater release and I hope I don't see it again for at least another 8 years. I was embarrassed for Al Pacino the entire time. The script was weak and every time the movie looks like it is going to get interesting it drops the ball. The story moved horribly slow and got nowhere. Was there any point to the ridiculous plot elements regarding Reeves' character having a half-sister?How is Keanu Reeves famous? This guy has to be the most overrated actor of our time. He's horrible. I've yet to ever see a good performance from him. His ridiculous accent came and went repeatedly. At least Clark Gable had the sense to not even try an accent. We hear Reeves' accent very pronounced at the beginning, then it vanishes and comes back briefly about midway through this snoozer.The real John Milton should be glad he never had to see this dreck. The second the Pacino character was introduced as Milton it was only a matter of time until they used the famous quote from Paradise Lost -- 'Better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.' Weak plot, weak dialogue, weak acting... this movie was the triple threat. Avoid this crap.",2,6,15,5 March 2005
Inglourious Basterds," My favorite Tarantino film since Pulp Fiction
","This was one of the movies I had been very eagerly anticipating. I've been a fan of many Tarantino films and this one looked to me to be something I'd enjoy. My 16-year-old was also pretty excited to see this. We finally got to go today to an earlier showing that was STILL completely packed.First and foremost, this movie is not for everyone. The tone is very ugly and the entire setting gives the film a disturbing tone. Brad Pitt is great in this film, but believe it or not is totally upstaged by Christoph Waltz. Many will find this film too long and will wonder why Brad Pitt isn't in more scenes. The people who wonder this wouldn't be familiar with Tarantino's films, which always feature backstories to other secondary characters and use many cheesy techniques, effects and music reminiscent of old spaghetti westerns and kung fu movies. Tarantino has also been one to stretch scenes out in order to increase tension and anticipation. Some people would find this tedious, while many others would find it to be brilliant filmwork -- it's up to you to decide.I found the film to be very intentionally funny, while at the same time keeping with its disturbing tone. I truly hated the villains, which is always a sign of good writing. I WANTED to see these villains get what they deserved. The heroes are not totally clean-cut likable people, nor are they meant to be. None of these people would be a 'role model' type, but this too is common in all Tarantino films.All in all, I'd say this movie was better than Kill Bill, but nowhere near Pulp Fiction (though I'm biased in that I thought Pulp Fiction was outright fantastic).FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO THIS FILM! I was amazed that a couple next to me took their son who could not have been more than 6 or 7. The graphic violence and language alone should be enough to convince you to find someone to take care of your younger kids for the afternoon. We left our 3-year-old with my mom. The kid in the audience kept asking loud and annoying questions too.I very much recommend this movie and would gladly see it again on DVD or even in the theater again if I have nothing else to see and extra time/money. You will not be disappointed, but be warned that if you are already not a fan of Tarantino or his style you will not like this movie and find it too long with frustrating and tedious scenes.",9,1,7,23 August 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Action rather than horror, but worthy remake
","As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything, but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies co-existing, but in different parts of the world.One of the key differences that I did like was the idea of the zombies running.  This made them come across as more menacing rather than being the slow clunkers that are seen in the original trilogy.  The idea of being able to walk right past them was abandoned.  I also feel that the movie did a good job of showing how quickly people would turn on one another and watch out for themselves only.One of my favorite 'realisms' of the movie is how the characters are too attached to their loved ones to shot them when they become zombies.  I'm certain that many of us would react in the same manner if something like this were to actually happen (yes, I know it's impossible).  Also, it was interesting to have so many people make it to the mall instead of only four as in the original.  Of course some of these characters fit the generic stereotype of a movie such as this, but I'm not surprised considering modern audiences would need such characters to maintain their interest.  This was a movie made for film viewers, not film makers.  We have the strong and silent male hero, the quick-thinking blond heroine, the official dumb jerk, the official slut, the young and naive girl who loses everything and needs the group's protection, the angry challenger for group leadership who has a change of heart and becomes heroic, the young trainee who disagrees with the angry challenger yet follows due to a sense of duty, and the stupid follower who gets his comeuppence.One aspect that was missing from this remake was the original movie's social commentary on the commercialism of people.  Ken Foree's character of Peter mentioned this in the original whereas Ving Rhames' Kenneth was more of a silent action hero never having much to say.  This was another reason that I saw this as a simple action movie -- though I will say that Rhames has more acting ability than Governor Schwarzenegger, Sly, Seagal and Van Damme combined.  Rhames also LOOKS like an action hero rather than today's prettyboy 'action heroes' such as Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves -- who all look like they couldn't fight their way out of a cooking class for senior citizens.All in all this movie was not better than the original and won't be nominated for any Academy Awards, but if you're looking for entertainment and can stomach the blood it's worth checking out.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD someday.",7,130,183,20 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fantastic cinematography and costumes. Depp's best performance
","I just got back from seeing this movie and I was overwhelmed.  I wasn't sure what to expect and was terrified that it'd be another Cutthroat Island bomb. One of my favorite things to collect is pirate paraphernalia so I was very heavily anticipating this movie -- making me certain I was setting myself up for disappointment... Thank GOD I was wrong!Johnny Depp has NEVER impressed me in all these years.  I hated him in every show and movie he was ever in (and that included Edward Scissorhands, Platoon and 21 Jump Street) until now.  This time he was right on the money. He stole the show and was by far the star over Orlando Bloom and Geoffery Rush.  His character was colorful and was a throwback to the swashbuckling of guys like Douglas Fairbanks, Burt Lancaster and Errol Flynn.  His costuming was fantastic, but the other characters' attire was great as well. Whoever picked out the outfits for this movie did a great job.Equally great was the cinematography.  It isn't easy to capture much of the scenery the way they did.  The shots of the ocean and the islands were beautiful.  I was reminded of my trips to Hawai'i and Catalina.  Great wideangle shots.I was also very impressed with the action.  The movie never drags despite its long running time of over 2 hours.  There are many fencing scenes and I enjoyed every one.  Somehow they manage to make the movie very action-oriented without making it turn into a mindless action movie a la Stallone/Schwarzenegger.  The movie is safe for the entire family despite its rating.  My girlfriend and I took her 9-year-old daughter to see the movie and she loved it as well.If you're familiar with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland you'll find many aspects of the ride in the film.  The movie literally brought the ride to life with they way they recreated the ride's scenes without being hindered by them.I highly recommend this movie, despite the bad reviews it seems to be getting in many newspapers.  You won't be disappointed.  Take the kids.",10,0,1,9 July 2003
Spider-Man 2," Great fun
","I wasn't overly hyped by the release this movie as I was by other recent releases.  I figured it would be a safe and fun movie to watch with my girlfriend and her son; along with my friends' daughter and her sister.  I have to say that I left the theater very pleased.  Not only was the movie never boring, but it was also very good as a movie to watch with the kids.Much like Batman, the strength/weakness of the movie can depend on the ability of the actors portraying the villains.  Molina was fantastic as Doctor Otto Octavius.  I was also pleased to see Willem Dafoe return for a brief appearance.  I was glad the focus was never on the fight scenes, rather on the inner struggle Peter Parker has with himself.  The fight scenes were secondary, but always added excitement.  I also liked the growth of the Spiderman character.  He is still kept as a regular person, unlike the Bruce Wayne-type in Batman who is somehow a superior physical specimen and a multi-millionaire.For once I have to say the CGI was excellent.  I am a fan of old-school special effects, but this time I'll say the CGI used added to the plot and overall enjoyment rather than taking over and becoming the abstract star of the movie.Also, the J. Jonah Jameson character is FANTASTIC!  I can't believe how perfectly they have captured the look and attitude of the character from the comic book!  It was simply amazing!  He steals the film whenever he's onscreen.As a former avid comicbook reader I have to admit to being a bit disappointed in the exclusion of Parker's romances with Felicia (The Black Cat), Betty Brant, and Gwen Stacey, but I always must remember that this is a movie for general FILM VIEWERS, not for already-existing fans of the character.  My mother would have no clue about those characters.  I use her as my example of a general viewer.This is THE movie hit of the summer.  It is the one movie that I feel everyone, as a family, should go see.  You won't be disappointed.  The Spiderman franchise is the best of the superhero genre, in my opinion -- and that includes Batman, Superman, The Crow, Blade, Daredevil, Hellboy and Spawn.  Not the best movie of all-time, but definitely a must-see.",8,0,0,7 July 2004
The Others," *yawn*
","This film was not scary, nor was it exciting at any point.  I was bored out of my skull watching this slow-developing piece of trash.  It just didn't seem to ever get moving.  I saw the ending coming a mile away, since it was a LOT like the ending to Sixth Sense.  I've seen worse, but the hype surrounding this movie made it a HUGE disappointment.  Terrible excuse for horror, only Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows was worse in that category.",1,7,16,16 June 2002
Troy," Proof that critics should be ignored
","I finally got to see this movie in the bargain theaters here in El Paso on Labor Day. I originally hadn't thought much about the movie, but as time went on it had left the regular theaters here in town and I realized that I'd wished I'd gone to see it. I remember hearing several outside critics blasting the movie as horrible and wanted to judge for myself. I'm very glad I finally saw this movie.This movie is not the usual Clash of the Titans/Jason and the Argonauts type of movie where the gods are constantly shown and portrayed as more important and powerful than the lowly humans. In fact, this movie completely ignores the so-called gods and instead places the focus where it belongs -- on the warriors themselves. I have studied the Iliad as well as other stories surrounding the mythical Trojan War since my days as an elementary school geek obsessed with mythology and Dungeons & Dragons. Instead of being targeted toward that audience this film demystifies the Trojan War and treats it in a manner in which it could have actually happened. We see that the elders who continually refer to their so-called gods come across as fools. One of the most telling lines is when Hector (Eric Bana) refers to the fact that Apollo did not strike down Achilles (Brad Pitt) for desecrating the statue. It is very telling that Hector seems to doubt the gods he has been taught to worship.I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a second-tier talent who became famous only because of his looks, but in this film he surprised me. He is the TRUE star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is NOT the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend BECOMES immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the so-called gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audience.Instead of supernatural powers and impossible feats we're treated to realism. Even Achilles' death is more realistic than in the myth. In the myth Paris does kill Achilles with an arrow, but because he has no battle skills his hand is actually guided by Apollo.If there was one thing I did not like in this film it was the transformation of Paris into some kind of hero. Paris was a coward in the original myth and I saw no reason to transform him into an overnight hero in the movie. I guess Orlando Bloom fans wouldn't be able to bear seeing him as the bad guy and were given the uninspired transformation of Paris into a better archer than Robin Hood.While this movie was nowhere near the epic masterpiece that the producers had hoped or that it was advertised as, it did not deserve the bad publicity it received from critics. I applaud the makers of this film and look forward to buying it on DVD.",7,523,939,8 September 2004
Cloverfield," Not very original, but much better than I thought I it would be
","I saw this film yesterday with my wife and oldest son, mostly because my son wanted to see it so badly. My wife and I both expected a total fanboy blood & gore monster/disaster flick with a bunch of characters only there to die in a loud and gory manner. Granted, for the most part it WAS a fanboy monster/disaster flick but it did manage to impress all three of us and somehow live up to the hype. I hadn't seen or read any websites or message boards so I was able to see the film without knowing any outside theories or leaked information.Yes, this film borrowed heavily from other films of its kind. I was reminded often of Aliens, The Blair Witch Project (itself an idea copied from Cannibal Holocaust) and the original War of the Worlds. I even saw some parallels from 9/11 video clips. It also had the generic disaster film elements of the troubled relationship that was being saved in the midst of disaster (just like Independence Day and Twister) and the heroic protagonist who disregards safety for the woman he loves. I think everyone knew that the end (spoiler alert!) would show the two troubled lovers one last time to remind us that they were happy not too long before. Despite all of this, I was still impressed with how the film was put together. They did manage to keep it all entertaining and I was never bored. I legitimately cared about these characters and the viewer felt like part of the disaster. I wanted them to escape even though the very beginning of the film had already suggested that they wouldn't make it.I've seen better films of this genre, but I still recommend Cloverfield to anyone who likes these kinds of movies. Not exactly family-friendly (our 1-year-old didn't come with us) but an entertaining way to spend an evening. I'd probably buy it on DVD. The only complaint I'd have would be the fanboy audience made up of skinny wannabe punkers who wore jeans so low they looked like they'd pooped their pants and identical-looking underage goths talking and answering cell phones during the movie.",7,1,4,21 January 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Brilliant
","This movie was outright fantastic. Having seen both this film and Ray I felt that Don Cheadle deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture over Jamie Foxx (and, mind you, I think Jamie Foxx did an EXCELLENT job himself). The fact that this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture is outright ridiculous. This important film is very emotional and will leave you wondering what you were doing while all of this was going on. Most of us were watching OJ Simpson's trial.Don Cheadle's emotional performance deserves high praise. The scene where he is arguing with the general in the office of the Hotel Diplomat is his best work overall. I couldn't believe the outright emotion this man put into his strong performance. The death scenes are tear-jerking while abstaining from graphic violence. Death is never glorified in this film. You'll also be amazed by the driving scene by the river.I especially liked the mise-en-scene (did I spell it correctly?) that showed issues of Time Magazine in the background with Bill Clinton's face featured prominently. I don't feel this film bashes Clinton or the United States specifically -- instead it makes us all feel guilty for being blissfully unaware the entire time. The media coverage here in the United States was centered around OJ and 2 deaths while 800,000 were dying elsewhere. While the film never states this, it becomes obvious when one finally realizes what they were watching on TV during this time.This film is a must-see for anyone who was an adult in 1994. While it is not a 'feelgood' film it is powerful and emotional. Easily the best film I've seen in quite some time.",9,2,3,1 March 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Outright incredible
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. My family and I had waited a long time to see it and the advertising was somewhat vague. It appeared to be a fantasy for children based on the commercials, but the people I'd spoken to said it was nothing of the kind. Finally, we saw this yesterday and I was outright blown away by the story. Guillermo Del Toro's writing crafted an incredible fantasy world while keeping the movie dark and serious. Ivana Baquero's lead role as Ofelia was also amazing. This girl was able to carry the movie and look strong despite being so much younger than the other characters.One of the best things about this movie was the way the characters were given personalities without being pushed ahead of Ofelia. I was very impressed with the 'Pale Man' character. He was legitimately creepy and evil-looking. I can't believe the imagination that was put into this film. Usually such imagination is only in children, and since this story was from the point of view of a child Del Toro did a fantastic job.Yes, this is a foreign film so you'll have to read subtitles. I actually am able to read and speak Spanish, but read the subtitles anyway. It never distracted from the film. The film seemed to be influenced from many other fantasy stories and films such as Alice in Wonderland, Chronicles of Narnia, Excalibur, and even Beetlejuice. However, the homage to these films was done in such a fantastic way that I felt it was on par, and often even better, than those films.This is not a film for children, despite the fantasy images, but it also isn't a bloodbath so violent that your young teenagers will be mortified. My 14-year-old also enjoyed it. I highly recommend seeing this in the 2nd run theaters or picking it up on DVD very soon.",9,2,5,21 April 2007
The Village," Disappointing, boring and predictable
","****** SPOILERS ******The previews to this movie had me excited. I was expecting great horror. What I got was a complete borefest of the slowest developing movie I've seen in years. I spent most of the movie wanting to yell at the characters to DO SOMETHING. This is horror? The so-called 'monster' is seen twice and does nothing thrilling or scary.Was ANYONE surprised by the horrible excuse for a twist ending? I think it came as no surprise to anyone who had ever seen a movie before. I saw it coming, my girlfriend saw it coming and my brother saw it coming. I think this Shyamalan guy wants so badly to think of himself as some master of fooling the audience that he forgets to make an interesting story to go with his twist ending. The characters stand around talking and talking and never get anything done.The talking scenes were too long. We got the picture as to what they were getting at, but yet the scenes continued on for no reason. It was like using a fire extinguisher on a fire that had already burned itself out.What a lame movie monster as well. It looked like one of the creatures from The Dark Crystal. I was startled twice, more by the screeching music that accompanied the sudden movement than anything -- once when the monster is spotted from the watchtower and once when the blind girl falls into the pit.Luscious was a boring character who did nothing. Noah was probably the only thing worth watching due to his comical moments. He's the only thing that originally kept me from giving this movie a 1. I changed my mind since then.This is easily the worst movie I have seen in about three years -- and that includes the borefest that was In The Bedroom and the stupidity of Not Another Teen Movie. Skip this over-hyped piece of trash and go see one of the many other summer movies that are thousands of times more entertaining. I gave this a 3 out of 10, and that was being generous so I eventually lowered it to a 1. If you want to sleep, watch this dog of a movie.",1,4,8,8 August 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Hey! Let's copy Point Break, only with cars!
","I have never seen a more blatant ripoff of another movie in my life. The makers of this flick took the plot of Point Break and used cars instead of skydiving and surfboards. Let's see -- instead of Keanu Reeves (the worst actor of all time, BTW) as an undercover FBI agent we have Paul Walker as an undercover cop. Instead of Patrick Swayze as the cold guru who takes the undercover FBI agent under his wing we have Vin Diesel as the cold guru who takes in the undercover cop under his wing. Instead of the ex-girlfriend of the guru falling for the undercover cop it's the younger sister of the guru falling for the undercover FBI agent. Instead of an ending in Australia it's in Mexico. Instead of robbing banks they rob trucks. Pathetic. I can't believe how many people actually liked this lameexcuse for a film. Gee... fast cars... too bad there are only 3 races scenes in the entire movie -- TOTAL. Nevermind that one of them is between the Japanese guy and the clueless fool of a friend.Lame, lame, lame. Rent Point Break for the original plot. Or if you really want to see a movie about cars try Days of Thunder or even the remake of Gone in 60 Seconds. Neither is that great, but both are WAY better than this trash.",3,0,1,2 August 2002
The Love Guru," Another reason to ignore arrogant critics
","I saw this movie today (opening day) because I just felt like getting a good laugh. This movie is beyond stupid and very over the top, but guess what? It's still funny. It's simple humor and cheap laughs that doesn't rely on overdone profanity and never takes itself seriously. Some people may prefer 'intelligent' comedy, and I'm all for that... go rent a Woody Allen flick from the 70s. If you like simple sight gags and silly comedy you'll like this movie. Mike Myers may not have been as funny as he was as Wayne Campbell or Austin Powers, but he can still get laughs. I have been critical of Justin Timberlake in the past, but he finally seems to have found a movie style that fits him.No, this movie will not be sweeping the awards shows or breaking any box office records, but if you're able to appreciate simply laughs you may want to check this movie out. While I found nothing offensive about the movie at all apparently some disagree. If you're easily offended then stay home or stay outside the theater holding a sign.Funny cameos also make this film and Jessica Alba looks her best in a long time. Not great, but there's a lot of fun to be had if you don't mind turning off your logic for awhile.",7,23,41,20 June 2008
Batman Begins," The way Batman was MEANT to be!
","I was lucky enough to have seen the premiere of the movie on Monday evening and I was very impressed. This is easily the best Batman movie I have ever seen. This movie completely disregards the previous 4 Batman movies and begins its own franchise. The scenes are dark and foreboding, as is Batman himself. This film makes the previous 4 Batman films look as campy as the old TV show. There are no wild costumes or over-the-top freak characters. Scarecrow's costume consists of nothing more than a burlap sack yet it is more effective than the ridiculous outfits worn by Mr. Freeze or The Riddler in the last two terrible Batman movies.The movie is outright action. The fight scenes are realistic in that there are no stupid one-liners being dropped during the fight, nor does the fight pause for one of the characters to crack a cheap joke. Christian Bale is the best Batman I have ever seen. The supporting cast is incredibly strong; with especially solid performances by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson and even Gary Oldman (who I have been very critical of in the past). I hadn't seen much of Katie Holmes before this film, but her performance was every bit on par as those of the seasoned veteran actors mentioned above. Lastly there is Cillian Murphy, whose performance reminded me of the chilling characters played in the past by Christopher Walken. I can see Murphy becoming a much bigger name in film in the near future.This was not a children's' movie in any way, though the film is not overly violent or gory. I don't recall seeing any blood at any point in the film. I saw many parents bringing children to the premiere, but I believe these people were expecting a movie like the previous 4 that added corny jokes and enemies that bordered on slapstick with their appearance.The movie distances itself immediately from the others by showing the audience a different version of Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered. The origin is told well and gives us a much better insight on the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. This Batman is realistic. We see how he is trained and hear what his beliefs are. He even bruises and looks athletic without looking TOO big to hide his appearance when not in costume. I applaud Christopher Nolan for breaking out on his own and not submitting to the campy formula of the other movies.I would gladly see this movie again in the theater. It looks to be the best film of the summer and easily the best film I've seen this year. Because there is no sex or gratuitous violence the film is okay to take the kids to, but don't expect them to be as entertained as they were with the previous films. At no point does this film even pretend to be targeted at a younger audience.",9,11,17,13 June 2005
Pride & Prejudice," Wow!
","I only went to see this movie because it was at a theater opening for free and my wife had wanted to see it. My expectations were very low and I was ready for another stuffy British romance full of boring scenes and pretentious behavior. I was proved completely wrong. I never imagined that this film would be so outright funny the entire time! While the acting and script were very sophisticated they never dragged on nor treated the audience as low class. Keira Knightley was outright fantastic in her portrayal of Elizabeth. She completely deserved her Oscar nomination and it is unfortunate that this movie happened to come out at the same time as Walk the Line. It appears that Reese Witherspoon will be the one to win.The story was very descriptive and never left anything open. This was a true tale of a couple separated by circumstance. The final love scene, while brief, was very emotional and so beautiful that the viewer can almost feel how much Darcy loves Elizabeth. Because this film is not 'politically correct' it didn't receive all of the attention that Brokeback Mountain did, when in fact this film was outright EVERYTHING the boring Brokeback Mountain claimed to be.Cinematography for this film was very underrated. The shots of the landscapes and backgrounds were so beautiful that I wished I could visit England. The scene where Elizabeth stood on the cliff alone deserved the Oscar nomination.When the scenery, costumes and acting were not being featured the movie kept the audience entertained with its comedy. This film was never boring at any point. I've seen several comedies where I have laughed less than I did watching this film. Though listed as a drama, this movie was actually the true definition of a romantic comedy. Also, the characters and acting were so incredible that I found myself rooting for the protagonists and legitimately hating the snobby or deceptive characters. This was truly a great film.This was a true date movie. Seeing this movie with my wife made it even more emotional. I look forward to buying this film on DVD eventually.",9,2,3,23 February 2006
When Harry Met Sally...," One of my favorite movies of all time
","I don't know where to start.  I loved this film so much when I saw it in theatres back when I was in high school.  I saw it several times on video and just loved the ending.  I couldn't get over it and watched it over and over.  Billy Crystal is fantastic as Harry Burns.  Reiner did an amazing job of telling it like it is (at least in my opinion) and discussing how men and women can NOT be friends.  The movie mentions many things that we know to be true but either never realize or never discuss.  This was the first movie I ever bought on DVD and I still watch it to this day.  Mind you, I am a 30-year-old man and the ending still brings me to tears -- 'I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out, I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich, I love that you get this little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts, I love that after I spend the day with you I can still smell your perfume on my clothes and I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night... and it's NOT because I'm lonely and it's NOT because it's New Year's Eve.  I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.'I still think that's one of the best monologues ever.  Right up there with Hank Fonda's monologue in Grapes of Wrath.",10,3,5,6 July 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Just plain amazing
","I can't believe I waited 11 years to see this film. I often saw commercials advertising the film on TNT, but never had enough interest to sit and watch until I bought the movie for my fiancée. I'm so glad I finally got to see this film. This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't believe the outstanding job done by all of the actors. I've seen very few scripts on the level of this one, but have never seen so many strong performances from the entire cast.Morgan Freeman is incredible as Red and narrates the action better than any other voice-over I've ever heard. I was very surprised with Tim Robbins. For some reason I still thought of him as Nuke Laloosh and never dreamed he had this kind of acting ability. The story is incredible and the dialogue keeps the entire film rolling. Two and a half hours go by like nothing. I also have to applaud William Sadler, who showed great versatility (watch Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Die Hard 2 to see what I mean). The film is intriguing as well as inspiring at the same time. I found myself inwardly cheering for Andy to escape from Shawshank and was even happy when he is shown emerging from the sewer tunnel. His reunion with Red is almost tearjerking. The movie managed to have a happy ending without it seeming to be another unrealistic Hollywood Ending.This film is definitely a must-see. I have seen Braveheart, and though I thought it was fantastic it doesn't come anywhere near the power of Shawshank Redemption. I doubt another cast ensemble of incredible acting talent will ever match this one. Easily a 10 on the IMDb.com scale.",10,1,2,15 May 2005
Iron Man," Wow! A heavily hyped movie that DIDN'T disappoint me!
","I was fortunate enough to get tickets for Iron Man on its opening day. I had been eagerly anticipating the movie since seeing the first trailer months ago and was excited by the strong cast and having Favreau as director. With all this hype I was fearful of being disappointed. Thank God I wasn't. This movie met and eventually exceeded all of my expectations.Robert Downey Jr. is outright amazing in this movie and is definitely back in the A-list of his career. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, who I have NEVER been a fan of, was believable and very likable as Pepper Potts. One thing I liked was the way this movie was able to change and poke fun at the Iron Man mythology of the comic books without completely altering the character. The script took advantage of having such a strong cast and let them dominate the film rather than making the special effects the star; which usually happens in superhero films like this one. The fight scenes, while fantastic, were secondary to the growth of the Tony Stark character. The final fight scene was exciting and never overdone. Many other superhero movie franchises could learn from this film. Just because much of the audience is fanboys doesn't mean the film has to be silly or even pretentious.Non-fans of the comic book will like this movie as well. It was very well done and I'm now looking forward to future Favreau projects. I'll happily buy this on DVD. It was never overly violent or bloody and had only semi-strong language at most. Take the entire family. You won't be disappointed.",9,1,3,3 May 2008
Beowulf," This is the future of cinema?
","I didn't make it past the first scene. Yes, many people will say that means I can't comment on the movie, but here's a sad fact -- I have NEVER walked out of a movie in my entire life until now. The animation is flat out annoying. If I wanted to see Shrek I'd buy the DVD. If this is the future of cinema then Hollywood will be bankrupt in a few years. Who actually wants to see movies that look like this? It looked stupid, the same way Final Fantasy and Polar Express looked completely ridiculous.Grendel looked like a giant booger. It was the worst depiction of Grendel I'd ever seen. The thing looked like a CGI Leatherface, only more mentally challenged.I'm sure the fanboys will love this film, the theater was full of them. I'm sure they were all dying to see Angelina Jolie in some kind of CGI erotic scene.I'm sorry, but this movie was stupid. I've sat through some HORRIBLE films in my life -- I even made it through that pathetic Dragon Wars flick, but this was just too much. Save your money and go rent Shrek 3.",1,9,23,21 November 2007
The Matrix," Most overrated movie of all time
","Somebody decided to combine the ideas behind Terminator (a computer gone out of control that runs the world) and Tron (a computer world within another world) and combine them into this overrated turkey that has plotholes big enough to drive a truck through.  Keanu Reeves is possibly the worst actor of all time.  The stupid faces he makes in the fight scenes are laughable and he has the worst voice for delivering serious dialogue.  They even managed to steal a scene from Walt Disney in this drivel when Neo is brought back to life by a kiss.  Most fans of this movie say that those who disliked it 'didn't get it' and try to make themselves come across as more intelligent by talking about the film's 'deeper meaning'.  Well, as someone who also had to painfully analyze this stinker I can say that there is not one original idea within the script.  While they're at it they should find a good lawyer to defend themselves from Robert Heinlein's estate, who should sue since they stole the entire parasite idea from Puppet Masters.  Keanu Reeves should be shot on sight.",1,10,29,15 April 2002
