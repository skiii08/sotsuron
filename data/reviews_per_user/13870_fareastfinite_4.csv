Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The worst film ever made
","For goodness sake, don't watch this film. It is awful, the dialogue is terrible, the plot is non-existent, the acting incredibly wooden, the CGI (despite clearly having spent a lot of money on it) is rubbish.. I can't believe anyone on here gave this film a decent rating! And of course there's the underlying racism, the evil oriental souding aliens, the very dodgy 'yessum' jar-jar binks Jamaican sounding character.. the only good thing in this is the light saber fight near the end, but that comes nowhere near salvaging this utter crock.Easily the worse film I've ever seen. And I've seen some real crap! George Lucas should be tried for crimes against culture for daring to make such a mind-blowingly awful film.",1,8,17,2 June 2007
Sucker Punch," This film is everything that's wrong with Hollywood these days
","Lots of flashy visuals, Snyder's 'trademark' slow-mo fights, big robots, dragons, improbably attractive women.. The comic book genre has become an excuse to churn out complete vacuous films with no depth, minimal dialogue and a total lack of direction.I won't even bother spoiling the plot for you, it's just an excuse to show some flashy visuals anyway. For the good of the film industry, people need to stop lapping this s**t up.Hmm, I can't even fill 10 lines of text talking about this film, that's how empty it is! OK, how about we lobby Congress to introduce a yearly quota limit on comic book films?",1,6,12,7 February 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Brilliant film, one of the best I've seen
","An excellent film, I was waiting for Jim Carrey to do something like this..Joel is a quiet guy who doesn't relate to women very well, until he meets extrovert Clementine. Their relationship is ultimately doomed to failure, and sure enough after a couple of years they split up, and Clementine has Joel removed from her memories. Joel is so cut up about this he does the same, but half way through the process realises he doesn't want to forget her after all.The ensuing battle in Joel's mind makes for great viewing and some truly surreal moments, while the staff of the memory clinic act out their dramas in the background. The conclusion of the film is absolutely brilliant and really touching, these 2 people know exactly how their relationship is going to pan out and it's all going to end in tears, but still want to go through that process anyway.And of course there's the debate over the value of memories, that all these painful moments in our lives go towards forming us as people, and we should always hold onto them.Cannot recommend this film enough, it packs in some great cinematography, touching performances from both Carrey and Winslet and a truly original concept.My god, a romantic comedy that was actually funny!",10,0,3,30 April 2008
Alien: Covenant," A Great Film
","Easily the 3rd best film in the franchise. More of a return to the ad- libby 'space trucker' dialogue of the original, and much better than Prometheus in every way. Decent script, fantastic soundtrack that nicely references the original, good pacing, some great blood and guts. It reminded me of the original in that it's fundamentally a horror film in a sci-fi setting.The actors are great, Danny McBride in particular nails his part. Katherine Waterston is very good too, nowhere near as irritating as Noomi Rapace. Meanwhile Michael Fassbander is brilliant as always.This is Ridley's best film for a LONG time, it's much tighter than all those epics he's made in the last couple of decades. Reminded me of his early stuff.",8,6,15,17 May 2017
