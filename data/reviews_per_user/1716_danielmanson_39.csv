10 Cloverfield Lane," The ending man.... so close
","I massively enjoyed this. Just not the ending. And here's why.
So the majority of the film is this thriller/mystery and since Michelle is also in the same boat as the audience it's great to watch it all unfold. If the ending was 15 minutes before, it would have been a solid 8/10. Listen, I get this is part of the whole 'Cloverfield' thing they have going on. But the entire ending sequence is just not needed and just doesn't fit with the tone of the entire rest of the film. Feel as though they just lobbed the ending in just for the sake of it. If this was just simply a thriller movie it would have worked so so well!Acting is really good though, the plot was great (not the end) and the suspense kept throughout was done really well. So yeah, if you enjoy thriller films then definitely give this a watch it really does it well. Just expect a weird end.",7,0,0,16 May 2020
It," It lives up to the hype
","With the 2nd one coming out this year I decided to watch knowing all my mates want to go and watch it. And I have to be honest, it did not disappoint.Positives: There's a good amount of the 'scare factor' and also a great amount of action, (Especially the final scenes), characters are extremely likeable, which is something you don't often get in horror movies and the acting from both Pennywise and the kids are surprisingly good.Negatives: 2 hours 10 mins seems a little excessive for a horror film and the director had a few chiche moments which really annoyed me (falling over when running or dropping something important or separating from the group)...Overall the negatives do not take away from how good this film is and I really do recommend if you haven't watched it yet! With such a lack of good horror movies about, it's a must watch. 8/10.",8,0,0,19 July 2019
Hereditary," It just wasn't that good
","There is so many fantastic reviews on this film, some calling it the horror movie of the year. So of course when it came onto Amazon Prime I had to give it a watch. And honestly I just could not get into the film and here's why...It takes way too long to get going. Before you start figuring it all out and 'stuff' starts happening, it's a good hour and a half into the film. By then, me personally, just didn't feel overly connected anymore.The plot. It is just very very confusing. Due to the slow pace of the film, you are waiting for something to happen. It does. But, you then do not know why. Was it a freak accident? Or something more? It does tell us at the end what is happening, the explanation, I found to be quite loose.The characters are just not likable. This was such an annoying aspect of the film I could simply not get past. Not one character in the family is even slightly likable. What this did was make the audience unconnected to any of them. So if anything happened to them, you won't be that bothered by it.Finally, they kept using the horror cliche of the character slowly turning around. They did this so much throughout the film that is just lost that scare factor. The horror of this happening just became null, because it had happened so much. It became very annoying to watch also, when the same character will do it for the 50th time in 30 minutes. Loses it's touch.These four major points really put me off the film and I just did not connect with it at any point. During midway, I just wanted it to finish.I will say that in terms of the 'horror genre' it adds a different element. There isn't many jump scares and the 'horror' element mainly comes from tension and suspense. Obviously, this is subjective and some will find this scary, others will not.Overall, I wouldn't personally watch this. There are much better horror films out there.",4,0,2,18 February 2019
John Wick," It's like a better typical action film
","Yeah don't ask why I have only just watched the first John Wick today but I have. And I loved itAction scenes were just so well done and watching Keanu pull off these stunts were just mad to watch. Special mention to the bloke who played the main villains son, because he played the role really well, because I absolutely hated him from the second I saw him.Listen, it's just a really good, bloody action film with tons of guns, fighting, explosions and more guns. But it's done bigger and better. If you like action films and you somehow haven't seen this then please do.",8,1,2,9 May 2020
The Impossible," Meh
","Okay okay. I know it's based on the tragic events of the tsunami, but I just had some issues with the film and plot.Pros: Tom Holland was fantastic in this, I typically don't like child actors in films, but I thought he nailed this role. No wonder he got picked up for Spider-Man! Acting from Naomi Watts was also great!
The first 15 minutes was fantastic, shot really well and it really illustrated the moments it all happened. Also enjoyed how it focused on one families story rather than adding loads of characters.Cons: Annoying cliches are a constant, turning around slowly etc but the one that bugged me the most was when they were all looking for each other and would keep missing them by second. Look, we know they are going to all meet up at the end stop teasing it's just really really annoying.
Didn't really see the point in the final 25 mins of the film, I won't go into detail but what you expect to happen, happens but then you have a further 25 mins of film to continue. Felt forced.
I read in a lot of reviews that people were angry with the portrayal of this rich white family who sodded off in the end on a private jet and I get where they are coming from. Just sayingOverall it's an okay watch, illustrated the events pretty well. Just could have been done better to be honest. 6/10 is still pretty good though",6,0,0,9 May 2020
Spotlight," Great story
","I enjoyed this film a lot, the true story being told is great and the film really captures the sadness of what's actually being told. I think it's great how they managed to tell a story that's actually got a lot of sadness involved and make it not just emotional but very captivating. If you like dramas and true stories this is definitely one to watch.
The acting was absolutely brilliant by everyone involved, just wanted to give a special mention to that.Only negative for me personally is that it is longer than it needs to be. Could feel myself thinking 'this must be coming to a close soon'
But overall worth watching in my opinion",7,0,0,10 April 2020
Don Jon," Not for me
","I was scrolling through Netflix comedies trying to find something amusing to watch and stumbled on this.
And all I'll say is that I did not laugh once.I understand the premise of the film and the plot, but I found it quite dull. There was no real depth. You got a sense of what was going to happen quite early on and the characters aren't overly likeable either.Overall it was just a bit boring.",2,1,1,24 November 2019
Zodiac," Fantastic film.
","Just want to start by saying that I thought that the performances were fantastic, especially from Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal.
The film itself was really interesting. As someone who knew only the absolute basics of the Zodiac story, this was informative, as well as well written and interesting. It's also a really good take on how much effort and how much concrete evidence you actually need on someone.If you know nothing about the Zodiac, or if you know a lot I think this film is perfect for both, because of how well it's done.",8,0,0,31 May 2020
The Hateful Eight," Long, but good.
","The title is exactly that. The film is very long, however it's very very good. It keeps you on edge, the acting was fantastic and you are constantly wondering who the killer is.The only negative like I said is that it's too long, certain scenes are dragged out longer than they need to be. Majority of this happens in the first half of the film fyi.Overall, it's a film I would recommend if you have a long evening to kill, plane journey etc. If you have a short attention span it's probably not for you.",8,1,2,30 March 2019
Snatch," Why did I wait 20 years to watch this?
","Granted I was only 7 years old at the time but I'm sticking with my title. It's a great film, it's hilarious, action packed, great characters, fantastic editing and cinematography and just overall a good watch.
I don't really have much else to say other than go and give it a watch if you haven't.",8,3,4,5 April 2020
Final Destination 2," I like these films
","I enjoy these kind of films. There's no drastic plot and simple to understand. And you see a lot of gore and imaginative ways for someone to die. It's a fitting addition to the sequel also. Which is something you don't always see. Especially in horror films.If you haven't seen the first I recommend doing so, but it's a nice 2 films and if you like gore or horror I recommend",7,1,1,20 December 2019
The Town," Much, much better than I anticipated
","I'm just going to jump in and say that I am not very keen on Ben Affleck, however I thought his acting was excellent (Renner was also very good) and it's the first film I've watched him in thats really impressed me.
In terms of the plot, there was a lot more action involved than I thought and I really enjoyed the inter twining of the relationship and his crimes.
It's just a really good story that puts the audience through the paces and it had me on the edge of my seat.Only negative really is that I thought it didn't need to be as long as it was. But it took nothing away from the film itself. Great watch and really took me by surprise. 8/10.",8,1,1,13 April 2020
Nightcrawler," I understand the positive reviews
","I loved it!It was a real eye opener on the world of news footage and Jake Gyllenhaal played his role of psychotic video footage capturer so well. Honestly such a phenomenal performance.
The film was great, really captured me and it was really intense. Worth watching if you want a good drama/thriller to watch.Only real negatives I have is that we didn't get a background or anything on Jake's character. I guess that adds to the mystery of him.",8,3,4,24 June 2019
Bird Box," Do not believe the hype.
","When this film came out on Netflix, I have never seen so much hype and praise based around it.
It's the most watched film on opening day ever on Netflix and has currently got over 45 million views. There was memes flying around all over social media, based on this film and it was just simply everywhere. So obviously, I had to give it a watch and see what the fuss is all about and I can say with confidence that it should not have all this hype at all.Do not get me wrong, it is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one either. And if you are going to watch this film with high expectations then please lower them or you will be disappointed. I will start by telling you the negatives of this film and then was is good about it.
For me, the film did not have to be over 2 hours long. It felt dragged out in certain scenes and at times very long winded which took away any emotions you are feeling, because you become bored. The biggest problem I am seeing in other reviews on here and social media etc is that there is no closure and nothing is really answered. And I sadly agree with that statement. You are made to wait over 2 hours to find out nothing about what is causing all the deaths. The characters aren't allowed to see 'it' or they will die. WHAT CAN YOU NOT SEE, SHOW OR TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT. You are made wondering what happened to certain characters come the ending. There is just so many unanswered questions to this ending that it goes far beyond the audiences imagination to just it being a cop out end to a film. There is several instances where, as a viewer, you question the motives of certain things that different characters do. I won't go into examples as I don't want to spoil anything, but you do get miffed off by certain actions and responses that some characters do.Some positives to this film is that the acting is pretty decent. The 2 children especially as they weren't annoying like a lot of child actors in films. The film did keep you in suspense a lot of the time. You don't know who to trust, who will survive etc. The general idea of the film is also good, you cannot see whoever or whatever is trying to kill you. It is a very similar idea to 'A Quiet Place' if you know what that is.But to sum up. I think that the negatives of this film outweigh the positives. Like I said at the beginning, this is not a bad film. But, it is not exactly a good one either. I gave it a 6/10, because there is good things about this movie and it is worth a watch if you need a couple of hours to kill. But, just expect to be miffed by the ending and DO NOT go into this film expecting it to be some unbelievable masterpiece.",6,0,3,30 December 2018
Justice League," Expected so much more
","I like DC films. This is coming from someone who loved Suicide Squad. But this just didn't do it for me. It had its moments sure, but I was left extremely underwhelmed.I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I'll just rattle off a few negatives.
This was a 300 million budget film. Yet, it just did not feel like one, CGI in areas was actually really poor, but it just didn't have the feel of a huge superhero movie.
The villain. Comes in and makes a huge entrance, but that's it. Doesn't really give us any info on the guy other than he wants to destroy the world and we don't really see him until the end. It was just a poorly done character in my opinion.
Jokes did not land. The limited comedy in this was very forced and just not very funny. The humour was almost to entertain a 5 year old.There are some positives, some of the fight scenes were pretty good and shot well and the main characters were likeable enough. But yeah, it's a bit of a miss this film. It's not the worst thing you'll ever see. 5/10, some positives there and didn't hate it, but there are a lot of negatives also.",5,0,0,6 June 2020
Salt," Average action film
","To be honest. This does exactly what it says on the tin, it's a bog standard action film. Good action scenes, explosions, car crashes/chases etcWhat I didn't like. None of the characters were particularly likeable, you only really started to like Jolie's character by the end. My other issue was that I think I've seen one too many thrillers, because I was constantly questioning whether she's been set up or who it could be etc. When really, I needed to just watch the action for what it was. It's a simple plot, nothing difficult to understand about it at all. The characters would do questionable things as well which would bother me.Overall it's not too bad, I didn't hate it at all. But, I feel as though they could have done more with the plot and the characters. I watched because it's on top 10 on Netflix UK so I know plenty of English people will be debating this. Chuck it on if you like action films, just don't expect anything drastic.",6,2,4,21 March 2020
Disturbia," Pretty good modern day thriller
","I saw a review state that it's a modern day Rear Window and I completely agree, it's obviously not on that same wavelength, but it's definitely something to relate to.
Here you have a teen who's extremely relatable for teens, but also very likeable. There's an argument throughout that he's the guy in the wrong for spying out his window, but the film does well in illustrating that he's the good guy to root for.
This makes for a very interesting thriller. There was parts that had me on the edge of my seat and overall I thought the plot was decent.Only negative is that the love/relationship side of the film I didn't really give a toss about. It didn't really fish me in. But I can see why people would be more invested in it. I'm going 7/10, it's a great watch. But it's not a film you're likely going to talk about much.",7,0,0,4 May 2020
Jarhead," Shows a different light into military
","I enjoyed this. When you hear war film without action, you wonder whether this can work. Well it does. The character development was brilliant and you see a completely different side to life in the military. One that they probably don't want to you to see. It's a powerful movie that's well worth watching!8/10. Very good.",8,0,0,1 February 2020
The Machinist," A real thinker
","Not sure why it's taken me this long to watch this film but I was not disappointed by it at all. It's definitely not a film for a casual viewer at all so if you half heartedly watch films on a Sunday night then don't bother watching this.
It's a film that had me constantly questioning 'did that just happen?' 'Does that guy exist?' 'Who is he?' And so on. And the ending I thought was brilliant, answered a lot of questions and had a real good twist also.
Acting from Bale was fantastic. I cannot believe the amount of weight he lost for that role.Yeah it was a really good watch, one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. Must watch.",8,0,1,19 March 2020
Bad Teacher," I enjoyed it
","It's a brainless, bog standard, typical comedy. Sometimes you need a simple plot and a few laughs and that is what this brought to the table. There's really not a huge lot to say other than it's not a bad film, just don't expect anything drastic.JT's character was really annoying I have to be honest. But I loved Jason Segal in this, which evened this all out.",7,1,2,20 December 2019
Ocean's Eleven," Great heist movie
","This film delivered more than what I was expecting. Plot was fantastic and kept me on edge several times as they were doing the heist, acting was great and overall it just really hooked me in.
Considering there was 11 in the squad as well I never lost track of the characters which is quite common in films which contain a lot of main characters. To sum up if you haven't watched yet I'd definitely give it a go. I'm going straight into the sequels nowOnly real negative to this is that I just wasn't bothered by the romantic/love side of the plot. I could not care less if Clooney got his ex-wife back or not. It just seemed a bit pointless in the grand scheme of things. It didn't take anything away from the film, but it didn't hook me in as the heist did.",8,4,4,11 April 2020
It Follows," not bad, not great
","So, this was on Film4 the other day so I decided to give it a watch and as you can tell by the title. It's not bad, but it also isn't great. And here's why:So, quick rundown, a young woman develops a curse after sleeping with her date and in order to get rid of it she has to sleep with someone else. If the 'demon' kills that person it then goes back to whoever is previous again.I will start with what personally annoyed me. We have this curse that the young woman got quite early on in the film. However, I would have liked some sort of explanation as to why this curse exists. Also, Jay (young woman) could have simply slept with some random lad in a bar and so on, but she fannies about for a while, because finally sleeping with another lad. At the end she ends up sleeping with one of her best friends who then hires a prostitute (which is what i suggested about 15 minutes into the film). But, clearly the prostitute dies, because the 'demon' is following them again. That ending seems a little pointless, because I have watched 100 minutes of a film to find out, they are still cursed....There are definitely positives to take from this film, the acting I thought, especially for a low budget horror, was pretty decent. The cinematography was also very good, some nice shots were used throughout and the music was different, but I believe worked well with the overall tone of this horror.So, why do people watch horror films? To get scared. Watching this, there was definitely an element of constant horror as you never know whether this 'demon' will appear as it would follow the character at random times. There was also some jump scares thrown into the mix so yeah I would say this definitely has that horror element. The idea of being constantly followed and watched is a current zeitgeist that bothers a lot of people and they have incorporated that well.I have given this a 5/10, because overall I believe it's simply just an average film. You won't be disappointed by it, nor will you be impressed.",5,0,1,6 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The ending. Wow
","Spoilers.All I'll say is when I figured out that the ending was retelling the Manson murders I was in awe at the film. Classic Tarantino ending with blood and gore and I absolutely loved it.Also massively enjoyed the 60s style vibe throughout.
My one comment would be that this is a bit more of a thinker than the Hateful Eight for example. The ending might not mean as much to you also if you dont know about Charles Manson (Yes I know we have the same surname).Tarantino films are different, you watch, because of the director. We all know his style. I was sat behind someone in the cinema who complained throughout and clearly never heard of Tarantino. And I think that showed the difference between the people that know and love him and people that have no idea and came to watch a modern day 'simple' film.So if you know about his style, enjoy his style and know about Charles Manson then this is a must watch. 8/10 for me, just as my arse got a bit numb sitting there for almost 3 hours. I also would have enjoyed maybe a little longer on Sharon Tate, but these take nothing away from this film!",8,7,19,21 August 2019
Gone Girl," Final half an hour took it from a 9 to a 7/10.
","I'm going to try not to bang on about the ending, but it's going to be hard. There's a lot of positives and 2 hours in I'm sat there thinking 'this film is brilliant'. I'm on the edge of my seat the entire time wondering what's gonna happen next. But then this lousy, loose and poorly written ending happened and it was just a huge kick in the teeth. So many questions left unanswered and it really deemed the entire film pointless. It was like they tried to just throw together something really quickly just to end it. Really disappointed with that ending.Acting was really good, the plot (minus ending) was very good and it really did keep me in suspense. Is it worth watching? On the whole. Yes. But expect to be a bit miffed at the end.Ps: Amy(wife) comes out of a hospital, why is she still covered in blood? That just really bugged me when that happened. Not a spoiler by the way.",7,0,0,16 March 2020
The Hurt Locker," It's just a really good war film.
","The title expresses my opinions on this more than enough. It's a really good war film. I enjoyed the realism more than anything and unlike a lot of war films where it's just guns, it's character driven.
The acting as well was just fantastic by all. Renner was stand out though, his character arc was acted unbelievably well and it really illustrated war for a soldier a lot more realistically.Well worth watching if you haven't already",8,0,0,18 April 2020

","Have to be honest, not a huge fan of the Xmen films, but love marvel films. I thought this was relatively entertaining. I like the main x-men heroes. Especially Quicksilver.

Prisoners," A real thinker
","When going into this film I did not expect to think as much as I did. Without going into details and spoilers you end up questioning a lot and wondering why that just happened. Which is good as it's a thriller.It's got good action scenes, phenomenal acting from all involved and great cinematography.
My only real problem with this film is that I feel they made it slightly too confusing than it needed to be. For example, the snakes (not a spoiler) made no sense and was never explained.Personally, as a film fanatic, I really enjoyed this film and would recommend. Just make sure you are ready to give it 100% of your attention, because it's much needed! 8/10.",9,1,1,7 September 2019
Everest," Mixed emotions
","Right. I'm just going to jump straight into what I didn't like about it. There was way too many characters to focus on and with them all wearing masks and big coats I had no idea who was who. There was no character arcs either, I know it's based on a true story but you didn't relate to any. Meaning I wasn't that fussed if something happened to them.It was also just a bit pointless, like did this need to be made to a film? The plot just felt a bit empty.What's good? Cinematography was fantastic. The shots of the mountain was brilliant. Acting was pretty decent from all involved also.

Limitless," Ending really let's it down
","I have very conflicting views on this film. Up until the end I had the film sitting at a 8/10, it had good action scenes and really had me on the edge of my seat. But I just don't see the point in the ending, there was so many different, more interesting ways it could have gone and it went for a really lazy, uninteresting one which lets it down so much.
I went into this with the idea that this is going to be a massive thinker, something that is going to make me really question everything and that's not the case at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I expected more from this film.
The love interest played a real back seat in the film and in all honesty it could have done without, because when it circled back to her or them as a couple I didn't care at all.Positives: acting was great, plot had me hooked in for the majority of the film and cinematography and editing was also great.",6,1,3,12 April 2020

It Chapter Two," Disappointed on the whole.
","To save hassle I'll jump right in:
Negatives: it's too long, I felt there was certain scenes which served no relevance and were there purely the lengthen the film. Could easily shave 30 mins off it.
The plot was flimsy, we got no explanation into Pennywise, why he did what he did and so on. Certain scenes also happened then were never linked back to. Bill and Bev kiss midway (no spoiler) and it's never once mentioned or anything. What was the point in that whole scene. This happened multiple times.
The likability and relatability of these characters wasn't the same as the first film with the kids. Ultimately wasn't that arsed if any of them died. And if it wasn't for Eddie and Richie this would have been very very stale.Positives: Eddie and Richie. Brilliant acting from both, especially Bill Hader. I quite enjoyed the small injection of comedy into this film, worked quite well.
The jump scares aren't too constant, something some horror films love to do.
Several emotions are done well. Funny, Scary, Intense, sadness and so on.Ultimately, the plot let's it down. I could get on board with the length of the film it it all served some sort of relevance, but it didn't. I noticed a few in the cinema got a bit bored midway.
The first film is much better, but it's not all bad don't get me wrong. If you've seen the first you may as well watch this. Just don't have huge expectations.
6/10. It's not awful, but has plenty of issues.",6,0,0,10 September 2019
Defiance," Just didn't hook me in
","I know this is based on a true story and I have no idea what that story was so going into this film I was watching solely from a movie goers perspective and not of a 'how accurate is this to the real thing'.
And the title states how I felt throughout, it just didn't hook me in at all. The characters were really annoying, it was a lot longer than it needed to be so some scenes felt dragged and especially in the first part of the film you couldn't tell if a scene was linear or if it was past of future or what...Daniel Craig's accent was really annoying also.Acting on the whole was good, the action scenes when they happened were very good but ultimately this just didn't really do it for me. It's not a bad film, don't get me wrong and i can understand the positive reviews but this just wasn't my thing and too many negatives I couldn't get past.",5,0,1,19 March 2020
Lucy," One word: awful
","I just did not like this one bit. I clicked on this because I wanted to see a women superhero, with some decent powers. But so many parts just made no sense to me, I'm a film graduate and I found this hard.
I felt like the film was trying in parts to be weird, just to be weird when they could have gone down a better, simpler path. So much was just simply unexplained and done just because she has these 'powers'. She is a superhero so she can do this random thing now for no reason.
The characters: they had 0 depth, so I didn't care what happened to anybody. Morgan Freeman's character didn't serve a purpose. Other than do that lecture he might has well not been there.Yeah I didn't enjoy this one I won't lie. And if you are watching for a simple watch. Do not",1,3,6,16 May 2020
Looper," It was alright I guess
","I dunno. I was incredibly underwhelmed by the whole thing. What I will say is that the first hour of the film just did not suck me in at all, however I felt the 2nd half of the film really upped its game and felt a lot better.
Reading a lot of other reviews on this the main issue seems to be the messy plot and the plot holes in regards to time travel. To be honest I ignored all the time travel issues and focused on just the overall film and the action, but I can 100% see what they mean by it.I thought it was a good premise and it just wasn't executed right. Like the plot is there, you know what's going on, but it's just a bit messy and loose. Also felt a too long.
Positives: Acting was good, cinematography was very nice, great action scenes.",5,3,4,5 April 2020
Get Him to the Greek," Not a bad little comedy
","I watched this because I am a Jonah Hill fan and I think that this is the only film I've not seen yet with him in. And I had no idea on it and I enjoyed it.My main concern was Russell Brand. He slightly bugs me in real life so was curious from the get go on how he would be. And I liked him. I enjoyed the character arc that he was given and I thought he played it well and funny.
The plot I thought was good. Thought it went a bit downhill after the hour mark and the ending was just a bit meh. Wasn't a bad ending or anything it was just a bit dull.
A solid part of the story was based on the relationship between Jonah's character and his girlfriend. And to be honest it just never sucked me in. I wasn't arsed if they were together or not at the end.Overall though, it's a good comedy. Had some good laughs in there and it's a nice, funny way to kill an hour and a half.",7,0,0,24 May 2020

","Okay. Yeah, this film is great. 100% worth watching, it works really well if you don't know the Doss story prior either. Acting, directing and cinematography all brilliant. My only real negatives are that the first half of the film felt longer than it needed to be.
Nothing much else to say, but watch this film if you haven't seen!",8,6,8,8 March 2020
13 Hours," Absolutely loved it
","I hadn't seen this film for so long because I was put off by the length, 2.5 hours. But, I am kicking myself because it's a fantastic film.
Knowing it's a true story just really adds to what you are witnessing. You are rooting for the characters more which really adds to the emotion of the film. The talk of families and the bonding of the soldiers added to this as and it was done really well, each soldier had little personality quirks and it just really made me root for them all, but like I mentioned prior it just really adds to the emotion.Yeah, it's a must watch film.Ps: you don't need to know about the true story prior as it also works really well as a film without any knowledge of the Benghazi attack.",9,2,2,18 April 2020
Warm Bodies," It got better as it went on
","I want to start by saying I feel a bit harsh giving it 6. Maybe 6.5 is more fair. I have to say though, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The reason why I haven't gone for 7/10 is because I felt the first 45 minutes or so were quite dull. I was sat there thinking, oh no this is going to be dire. But, the 2nd half of the film really picks up. There's a good amount of action, I became invested in the 'relationship' and the plot just all fell together really nicely and ended how you would want it to!I will say that if you are putting it on because you want to watch a comedy. I wouldn't bother because it doesn't really contain a lot of humour. But I will say that it's a great plot and I'm happy I watched in the end.",6,0,1,3 May 2020
