Casablanca," wonderful 'golden-age' movie
","This is a perfect example of the golden-age of Hollywood. The plot is fairly silly (to the point of being occasionally incoherent), the set design is somewhat uneven, the special effects are almost laughable, and some of the supporting cast give mediocre performances (Henreid especially gives his typical one note performance, but is more wooden than usual). And it doesn't matter at all. If you like movies, you will love this one. It's hard to say what makes it so magical, but the pieces all come together. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat.",9,0,0,12 September 2000
Fight Club," surreal, downbeat, and rather silly movie -- but fun
","I liked this movie because the performances were so good, and because the first part of the movie was just about perfect at creating an atmosphere of yuppie existential nausea. I always like Edward Norton a lot, for a change Brad Pitt gives a decent performance, and the plot is nicely twisted, but ultimately the movie is just dumb. I think that a movie like this can be more than an exercise in style only when the plot makes some sense. The plot in this movie makes no more sense than something like 'Atlas Shrugged', so the movie is just high class junk. It's pretty hard to discuss the plot without putting in a spoiler, and since the key plot point wasn't obvious to me until shortly before it was exposed (and I had fun figuring out what was going on), I don't want to ruin it for other people. Just don't be fooled by the early part of the movie into thinking that it has anything deep to say.",7,0,2,7 June 2000
Captain Marvel," About average for Marvel movies
","Some early reviews made me expect a 'feminist polemic', but it's not. There are a couple of gratuitous 'girl power' moments in the movie, but they aren't that jarring, and every Marvel movie has some moments where I go 'What?!', so why should this one be different?The performances are fine, and Larson and Jackson are quite good, especially together, and some of the moments called out as being 'feminist' by people critical of the movie can also be taken as integral to the character arc (which is mostly how I took them).Some reviewers complain that it 'disrupts the MCU', and perhaps it does, but I can't keep that straight anyway, so I just take these movies one at a time - I actually liked the prequel aspects. Overall this movie is brainless fun: not quite as good as Winter Soldier (which is my favorite Marvel movie so far), but on a par with a lessor Iron Man.",7,1,2,2 August 2019
That Thing You Do!," sweet, nostalgic story of a rock band
","My guess is that Tom Hanks is a really nice guy. He certainly seems like it when he's interviewed, and since he wrote and directed this movie, and it's really nice, too, that seems to be more evidence.This is a very small movie. It has no pretensions, but just tells a simple story about a small-town band that makes good. It paints a nostalgic picture of the 60's -- I grew up in a small town during that time, and life wasn't so idyllic in my town -- but it isn't trying for gritty realism. The cast is attractive and more than adequate (some are quite good, including Hanks as the band's manager), and the story is observant enough to be an enjoyable confection. It's very nice family movie (my kids liked it, and so did I).",8,3,4,23 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," better than average for the series, not great
","The only really good movie in this series is 'The Empire Strikes Back'. The first movie was fun, but it didn't hold up for me when I saw it on video (this apparently doesn't apply to lots of people that saw it in the theater as kids). But the second movie was excellent (and did hold up). The teddy-bear movie was terrible, and episode 1 was really dull (although I kind of liked the character with the horns on his face). Anyway, I'd say this is not quite as good as the original Star Wars (episode 4, that is), although the acting is generally much better (and the production values incomparably so). It was good enough that I'll watch the last one, although it is a little depressing to think what this series could have been if they had maintained the quality of TESB...",6,0,1,11 June 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," sweet, funny, excellent performances
","It's a standard Hollywood movie, but a clever script, Zellweger's performance, and an excellent supporting cast lifts this predictable story to a level well above most of the romantic comedies. Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as the devilish 'bad boy', and Colin Firth is the only choice for the rather thankless role of reprising Mr. Darcy of 'Pride and Prejudice' (he is a very good actor but in most American movies he plays a pompous and humorless jerk; at least here he is a generally sympathetic character). But as good as all of these actors are, it's Zellweger that carries the movie. Her performance is perfectly nuanced -- she's funny, adorable, and goofy, and manages to convey just enough pain during her character's misadventures to be touching, while still letting you laugh.It's an ideal date movie, and she's still as cute as a button with the extra weight she put on for the role.",9,0,0,24 April 2001
Top Secret!," very underrated spoof
","I think that this is the best of the Abrahams/Zucker Airplane!-genre spoofs, probably because I prefer the genre of films being spoofed here, which are spy thrillers and Elvis movies. Some of the jokes are a little inside, but I think that it makes them funnier (although less accessible). For instance, the scene in the diner where Val Kilmer sings is even funnier if you recall the analogous scene in 'Loving You', which is a wonderful Elvis turkey (and I say this in the most affectionate way). And to me, nothing in Airplane! equals the hilarity of the interaction between Nick Rivers and the border guards or the fun of the opening music video...",9,1,2,1 December 2000
The Italian Job," light as a feather
","This is a very slick movie. It has the same title as the Michael Caine movie, and it has some gold bars and some little cars, and otherwise it's entirely different. I liked both of these movies, but the first is a comedy with some action stunts, and this is a caper movie with a sense of humor. The cast is very good-looking (so much so that at one point when a new member of the gang is needed, you know it will be the best-looking person we've seen recently -- my wife and I had some laughs over that). It's completely escapist, but it's excellent at it.",8,1,2,25 June 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," solid action movie
","This is a very respectable end to the trilogy. The second movie and this one aren't as much fun as the first one, which was both groundbreaking and full of interesting ideas, but the action sequences and quality of the special effects are even more impressive in the last 2 pictures. I think that I liked 'Reloaded' more than 'Revolutions', because I felt that 'Revolutions' left a few too many threads dangling. Like most movie series, this one runs down, but it had so much gas to start with that this movie can only disappoint if compared with the first one.",7,4,8,7 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," explosive fun
","Lots of things blow up in this picture real good. The feel is different, since only Arnold is back (and the goofy psychiatrist in a cute cameo), and the ideas aren't quite as interesting as in the first 2 movies, but the storyline fits neatly with them. (I wasn't sure how this would happen without being a repeat of T2, but it works.) I actually like the TX character better than the evil robot in T2, and Claire Danes is always good.
The movie adds to the franchise in an interesting way (leaving open the possibility of a T4), and the action scenes are bigger and better than ever.",7,0,0,12 July 2003
Face_Off," just didn't work for me at all
","This movie bored me. Perhaps it was because it pushed the envelope a little too far on being unpleasant (too much psycho thriller stuff in an action movie), and maybe it was the total lack of chemistry between the two stars, but I had trouble getting through it. There are some good sequences, and perhaps having the movie around to make a joking reference to in MI2 is worthwhile, but I'd skip this movie. Any of Lee's Hong Kong movies are better, and even 'The Big Hit' is much better. That at least is a pure action spectacle. For my money Lee can't handle 'acting', so if he tries to do anything other than straight action, I'll give it a pass in the future. I am surprised at how bad this movie is.",2,2,5,9 July 2000
Spider-Man," solid rendition of the comic books
","Maguire, Dunst, and Dafoe are all much better actors than the material requires, but their performances add to the fun of this movie. And it is a lot fun. (And you'll certainly get a chance to see them again, since this thing has SEQUEL written all over it.)They take a few liberties with the comic book (no, I refuse to call it a graphic novel -- anything with 50 words per page that is less than 100 pages long is not a novel), but I thought that they were generally improvements. The special effects are not really astonishing (although I probably should have been astonished; perhaps I'm just jaded), but they were good enough to not detract from the story (I didn't feel the vertiginous rush during the movie that you get from 'Soaring over California' at Disneyland, and the scenes of Spider-Man swinging down the street look like a really good cartoon to me).The movie is good looking and so is the cast (and you get to see a lot of Dunst's cleavage, which I certainly enjoyed). It's a perfect summer movie, a little ahead of the summer. I think that it's too intense for most kids under 10, although there were some kids still in diapers in the theater when I saw it, along with a couple of louts behind me that talked during the movie and kicked my seat repeatedly. And we all liked the movie (although I could have done without the louts).",8,0,0,6 May 2002
Bring It On," fluff, but entertaining
","I get the distinct feeling that there was more to this movie than hit the screen. That perhaps it was originally intended to be a slightly raunchy comedy and got toned down too far. The cast is pretty solid, and uniformly attractive. The little brother is very good.It's funnier than I expected, and the girls are cute. Wait for the extra scenes and out-takes during the credits. These are as good as anything in the movie, and are part of why I think that there was more to this movie originally.",6,0,0,28 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," uplifting, wonderfully acted
","I missed this when it came out, and probably wouldn't have gone even if I had heard about it. I expected this to be what 'The Green Mile' was. That is, I thought it would be heavy-handed, pretentious, self-consciously high-minded, and boring. It is anything but these. It's an engrossing story and very entertaining story of two men and how they overcome their past lives. Freeman and Robbins give wonderful performances, and the supporting cast measures up. There are plenty of funny moments in the film, and the ending is intensely satisfying. It is a great movie.",9,0,0,12 September 2000
Shrek," wonderful fractured fairy tale
","This is a terrific movie. It's sweet, very funny, and has a lyrically satiric edge. I think that it will become a classic. The cast is excellent (especially Eddie Murphy in the role of the talking donkey), and the animation is state of the art (although that will change in a few minutes). The movie is great fun both for kids (my 6 and 10 year old daughters loved the movie) and for adults (my dad and both liked it very much, too). I don't believe that it's necessary to recap the plot, but it gives the movie lots of chances to have fun with fairy tales, and they do. There are so many hilarious moments that some of them are things that happen in the background without any notice by the main characters.",9,0,0,28 May 2001
Before Sunrise," straight romance
","This movie is the purest form of romance. No comedy or drama, just straight boy-meets-girl. It's entertaining and occasionally quite funny, but it won't work for you unless you are a romantic at heart. The movie is very sweet, has no plot, and is the most gentle picture I can recall at the moment. Nothing even slightly scary happens, and other than a little mild necking, there isn't any sex in it, either. I guess that Ethan Hawke is cute (I'll ask my wife), Julie Delpy is quite beautiful in the movie, and both of the characters are extremely likable.This is a normal Linklater movie, which means that it's about people instead of plot, so if you like his other movies you really should give this one a try.",9,2,4,3 May 1999
Signs," entertaining, thoughtful, but not 'The Sixth Sense'
","Shyamalan manages to stay with his franchise (mystical and optimistic) without repeating himself. It's not a great movie, or even as good as 'The Sixth Sense' (which I think is close to, but not quite, a great movie), but it is solid entertainment. I've seen complaints about the ending, but I found it fair and consistent with the rest of the movie.
Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix give strong, understated performances, and the rest of the cast is good (I found Shyamalan's cameo the weakest, but he's adequate -- it's just that the rest of the cast is very good). The Culkin kid gives a 'Culkin kid' performance, but he was well cast so it works fine. And the little girl is as cute as a bug.I find it hard to write reviews of his movies since so much of the pleasure of the movie depends on figuring out what's going on. This movie has less of that than TSS or Unbreakable, but it's still part of the movie, so try not to learn too much before seeing it.",8,0,2,5 August 2002
Rear Window," one of the best movies ever made
","I think that this is Hitchcock's best, although I won't argue with someone picking something else. It's too bad that they keep yanking the thing from circulation, since I believe that there is enough ongoing interest that they'd do just as well selling it all the time.One thing to notice in this movie is how skilled everyone is. Even Grace Kelly, who wasn't that experienced an actress does a more than creditable job (although she does flub the line about 'ghouls' in the middle of the film a little), but Stewart and Ritter are just amazing. I think that having a career in which you make 100 movies, something that apparently will never happen again, makes talented actors and directors into something more. The movie is a straight suspense picture, and the fact that it's about something more profound than just whodunnit adds to the tension, since you care about the characters. The casting is great, and Stewart manages to realistically portray a guy thinking about breaking up with Grace Kelly.",10,2,5,18 April 1999
Gladiator," very long epic with modern sensibilities
","I'm surprised that people liked this so much. It was entertaining, but I've seen several movies I thought were better already this year. I found the mismatch between the 'realism' of the sets/props/action and the modern sensibilities expressed by the actors to be somewhat jarring. And while I enjoyed the spectacle, the attempt at being serious (which included jerky camera movements and washed out colors) got in the way of that, too. (This is in contrast to Ben-Hur, which is all spectacle.) I thought that the performances were rather good (Crowe was, as always, excellent), but Derek Jacobi was acting in the wrong movie (I think that he thought he was in Spartacus, perhaps), but somehow it all added up to less than the sum of its parts for me.",6,0,0,15 May 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," another excellent Coen Brothers' movie
","This is a sweet, wacky movie with a feel not unlike 'The Big Lebowski'. I skipped it in theaters because of Clooney, but I regret that now. His performance is, I think, even better than his work in 'Out of Sight', and completely free of the mannerisms that he used in ER (something I was beginning to find quite irritating). The plot is loosely based on the Coen brother's misconception of the Odyssey (a book they acknowledged they had not read before making the movie), but it is a harmless conceit. The look is somewhat artificial, due to the digital post-processing of the film, but I found that this enhanced the feel of the movie. And I liked the songs...",9,0,0,17 August 2001
