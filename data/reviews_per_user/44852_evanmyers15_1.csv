Insidious: Chapter 2," Great Horror Movie!!
","This movie was a huge surprise for me. I didn't believe that they could have made a successful sequel out of Insidious, but this movie was surprisingly very good. Throughout the whole film there was a sense of dread and it was very well played out. There's something about the way that the film was shot that gave it a creepier tone. There were some parts in this movie that made me jump more than I ever have in a horror movie. James Wan is an absolute master in the horror genre now. After seeing the Conjuring and this movie, he is proving himself to be the new name for a horror movie director. The acting was very good and the story was more surprising and creepy than the first Insidious. There were also several parts that were really funny. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror. You won't be disappointed!!",8,1,3,14 September 2013
