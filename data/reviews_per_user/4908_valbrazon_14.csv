The Rock," Fun action movie
","Michael Bay is actually one the most underrated director, many peoples don't like him, maybe because of the second degree scenes in a serious story. 'The Rock' contains some funny scenes and the movie becomes a bit less good than expected. The movie itself is good but the first hour is a bit ridiculous for example with the complaining of the citizens about Sean Connery when he is chased by Nicolas Cage in the streets of San Francisco. The second hour is better and more serious scenes are present, the second degree is till here from time to time though. Also, some peoples criticize the fact as this movie is available in DVD for The Criterion Collection, which is a DVD collection famous for includes classic movies and foreign ones. It's pretty weird to see this film there, but it probably means as they liked too.",7,1,1,20 August 2012
Come and See," A shock movie during second World War
","I've heard of this film at 'Étrange Festival 2011' in Paris. The director Julien Temple presented it, but i didn't wanted to see it during this festival. I wanted to see it because it goes in Top 250 and i was intrigued.The movie is pretty shocking and show the horrors of the war (peoples in a hangar burnt alive, an eradicated village...). I didn't like much because of the shock scenes but i liked the few scenes of action and the ending.This movie is a kind of experience, like 'Salò or the 120 Days of Sodom'.",6,1,9,20 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Very good sequel
","I have seen it at the french premiere with the presence of Silvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The ambiance was awesome, everybody yelled when the actors came and loud applause have been done for the first time we see Chuck Norris and good actions scenes, like the final fight. Probably the best premiere i have seen.About the movie, i preferred it to the first one. the first had good actors and load of actions. Keep the same for the second, a bigger role for Schwarzenegger, add Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris and you will have The Expendables 2. Jet Li is only present at the beginning and disappear for the rest of the movie. There are some references to others action movies like Terminator, Die Hard and Rambo. If you liked the first one, i recommend you to watch the second.",9,48,84,9 August 2012
Lifeboat," The only movie of Hitchcock which take place
","I watched this movie because i love Hitchcock and i was intrigued by the story which takes place on a lifeboat.We follow the story of 9 survivors of a boat who have been torpedoed by German submarine, during the Second World War. They found one German soldier who belongs to the submarine who has attacked them.The pressure increases in the group because they don't have a lot of rations and the German soldier wants to help them to navigate to a supply ship but some of them doesn't trust the German soldier.Alfred Hitchcock has a cameo in most of his films, and he appears in this one on a newspaper, in a publicity about become thin, we can see the drawing representation of Hitchcock.The suspense in this film is intense and the final is powerful. A must see movie.",9,1,2,21 April 2012
The Hunger Games," I Didn't read the book and i enjoyed the movie
","I finally watched The Hunger Games. It was pretty good, i didn't read the book so i enjoyed. Some peoples compares it to the movie Battle Royale, came out some years before the Hunger Games books, the stories are different, but the theme is same. Battle Royale wasn't the first to do a movie about surviving, i watched 'The Running Man' few months ago with Arnold Schwarzenegger and it came out in 1987, there was the same theme. I also can quote 'Rambo' for movies references. I liked Hunger Games for the styles in it and the casting. I was surprised to see Isabelle Fuhrman from the awesome movie 'Orphan' (Clove in Hunger Games) and Donald Stutherland as i saw in many movies. I also liked the action scenes, mostly the explosion of the supplies. By the way it's a bit stupid to place mines near important stuff. An enjoyable movie if you didn't read books, not really for kids because of some violent scenes.",8,3,8,31 August 2012
Batman Begins," A good adaption of the comic
","'Batman Begins' is the first episode of a trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan. Tim Burton already made two movies about Batman : 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns'. How will be this new adaptation of Batman? Like the title say, we will know more how Bruce Wayne became Batman. First he discovered the future 'Batcave' and will learn how to fight with the help of Ducard and Ra's Al Ghul. The Scarecrow and Ducard will be the big villains of the movie, there are others villains but they aren't defeated by Batman himself.The movie is a bit slow to start but the second hour is very great. I liked the scenario and the action scenes, a great adaption of the comic book. If you didn't do, you should watch this film.",8,0,2,10 August 2012
Mr. Nobody," The idea was good but...
","I watched this movie because a friend highly recommended it to me and i heard a lot of good things about it. The first five minutes made me understand what i was going to watch : something very boring The main idea of the movie is say as the life is full of choices, i completely agree with this because i always made choice in my life. But why so long? That's probably the big problem of the movie. It was so boring as i planned to cut before the end but i decided to don't because i prefer watch a movie full even if it looks bad or boring, it changes at the end. But it didn't happened in this movie, the movie stayed boring during the whole time.A movie to avoid.",3,11,20,29 July 2012
The Dark Knight," Less good than Batman Begins
","I loved 'Batman Begins' so i was excited to watch 'The Dark Knight'. Evn his rating was awesome so it gave me another reason to watch it. Also, the actor who plays The Joker died at the age of twenty eight.My impressions of this film won't be like many others peoples : i didn't enjoy that much and i'm not going rate this 10/10 or 9/10 but 7/10. I will explain why : I think the movie doesn't have rhythm because it chain one action scene and one scene with only dialogs all the time. Also, there are many scenes where you think it's over but in reality it's not (when Batman get the joker at the top of the building for example). So i felt as two hours and half were a bit long.Except all i told above, i liked the other things of the film. The Joker was nice and Heath Ledger played him very well.",7,2,6,10 August 2012
Taken," Liam Nesson at his best!
","It was probably one of the best surprises i've seen in my life. I expected a good movie but not that good. I remember as Liam Neeson played cool characters like Schindler in 'Schindler's List', but i didn't expected to a character very fast to fight and ready to all to save his daughter. The movie is only one hour and half which doesn't make the film long or boring, not at all. It seems difficult to be bored when watching this movie. I think actors like Sylvester Stallone and Jean Claude Van Damme have a rival now. If you are looking for an action movie which takes places outside the USA, with the idea of revenge, Taken is the movie you need to watch.",10,1,2,11 August 2012
Dark Shadows," Good actors, good movie.
","First of all, i didn't know a lot about this movie. I discovered when watching it as Johnny Depp is a vampire. Also i didn't know about all the good actors like Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Chloë Grace Moretz, Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper ! I thought it was going to be a kind of remake of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' because the story is about a lady who goes to a mansion for a job of housekeeper. So the idea of mansion, vampires and human being made me think about 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. But i can assure you as it's not.Also it looks like a lot others works of Tim Burton like 'Beetlejuice' and 'Edward Scissorhands', mostly for the mansion and for the character of Johnny Depp which is different from other ones.I liked the movie and i recommend it if you like Tim Burton's work.",8,21,47,9 May 2012
Halloween," Masterpiece of slasher theme
","'Halloween' was terrifying when it comes out, because it was possible as there is someone like Michael Myers in our streets... and still today. It's not the first slasher film but probably the most famous, because it has been directed by John Carpenter. He was the master of horror in the seventy's and the eighty's but his last films were a bit less good. Michael Myers is also the representation of the evil, because of his pale mask and his strange power of be hard to kill. This movie inspired many directors like Bob Clark for his film 'Black Christmas' or also James Cameron for his future classic : Terminator. The sequels aren't as good as this film, this is the best one of the saga.",9,0,1,5 August 2012
Taken 2," The first was better, but decent sequel.
","I have been to the premiere in Paris with the presence of Liam Neeson and the director Olivier Megaton. It wasn't the real premiere because the movie has been projected at the french festival of Deauville one day before.I really loved the first episode so i really wanted to watch the sequel, though i had a doubt as it will be as good as the first. First, i didn't imagine the daughter fight enemies like Jean-Claude Van Damme for find her father, because it was really stupid to imagine that, or maybe be used of 'so bad it's good' movies.The first hour is really good but i didn't enjoy much the last twenty minutes because i thought it was over. It was projected in original language with french subtitles and at the beginning, the Albanians kidnappers talk with their friends in English. I verified on internet and the Albanian is the unique official language in Albania. Maybe it was to show us Albanian peoples are bilingual English, or maybe it's a mistake of the director.Taken 2 isn't a bad sequel, but the first episode was better.",7,25,58,8 September 2012
The Woman in Black," Excellent scary movie with Radcliffe.
","I saw the trailer of this film before Devil Inside, at least something good for catch up a bad movie and i had only one idea : watch it. It's what i've done and i'm really surprised of it! I suspected a scary movie without real interest but it wasn't. It looks like a lot 'The Others' for the style (haunted house and ghosts), 'Insidious' for the son missing and it's scary scenes and 'Dead Silence' for the old woman. I noticed a reference to 'Old Boy', there is a scene where Daniel Radcliffe take a hatchet and walk slowly in the house.I expected a twist ending for this movie, because most of the times there is a twist in this type of movie, but there is not.For conclude, it's a must see movie if you like Daniel Radcliffe and scary movies.",9,0,1,24 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Better than The Dark Knight
","Even if i didn't like much 'The Dark Knight', i was waiting for 'The Dark Knight Rises' like many other people. I heard about what happened during the premiere of the film in USA and it makes me sad, it's pretty crazy such things happens.For me, the movie was better than 'The Dark Knight'. I also liked Bane and i preferred him to the Joker as villain. Marion Cotillard isn't very present in this film except for the little twist ending. We don't know what happens to Bane, he seems to be dead though. I preferred this one to the 'The Dark Knight' for the characters and the scenario. I loved the chant of the prisoners, which at first i thought it was German but in reality it's Moroccan Arabic.My favorite with Batman Begins. Nolan made a good trilogy about Batman.",8,2,6,10 August 2012
