Blade Runner 2049," total disappointment
","Weak story, so weak that if it was on a stand alone Sci Fi movie i would rate it 2, awful directing, awful dialogues, the first meeting between Ford and Ryan was something you'd expect to see in a B detective movie (or E if there was such grade). Jared Leto gave such a poor performance, that it was embarrassing to watch the screen. the whole movie gives an impression of a cheaply made rubbish.",5,3,8,9 October 2017
Interstellar," the movie for the small brained 'thinking man'
","I appreciate Nolan, all in all he made great films, but 'Interstellar' and 'Avatar' were kind of fakes, small stories with old ideas that are very common in science fiction literature and sf movies for decades, wrapped nicely in cg and dramatic music, creating a feeling of enlightenment in any idiot who never read a book or knows not what real imagination is. I never thought of Matthew McConaughey as a real actor, but in this film he does a wonderful job, no one can play the idiotic role of the genius farmer as he does, dramatically suffering just as Nolan directed him, any other actor would have burst in a crazed laughter at the idiotic script, but Matthew, a 'thinking actor' did exactly what was expected from him. must respect him for that. few words about the music, there were all the right notes and volume to make this flick seem like a 'serious' one. but the music itself was created on a very cheap emotional theme. Feels like the budget for this movie was about 10 million $, i cannot see any extra dollar that was spent as giving any result.",4,6,12,28 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," sheer boredom, enough is enough
","Nothing, plain nothing, no original plot, just repetitions of previous plot parts, same shootings, same remarks, same rememberings, same too loud music that's supposed to cover the lack of anything else, fights and more fights with no results, everything is same, nothing new, not one moment of originality in more than 2 hours. Hopefully this tiring saga is over now, and please give J.J A. some rest, few years to recover some originality - if he has any left. The reason i gave it 3 stars and not the minimum is the sea scene, stolen from interstellar, but still nice",3,29,39,29 April 2020
Baby Driver," horrible
","what a pain it was to watch this garbage, even 2 16 years old guys who sat in front of me seemed to suffer. why Hollywood keeps producing these garbages is a mystery to me and to anyone i know. bad acting, predictable plot, no original music, not interesting cars and the car chases look ridiculous, don't watch",1,21,37,14 September 2017
Ender's Game," Nothing original or interesting
","Well, i did not hear about this movie before i went to see it, and probably missed it in cinema - if it was on cinema here. The DVD was not too expensive so reading what's on the cover and considering the actors i expected a good movie. I was wrong. Nothing original, this movie looks like it was made from parts of old films. seems like the creator of this movie took parts from 3 or 4 old films, 1 really forgotten (i am not sure that i can put the name here) and just created a salad. Small cast, mostly cg graphics, no logical explanation how a nation of ants can create amazing weapons and why they do what they do. ridiculous makeup for Mr. Kingsley, where is the connection between his make up and the plot? he says meaningless sentences. Boring predicted movie with 10 good minutes",4,2,5,1 February 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Exceptional!
","If you understand movies, this is the one for you. Exceptional directing, acting, cutting and score, a real wow! Tarantino humanizes hollywood, and creates a real masterpiece. Reminds another great movie: Boogie Nights (1997). Brad is as great as only he can be. Tarantino's Israeli wife is in this movie for 4 seconds, looking amazing, I just saw them in Tel Aviv the other day, and she looks great in real life too. Don't miss it.",9,3,5,30 November 2019
Django Unchained," worst Tarantino ever, boring
","First time in many years that i left the cinema, after 1 hour i could not take the B..S... any more, and with many others, i just left the cinema, of course it would not be fair to write a review without watching the whole movie, so i bought another ticket and came to watch it again, this time i could take it up to about 10 minutes from the end of the film, so, with most of the audience, i left again. Only of course to come back the next day and pay and watch the end. this movie is so boring that when people ate and talked in the theater - it did not disturb anyone, a couple next to me planned their wedding - i enjoyed it. most people actually became friends, friendships were rising just like in the war... I can honestly say that if they gave me the DVD for free i would just throw it to the garbage. I gave it a 3 for the music, 0 for everything else.",3,10,18,28 March 2013
The Disaster Artist," Amazing
","Pure joy, the Franco brothers work so great together, and James, he is unbelievable, there is this part in the movie where he auditions for a part, his performance is sooo amazing! He matured into a real actor, he tried to be one before, but he was never in this level, he trully amazed me. great film, worth the time and money, you get much more than what you pay for.",9,0,0,28 October 2018
American Made," Much better than you'd expect
","And undoubtedly tom cruise's best performance to date. Doug Liman directed everything to almost perfection. such a pleasure to see a good movie after all the rubbish thrown at us by Hollywood and the rest of the world. Excellent story telling, reliable acting pretty much all over, Good work.",9,0,1,2 December 2017
Arrival," Worst story telling ever (might contain spoiler)
","easy to understand why some gave it good ratings, once the regular Joe understands what the story is about (at about the end of the movie) he/she immediately thinks that he/she is a genius and has solved the mysteries of the universe. A very simple story twigged into a web of ridiculous situations, Terrible. So what do we have? aliens so advanced that they can move in time mentally, build amazing spacecrafts without any limbs, know the human race for thousands of years and yet cannot write 1 word in English, clever aliens! the score is so pathetic, as the alien voices are created with electronic music, and for the score the composer used the same electronics, most of the time one doesn't know if music is playing or aliens talk or it's the spacecraft internal sounds. presumptuous garbage, totally worthless.",1,7,12,20 September 2017
Annihilation," Total Garbage
","At 65, and after watching thousands of movies, I think that this is the first time I say total garbage about a movie. shame that imdb force us to give 1 star, it is 100% more than this 'movie' deserves. I love Natalie Portman, she probably thought that this is some 'artistic' film, boy, was she wrong! whoever wrote this garbage is probably laughing all the way to the bank......
May I suggest a new rating system? instead of PG maybe put TG? for these films.
Save your mental health, do not watch it !!!",1,14,26,17 March 2018
