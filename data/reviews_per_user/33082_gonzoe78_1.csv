The Ring," the best horror film i have seen in a long time
","Going into the movie i was thinking its going to suck its PG-13. I was in a theater with all teenagers doing the teenage thing. (e.g. spit balls and throwing popcorn) But 10 min. into the movie that all changed. everyone shut up and payed attention. I going to say that its the most disturbing movie that i seen, and it didn't have to be bloody or grusome. Its the best horror i seen since The Exercise.",10,1,1,23 February 2003
