Deepwater Horizon," USA and México
","And to think all that we struggle with migration issues when the Oil companies almost F up the Gulf of México, i think they should have make us the Mexicans hole with that spill. With a compensation to the people of this country who would one day could have benefit from all the natural life and resources the big corporations have ravaged like crazy , if that would happen we would not have to jump your fence in order to work doing hard labor to scratch a living, we would be in México just chillin eating beans and tortillas like kings. But nooo, where are here eating one another, no wonder why we end up wanting to get out.I hope Justice will serve us equal to all one day, not just the few",7,0,1,22 December 2016
Mr. Nobody," I Like to think i think i understood well
","i would say the flick is monstrous, why?, well, it offers an holistic world view where the naturalistic way of though is the main one, thus leaving the burden to chance to be the explanation of the origin of life, then again this is not the main point of the movie, but it moves forward with that statement as ground conception of the fantastic possibilities inherent in the phenomenon we relate as consciousness, and so on... its a good production, and i am not trying to hurt the movie with the critic, i am just saying that reality seems to me to be far more complex, but then again there are ways to explain it in a simple manner; the complexity of it, you don't go just lay it all out and call it art, yo create art by connecting with reality, onto-logically speaking, but using the film as a way of expressing it, the image, it should make me feel other emotions than the burden of another fiction.By the way, i am not against the naturalistic way, neither the creation, nor other possibilities, if you follow the syntactic line of theories, humankind has develop a serious place for the mystic, understanding it as a science yet to be known: the metaphysical realm, and there is much to be accomplished, all though reason has limits, the dead mans toil has shared the legacy time and again.",1,1,7,20 December 2016
Sausage Party," Is a piece of stool
","First, i respect others way of thinking but the movie deals with some sort of a vague analogy from the social interaction of the many cultures that make our world, regarding the main issue i for one have read this on books but don't have the reference at this moment, but some how the center idea goes out something like in reality we do not perceive beings that are in higher or lower levels of existence, therefore we are oblivious that the higher beings form a chain of predator nature, feeding on the weaker more simpler beings, this has a strong relation to the esoteric philosophy of the early postmodernism of the 70's, that there are cosmic gators, or lions or other animals depicted by ancient cultures that some way are blah blah blah gods... this is just as a watermelon milkshake, but it speaks of the collective interest of that peculiar group of artist that make movies, and get hooked by them and sough out to express their thoughts, the way they do it is most representative of them self's, by taking that crap in to the movie theater... but to me, i have to say that they need to smoke less herbs, read more, and grow an opinion of their own, and by that you have to consume your life to endless lectures about the development of philosophy and logic, what can i share in simple words is that in some point it begins to add up, and only then you star to realize where is God, and Who he is, unfortunately the are too busy having amazing prosperous lives to care about reading Imanuel Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Levinas, Habermass, and many many more, that add bits and pieces to a far far greater than life story, that corresponds to math and physics and all that, but the main point is that the don't read as much as the should, otherwise the movie here should be less stupid, and the resources taken by this production better spent.",1,8,16,9 January 2017
