The Equalizer," Makes John Wick Look Realistic
","'The Equalizer' is based off of an 80's TV show about an ex-spy/mercenary that helps people with problems that need to be solved outside the law, and while the movie ultimately sets this aspect up, most of the film just leads up to that point, and I have to assume isn't really connected that strongly to the show. 
Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua have worked together before in the memorable and very well-crafted 'Training Day', but Equalizer shows that the people involved are only as good as the script, and that's where the weaknesses of this come into play, as well as some silly editing and scene-transitions. 
Middle-Aged Men action films are something of a sub-genre now after Taken, with multiple franchises and installments based around the concept, including the very popular John Wick series. You always use a jury of your peers, so John Wick is the peer to something like Equalizer, and is better because Wick established a stylized alternate world to our own and had well-practiced choreography without jump-cuts, edits, and slow-motion. Wick also got beaten up and ran out of ammo several times in the movie, and had to be saved by friends more than once; in short he was skilled but still human.
Denzel's Robert McCall almost never expends a shred of effort, with planning skills that would make Batman look like a sloppy procrastinator. It's still fun for what it is, and Chloe Moretz, Martin Csokas, and the rest of the cast do a great job in their roles, but the movie gets more and more absurd as it goes in terms of how resourceful and skilled McCall is, to the point that he singlehandedly takes down a wing of the Russian Mafia, disrupting their entire operation in Boston, and then travelling to Russia and killing the kingpin, all without much effort (even though he does sustain a gunshot wound to the shoulder, which isn't a big deal to him).
I love seeing heroes take on the bad guys, it's a great, timeless fantasy that can be very rewarding and inspiring if done well, but The Equalizer takes any suspense and drama out of the equation, and there's very little struggle on the part of the hero. Wick got outclassed in a hand-to-hand fight and James Bond routinely gets knocked around in his outings, but it's hard for me to root for a hero who at some point doesn't get taxed or pushed, no matter how resourceful they are.
It's saved by Denzel's solid-as-always performance and the rest of the cast, but The Equalizer has material that has been way better by much better productions.",6,1,2,8 July 2018
John Wick," Simple, Yet Effective; If Well Shot Action is What You Like, John Wick Delivers
","John Wick is a simple action story with elements that we've all seen before, and nothing about it is groundbreaking or particularly intriguing in terms of the story or performances, so if you cannot value an action film for its set pieces, choreography, and stunt work, then this film isn't for you. For action fans, I would definitely recommend it, the camera work is still yet dynamic, and allows us to see a great view of the action while not obscuring anything that happens. All of the action scenes are quick, to the point, brutal, and have consequences for all characters involved. John Wick isn't presented as invincible, just highly skilled and lucky. His character has been out of the assassination game for over 5 years, and that makes Keanu Reeves playing the part a bit more of an easier pill to swallow. Although I might want to bite my own tongue here, because for a man nearing 50, he carried out every scene to the letter and in my opinion was more tough and convincing than he ever was in any of The Matrix films here. I saw influence from another great 00's action flick, The Man from Nowhere, which if you haven't seen but enjoyed this, I would highly recommend. John Wick has a lot of style, the locations are spectacular, I often found myself asking 'Where did they find this place?' Gorgeous Victorian and old school architecture to high tech modernized homes, you really feel that you've covered a lot of ground watching this. Another element of the style is the world it takes place in. It's a very stylized, slick graphic novel type alternate reality, where coded language, an honor code amongst assassins, and even secret resources and hotels for them is all the norm. The film doesn't treat any of this as strange and takes you along into this bizarre world, revealing more and more at a time, while including things such as John Wick running out of ammo multiple times to keep it refreshingly grounded. Again, in terms of writing, story, or acting, this isn't a critic's dream. I saw this with a friend on a lazy Saturday morning after having some Waffle House, I feel that is exactly how this movie is meant to be enjoyed. As an added note, as a martial artist myself, I appreciated the use of Judo and Jiu-Jitsu on film, most movie fight scenes are 90% striking based and are afraid to show ground and grapple work. Good on them for not being shy of it. John Wick gets a 7 out of 10 for slick, well choreographed action and a quirky, dark humour sheen, complete with a high body count.",7,2,7,15 February 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Latest MCU Flick a Gem in Marvel's Gauntlet
","It's a general rule that if you invest more time into something, the more you'll get out of it. This could apply to studying, cooking, maybe a good solid nap, or a good video game. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is no exception. Anyone who knows me even in a casual sense can tell you I'm pretty into Marvel Comics. I can still remember all the way back to the early 90's (all the way back, because, I guess it was a long time ago now) when it was a combination of friend's comics, a few select arcade games, and those awesome trading cards that had character stats on them that first infected me with the Marvel bug. I remember seeing that art and the style, and what the characters represented, and what really blew my mind as a youngling was when I realized that not only were these characters incredible, amazing, and mighty in their own right, but that they knew each other! These guys are a part of a whole universe!! I think that realization was maybe my first time that I experienced a story with an over-arcing lore. Stuff that was read to me by my parents as a kid, The Little Engine that Could, or Peter Cottontail, didn't feature outlandish team ups where everything was on the line (not that I'd necessarily be opposed to Clifford the Big Red Dog and The Berenstein Bears teaming up to knock the stuffing out of evil aliens). 
I think one of the rewarding parts of a whole universe like Marvel, and their contemporaries, is the sense of reward that the fans feel when they see characters that have their own self-contained franchise and world meet each other and work together. To someone outside of the know, it just looks like a band of superheroes, big deal, right? But to fans, you're seeing characters that have their own harrowed origins, unique powers and motivations, supporting casts, and mythology interact with other characters who are their equals, their peers, and have all of those same elements as well. When you center that kind of team-up around very, very high stakes, like the fate of an entire city, or maybe the world, or possibly, even further, all of the universe and known reality, the excitement and scale of the fictional world that these characters inhabit takes on a whole other level of importance and depth. 
But how do you communicate something like that in a movie, where you have a limited amount of screen time, actors with restrictive schedules, and budgets to balance? I'm sure that for most of film history, something like the Marvel Universe, in its scale and entirety, was considered something strictly for printed, comic book material. You can see in past comic book films that studios that owned the rights to a whole universe of characters never had them meet, never thought of their headliner superheroes meeting each other, and how that would operate. In the past 10 years, Marvel Studios, in conjunction with a few other distributors until they could finance, film, and distribute movies on their own, has become a giant in the entertainment industry, and it's all because of that same idea and concept that drew me to this world when I was in kintergarden. The right minds at Marvel Studios realized that bigger picture, the overall story, was what mattered, and that if it could be communicated properly, would be something that would change superhero storytelling on screen forever. 
We thought that everything had changed back when Avengers first came out in 2012, after about 5 and 1/2 years of build up, and that with the follow ups, things had changed even more, but I can definitively tell you that after Infinity War, there's truly no going back. There's often a lot of talk that the superhero genre is going to burst like a bubble at some point, like Westerns and the macho-action films of the 80's and 90's, which is still possible, but fans of the genre and characters should be grateful that Infinity War has been released before that point. After the great reception and revitalization that the well received Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther movies generated, Marvel couldn't have timed this latest entry any better. 
With this being the 19th overall entry into the series, Infinity War keeps the energy alive in the saga by addressing some of the criticisms that often gets levelled at the MCU by impatient critics and people who might not be as familiar with the overall story: that the stakes aren't high enough, the villains aren't threatening and compelling enough, and that there aren't any consequences for the main characters, that they're insulated and protected to keep the franchise going. One of my main concerns about the MCU since the first Avengers, is that since there's so many moving parts in the saga, how would Thanos be handled and introduced? In the 6 years since he first appeared post-credits, we haven't seen a whole lot of action and development from him as a character. He's a looming background presence, and despite being teased and established in a very basic, general way, we haven't really seen much from him, despite having the opportunity. I'm relieved to be able to say that any worry I had about his authenticity is gone. Thanos is one of the most dynamic, ruthless, yet also fascinating villains in the series and for all of comic book movies yet. Josh Brolin's matter-of-fact and stoic delivery, occasionally dipping into a few surprisingly heartfelt moments, really ties the movie together. The CGI on Thanos captured his expressions, overwhelming power, and menace very well, he blended right in with the cast for me. One could almost say that Infinity War was really about the journey and development of Thanos as a character, and that The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Wakandan tribe are really just obstacles for him that he needs to get past, to accomplish a goal that while sounding insane and vicious, has justification from his point of view. The movie does a great job of taking a character who could so easily be a cardboard cut-out of a villain, evil and cruel just for the sake and fun of it, and makes him into a guy that, yes, while definitely all of that, has a reason for doing what he's doing. It doesn't have to make rational sense, but that his motivations are present and well-illustrated in a few scenes makes him dynamic. Despite how flawed and disgusting they are, even the worst despots from their point of view have some kind of reason for doing what they do, and delivering on that aspect was crucial, and makes Thanos a very engaging villain for us to watch. I now understand that the early movies set the stage for who you thought was going to be a madman of great strength but little character, and then surprised you with a bit more depth once he finally made his anticipated entrance.
I can see why the Russo Brothers were chosen to direct this entry, Joss Whedon brought the team together skillfully in the first installment, but I think his peppy dialouge and lingering on petty conflicts, while perfect for the very first time the team has to work as one, wouldn't have worked for a conflict and story on this scale. The Russo Brothers balanced those inter-personal relationships with a huge, multi-faceted story in Civil War, and were brought back to do the same on a level 10 times bigger than before. (Side note: way to rep for Ohio, boys!!!)I won't talk a whole lot about what I thought of each individual character and actor's performance of them, or the action scenes, the powerful emotional moments, or affects, which are all more or less completely spectacular. Infinity War is long, and this only part 1, and there's just too much to address in this review about all of those topics, this would become a long, long essay. Just know that the huge multitude of relationships are handled well as long as you the viewer know these characters, understand how they fit together, and are able to keep track of what their importance to the overall plot is. I'd be interested in the take of a first-time viewer, who watched the end result of a decade of cinematic storytelling, and wonder if they thought it was worthwhile or not. I can certainly tell you that this experience is mainly for those who've invested the same time and energy into this saga that the creators themselves have, and are arriving at this journey after all this time. 
It's tough for me to view Infinity War as a stand-alone movie, to judge it completely on its own merits, because in my opinion I think that's wrong. I think that's unfair to the design of the story itself, and while I know that there are critics and people out there that will do this (which they're completely valid in doing), it's tough for me to, but I'll try. I do think that it bounces around a lot and the pace can be fast sometimes, but shouldn't it get a pass for this? It has to cram so much into its nearly 3 hour runtime, and even that was split from it being 6 hours with the second part (if anyone from the studio is watching, I would gladly, gladly watch a cinematic re-release of the full cut with intermissions peppered in like they did back in the day). The fast pace and character juggling in a standalone movie without context would be terrible if this were our first time getting to know these characters, but it's not, this movie is a collection of multiple threads that have been established for years, with its own over-arcing narrative thrown in as well. So while I'll take just a few points off for some scenes that I think could've breathed more, or times where I think it brushed past something a bit quickly, again, take that with a grain of salt, because those criticisms come from trying to look at I.F. as its own movie, when really it's a summary of what came before, and I would posit that looking at the movie that way would be the viewer simply digesting the material wrong. I give everyone at Marvel Studios a huge hand for making something for the fans.",9,1,5,8 May 2018
Black Panther," Marvel's Trip to Wakanda is an Outstanding Ride
","Clocking in as the 18th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to date, Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Chadwick Boseman might make some moviegoers wonder that in a series this widespread and ongoing, how could the magic still be there? I feel that the key to Marvel's success is in offering what you expect in a superhero movie: amazing visuals, great characters, thrilling action and storylines, but also something unexpected. Each of Marvel's huge successes takes the standard superhero story and merges it with another genre or style: Captain America was a World War 2 superhero film, its sequel was a spy/espionage-flavored hero flick, Spider-Man: Homecoming was a teen coming-of-age story with superheroics, Ant Man was a goofy heist comedy with heroics, Thor and Dr.Strange are fantasy mixed with the superhero mantle, etc. It gives each of the characters their own vibe, flavor, and niche they represent, and this even extends to the Netflix material. You never feel like you're watching more of the same even though the MCU and related material now spans hundreds of hours of content.  Black Panther carries on the this tradition by merging the superhero genre with a royalty-themed drama. Michael B. Jordan who plays the film's main villain, called it 'Marvel's Game of Thrones' in an interview, and you can see why after watching. Black Panther also has themes of how to balance power on a worldwide scale, and how national superpowers can interact with other countries, if they should at all. 
If that all sounds like maybe it's not quite what you expected, or maybe a bit too political and not action packed enough, do a 180 and think again: Black Panther has all that great content packed up with absolutely beautiful visuals and kick ass action that bring the fictional nation of Wakanda to life.  Unlike something like Spider-Man or Daredevil, most of Black Panther's stories don't take place in anything close to modern American/first world life, so on top of introducing characters, crafting a story, and bringing it to a balanced and satisfying conclusion, the movie also had to introduce non-comic reading (the majority) audiences with what kind of nation Wakanda is, its history and culture, and what makes it so powerful. The movie manages to give you all this information on how Wakanda figures into the rest of the MCU and why we're only just now hearing about them in the story (although there were little hints at it earlier, aside from Age of Ultron, watch Iron Man 2 again!), and make that not just background information about the movie's setting, but an important part of the plot. T'Challa has to decide whether to keep Wakanda and it's technological marvels hidden from the rest of the world, or use his power and influence to help other countries in need, even if it risks invasion.  Marvel fans saw accomplished stage and film actor Chadwick Boseman play Prince T'Challa before in the excellent Civil War, so we already knew going in even from that performance that he'd deliver bigtime, and you get more of the same measured, wise, skilled, but occasionally fun-loving character we already saw. Helping him out is a great supporting cast including Danai Gurira (popular from The Walking Dead) as General Okoye, Forest Whitaker as royal advisor Zuri, a hilarious, smart mouthed and trolling-heavy performance from Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's sister, and Golem performer Andy Serkis as the villainous arms dealer Klaw, and Michael B. Jordan as the villainous Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens, amongst other great cast members that contribute to a story that brings the classic Black Panther stories written by Jack Kirby, Christopher Priest, and others to life. You could tell all of the cast and crew had passion for the project and wanted to deliver something memorable.  Speaking of the cast and story, it's the story of the villain, Killmonger, that really made this stand out for me. I was already excited and aboard the hype-train for sure, but was prepared for reality in case the movie let me down. Marvel has been criticized for its villains before, and how they don't measure up to other great film villains, but in several past installments, we've had villains with strong motivations, and between Vulture and Killmonger, we've seen some of this decade's best villains in comic book movies yet. Some critics are even going so far to say that Killmonger is on the level of Heath Ledger's Joker, and I have to say, his character nearly steals the movie with his well constructed backstory and well-developed motivations. Before he does something particularly heinous, you might even find yourself almost rooting for him after you find out why he's doing what he's doing.  The soundtrack to the film also has its own identity, with typical orchestral instruments being swapped out for African influenced instruments that were studied and recorded in their home environment by Ludwig Goranson, the composer. Royal trumpets and pounding drums accompany T'Challa when he starts laying down the might of the Panther on fools, a sharp female-led chant backs up General Okoye when she starts flinging her spear, and whenever Killmonger shows up, due to his American upbringing, you get a threatening, pounding orchestral hip-hop beat that is in my opinion good enough to be sampled by a major artist (speaking of major artists, Kendrick Lamar's original tracks he contributes to the soundtrack also help jazz up a few sequences and the end credits). 
 Along the same line, the costumes and design of Wakanda transport you to a world as rich as any fantasy movie, or any of the other incredible locations in the now wide Marvel Cinematic Universe.  With stunning visuals, fantastic action, and an ending that really makes you understand what T'Challa is about and what sets him and Wakanda apart from other superhero material, I think Black Panther is towards the top of MCU films. The one major criticism I can give it is going to be a spoiler, so please, if you haven't seen it yet, consider the review done, and go enjoy the movie. If not, scroll lower, and read my comments. The one change I would've made to Black Panther would be to save both of its main villains for future installments, much in the same way Loki from the Thor films has crossed over into other properties and hung around for a while now in the MCU, or how Wilson Fisk is still a factor in the Netflix shows. 
 Marvel has to acknowledge its good villain problem, and they did too good of a job crafting Killmonger, and to a lesser extent Klaw, who was still funny and interesting as well, to just kill them both off in their first outing. Killmonger uses Klaw's body as a token to enter Wakanda, but what if he faked his death and then revived Klaw, forcing Panther to fight them both in the end? That might've been interesting, and then have them both jailed to see justice for their crimes, so that they can be used in the series again. Both of them, but especially Killmonger, are such rich characters that it almost felt like a shame to cut them out of the franchise so soon. But that's how it goes, and as is, their deaths serve the story and are memorable.",8,1,3,25 February 2018
Creed II," Creed 2 is a solid follow up, but not quite a K.O.
","'Creed' is a brilliant way to continue the long-running and often parodied 'Rocky' saga. Creed 2 sees Apollo's son continue on in his journey to find his own path and establish his own legacy in the ring, and how that fits in with what his father did before him. Creed 2 has some solid developments in Adonis Creed and Rocky's story, and is filled with continuity and references to the entire Rocky series that longtime fans will appreciate, but the nostalgia-factor also hurts it to a degree as well.If you've seen the other Rocky films, then you'll be able to tell right off the bat what's going to happen. To be fair, in the boxing genre, there's only so many things that can happen in the storyline that can make it interesting. After all, for the actual sport itself, there's only 3 outcomes: -win, -lose, -draw. The main draw of the Rocky/Creed franchise has always been *how* the main character gets to where he is, and what circumstances surround his life at the time of the fight, not whether or not he wins.Creed 2 borrows the idea of the lead getting too comfortable and too soft from success, and having to deal with a physically larger, intimidating new challenger from Rocky 3, and it borrows the Drago characters, the protagonist's shift towards a new, more grueling training method, and cultural differences/tensions (although to a lesser degree) from Rocky 4. It's like a remix of them both with Creed in the lead, instead. I will say that if you're new to the franchise and don't realize that the series is referencing itself (Star Wars: Force Awakens, anyone?), you might get more out of the storyline than someone like me who's seen every entry in the series.The cast carries Creed 2 along, and every single one of them delivers and knows what fans want from these beloved characters. The last Creed saw the dynamic of Rocky having to fight cancer, which contrasted with Creed building himself as a fighter, but this time there isn't quite as interesting of a driving conflict to push things along. It's interesting to see how Drago ended up, and there's a good attempt to show that Drago's son isn't as malicious or intentionally mean as his father, but because of that, the over-the-top rage and drama of Part 4 isn't there, but the more subdued drama of other entries of the series doesn't quite fill that void as well. There's talk of Creed needing to change his boxing style, but stylistically, we don't see him learning that many actually new techniques or new strategy in detail, like Rocky does in the other films when he adapts to new opponents. The training sequence in the desert is good, but as a boxing fan, I would've liked to see them break down his training more and show the audience Creed truly changing as a fighter. (Side note: while still in incredible shape and doing a great job overall, it might just be me, but it seemed like Michael B. Jordan's hands were faster in the first Creed, just my opinion.)What's missing from Creed 2 is the touch of director Ryan Coogler. As seen from Black Panther, Coogler works really well with Michael B. Jordan, and the difference in feeling between both 1 and 2 is visible and tangible. It's a shame that Stallone himself couldn't direct Creed in Coogler's absence, since Stallone is the one who created these characters after all, and would presumably know them better than anyone else. The cast and their commitment to their parts, as well as the overall context within the Rocky story propel it further than being just average for me, but I would say that boxing-drama/Rocky fans will get the most out of this sequel, and that the more casual viewer could stick with the first Creed. The next Creed should make a plan to hit a little harder when it steps into the ring.",7,0,2,4 December 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," It's Impossible to Kill the Comedy At Stake in This Vampire Romp
","The mid-00s saw the rise of reality-TV style comedies, chiefly with the popularity of the British and American versions of 'The Office', which involved humor based around awkward situations, misunderstandings, and petty social drama rather than the more plot-driven style of a traditional sitcom. 'What We Do in The Shadows' by New Zealand-based director Taika Waititi answers the absurd question of what if that dynamic and style was applied to vampires and the world of the supernatural?Full disclosure: I'm not the biggest fan of horror in general (with some exceptions), and certainly not a fan of vampires. The vampire concept, its romanticization, and how seriously the vampire sub-genre takes itself has always made it a ripe target for satire and comedy, with Leslie Nielsen and Mel Brooks doing a great job of mocking it in 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It'. Waititi's project takes that same satirical spirit and plants it in the modern aesthetic, with plenty of hand-held camerawork and confessional cam scenes that you've seen on your favorite garbage reality shows.It's expertly executed, and after close to a decade of vomit-inducing Twilight sequels and vampire fetishizing, sorely needed. 'What We Do..' shows vampires from what's arguably the most realistic viewpoint ever seen on film, with daily (nightly?) routines filled with their own unique mundane frustrations and challenges, as well as social complications like who to convert to a vampire, and who to simply prey upon. You can tell watching it that the crew improvised a great deal, and the whole production has an organic, natural energy to it filled with fun.
'What We Do' doesn't completely stilt itself on gags, goofiness, and satire though. It has surprisingly well-done special effects and gore scenes, and also draws effective portraits of all the characters, and develops them in their own silly, petty, and sometimes surprisingly endearing ways.I think Taiki Waititi struck gold with this concept and applying such a pedestrian mood to what's supposed to be terrifying. It's not perfect, and towards the end of the second act of the film, at least on my first viewing, it began to drag and stretch a little, with the concept starting to wear thin in places. Luckily, there's enough of a story arc to bring you back in, and it wraps up neatly before it feels stale. Overall, even if you don't have the contempt and fatigue from vampires I do, even if you love them in fact, I would recommend 'What We Do..' Because copies, homages, inspiration, and blatant rip-offs are so common in the film industry, one of the only things I'm worried about is other filmmakers, especially Hollywood-types, borrowing the concept from this production and trying to pass it off as clever and original, since no major Hollywood stars feature in 'What We Do...' and it might not have as high of a profile. Or even worse, a remake. Now the thought of that is truly terrifying.",8,0,1,21 November 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Spike Lee's Latest Bleeds Out a Bit, Great at Times, Confusing at Others
","I generally enjoy Spike Lee's films, and consider many of his movies to be required viewing for any contemporary film buff. I loved 2018's Blakklansman, so I figured that Da 5 Bloods on Netflix would be right up my alley.The story of 5 black Vietnam vets returning to their former front, now-tourist-destination is sometimes charming, sometimes powerful, but all the time uneven.There are some outstanding performance moments here, especially from Delroy Lindo, who I haven't seen in anything for a while, and the always charismatic Chadwick Boseman. There's interesting filmmaking touches, like all the other members of the Bloods being their current-day ages as they relive the combat memories, with only Boseman's character remaining young in the memories, as he never got a chance to age.The 4 remaining alive have definite chemistry with each other, and in some of the comedic moments of the movie, had me in stitches with their jabs and insults at each other. There's occasional tense, confrontational moments that the vets have with Vietnam locals, and those scenes are taut and engaging because you can imagine that underneath the surface, there's still underlying resentment amongst many Vietnamese people towards the military and Americans in general. Those scenes flow well.What doesn't work is when the movie brings us in with a comedic, almost Hangover-like vibe (I think Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicolsohn were in an old-guy version of The Hangover not too long ago, right?), and it lingers on this portion of the movie a while, also introducing elements like Otis' long-lost half-Vietnamese, half-black lovechild who he's never met, that he then has no other significant interaction with until the end of the movie. An entire film could've been made about him reconnecting with his estranged daughter, and they don't even get much dialouge together.After they begin their treasure hunt for the gold that they stumbled on during the war, the movie turns towards a thriller-action vibe, stretching the limits of believability when the Bloods are still able to mow down modern Vietnamese fighters (although not without sacrifices on their end also). The intensity and extreme gore come out of nowhere, and the movie wasn't really marketed in this way, so it's pretty jarring.Delroy Lindo's character, a black Trump supporter, is a commentary on many aspects of modern American society and how our country deals with its vets, however some of his jaunts off by himself, speaking to the camera, get awkward and sometimes unintentionally funny because of how blunt they are. To be clear, what he's going through or what he's saying *isn't* funny. The way that it's framed and displayed, with zero nuance or subtlety, is what made me laugh.There's a lot of dialouge towards the beginning of the movie where The Bloods are getting guided around Vietnam, and they casually drop multiple black-history facts to one another in a very detailed and educationally explicit way. I have zero problems with a film displaying an angle of history that's too often left out of mainstream education. One of the reasons I enjoy Spike Lee's films is because of the perspective and the power he can convey from his experience.However dialouge between fictional characters still has to sound like what people would say to each other, and I have a hard time swallowing that these grizzled old vets would be trading historical facts with one another in such a plucky way. If it was a scene of them educating or speaking to an ignorant white person? Their grandchildren? Sure, that could be powerful. But as it stands, this dialouge and a few other moments in the film where the characters speak so bluntly and openly about history in situations where you wouldn't go into that much detail; take you out of the film.If Spike Lee wanted to make a documentary about black soldiers in Vietnam, I would watch the hell out of it, but if it's historical fiction, then commit to that.Again, it's not all a mess. A scene where Delroy Lindo's character saves his soon from mortal danger is especially tense and very moving. Almost every scene Chadwick Boseman is in is touching. There's good chemistry amongst the leads, and Spike Lee knows how to move a camera, he's a cinematic master, so in terms of visuals, the movie is smooth and stylistic, with a choppy grain used on the scenes from the past, but not to the point that it looks distracting.There was potential for a truly powerful story here, but I think Spike Lee should've chosen between a Nam film entirely set in the past with a young cast, or refrained on the amount of flashbacks with an aged cast, and gotten to the tension quicker.I would say that if you're a Lee fan or a fan of the cast, then it's worth checking out. But in terms of Black History, Vietnam films, or other works from Spike Lee if you're a casual fan of his, then there's other works you can go towards other than this one, which clocks in around 2 and half hours.",6,0,2,16 June 2020
