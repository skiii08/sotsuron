Mission: Impossible III," Superb action film
","I have recently watched Mission Impossible 1 and 2 on DVD, whilst I thought 1 was good, I wasn't over impressed with MI 2. So I went to watch the 3rd film with mixed feelings. I was greatly surprised at how good it was. I thought the cast were good and worked well together, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding (as usual), unbelievability menacing. Tom Cruise, did what you would expect from Tom in this type of film, though at times I thought there were times when it was obvious that he was acting, though this maybe being a little picky. As for the special effects, in my opinion they were as good as any film of this type that I have seen. This is for 2 reasons, 1. They were extremely stunning and realistic, in the films context. 2. In my opinion, the effects didn't overpower the storyline. This is an action film, that is high in action and a reasonably good story line which is well worth checking out.",8,0,1,25 May 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," charming film
","I went to see this film twice. What I really liked about it was its sheer optimism, especially that of Burt Munroe played by Anthony Hopkins. Set in New Zealand it is about an fairly old man who has a dream to see how fast his, mainly home made, Indian bike would go. Along with being optimistic I think it shows the good side in a lot of people and their willingness to help people with enthusiasm and charm. This is lacking in a lot of films which tend to rely heavily on cynicism and the worst traits in people. This film to me a definite 'feel good' movie which made me smile throughout. For charm and unpretentiousness I gave this film 10 out of 10. Fantastic",10,0,0,9 May 2006
The Matrix," Surprisingly excellent
","What can I say about this film. I must admit that I did not see this at the cinema, in fact I watched in on DVD for the first time. To be honest I wasn't really expecting much, and what I saw from trailers etc. I did not think that this film would be to my liking. I thought that it might be high on style but low on substance. How wrong was I, when I watched the film everything all fitted into place, it wasn't about Keanu Reeves trying to look cool, it has got a lot more going for it, including some excellent twists and turns that took me by complete surprise. Some of these twists were so good that I had to evaluate what was going on at least once. One of the very few action films that can be classed as being intelligent as well as good fun.",10,0,1,24 April 2006
