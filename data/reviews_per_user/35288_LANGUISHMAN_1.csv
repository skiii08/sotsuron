Blade Runner 2049," Art in Films Done With Perfection
","This is a film that I would describe as an art-film, but rather being an art-film (like ones that are made for a niche audience), it presentations and narrative are so fantastic that I never found myself bored of the screen.I never really liked the original Blade Runner, I think it is one of the most overrated pieces in cinema. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography and world-building was nothing but impressive for its era. However, the story is slow and the narrative just doesn't make any sense (eg. what was up with that unicorn scene? Why does every single performance seems like they just want to go home?). Regardless of how much I didn't like the first film, I could appreciate its influence and production design. Blade Runner 2049 improves every single thing about the original.The plot was amazing. For once I was able to understand the character's motivation, what their goals are and so on. It explores many themes like perfectionism, life and death and every single of these themes are explored throughout the film like a sacred text. There were so many details and so many beautiful imageries that I could not imagine that these were made this movie by actual people. Everything in this film is perfect. I could see anything wrong with the film. Every single shot feels emotionally impacting and the last scene was me gripping me on my seat cheering for the main character. This is what an art film should try to accomplish. It is a film that tells life through art and art through life. It is not made for a niche audience, instead, it is made as a representation of the future possibility of the human race. These possibility seems so real in our world that I would imagine myself living in this fictional society. The CGI was perfect, the cinematography was bloody incredible. The story was amazing.There were so many things done right for this film that I am comfortable calling it a 10/10. A minor issue that I had with it would be the dialogues, which sometimes feel drawn-out and pointless, but these were added with amazing visual, making you grip with the scene regardless of the nonsense.",10,4,20,24 November 2019
