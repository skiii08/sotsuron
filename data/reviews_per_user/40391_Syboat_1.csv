The Avengers," Avengers Assemble! *Spoiler*
","I have to say this film was brilliant from start to finish, the characters were awesome and the action was mind blowing. I thoroughly recommend this film, it captured the true meaning of an epic feature and this certainly delivers a punch! The Hulk looked great in all his glory and I hope he gets to appear in the next instalment! A great mix of action from the air battles to the streets below. It was great seeing Thor and Hulk battle it out again being the last time we saw them together was in TIHR TV movie from 1988!I think it was faithful to the comics and brought the comic strip to life and I can only applaud the efforts of the film crew for bringing together the characters that I grew up and became so fond of.",10,6,13,27 April 2012
