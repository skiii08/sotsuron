Hereditary," Ugh, not one knife slash in the whole movie!
","The movie does move at a glacial pace, setting the story and characters; the tension deftly ratcheting tighter. There are no cheap jump scares here just relentlessly driving to its grim conclusion. The novel concept of this movie sets it far apart from most others of the horror genre which probably explains its divided ratings.",10,3,6,4 July 2019
