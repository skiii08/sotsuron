Mission: Impossible III," Mission 3
","It's a given that this film would offer little in terms of intellect or depth in the script. Yet the way director J.J. Abrams and his co-writers injected humor and emotions, plus how its action scenes were superbly handled, save 'M:I:III' from becoming just another passable popcorn movie which is why I liked it. It is a film intended solely for the purpose of escapism and it achieves that purpose. Although there is a feeling that it could have been more, it easily surpasses the first two 'M:I' in an explosively stylish way.'Mission: Impossible III,' the latest installment of the blockbuster movies which in turn were based from a TV series, is for those looking for a way to start off the summer season at the movies. Here is a movie filled with action and nothing more. There are the usual: Tom Cruise running and getting banged up, high degrees of improbability, explosions, gadgets, the whole shebang. Still, 'M:I:III' is a fast-paced thriller that manages to get hold of you for the 120-minute span of its running hour and never lets go.8 of 10 http://www.learn-English.ru/",8,0,1,3 June 2006
