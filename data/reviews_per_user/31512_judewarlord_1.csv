Deepwater Horizon," Movie or action documentary
","First of all, this is one of the kind of movies where the trailer promises more than the movie is able to fulfill. In the first half of the movie (or even more, at least it felt like more) you wait for something interesting to happen, but instead it's more of an documentary about the daily life on an oil rig. Then, when you are just about to fall asleep, everything explodes for the next couple of minutes. And in the end we get a bit of heroism, patriotism and the good old clich√© of 'good worker vs. greedy bosses' For a movie where you already know the plot beforehand, the makers weren't able to create a thrilling or even interesting movie. In sum: waiting, exploding, roll credits.",4,22,40,19 November 2016
