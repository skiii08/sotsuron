The Ring," A+
","Loved it. The kind of movie that keeps you feeling creepy long after. Great plot, but you have to pay attention to the clues. Unforgettable! Haven't see the original, but I will now to compare them. Could definitely see this one again to watch for the things I missed.",9,0,1,28 July 2003
Identity," Great!
",Reeeeally good.  The fact that John Cusack is in it is always enough for me to want to see it.  This guy is highly under-rated.  Good story.  Good twist at the end.  Plays with your head.  Just the kind of escapism I like in a good movie.,8,0,0,28 July 2003
