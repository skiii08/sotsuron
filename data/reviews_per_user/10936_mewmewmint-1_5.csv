Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Are you kidding me??
","This movie was a total letdown. I was expecting it to be a lot better because I loved the first one. Vol 1 was awesome. Vol 2 sucked. If Tarantino would have called volume 1 'Kill O-Ren Ishii' and ended it there, I would have been MUCH MUCH happier. This movie wrecks the first one. If I could I would erase it from existence, and then erase everybody's memory of it ever existing. I don't mind there being a bad movie. But when it ruins a perfectly good movie by association, I mind that a lot.Volume 2 is a complete waste of time... I was so disappointed by this film that I can't even give it more than 1/10.If they took these two movies and put them together, people would say it's too long and they should just hack off the last one and a half hours, THAT is how bad this movie is compared to the first. It is dead weight.",1,2,8,3 April 2006
Sucker Punch," Worse than 'Showgirls'
","I quit watching half way through because I just didn't give a crap about the story. Wait a minute... what story? There is practically NO story. It's just a lot of fancy special effects and a couple of cute girls showing off their bad acting skills and campy poses straight out of Xena: Warrior Princess. It's f-ing stupid!! Half the movie takes place in imaginary world with lots of explosions and jumping around with swords, and the other half is pretty much Showgirls without the nudity. Wow I thought that was big enough but I guess not. Ten lines?! There goes trying to be concise. Thanks a lot IMDb. No wonder most of the reviews here blather on and on and are completely pretentious and unreadable. There just isn't ten lines worth of review in this movie!",1,12,22,8 February 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," It was okay...
","If I was sitting at home with nothing but this to watch, and it was on TV, I would watch it. This is pretty much how I feel about all dorky action movies. Yet I wouldn't want to be around a person of such immense dorkitude that they would either give this movie a perfect score as if this was the greatest movie in history or the dork who would give this movie a zero based on dorky reasons like comic book inaccuracy. I skimmed some of the 0/10 comments and experienced DORK OVERLOAD!! Some minor gripes of mine (proof of my comic book dorkitude): Colossus is supposed to be from Russia, and yet he doesn't have a Russian accent. Not only that but he only says two words throughout the whole movie!! Unbelievable! It's like they added him in as an afterthought.Juggernaut doesn't really look like Juggernaut. I understand that you can't reasonably find an actor who is ten feet tall with fists bigger than his head, however movie Juggernaut's helmet looks like it is made out of tin foil. His helmet is supposed to protect him from mental attacks, not protect his good looks... WTF? First, you're not that good looking anyways, Juggernaut, and second, no matter how good looking you are, a tin-foil helmet is going to make you look like a retard. Another Juggernaut gripe is that he is not actually a mutant, he got his powers from the Ruby of Cyttorak. In the comics, his powers are much better than most mutants. He is immune to physical damage and has super strength and stamina. In the movie his power is described as, 'Once he gets going, he can't be stopped.' Once he gets going?? That is so stupid!! People who don't know the comics (I.E. the director and writers) are going to think that his power has something to do with him running. Also he is supposed to be Charles Xavier's stepbrother who hates him. Would it really take that much time to give him a little background story?? Movie Juggernaut is just some jerk-off that magneto rescues from a truck.I was surprised in the credits that Jubilee is supposedly in this movie. Yet I never see anything remotely resembling comic book Jubilee. Where is she?? It's a mystery.One more gripe: When magneto is sending his 'pawns' to battle, how is Spike not among their number? Is magneto so senile that he thinks growing two inch spikes all over your body is some kind of killer mutant power? Not often do you see a power that sucky in a movie like this, not often do you see it glorified so. WOW!! He just has to hug people to kill them, that's AWESOME!!Kelsey Grammar was great as beast, I never would have guessed that was him. He was the perfect choice.I also thought the scene where wolverine was running through the jungle kicking ass was good because it reminded me of some of the wolverine comics.",5,1,1,1 October 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," This was so lame.
","Crummy acting, crap dialogue, and comic inaccuracy. A kid in kindergarten could've made up a better story. This movie sucked from every aspect. Watching Alba doing her mime push was just so lame... 'I'm a sthooper hero!' I'm sorry but Alba can't act her way out of a paper bag.Main gripe is that Galactus didn't look like Galactus and he died waaaaaaay too easily. The writers of this obviously didn't even glance at the comics... though it's hard to believe Stan Lee would have signed off on this load of crap. He's f-ing Galactus! He's WAAAAAY stronger than the Surfer... and he's killed by an explosion that doesn't even wipe the Surfer out for good? What the f*** is this??! And don't you think the Surfer is moral enough to do this as soon as he learns of his true identity? The Surfer isn't so selfish that he would put his life before countless others. This show was so f-ing LAME!!",1,2,5,10 September 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," This film makes me hate humanity.
","The people portrayed in this movie are not my people. They are grubby little parasites. They sit around discussing things that no person would be interested in unless their jobs depended on it. What can you learn from this movie? You can learn about historical events that are uneventful. What I mean is none of the history in this historical lesson has any real impact except to show you how stupid people were back then. If you want to know that, just look around. People are about as stupid now as they were then. Yes, it does tie into important historical events, but doesn't everything that occurred at the same time and place tie into those events? What bothers me is WHY anybody would think this is worth making a film about OR watching. What boggles me is that very boring people have written unbearably boring reviews ten pages long praising how good this movie is. Wouldn't the person who praises a boring historical film this much be just as happy reading any non-fictional textbook you could find at any public library??",1,8,23,29 July 2006
