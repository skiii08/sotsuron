Your Name.," Breathtaking animation. Simplistic storyline.
","The animation is top-notched. The sceneries and images are simply breathtaking. The premise of the story is interesting enough, but pretty much linear. It is an intriguing story but not the type that is stuck in your head after weeks of watching for it raises no philosophical questions or contains any life messages. There is no depth or complexity to the story. This is no Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, and to see it having as high ratings as the latter disappoints me.",7,1,3,23 November 2019
