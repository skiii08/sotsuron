Despicable Me 2," A memorable movie
","I think that the movie was pretty great for a sequel, it's not like cars 2 that totally failed... I must say that I was impressed of the first, but the second is better than the first one ! minions are hell of a part in the movie, usually, in the animations that we've seen before, characters like this were annoying and not that funny with the clichÃ© jokes, but the minions are great and didn't disappoint. I like the fact that Gru's children still have a lot of importance in this movie, they are not useless characters. The villain was great, but we didn't get to see a lot of him, and the final fight between him and Gru was really short. finally, great memorable movie, its good to show these kinds of movies for kids than Selena Gomez's movies",8,0,2,9 July 2013
