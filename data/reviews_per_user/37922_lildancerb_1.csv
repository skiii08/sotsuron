The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I thought that this movie was not going to be that great, but I was pleasantly surprised.
","Charlie is a 15 year-old freshman in high school that is shy and socially awkward. He counts down the days until he graduates and hopes that he will not turn bad again. On the first day of high school it is said that a student will make at least one friend that day. If a friend is made then the day was not so bad after all. Charlie did not make a friend on the first day of high school.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a 2012 film that was adapted from the 1999 paperback book. The director of the film, Stephen Chbosky, is also the screenplay writer and the books author. The film stars Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam, and Ezra Miller as Patrick portraying troubled teenagers. The film is a Mr. Mudd Productions movie that was distributed by Summit Entertainment.Charlie, the main protagonist, narrates most of the movie. He often writes to a friend, whom is never revealed to be an actual person, about his daily complaints. The first friends he makes are Patrick and Sam at a football game. Patrick is a bubbly, homosexual senior that is the step-brother of Sam. Sam is also a senior and the step-sister of Patrick. These three characters become close throughout the movie as Charlie finds himself.An event from the movie that I found important is the scene where Charlie is having trouble with the friends he made. It has been awhile since they have spoken to Charlie and he is reverting back to his bad habit of blacking out. During lunch, Patrick is being beat up by jocks and Charlie goes to help and blacks out forgetting what happened. At another point in the movie, Charlie blacks out again and has to be put in the hospital to figure out why this is happening again. At this point, Charlie, and the audience, starts to piece to together why he is the way he is.This movie was a heartfelt one that I would recommend to teenagers and young adults (college students). Each character has a story that is being told and that at least one other person could relate too. Not every person has the same exact story, but there may be some similarities that need to be seen. Maybe the film can only be truly understood by people who weren't always in the 'in' crowd. People on the outside relate to things on the outside. I liked the movie because it had a message that people can take home with them. The specific message I received was that everything in one person's life can affect another even if they do not realize it. A message another person receives could be completely different.",9,0,0,11 April 2014
