United 93," Surprisingly wonderful film!
","I went into this movie thinking it would possibly be a movie that just wanted to take advantage of a national tragedy and making $ off it. As I was sitting there watching the movie I have never felt something so real, it was like i was on the plane. The movie was a roller coaster ride and your eyes couldn't leave the screen for a minute. The terminology that was used was so detailed and accurate. Even though we all knew what was going to happen you still had that thought in your mind that it didn't really happen and someone will save the day. Well the reality is I have never left a movie feeling so cold and so lifeless. This movie makes you feel so sad but yet so grateful to be alive. The acting was brilliant and like I said I have never seen a movie feel so real go!! and see it!! 5 stars!!",10,2,4,7 May 2006
