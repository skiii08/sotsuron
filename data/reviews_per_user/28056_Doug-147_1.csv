The Blair Witch Project," Movie was way too hyped
","After days of hearing about The Blair Witch Project , I couldn't wait to see it. The theater was packed there was hardly any seats! I couldn't wait! To my surprise the film was a big disapointment.As I sat in the theater I thought to myself Am I in the right movie?? This was supposed to be the scariest movie ever. I heard more laughing in the movie than anything . I found there to be nothing scary about the movie . People say they can't sleep at night . The characters  spent most of their time arguing over being lost ! This movie was very  over rated. The documentary on the Sci-fi channel was a lot better. It showed all the best scenes in the movie anyway. I have to say the actors were good. But the ending of the movie was terrible. My family, myself and all the people in the theater just sat there for like 5 minutes after the movie ended. We could not believe the movie ended like that. The ending could have been much better!  If you haven't seen it yet, you do better by waiting for it to come out on video. Don't waste your time, if you do plan to see the movie be prepared for some disappointment! --hyperg2390",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
