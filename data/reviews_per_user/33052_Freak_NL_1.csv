The Ring," Great Suspense!
","When I saw the tagline of this movie (You see a video, and after 7 days you die) I thought this movie would be some lame horror movie. But it sure wasn't! I got sucked into the movie by the great story, and Gore does a great job on creating a movie full of suspense. And after all, suspense is one of the main factors which makes or breaks a horror movie.",9,1,1,19 November 2003
