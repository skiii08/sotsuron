Black Swan," Perfecting the Dance
","One of the best films of 2010, and for that matter the past few years. 'Black Swan' is dark, disturbing, and beautiful. It is a focused film about one of the most demanding art forms: ballet. The ballerina, especially the prima ballerina must be in the most fit of physical conditions, and because it also demands so much expressive emotion the mental state of the dancer must always be affected by the stress and rigorous preparations necessary for a bravura performance. All of this is so artfully conveyed by the director Darren Aronofsky it seems almost effortless.The film conveys the physical ordeal the dancer goes through, and literally represents the mental transformation of the main character who is tasked with playing both the White and Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's masterpiece Swan Lake. Natalie Portman is mesmerizing as Nina. She is virtually on screen throughout the film, often shot from behind to emphasize the first- person nature of the story. Aronofsky could not have chosen a more appropriate actress to portray his Prima Ballerina in the making. In fact the casting in this film is impeccable all the way around. Even the small roles give us a sense of authenticity from the other chorus girls, to the instructors, and massage therapist. Barbara Hershey as the cloying mother, Mila Kunis in a breakout performance as the 'other girl/swan', even Winona Ryder's minor role as the deposed ballet star stands out in this strong ensemble piece.It is as if each of the primary women in the film are different representations of the same psyche, so it seems clear the director needed a strong troupe of actors capable of giving and playing with and off each other in ways that would keep the audience on edge and at ease with how the story would be told. Vincent Cassel portrays the proto-typical arrogant ballet director, and yet somehow seems understated in doing it. This is a gifted actor we should see more of, and the director did a magnificent job keeping the tensions right at the edge. He and the other men all seem to have designs on Nina, and just like the women in the film seem to meld into one another.The film is about mirroring, performing, becoming. Much of the film is shot either from behind the actors, or through mirrors, so what we are seeing is always but a reflection of reality. We are never quite sure if what we see in 'Black Swan' even happens. Even in the last shot we are left to wonder if what transpires is real, or imagined, but we are sure that what we have seen is the perfection of art.",10,2,5,29 December 2010
Crash," Roller-coaster of emotions
","Like Altman's classic Short Cuts, and Anderson's Magnolia, Crash, by writer/director Paul Haggis weaves a tale of multiple characters through the web of streets we have come to know as Los Angeles. Unlike those other two films this one has a very specific theme to explore. From the opening line uttered by Don Cheadle we know this is to be a film about how people relate, and from the interchange that follows between Jennifer Esposito and Alexis Rhee (pretty sure she plays the Korean female driver who rear-ended her) how people relate tends to be ruled by first impressions or prejudice.Race is paramount in this film, and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption, another stereotype, and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script, tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling one-dimensional.I would love to discuss some of the details of what happens to explain how well it is done, but part of the magic of this film is allowing yourself to be taken on this ride. Mind you, this isn't a ride of pleasure. The first half of this film is unrelentingly in its ferociousness. I could literally feel my rage at some of the characters forming to a fever pitch. The fear and hatred I was confronting wasn't just on the screen, but in the pit of my stomach. And in one absolutely brilliant moment I was literally sobbing at the expectation of horror unfolding, only to be cathartically released in a most unexpected way.Mr. Haggis was in attendance at the screening I saw and explained that the idea for this film came to him one night sometime after 9/11 at about 2a.m. when his own memories of a car- jacking experience from 10 years before wouldn't leave him alone. Clearly this film was his way of relieving those demons of memory, using the catharsis of his art to unleash them and in doing so has given to all viewers of cinema an opportunity to examine our own preconceptions about race relations and how we treat each other and think of ourselves. He mentioned in the discussion after-wards that he likes to make films that force people to confront difficult issues. Films that ask people to think after the film has ended and not just leave saying: 'that was a nice film'.This isn't a 'nice' film, and I would expect that it will provoke many a discussion in the ensuing weeks when it opens nation-wide. It's a discussion long overdue for this country, and it took a Canadian to bring the issue to the fore in this brilliant, thought provoking film.",10,676,1028,1 May 2005
