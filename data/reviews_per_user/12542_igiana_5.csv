Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One for the Nerds.
","I thought that Kill bill vol 1 was crap but this is even worse. It is just shocking to see how Tarantino has regressed in his film making. You would have thought that after taking a while out that he may have grown up a little and come back with a film that would reflect this maturity. Instead he makes the Kill bill movies. They are completely juvenile films that surely would fail to impress anyone other than immature, spotty faced, teenage nerds. The fact that the martial arts in this film are crap only adds to the misery. They seem unable to distinguish between Japanese and Chinese martial arts and film making. As a result the film displays neither. That may not mean a lot to most people but for someone who has been studying martial arts for over a decade it means a lot. I promised myself that i would not watch vol 2 after being so thoroughly disappointed with vol 1 but i was curious to see if it was any better. It wasn't and once again i spent a few pounds that would have been better spent elsewhere. So if you haven't seen this movie already do yourself a favour and give it a miss. It is CRAP!!!",Null,6,11,11 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Boring
","This movie is so boring i was unable to watch it to the end. The actors stink as does the script and the special effects. That guy who is playing the future Darth Vader is particularly rubbish. He is so wooden, it is unbelievable. It all looks so unconvincing. I think there are computer games that look more realistic than this. The water effects are especially poor, totally unreal. They make a big mistake in using so much cgi. In fact the old films look better than this and thats just using models and old school special effects. It is such a shame that this new wave of star wars films ever got made because they don't do justice to the old movies. They were great. These new ones are crap. End of story. 1 out of 10.",Null,0,1,2 May 2005
Armageddon," An all american, flag waving turd.
",I can't believe that anyone actually likes this film. It must be the most cheesy and damn right offensive film i have ever seen. It's nothing short of embarrassing watching the 'hero's' strutting around in slow mo to the sounds of some ultra cheesy rock music. It's just so uncool. If it wasn't for the flag waving all american nonsense i would have found it hilarious. For all the wrong reasons of course. Something about this movie makes me just want to puke. Probably the fact that i absolutely hate it.You only have to look at the other dribble Micheal Bay has directed to know that this film is going to be complete and utter crap. How can someone so consistantly make bad bad movies but still keep getting work. I just don't get it. On the positive side at least i now know better than to waste any money going to see any of his films.I would give this film a mark out of ten but it simply dosen't deserve one.,Null,0,2,26 April 2004
Batman Begins," Batman disappoints
","This film seems to get a lot of very good reviews due to the dark nature of the films appearance and its seemingly grown up approach to a comic book adaptation. For me these are the very reasons that i don't like this movie. How can you take such a dark serious approach to a movie that is essentially about a grown man dressing as a bat. For god's sake, there is nothing dark or adult about it, its a COMIC BOOK. Why try to make the film so serious, you have got to be some kind of super nerd to treat this film in this way. Other comic book films have benefited from the addition of a little humour and the fact that they don't take themselves to seriously. Hellboy is a good example of this. Plenty of funny lines keep the script flowing along nicely. If that film had taken itself deadly serious surely it would have flopped. Not that i think all comic book adaptations should be comedy films, but i think it is a little much to ask grown people to take daft films like this too serious.The spiderman films that have been so successful of late have made a great effort in making the action sequences as exciting as possible. The same thing goes for the X men, Hellboy and fantastic four. Unfortunately i found the action, especially the fight scenes, in batman begins terrible. They suffer from the same muddled editing that a lot of cheap martial arts films do. This is done in martial arts films, Steven Seagal in particular, to cover up the fact that the star is aging, over weight and no longer able to do his usual stuff. The result is fight scenes where you see a leg here an arm there a guy flying through a window, etc.. But you never get a real sense that this is really happening. You never get to see any real moves being pulled off. They got around this in the Spiderman movies by using a lot of computer graphics. During the action sequences the camera is a good distance from the action and you can see exactly what is happening. Obviously Christian Bale is no Bruce Lee so you can't expect him to pull of the most amazing moves during the fights but i feel the director and fight choreographer are responsible for getting around this problem. The result is a film full of action scenes that just don't excite. The romance side of the film is pretty lame as well. Its all a little rushed and leaves the viewer feeling unmoved. Maybe batman is waiting for his 'friend' or should i say gimp Robin to make an appearance.The supposedly adult nature of the movie also manages to deprive the viewer of a decent bad guy. Rather than the usual flying, walking through walls type bad guy we are used to in this kind of film we get a shrink with a sack on his head. This is an obvious attempt to get away from the unbelievable feel most these type of films have and make the plot more convincing. But seeing batman struggling to beat this enemy only makes the lead character seem like a regular guy in a stupid costume. It does not give the film a feeling of reality more a feeling of anti climax.All in all this movie just didn't work for me and is without doubt one of the weaker adaptations of late. The fact that the end of the movie suggested a follow up movie with the joker as the villain only added to the disappointment. Only 16 years have past since this movie was originally made and there can be no justification in a remake this soon.Although i am sure the nerds will love it.",4,0,2,26 July 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino has lost the plot.
","Whilst leaving the cinema after viewing kill bill i heard a guy in the row in front of me say 'He's lost it a bit hasn't he'. He took the words right out of my mouth. I still find it hard to believe that someone who made quality movies like pulp fiction and Jackie brown could possibly be guilty of making such an awful movie. People say that Tarantino spent several years watching kung fu movies before he made Kill Bill. So how come he ended up making a samurai style movie. There is a big difference between the two genres. But to be honest this movie shouldn't count as martial arts full stop. For a start there are no quality martial artists playing the main characters and thats always going to be a problem. The movie spends a lot of time covering the same old ground. The quirky sound track, the over stylistic approach. There is nothing new here. The levels of violence may have increased but surely only the most dim witted of people would rate a movie just on the number of killings they see.Many critics are raving about this movie at the moment but i feel it has a faddy kind of appeal. It's one of those movies that people blow out of proportion just because they like the previous work of Tarantino. I don't feel they are judging it purely on what they see at the cinema/dvd. I hope Tarantino can do better than this in the future because up until this i was a big fan.I rate this movie  5 out of 10. In future leave this genre to those who know what they are doing.",Null,1,2,20 April 2004
