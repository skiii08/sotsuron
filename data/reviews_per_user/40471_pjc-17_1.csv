Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Where Is All The Praise Coming From--The Junior High Boys Locker Room??
","I saw this movie 11/4/06. Although there were a few funny parts, I felt like I was watching a movie written, directed, and starring a handful of junior high school boys who came up with the idea in the locker room. Awful, awful, awful. The audience dynamics (i.e., other people laughing at marginally funny stuff) helped a bit, but after I and my date left the theater, both of us were left to wonder who ARE these critics who say this is the funniest movie they've ever seen, and just exactly what comedies have they seen that have set the bar so low for them? Who ARE these people who think this movie is hilarious? Is this a case of The Emperor's New Clothes? I think so.",1,20,42,6 November 2006
