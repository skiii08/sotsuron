Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lacks in Character Development, but Still Highly Imaginative
","The special effects that can be found throughout The Phantom Menace sets an example of its high imagination.  While it ultimately gets to a point where it more than ever feels like an exhibition for the special effects, they're top notch never the less.  The same really can't be said about the story itself.  First of all, the character development is lacking.  For the most part, the characters are presented in an one-dimensional fashion (especially several characters who play a pivotal role in the story but are ultimately giving fairly little to do) and it could have gone deeper with the background of the planet Naboo.  The restricted character development seems more apparent based on the fact the there's other film that's going follow up on The Phantom Menace.  Also, there's a feeling that the movie is trying too hard in the comic relief department at times (i.e. Jar Jar Binks who's dialog can be pretty incomprehensible on certain occasions).  In spite of this, there are about two points in the story that is able to generate the most excitement (a quickly paced race, and a light-saber duel).  The light-saber duel (with the music aiding things) starts out on a quick pace but then stops in the middle of the whole sequence and eventually goes back into a quick pace.",Null,0,2,23 February 2000
Batman Returns," This Film Suffers With it's Plot
","Although this film is very stylish (and it's able to maintain it that way throughout the movie), it can't make up for a broken up plot that consist of things that are left with out explanation, points in the story that aren't followed through, and points in the plot that feel like they were tagged on like for example, the climax which involves a plot that lacks in build up (it feels like it just came out of no where).  The film also in a way falls flat in the action department as the script occasionally resorts to inane dialog and graphic violence that's somewhat uneasy to watch.  Plot aside, one underlying problem in this movie is that the title character doesn't really play a central part here (it's really instead centered around Catwoman and Penguin).",Null,4,10,17 August 1999
Romeo + Juliet," A Flim That's Hard to Take
","I just found this film to be pretentious and at times untentionally funny. What really makes Romeo + Juliet hard to take is scenes which consist of the dialog being delivered via shouting (unintelligibly). Not only can the overacting be able to garner in some laughs, it's certain scenes that almost feels like something out of a sitcom like for example, the balcony scene (which here takes place in a swimming pool).  Also, the camera work is often bungled here.  Certain areas in Romeo + Juliet are either overblown (like a car chase a one point), incredibly cartoonish, or incorporate unnecessary imagery.  A perfect example of scenes consisting of unnecessary imagery, is a scene which consist of a character picking up a gun (pondering weather or not to kill themself).  The problem with that particular scene is that the camera work incorporates blurry, slow moving, imagery which not only is distracting, but also (if you look further into it) makes a sensation out of suicide.  And speaking of areas in the film that can use a deeper examination, I somehow get a feeling that there's some hidden fascinating with the Roadrunner cartoons e.g. the opening montage which consist of everything moving at a fast pace before there's a sudden freeze frame and we're soon introduced to the characters (just like in the cartoons) and a scene in which a character speeds out of a bedroom as if they were the Roadrunner.  I just think that the style in Romeo + Juliet gave the notion that if it wasn't for the camera work, the people behind the film would belive that you would just get bored.",Null,1,1,19 September 1999
Forrest Gump," At Times Fascinating and Informative but Also Considerably Offensive
","Perhaps the most interesting aspect in Forrest Gump is its various alternations of certain historical events.  While these scenes (presented in the fashion of archives) which center on interaction with numerous past famous people essentially appears to be contrived (not to mention that the film also could have gone further with the satire), this can also serve as some type of source for information on the United States and are amusing and inventive. The storytelling in general, feels like a way to provide some type of information and history of the United States at a certain period. But the film as a whole feels bloated, and along the way, some considerably offensive material can be found here and there.  At one point, there's a feeling that the script is trying to lay down a stereotype people based on the type of states that they live in.  The script in certain areas takes some humor and/or tries to create satire out of people with various physical disabilities along with seemingly attempting to create some humor out of a racial slur based on misinterpretation from the title character.  Certain points in the story are brought up in a relatively low key fashion but we still can help to come to a foregone conclusion on the meaning of the particular topics that are discussed.  Along with that, Forrest Gump occasionally aims for absolutely low brow humor rather than providing more necessary satire.  While the musical score makes for a good set piece, the drama to a certain extent can also rub you the wrong way.  It at times breaks down and treads into sappy territory and can also get pretty manipulative.  Take for instance a small reference to AIDS which by itself feels tagged onto the story.",Null,1,8,27 February 2000
Armageddon," Entertaining, but Ultimately Falls Apart As It Progress
","Somewhat surprisingly, Armageddon ultimately falls apart when it finally gets into full swing with its premise.  Perhaps the biggest flaw in this movie, is the quick editing technique throughout.  The camera tends to cut to another character or shot before another person is even finished with a sentence.  The editing creates the illusion that numerous situations are happening all at once.  Because of this, the movie pretty can be confusing at times in spite of the fact that it can represent frantic situations fairly well.  Not to mention that the quick editing technique grows somewhat tiresome after a while.  On certain occasions Armageddon can fall into the area of repeating itself.  Besides the style of editing, the camera will every once in a while, use slow-motion shots of people all across the world and even some action sequences (e.g. scenes that involve drilling at an asteroid) seem similar. Along with that, certain scenes in space and their outcome (although benefit from moving at a fast pace) can get predictable as they progress on certain occasions.  Although the drama is somewhat sappy and manipulative, it's redeemed to a certain extent mainly by a moving musical score.  But what really can't be redeemed in Armageddon is some ridiculously played out scenes.  For example, there's a seemingly pointless scene on an asteroid which centers on the usage of a machine gun.  In spite of the various flaws in that Armageddon contains, it still manages to hold your interest throughout.",Null,0,1,4 March 2000
Face_Off," Carries Effect Action Sequences and a Silly Script
","Since Face/Off is based on a relatively absurd premise, it's quite easy to look pass various questions concerning logic.  For example, is it really possible for the transition of the faces of people with different blood types to work (the story behind it felt contrived by the way), how can somebody still be able to smoke after they have just had their face taken off, how and why can you tell the amount the bullets you have left, etc. This is off-set by some effect camera work (e.g. up close shots of bullets leaving guns the moment that they're fired) that gives something extra to the action sequences.  For example, there's an action sequence that somehow gives off an illusion that someone is firing a gun while on top of a moving squad car.  But it seems that as the film goes on, the dialog just gets unintentionally sillier and it absolutely gets to a point were the the only thing that Face/Off can fall back on is the action (which can be over-blown and tense at the same time) in spite of the fact that it seems to try to off-set its premise by throwing in a plot about revenge.  While the film carries an increasingly mediocre script, then I suppose it works to a certain degree on a psychological level like its usage of mirrors in certain parts.",Null,0,1,17 February 2000
Independence Day," The Special Effects are Ultimately the Main Thing To Look Out For
","Independence Day is basically a movie in which the special effects are ultimately the main thing that's really worth looking out for.  It used miniatures quite effectively (they probably work at best when it incorporates green lighting) as buildings practically shoot out towards the camera with a loud presence and the fighter jet sequences are perhaps highest point overall in this film but ultimately, that's about it, just a collection of hugh special effects.  The story itself is shallow with an explaination surrounding the motives behind the alien invasion.  The only character trait that's really interesting surrounding the aliens is their telepathy. But the movie only touches on that subject briefly in one scene. At the same time, the movie adds pointless and downright silly traits to the aliens i.e. their smell.  You can also to a deep look into the dialog in Independence Day.  The script is for the most part basically an assortment of one-liners throughout.  It perhaps gives a small notion that it doesn't for the most part want to be taking very seriously or it isn't ment to be taken seriously because of this. Perhaps you can argue that this really provides relief in a story concerning the destruction of earth but at the same time, the writing just feels too lame.  While the special effects are the highest point in Independence Day, they also in certain areas set an example of downright silly storytelling.  Like for example, a action sequence involving a dog surviving an in-coming blaze.  Or a scene in which a hugh alien is knocked unconscious with a single punch.  This scene gives a notion that in spite of the fact that the aliens possess the ability to lay out a massive invasion, but they're unable to fight on their own (meaning without the use of any type of vehicle).",Null,0,0,7 January 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Amazingly Dull (Possible Spoilers)
","The Lost World takes its time to get where it's going (Site B) but when it gets there and moves forward, it becomes more apparent that the movie can mainly be viewed as an exhibition for the special effects.  The numerous special effects are satisfying as they interact very well with the live action and its presence could have possibly created various situations throughout.  But as The Lost World goes on, it slowly grows more and more tedious.  It's fairly stylish with the way the atmosphere is presented (i.e. through the usage of rain) and is able to pull out some decent cliff-hanger stunts, but they can grow exceedingly tiresome as well.  One sequence in particular involves a trailer and the threat of the cracking wind-shield glass, but after it's all said and done, the sequence (while done to an effect) feels over-long.  There are also certain scenes that are apparently there for the purpose of action, but they just feel flat out inane.  Like a scene in which a dinosaur is defeated via a gymnastics routine or a segment in San Diego which incorporates a scene set outside of a family's house which would be better suited for a situation comedy.  Somehow, The Lost World for the most part is unable to really get you involved or conjure up any real suspense.",Null,0,0,19 February 2000
There's Something About Mary," Sporadically Funny
","In spite of being filled with a collection of considerably surprising gross-out gags and things of that nature, There's Something About Mary still has a tendency of being spotty at best (there is about as many misses here as there are hits).  One problem that this movie has concerns the exceeding hammering of various jokes.  For example, there's a gag that centers around the 'beans and franks' getting caught into something.  The problem that lies with this gag is that the 'beans and franks' are eventually shown and it in my mind would have been funnier if you were allowed to imagine what the 'beans and franks' could look like in that sort of predicament (it spoiled the joke frankly).  Not to mention that the writing occasionally gets lazy and certain muffed jokes are apparent.  One bungled gag in particular involves feces being found right near a door.  The thing about this is, there wasn't exactly anything to set this gag up (it was just thrown in for its own merit) as it perhaps gave a notion towards the fact that the movie tries too hard from time-to-time.  It's as if the fact that There's Something About Mary has a tendency of presenting gross-out gags is being stamped as hard as it can.  Along with that, the movie seemingly has a mentality in which persistent profanity (i.e. a word that begins with the letter F) can be used as a way to get laughs.  But at the same time, persistent profanity is perhaps one example of the laziness in terms of writing.  In the aftermath, There's Something About Mary is perhaps one of those films in which a majority of the successful jokes are practically beat to death in advertising.",Null,0,0,3 November 1999
Titanic," Worth Looking for Only for the Action Sequences and Camera Work (Some Spoilers)
","Titanic really isn't very involving in terms of its drama as it starts out. At this point, main thing that can be really worth observing is the camera work.  There are numerous long shots the movie progress, you are able to gain more of a interest with the story around the ship and its atmosphere. It that can help grab a hold on to the scenery fairly well.  As occasionally cuts back to the present day setting were the movie begins but not on a constant basis.  The drama itself at times feels to be lacking.  It tends to force several situations for dramatic impact.  Most of the bulk in Titanic belongs to the sinking of the ship.  The process of these action sequences is seemingly carefully and well constructed but along the way, it falls into various repetitious situations and dialog (e.g. the lines 'Come back', 'Oh shi*', and 'Never let go').  For example, we either see children standing around and crying or crew members (who set an example of the one-dimensional supporting characters and in the process of this type of scenes usually gets punched) arguing with a group of passengers who paths are blocked.  Any other way, this period in the movie (albeit going on forever) is still interesting since it's obviously at moment of panic.",Null,2,4,23 February 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Somewhat Original, but Feels Pretty Redundant In the Process
","It's very obvious that Die Hard With a Vengeance is trying to move away from the type of formula that was found in the first two films.  It doesn't set around Christmas and the action moves around a city rather than setting itself around one particular building.  But there are still several aspects that are considerably similar to the original.  There's German terrorist, a plot about an estranged marriage, and a situation that involves being down to only two bullets.  There are some involving elements towards the way the action is structured at first.  The action and/or tension seems to be based on puzzles and riddles.  There are numerous large-scale, well-crafted action sequences that can stand-out but at the same time, the story seems to lose some steam towards the middle (not to mention that the pacing on certain occasions, really bogs down) to the point were a gets to a climax that's not really stimulating.  Certain aspects in Die Hard With a Vengeance grows a bit tiresome after a while.  First and foremost, the profanity throughout ultimately feels like a really worn-out conversational piece rather than being the exclamation point of a line. Even the 'Yippie Ki Yay...' line isn't very effective because the way it's presented simply feels too obligatory and seemingly thrown in at the very last minute.  Secondly, while Die Hard With a Vengeance also tries to move away from the formula of having one person taking on the terrorist to having two, the movie obviously allows itself to seriously fall into typical cliches of cop/buddy type of movies in which the cops reluctantly work with each other but slowly begin to accept one other as the movie progress.",Null,0,1,18 April 2000
