The Legend of Bagger Vance," Brilliance on the links
","'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is one of those movies that comes around and defines a sport.  'The Natural' did it for baseball, 'He Got Game' did it for basketball, and 'Any Given Sunday' did it for football.  Now, golf has a movie to call its own.  'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is a stunning and magical journey about the sport and a few souls who are affected by it.'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is the story of two people whose lives are directly affected by a drifter named Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith. Those two people are Rannulph Junuh, played by Matt Damon, and Hardey Greaves, played by J. Michael Moncrief.  Junuh is a WWI veteran who was once known as a great golfer, maybe the greatist.  His experience in the war left him shaken, and he loses his swing.  Hardey Greaves is a child who loves golf and wants to be just like Junuh.  His father is another victim of the Great Depression, and is made to sweep the streets.  Junuh is invited by his former girlfriend, Adele (Charlize Theron), to compete against two of the best golfers in the world in an exhibition match for $10,000.  Bagger Vance tries to help Junuh find his 'authentic swing' before the big match.'The Legend of Bagger Vance' seems to be more than a movie.  It has a life of its own.  Robert Redford employs some beautiful cinematography which gives the movie a magical air.  However, some people may see it as too much of a 'Halmark card', but to each his own.  I especially liked the scenes where everything disappears but the course, they really draw you in.  Some have called the dialogue hokey, but I just think they were trying to keep it in that time period.  Remember, people did talk like that.  The only real flaw in this movie is the beginning.  The exposition seems to move way to quickly, and they ask you to ingest a lot of background information.  But, it was based on a book which had as long as it wanted to explain things, and we only have two hours.  So, this isn't really a bad thing.In the end, I came out of 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' feeling good.  It does the sport of golf justice in a way no other movie has.",10,0,1,4 November 2000
Antz," The best animated feature ever!!!!!
","Antz is an incredible movie!  There is no other animated feature that has come along that has been this ground breaking, with the exception of the first one, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.  Antz has got everything that a movie needs these days.  It's visually stunning, with great computer animation displaying the huge ant colony, as well as great work on each individual ant.  Antz also is very funny, not childish.  It plays out like a regular film, just with computer animation.  This movie was incredibly casted.  A huge collection of stars were in this movie, but they don't just put them in and throw them away.  Each person has a particular part in the storyline, even though they leave they may show up later to lend an important hand.  I'm not going to reveal the plot of this movie, because that would ruin the fun.  All I'll say is definitely see this movie, and don't be worried at all about it being too childish.  Antz is great entertainment for absolutely everybody.",10,0,0,20 October 1998
Unbreakable," An Unforgettable Tale of Self-Discovery
","I must say, this movie had one of the greatest ad campaigns I have ever seen.  It revealed nothing about the movie, but yet intrigued me enough to make me want to see it.  This was probably for the better.  If I told a 'sophisticated' adult about this movie's plot before they saw it, they would most likely write it off as pure cinematic cheese and not bother with seeing it.  That would truly be unfortunate, as Unbreakable is one of the most stunning movies I've seen in a long time.I will spare a plot summary, except to say that Unbreakable is not what you expect.  It is, at its core, a story about finding one's true self.  But that isn't all it's about.  Also sandwiched inside this theme-heavy movie are many other well known archetypes, such as good vs. evil, and you can't let bad things happen to good people.  Even though people will come out of this movie saying, 'I've never seen anything like that before,' they really have, if they thought about it.Unbreakable is visually stunning.  I can't think a movie that has used photography to convey a mood like this before.  Unbreakable even tops Shymalyan's previous hit, The Sixth Sense, in this regard.  Every scene was carefully crafted, and you really get the sense that the storyboards were used to their full potential.Unbreakable shares many similarities to The Sixth Sense, but this is not a bad thing.  Shymalyan knows what worked for him in that movie, and has added that in this movie.  The changes come in the form of a regression. Unbreakable feels very old-fashioned.  There are many similarities that can be found between this movie and old superhero stories.  I don't mean Superman, more like Batman and X-Men.  Unbreakable has found a way to express very old messages in a new fashion.I can see where some people would not like Unbreakable.  They just got blindsided by a movie that they did not expect.  I, however, was pleasantly surprised and recommend this film highly.",Null,0,0,25 November 2000
Blade," Finally, a good comic book translation
","I am tired of films like Batman and Robin taking a good comic and draging it in the mud.  Thank god someone had the sense to make Blade.  I read comic books, and I am severely disappointed with the attempts Hollywood has made to turn them into movies.  Blade is excellent.  With no corny script, and action sequences with a very graphic nature, Blade pays homage to the comic. Wesley Snipes does a great job as Blade.  He had a very dark yet cool presence.  If you liked the comic have no fear about seeing this movie.",Null,0,1,18 September 1998
X-Men," Thank you, thank you, thank you!
","Hollywood didn't screw it up.  Thank you.  I had such a low expectation of this movie, I almost wanted to throw something at the screen every time I saw the trailer.  Even that couldn't keep me from the theater on opening night.  I was the one with my eyes closed and my hands together, praying for this to be what I had dreamed for an X-Men film.  I was not let down.Sure, there are a lot of changes from the comics, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie.  The movie is centered around two future X-Men, Wolverine and Rogue.  The others are just scenery, mostly.  Their characters will probably be viewed with more depth in sequels.  Hugh Jackman may be to tall and skinny for Wolverine, but, WHO CARES!!!!!!  He plays the part with the right wit and attitude you would expect.  Anna Paquin works well as Rogue, even though she is very young.  She is the mutant that we feel sorry for throughout the movie, and rightfully so.  The villans are there to provide an opposing view on how mutants should handle humanity's hatred of them.  Magneto, (Ian McKellan) is almost understandable in his violence. Still, I found myself rooting on the heroes at the end. 
I couldn't be happier with this stunning adaptation.  It has just the right amount of humor, action, and memorable characters you would expect from an X-Men film.  That is what kept me glued to the seat of the theater on opening night.  I was the one with a smile on my face.",10,0,0,16 July 2000
Cast Away," An amazing experience.
","The best way to describe 'Cast Away' is that it isn't a movie, it's an experience.  It seems like so much more than just a movie, it is almost like you are living on the island with Tom Hanks.  For the duration of the film I found myself totally lost in it. I was also a cast away.There are a few films which are able to have just one brilliant moment in the whole picture.  'Cast Away' contains several, if not the entire movie itself.  The plane crash is one of the most intense scenes in recent memory, and rivals anything in 'The Perfect Storm.' The scenes where Chuck (Hanks) is trying to make a fire have a desperation and perseverance that accompany them.  The raft scenes are also outstanding and incredibly suspenseful.The best part of 'Cast Away' is no doubt Tom Hanks.  I have never seen an actor carry a film on his shoulders like Hanks does.  The majority of the film is Hanks, and only Hanks.  It takes an amazing performance to pull something like that off, and he delivers.  His emotional state throughout his time on the island changes, and he doesn't have to say anything.  It's all in the eyes and the body language.  Tom Hanks may not beat Russell Crowe for best actor, but a nomination is assured.The mastermind behind 'Cast Away' is none other than Robert Zemeckis.  He directs with patience and maturity.  He allows Hanks the breathing room to make the tedious island scenes work.  I have not seen editing this effective since 'JFK.'  He delivers a movie with a lot of suspense and drama.  The film's end is one of the best I've ever seen, and really is appropriate.Go to the theater and experience 'Cast Away.'  Remember to bring your beach towel and sun block.",10,0,0,24 December 2000
American Psycho," Slasher, with style and wit.
","American Psycho is a rare and refreshing movie that breathes new life into the horror film genre.  However, to call American Psycho simply a slasher film, is wrong.  This film rises above all genres to become an instant classic.  Ever since the original Scream, killer movies have tried to follow a very familiar and formulaic path.  American Psycho delivers all the horror, but still tells an intriguing psychological tale of a killer in the 1980's.American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman.  Bateman works on Wall Street, and is basically a rich yuppie trying to fit in.  He listens to all the latest music, like Huey Lewis and the News, and does 1,000 crunches every day.  This is Patrick Bateman by day.  By night, he must satisfy a terrible blood lust.Patrick Bateman is played brilliantly by Christian Bale.  Bale displays Bateman with an absolute coldness.  It is as if the only humanity displayed by him is when he is killing someone.  I think that Christian Bale is someone to be watched and I see Oscars in his future.  He takes on a role which he describes as being, 'an acting teachers nightmare.'  Christian Bale, however, is an absolute dream as Patrick Bateman.  To think that the role originaly belonged to Leonardo DiCaprio.  Nobody else could have played Bateman except Christian Bale.American Psycho is masterfully directed by Mary Harron.  She injects the film with a sort of style that is all its own.  Not only style, but substance.  Every scene hints at the psychological make-up of Patrick Bateman.  It's very kinetic, as it rises faster and faster to an unbelievable climax.  Overall, American Psycho is a must-see movie for those who have the stomach for it.  If possible, see the unrated version, as it shows Mary Harron's true vision.",10,0,1,20 September 2000
The Patriot," Identity crisis
","The Patriot has been described, rather prematurely, as an american Braveheart.  While The Patriot is nothing like Braveheart, it is still far from the greatness of that movie.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, just flawed in two very annoying story elements.  The first is death. I won't say who dies, but there are a lot of key characters killed off.  So many, in fact, that I stopped caring after a while.  The other problem is the biggie.  The filmmakers, apparantly, couldn't figure out what type of movie they wanted to make.  There are revenge movies, like Gladiator.  There are movies about wars, like Saving Private Ryan.  The Patriot seems to want to be both of these movies at the same time.  The lead character vows revenge on a british soldier.  This is a movie on its own.  However, they try to place american history in very inconvenient places.  I couldn't figure out if the movie was made to show Mel Gibson's character, or to give an insight into the American Revolution.The Patriot isn't that bad though, and it has its strong points.  Mel Gibson gives another stunning performance as our hero.  He seems to posses the same drive that allowed him to play William Wallace.  Heath Ledger shows that he is ready for the spotlight with his role as the rebellious son.  Jason Isaacs is one of the best villains in a year with all kinds of great villains, such as Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, and the storm in The Perfect Storm.  The Patriot is a three star movie, which is too bad.  It had some great potential.",7,0,1,30 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Unforgettable
","Saving Private Ryan is the most hauntingly realistic movie of all time. While sitting in the theater witnessing this extraordinary piece of cinema history, I couldn't help but think about what it must have been like that day, in Normandy.  Although I felt like I was right there on the beach with the brave soldiers who risked, and gave their lives for us.  This is a movie that makes you think.  Oscar caliber performances delivered by every member of the cast, especially Tom Hanks.  The story involves Private Ryan, who's brothers died in the d-day invasion, and the eight men sent to return him home.  Eight men sent to save one may be unfair, but their soldiers and will follow orders, no matter what the cost.  This movie has many very gory moments, but what else do you expect from the man who brought you Schindler's List and Amistad, Steven Spielberg.  This is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend it to anyone who can handle it.  It's been said that war is hell.  But I can't imagine a hell being any worse.",10,0,0,18 September 1998
Gladiator," The best so far
","Simply put, Gladiator is the best movie of the year so far.  It doesn't bring back the Rome epic, it redefines it.  CGI has allowed Ridley Scott to show Ancient Rome as it truly was.  Gladiator also has more than just special effects.  It has a riveting story of revenge, amazing acting performances, and great action.  The action is not as plentiful as in Armageddon, but the scenes do come and they are amazing.  Breathtaking cinematography, and an epic as well as solemn musical score help Ridley Scott's grand vision.  I predict best actor nomination for Russel Crowe, as well as best supporting actor nomination for Joaquin Phoenix.  Go see this movie.  NOW!!!!!",10,0,0,30 July 2000
