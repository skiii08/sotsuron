Conquest 1453," A good movie to see when you don't know what it happens in reality
","I heard about this movie last year when I was searching about the Fall of Constantinople.I watched this movie and I like very much the effects that were used,the battle scenes,the costumes and the actors.But,I know exactly what it happens in reality and I have discovered that there was some things that shouldn't appear in this movie,or just things that should appear.1)Well,i have watched this movie twice because i doesn't understand first time who are the antagonists and who are the protagonists.At the second watch,finally,i realized that the turks were the good one and the Byzantines were the bad,even if in the history it was the opposite. 2)Hassan really exists for the people who said he doesn't.He was the first ottoman who puts the flag on the Constantinople's walls.But he wasn't sultan's best friend.First time Mehmed II saw him was when Hassan died so... 3)The cannon was built by Orban(he built this cannon not Era!!)(Urban) who was from Transilvania,Romania.(not vampires world)The legend says that when the Emperor hasn't enough money to pay him,the engineer offers his services to the sultan.No one wanted to arrest him.4)I think that the love story between Hassan and Era was useless because there was another couple which could be insisted:Gulbahar and Mehmed.In movie,i saw that the relationship between the sultan and his wife was so cold,like an iceberg;i hoped that they were talking more but it hasn't happen.I realized that they were 2 shy teenagers(in reality they were,she was 17,he 19 but however!!) at first meeting:))I hoped that they will kiss,something but it doesn't happen nothing,nothing on the screen...(the sultan was bisexual but it does't matter)5)Another thing that it was wrong interpreted is the mother of prince Bayezid.Some historians says that Gulbahar was his mother,another says that his mother was Sitti-Mukhrime(or something like that).Anyway,in movie Gulbahar is his mother,a very lovely mother,unlike Mehmed... I realized that he does't like his son,because he needed 70 minutes to realize that he does' show affection to Bayezid.At the end of the movie he kisses the little girl,even if he doesn't know her.Poor Bayezid...(i hope Yigitcan Elmali will play the same role on Faith Series:)))6)The emperor Constantine wasn't a bad,harlot,drunk and superficial person.It was a very unlucky emperor and I was so sad when he dies,even if the movie does't show the moment when his head flews 5 inch to west.7)It was very funny when I watched the battle between Hassan and Giustiniani.They were identical,like the twins,and until the end I haven't make the difference between them.But I was sure from the beginning that Hassan will die on the walls hit by 20 arrows.(from the countering) 8)This movie doesn't show when Suleyman Baltoghlu was beaten by the Byzantins.Shame!!I was very curious to see this battle and the director cut this scene.9)In the reality,sultan hates Halil because he dethroned him when he was 14 and reput Murad II.And after the siege,he beheaded Halil.The grand vizier wanted to control Mehmed so,their discussions were very interesting,in movie they're not.And the grand vizier was with the Byzantines.10)In the movie,Zaganos is portrayed like a cloth doll,and he does't argue very much with the grand vizier.In reality it was like Hurrem,but a masculine version.In any case,this movie is very interesting and it respect most of events that were took place:the depression of sultan(note:Zaganos encourages the sultan not Aksemsettin),the presence of Orhan,the battle,the intrigues(some of them).The actors convinced me that they were the characters,even if the scenery was dull.I hope the TV series will be more good.For one thing i'm sure:the series will not show the sexuality of the sultan...or it will do...the heterosexual side...PS:sorry for the fans...",Null,1,5,11 November 2012
