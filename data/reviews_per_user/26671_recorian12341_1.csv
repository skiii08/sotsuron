Resident Evil: Afterlife," You Wont Be Disappointed
","With what the reviewer said that they were here writing a review on how bad this movie was then they really don't have any knowledge of resident evil and this movie was an amazing movie in 3D i went to see the first viewing in Bristol,United Kingdom and i was not bored.... it keeps you wanting to find out more and with a cliffhanger like that you will want to wait till the next one.... Milla Jovovich was amazing as in everyone of the resident evils Ali larter was great continuing her role as Claire Redfield Wentworth miller as Chris Redfield and after his role in prison break no one better to play him Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker was identical to the game character Sienna Guillory as Jill valentine even though its such a short part place very well and cant wait to see more of resident evil later on this decade.... so see it as soon as possible.. :D:D:D:D:D",10,7,16,21 September 2010
