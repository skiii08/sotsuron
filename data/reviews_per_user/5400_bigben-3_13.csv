The Ring," Okay, now I'm scared!
","Okay, this film is sure freaky! I must admit that this movie gave me the creeps, and just blew me off right there and then. Performances of such very talented actors gave this film it's life and brought this film close to a scary reality. This is not your average horror flick, where you can find some psychotic killer running around slashing its victims. No, this is way better, no annoying, freakish music to warned you when it's going to hit you, it just happens - and that's the scary part. This movie pushed the the world of horror films to the next level. Very scary.So, thumbs up to the cast and crew of this film. Well done performances. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,26 October 2002
Finding Nemo," 'I'm having fish tonight!'
","Whoa! I couldn't even remembered the last time I laughed so hard like I did watching this film. I must say, Disney has done its wonders again! Finding Nemo, in my own opinion, surpass every computer-generated animations. Although they are also Disney & Pixar's incredible works, Toy Story and A Bugs Life never gave me so much fun and excitement as Finding Nemo did.<ul><li>and Dory? The best character ever! I LOVE THAT FISH!! from her short term memory loss to that 'whale talk' she did, I was basically on the floor with laughter. The sharks, 'Marlin', the seagulls - 'Mine, mine', the whole aquarium gang, the 'little crab', the turtles, 'Nemo' combined with a terrific plot and incredible computer graphics and effects made this whole film one of the best Disney &amp; Pixar's film. Worth your time and money. Lots of laughter - Guaranteed!</li></ul>Rating: Totally awesome, DUDE!",Null,0,1,26 October 2003
The Mummy," Not bad...
","I must admit that this film did not turn the way I am expecting it to be. Many of us expected much more than this. The cast, overall, delivers a quite impressing performances. Brendan Fraser may have some 'bad acting' scenes, but proves that he can also do better in the field of sci-fi actions. Visual and sound effects, I must agree, are great. From the burning hails through the tumbling 'sand wave', visual effects are far more ordinary and beyond imagination. Overall, this movie isn't bad as it seems. I rate this film an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,17 May 1999
X-Men," X - marks the spot
","Well, what can I say, this movie was x-cellent! though I have not been really a fan of x-men, when I first saw this movie, it changed my whole perspective to comic books.  Although there has been many comic stories brought to the big screen in the past, this movie was so far the best of them all. The special effects and action sequences were the strongest point of this film. So, if youre into this kind of thing, brace yourself, this is one kind of a ride.Highly recommended! Worth your time and money!",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
Lilo & Stitch," Cowabunga! Go Disney!
","Yeah, Disney has done its magic again. Lilo and Stitch is really one of Disney's greatest animated film. A very enjoyable, fun-filled movie suited for everyone in the family. This film also delivers strong messages that is usually uncommon for animated films. It teaches us life's important lessons, such as the true meaning of the word family. The phrase 'Ohana means family, and family means no one gets left behind' clearly displays the true importance of family unity. It's very rare that animated films entertains as well as educate both major age genre. Lilo and Stitch is an excellent example. To all the millions and millions of Disney fans out there, I totally recommend this film.",Null,1,1,20 July 2002
U-571," U-571 is not a 'documentary'.
","Okay, as i was reading some of the comments, i must admit that most of you guys out there gave this film a rather poor comment. Of course, why not, you based this movie to a much better one, AND you're still digging for the solid facts. Of course this movie would be a BIG TIME FLOP!U-571 was not designed to educate us on what really happened, this film was made to entertain. Thats what Hollywood is all about. U-571, although based on a true story, is still a fiction. Do you think you would rather see this film based on the naked truth? on what really happened? I think not. If, yes, go watch a documentary.",Null,1,3,10 May 2000
The Patriot," Masterpiece... Brilliant!!
","Well, what can I say? this movie is truly one of the best. Astonishing! Heartbreaking! Although historically inaccurate, performances of such talented actors truly ignite the screen and brought this movie to life. It clearly displays our heroes hardships, sufferings, sacrifices, the joys, tears and countless lives they have to give up to mold and to present the gift of freedom to this country. Although this movie may not be suitable to everyone (due to violence) but beneath the external bloodshed and brutality, lies its true meaning: The family bonding, which may be one of the strongest point of this film.I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. Even though this film may received bad comments, get way past that and treat yourself to one of the greatest film created.",Null,1,2,10 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan Rules!
","Unlike any other war movies of the past, Saving Private Ryan vividly displays the horror, and hardships of war. It allows you to travel back time, and allows you to feel the terror of the world's greatest destroyer. Steven Spielberg has presented this movie brilliantly, and captured most of its audiences. The actors, art decorations, settings, and its powerful sound and visual effects made this movie come to life. All this elements sums up to one of the best movies ever made.",Null,0,0,23 March 1999
Men in Black II," HEADLINES: MIB BREAK-UP.
","This just in: 'Sources just declared the break-up of one powerful duo- MIB. More at 6 o'clock'Okay, what the hell is going on in Hollywood? Already I've seen enough bad sequels that would last me for a lifetime. Every movie sequel I watch, I would always come out of the movie theaters disappointed. Haven't they learned that most sequels DO NOT SURVIVE! Why do most people behind the camera thinks that if they make one great movie, the next logical step is to make a sequel. This formula never works!Men In Black 2 is one of the many trashy sequels ever made. The first one was already a hit, why follow it up with this? Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is one powerful, funny duo, but in this film, they played some really tasteless, boring, dry characters. The duo magic that was present on the first part is now gone. Combined this with one terrible, poor storyline and you got one recipe for a 'Sequel Disaster'.To all producers, writers involve, please let's just leave this great films alone. Making a sequel is one great risk and almost everytime, it doesn't work. Take a lesson.3 stars out of 10.",Null,0,0,3 November 2003
Titanic," The Sinking Ship
","Titanic, for many of us, maybe one of the great films ever made, I beg to differ. Seeing this movie for the first time did not really gave me the intense and impact as it did on millions and millions of us. To be honest, I find this movie boring and really a waste of more than 3 hours.The story is so much predictable. You can even guess what would happen, and even what's the ending. Performances, I must admit, are quite impressing. Billy Zane and Kathy Bates delivers a stand-out performances. Leonardo and Kate, also did well on this film, but truly neither of them deserves an Oscar. James Cameron, as far directing is concern, really deserves his Oscar. Effects on this film are also great, especially when the ship is sinking, but most of the time I find it lame. To sum up, this film has its own highlights, but truly I don't consider this as one of the greatest films.",Null,5,6,14 May 1999
The Lion King," Lion 'KING'
","Once again, Disney has done it again. The Lion King will go down in history books as one of Disney's great animated films. The voices of such very talented actors, it's brilliant artistry, together with it's humorous and good moral lessons made this film one of the classic masterpiece of the animated world. Truly one of the best. A great film for the whole family. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,15 October 2002
The Waterboy," DUH!!!!
","I really thought this movie is going to be one of Adam Sandler's best movies, but... I'm not really satisfied about the performances of the actors in this movies, even Kathy Bates, in spite of her well done performance in 'Titanic'. I'm not really into Adam's 'baby talk'. I'm having a hard time understanding what he's saying throughout the movie. This movie really lacks a good humor, and they need HELP!So much for the Waterboy.....",Null,2,3,15 March 1999
The Matrix," An excellent sci-fi action !!!
","An excellent, non-stop sci-fi action ever. Keanu Reeves, and the rest of the cast delivers a stand out performances. Fighting scenes, were great and will leave you breathless. Visual and sound effects are one of a kind , and will really take you off to the edge. The story is not spoon-fed on this film, but as it progresses, you'll have the wildest idea of what's going on. If you are into some sci-fi action, Well, buckle up, this is going to be some ride!",Null,0,0,17 May 1999
