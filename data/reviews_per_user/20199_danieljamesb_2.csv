Lucky Number Slevin," Good but not GREAT. Early Summer Movie.
","7.5 out of 10 I thought this movie was good but not great. In the beginning it kicks off a little strange. Your thrown for a loop and if you reach down for some popcorn you could miss a crucial part of the movie.The acting in the movie was good, I mean typical. There weren't very many diverse, difficult, emotional roles to play. There is just your typical movie villains / mob bosses / assassins that you would see in any other movie, only that they are well know expensive ones (ie. Bruce Willis).The movie does have a twist here and there and eventually all the turmoil makes sense but the twist doesn't leave you speechless like an M. Night Shamalan movie would. It is predictably unpredictable as like most new movies out there. I think I might dip back into my old VHS's again to find something great to watch. This was just good.",7,0,6,11 April 2006
Wedding Crashers," One of the Funniest Movies Ever
","This movie was even funnier than I expected it to be. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are a GREAT tag team as the 'Wedding Crashers'. Great acting on everyones part and I laughed all the way through it.If you like the SNL / 'Old School' / Will Ferrell style humor than you well die laughing after seeing this movie. And if you don't die, you will get back up and watch the movie again.Also, the romantic story lines definitely make this a great date movie. It is a hilarious movie with a moral message. This movie makes you feel good, and you don't regret spending the money.Buy this movie. If you liked it as much as I did you will watch it consistently, forever.",10,0,3,9 April 2006
