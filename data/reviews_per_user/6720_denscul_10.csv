Vertigo," Hitchcock can make a good movie without a plausible plot.
","This movie entertains because the director uses the beauty of San Francico, Kim Novak and a good score. The first time I saw this movie, the absurdities were overcome by the above. But after seeing the movie for the third or fourth times, the plot begins to grate on my penchant for logic. I don't mind fantasy, or even science fiction. But, its got to be logical. I find the concept of entering into a murder conspiracy with an accomplice who is as attractive as Kim Novak, and not insist that she move, is simply unblievable. Take it from an old detective, San Francico in the 50's was not big enough to hide a Kim Novak from the eye of a good detective. Then there is the scene at the tower. Its not bad enough that we have to see it once, we see it several times in cartoon color. when you commit a murder, you better think of as many varibles as you can, or you will get caught. Unless you murder some street person and nobody cares. The complex murder scheme makes for great entertainment. But consider this point. How sure could you be that Scotty would leave the scene? Even if he left the tower, the odds are that he would remain in the area. He's a former cop. He's just witnessed a suicide. He can't leave. One of the most absurd scenes is at the inquest, where he is having his character pummeled. Was this the writer's attempt to make Scotty's leaving the scene seem the most logical reaction? Well, it didn't work on me the last time I saw this film.",Null,6,7,22 November 2000
Casablanca," Will time erode Casablanca's popularity?
","Is Casablanca one of the great movies, or is it a cheesy WWII propaganda film.  For the record, it was a propaganda film. Art and propaganda do not generally mix. This movie has a tremendous cast, a good sound track and great director. But all the characters on 'our side' were stereotped as generous, heroic or lovable. The characters on the 'other side' are pathetically sterotyped as evil in Nazi uniforms. My critque of this movie is not about Nazi's and the good guys. As time passes, and this movie is viewed by generations who have no personal contact with the period portrayed in this movie, the major defect that I see in this great film will become evident to more people. Movies made during war time, on all sides had to overcome this hurdle. Stanly Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, made during the early 60's at the height of the cold war, is a better movie because his characters and plot are not plastic imitations of good or evil people.",Null,1,1,8 September 2000
Chinatown," A bit of Art imitating life.
","My high rating is due to the fact that the 'smart ass' private eye character we see in so many of this type genre is worldly wise except for the fact that he misses the paternity line of Faye Dunnaway until the end of the movie, and his lack of catching on causes her death. This is not the usual shamus movie. I was left with the impression that John Huston's character, although wounded and hurt, would get off legally because the last scene plays in Chinatown, where anyone with money and influence can beat any legal rap. However as someone who believes that if you live long enough, your own misdeeds will eventually punish you more than the corrupt law.As for life art imitating life, you have Roman Polanski, the convicted rapist of a 13 year old, and Jack Nicholson growing up not knowing who his father and mother was. This fact of life plays a central theme in this film, and J.J. Gittes had figured everything out but the true connection between Dunaway's character and Huston's, but too late to be the hero. Instead he is like most of us, a guy who hasn't got all the answers, and thats what separates this from your average cop film.As for the film, the only thing I didn't like, and don't like in general, is the tint used to give us the impression that the time frame is the 1930's and not 1974 when the movie was shot. Isn't the dress, 30 cars and ethic stereotyping enough to remind us of that era? Maybe Polanski should have shot it in Black and White, like the Godfather, or Maltese Falcon.",9,0,1,7 April 2007
Citizen Kane," I don't get it.
","Why has this movie become an icon? There is not one shred of humor for all of its innovative camera angles and 'messages'. It unfairly shreds the reputation of Marion Davies as much as it may parody Wm. R. Hearst. Ms Davies was able to do something that Welles has never been able to achieve as Director, writer or actor. And that is the most difficult of the performing arts.  He has never made me laugh. When I watch Kane, and I have seen it many times, because Im trying to understand what other see that I don't. Like Walt Whitman's poetry. I don't get it!",Null,0,3,27 March 2001
The Great Dictator," This film is dated, and not entertaining.
","Chaplin was great a silent comedian, but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when sound came to film. Contrary to most of the reviews I have read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by Chaplin the comedian, and not spend their entertainment dollar watching Chaplin's political commentary.Despite Chaplin's awards and knighthood, I would take exception to his 'contributions' to humanity. The Great Dictator was made at the same time Stalin's brutal dictatorship was having it's show trials, and both Dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of Poland by both Dictators. WWII started in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazi's were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of Hollywood by the Federal government. Had Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satire,in addition to including the Italian dictator, perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians. The Soviet's mistreatment of Jews and dissidents exceeded the Nazi's in time and numbers.Judged simply as a film, many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers, who wouldn't know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were. A classic piece of art must stand the test of time. Classic Greek Tragedy, the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless. Films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made. But those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me.Chaplin, as the writer, director and lead actor must take the blame for what I judge as a dated and tiresome film.Chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the US so offensive, why didn't he return to his native land. Great Britian fought the Nazi'with blood and money. What did Switzerland contribute in the fight against the European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class, and cares little about people who can't join the club.",2,24,76,14 April 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," reevaluation after 40 years
","This movie is still funny, and represents a better quality film than was produced during this era. I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out, and had views similar to the majority of comments at the time.Two years later, I was a pilot in SAC, and was very familiar with the real system, including the two man policy, and the procedures involved in starting nuclear war. But one doesn't have to know anything that comes close to personal experience with the complex systems in place. My complaints, too numerous to mention make me rely on one very funny scene where Peter Sellers is trying to call the President on the pay phone. Nobody has to be familiar with a complicated system, to know that the scene is a cartoon of real life, and not a satire worthy of various awards this film earned. Keenen Wynn's character, an Army Colonel has been sent under force of arms to get the commander in contact with the President. Why then, did Wynn's character act as if the Deputy would not suffice, knowing that Hayden's character had committed suicide? And did Kubric do such little research as to be under the impression that a British Officer could act as a Deputy, when NO foreign officers were allowed access to nuclear control It was funny seeing Sellers trying to place a call to the President from one of those antiquated pay phones. It was also funny seeing Wynn blowing up the Coke machine to get change. But how many films have we seen where Colonels go around without several subordinates carrying various means of communications,especially if the boss back at the Capital wants to learn what's going on- IMDIATELY if not SOONER. Whether it was fast runners,carrier pigeons, or radio; we do not see anything of the kind. This one scene makes part of the film a cartoon, not worthy of any award, because it not well crafted. The scene violates what everyone who has ever seen a war film knows. Its not any different than a cartoon character being blown up in one shot, and coming together in the next shot. It's ludricrous, and admittedly funny, but that's OK for cartoons, not for award winning films. Satire should be a bit more subtle. 'No Fighting in the War Room' is an example of Kubric's genius, and would deserve a 10 had the film refrained from caricatures and preaching.War is not funny, and at times, it is ludicrous. It is a worthy subject of satire and ridicule. And in the proper context, it can be funny. But when a film strays into being a platform for preaching propaganda, its no longer entertainment or serious.Plan 'R' was a complete fiction. B-52's had numerous radios, and were in constant contact with various command posts throughout the world. Since refueling was necessary in order for the B-52's to reach their targets, the B-52's could not have reached their targets. Aircraft carrying nukes on actual missions had been discontinued when this movie was made. The accident in Spain, where 4 weapons were lost during a air-refueling accident caused political reality to end the practice.(Nobody was killed, except the SAC crew members, and no bombs went nuclear). Nobody was killed by any nuclear accident by either side in the 50 years of the cold war. Read history to learn the truth.Why hasn't someone made a a 'funny' movie about fanatics seeking control of nukes?",6,2,9,5 April 2007
North by Northwest," Great funny lines but no plot.
","I'm old enough to admit I saw this movie during its first run. I was a teenager, and I was fasinated by Eva Marie Saint, wanted to grow up and be like Roger Thornhill, a reluctant hero. Of course I grew up, and everytime I see this movie, I see more that I didn't see or hear the first time. Hitcock is a genius because he took a cartoon's script and made a great film. Consider these plot fantasies. Two goons mistakenly kidnap the wrong person at a posh hotel. How did the cold war last so long with such incompetents. Wouldn't real life spies wait until a less public place?  What was the rational for the Glen Cove mansion? The real owner doesn't know who's using his house. What about neighbors? What if he decided to go home? Throwing knives may be a good circus act, but hardly the weapon of choice for a modern assassin. Nor would a corn field be the place and a crop duster the weapon. I've been to Mt. Rushmore, there is no place for a landing strip, let alone any private property. Its a National Monument for pete's sake. Oh yeah, when Eva and  Gary are being chased by the bad guys as they crawl over the monument, why didn't they pitch the gizmo with the microfilm over the monument. The bad guys never would have found it. On the other hand, I think the  auction scene was pure genius. Lehman can write funny one liners and lines that drip with hidden sexuality.",Null,0,2,5 November 2001
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," One more drama sans documentary
","I give this movie a 3 because it is a propaganda. I do not enjoy seeing a movie, no matter how funny, well directed or acted; that pretends to be an accurate reflection of the past, and is not. Too many young people see movies like this and come away with a distorted perspective about the era following WWII, which did not really end until the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of Soviet communism. Mc Carthy was not the only person who made a fool of himself. Those who denied the threat of communism in this county were members of a tribe that Lenin called 'useful idiots'. Is this movie trying to make another generation? Clooney's Murrow is an American Eagle. My impression of Murrow at the time (yes I saw the show on B & W TV was that he was more like a buzzard picking the bones of an animal already dead.",3,8,20,5 November 2005
Some Like It Hot," Marylyn Monroe's Best Movie
","Monroe was the reigning blond bombshell when she made this movie. For all of her problems and the complaints about her from the critics, could anyone else have played this role as she did. Forget how many times it took her to get it the way Billy Wilder wanted it. 50 years later, we can watch her and not wonder why she caught the attention of the countries men, including America's best playwrite, Joe Dimagio, and a Senator from Mass. She was good in the Seven Year Itch and the Misfits, so critics can't say she only had one great movie. But this is my favorite because she is cute, funny and somehow sexy and innocent at the same time. I have a feeling that's the way she really was in life. She couldn't help that she had that great skin and sex appeal. Would this movie be on nearly everyone's favorite 100 movies without her? Curtis and Lemmon are great, along with the supporting actors - Joe E Brown (Nobody's Perfect Line one of the all time great quotes. Who could play a legendary gangster better than George Raft, or a better cop than Pat O'Brian. If this doesn't make you feel better, you need to see a doctor.",10,4,6,12 April 2006
Stalag 17," Great Movie even with flawed plot.
","Any movie that launches a successful TV series and captures an Oscar for the lead can't be all that bad. But the idea that the Germans would put a 'spy' inside an American POW camp (comprised of sergeants) is ludicrous. After watching the film in 2006, I learned that Wilder, who was the Director, Producer and one of the writers, broke off his relationship with Paramount when the film was shown in Germany, and the American spy became a Polish spy. Wilder, who had some relatives die in German concentration camps may have been justified for personal reasons, but I think the character 'Security' was a way for Wilder to portray his anti-German feelings. (This movie was made less than a decade after WWII ended).When an artist crosses the line between telling the truth, and starts to engage in propaganda he becomes a hack. There were many goofs made in this movie that illustrated to me that the truth was stretched to cartoon-like proportions. With Nazi manpower stretched to the limit, that the Nazi's would place a spy in a barracks full of sergeants does not make the main plot line believable. It would have been an odious job, and require a professional whose service would have been more valuable at another pursuit. Perhaps the Germans had used a Polish Prisoner to keep track of other prisoners, and wanted to give the film the plausibility it lacked in the original version.The film begins 'a few weeks before Christmas' in 1944. Hundress of American Bombers had crashed inside Germany. Not only did they know everything about their aircraft, the Nazi's had put together pieces of our planes, and had flown them inside US bomber formations as a battle tactic.When Lt. Dunbar is assigned temporarily to the barracks, I wondered why the character couldn't have just been another sergeant. But then William Holden's character couldn't have given the audience the impression that Dunbar's mother's money got him through pilot training. I am not a writer, but I was a USAF pilot, and I know that money and influence doesn't help a bit when your flying solo. Also, did anyone notice that Lt. Dunbar had to look at his dog tags when asked what his serial number was? I can still remember my original numbers, and that was 41 years ago. The scene where Dunbar is sleep deprived (a Geneva convention violation) and in walks the Geneva Accord Representative. To quote one line from the movie, 'the Krauts may be dumb, but they're not stupid. And everyone seemed to have watches. Are we to believe that watches would not have been stolen by the guards, exchanged for food, blankets and other favors? The writers have Lt. Dunbar being taken away from the camp as a sabateur because he blew up an ammunition train. Is it plausible that a matchbook with a cigarette stuck inside could be thrown inside a train, and three minutes later an fire would consume boxes of ammo with a resulting explosion. How far can one throw book of matches with a cigarette? Do German Ammo cars always travel with their doors open? Did anyone associated with this movie ever handle ammo. It's very hard to ignite, except in the way its intended to be used., i.e, a firing pin, or a very hot fire is necessary for ignition.Since this movie takes place in a mountainous area in Germany, and the time of year is the beginning of winter, Lt. Dunbar would have died of hypothermia, standing in the water tower. Why the Authors choose to put him in the water tower seems more far fetched that the smoke bomb excape from the SS guards. Several commentators have mentioned King Rat in comparison with this movie. Holden won and deserved his Academy Award. But George Siegal was even better in King Rat, and the plot was more believable because Rat was a complete and believable movie. Siegal's character becomes just one more enlisted man whose throne is overturned by the liberation of the camp. In Stalag, as several reviewers have mentioned, is flawed because we don't know whether the excape is successful, and the consequences of the others is unknown.",5,5,10,12 October 2000
