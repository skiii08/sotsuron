E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Magical.
","From the Amblin' take of the Universal logo, to the beautiful and iconic moon/bike shot with the uplifting and spine-tingling John Williams score; This IS a magical film that has been touched by the gods of film. I love the way Spieler only shows the bottom halfs of the 'bad guys' throughout the film, exactly like he did recently in the crimescene shots of the CIA following Frank Abignale, in Catch Me If You Can.Every Speilberg/Williams film is a storytelling powerhouse and this is no exception. (See the enhanced anniversary edition if you think it looks dated.)",10,1,2,24 September 2003
