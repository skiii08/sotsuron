Scarface," One of the best gangster films of our time
","Pacino gives one of his best performances as Tony Montana, in a film that has about as many trademarks as The Godfather. Hands down, this film is a classic.  One of the 100 greatest movies of all time on my list.",9,0,0,20 October 1998
Se7en," A VERY good movie; one of the best
","Morgan Freeman steals the show once again in this EXCELLENT thriller.  A great storyline, and great suspense makes this film one of the best.  Kevin Spacey is great as 'John Doe'; this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.",9,0,0,18 December 1998
Predator," One of my favorites of all-time
","This movie has it all.  Action, suspense, a bad-ass villain... you can't go wrong with Predator.  After seeing T2, and a few other graphic-cluttered flicks, I'm STILL amazed at the way they made the Predator camouflage. How'd they do it that far back in '87??  One of the best ever.",10,0,0,14 January 1999
He Got Game," Good film
","Spike Lee does it again.  'He Got Game' is a good movie with a great message.  This is a movie that anyone could more or less identify with.  I was a bit let down by the weird ending, but this is a very good film.",8,0,2,11 November 1998
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," GREAT movie
",One of the best films ever made; the only thing that takes away from it is how annoying Edward Furlong as John Connor is. Arrgghhh!!..with all his screaming; that's the only thing preventing me from loving this movie EVERYTIME I watch it.  VERY excellent nevertheless.,9,3,4,24 December 1998
Independence Day," What a BAD movie...
","I don't see what the big deal with this movie was.  It's HORRIBLE!!!  This is one of the worst movies of our decade.  It relied totally on its special effects to carry it.  A disgrace to the movie industry, and a waste of money in my opinion.",1,3,9,20 October 1998
Raging Bull," EXCELLENT...
","What a great movie!  I think this is De Niro's best role!  Joe Pesci was great also; 'Raging Bull' is one of the best movies of our time, Scorcese's best.",10,0,0,12 January 1999
Heat," What a great movie
","Who would've thought that Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro would be on the same screen together.  The impact these two actors bring to the screen is impeccable.  Arguably the two best actors in the business, Pacino and DeNiro are awesome in this crime epic.  Heat is already a cult classic because of the two powerhouse actors.  One of my favorites; I watch it all the time. Indeed a classic.",9,0,0,24 October 1998
