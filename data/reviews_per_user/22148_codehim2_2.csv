Iron Man 3," A Huge Iron Mandarin Mistake!
","The main beef I have with this film surrounds the directorial choice to use the Mandarin as a total foil instead of the true antagonist. Perhaps a candidate for one of the worst ideas EVER by the MCU! Obviously the director had little affinity to the original Iron Man story, or he would never have attempted such a thing. And yet I thought they picked THE PERFECT ACTOR to play the Mandarin too! Such a disappointment that they wasted his talent, especially since the antagonist (Aldrich Killian) was a laughable substitute with a nearly spoof-like backstory and shallow motivations. To add insult to injury, they write the plot where Tony spends basically the whole movie out of the suit, and then has him totally destroy all his remaining suits at the end for some fireworks. Overall, I'd give it 5 exploding Iron Man suits out of 10.",5,2,3,3 June 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Intense Action, Deplorable Storytelling
","Soooo...hearing mixed opinions about this movie, I decided to go in with an open mind. And the more I watched, the more I really tried to see some light in the midst of this morbid portrayal of these comic hero's, but alas, the cacophony of absurdities dramatically overwhelmed my viewing experience. Suffice to say, if what you want to see in a movie is intense special effects, buildings falling, fires burning, fists bashing, and actors grimacing, then this movie is for you. But if you value any kind of reasonable plot flow, authentic character motivations, logistical actions, and at least a shred of an inspirational tone in a superhero movie, then you likely WILL NOT enjoy this movie. At least, this is my verdict on this one anyway.",4,4,10,5 April 2016
