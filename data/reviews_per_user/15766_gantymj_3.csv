Mission: Impossible III," Good but not great
","For me this was the must see movie of the year, I love Tom Cruise and a huge fan of the previous two MI's.I wasn't disappointed MI3 does exactly what you would expect it to.... explosions, guns, fights, disguises, break ins and escapes but we've seen it all before.There is nothing ground breaking in MI3 however it is still a thoroughly enjoyable movie.Tom is as good as ever (great to see the smile is still there.... although having Katie Holmes as a g/f must help considerably) ably backed up by Ving Rhames, and the oh so sexy Maggie Q!! The dude from bend it like Beckham is also good! Overall I was entertained its good but not as good as the first two!",7,0,0,15 May 2006
Hot Fuzz," Superb
","My wife and I chose to watch this movie because we wanted to laugh out loud at a film....and laugh out loud we did.The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic the gags are seamless, they appear like two guys who have been together for years (which of course they are) and all this leads to one of the funniest films I have watched in a long long time.Yes a lot of the jokes are crude and child like but occasionally that is what is required!! Any one expecting to see a movie with clever sub plots and intricate jokes will probably be disappointed but if you want a two hour escape to action, bloodshed and a lot of laughs this really is a must see.Timothy Dalton is fantastic as the loathsome retail magnate and the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British comedy... anyone remotely funny at the moment is in this movie.A must see!!",8,2,4,1 March 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Cant help but compare it to the book
","If you are going to base films on books you have to be prepared for comparisons!!! Phoenix is my favourite of the Harry Potter books books but I must admit that this movie is my least favourite.If you are able to judge it as a stand alone film then its not bad but too much was missed out to make it a convincing adaptation of the 5th novel.Put it this way it was the first movie of the summer that I couldn't wait for it to end.There are good performances from the usual cast and the characters of umbridge and bellatrix were perfectly cast, dan radcliffe is getting better with age and will probably go on to be a huge star once the potter films are finished.Oh well will have to wait and see what they do with half blood prince which is more complex than this one.",6,2,3,23 July 2007
