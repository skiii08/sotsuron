Blade Runner 2049," 15 min show stretched to 166
","God it's bad, I kept looking for the fast forward button. This show couldn't get worse unless you just took a bunch of stills and looked at each for 5 min. Even the ending is slowed to a crawl, or was it my skin that crawled. A very hard to understand storyline, but the fact that it stretched scenes so you had to watch, with painful background music, with no action or dialogue was awful!!",1,28,57,28 October 2017
