Source Code," Hollywood messes up a brilliant movie... AGAIN!!
","You probably know what this movie is about by now, but it's pretty simple premise. A soldier from Afghanistan (Captain Stevens) has his consciousness put into a normal school teacher riding the commute to Chicago on a train. It is his mission to find out who and where the bomber is that blew up the train. The bomber is planning to use another, more powerful, dirty bomb (a bomb loaded with radioactive material) inside Chicago. All they want to do is capture this assailant before the second bomb detonates.According to the science, it is impossible to stop the first bomb from happening (at least in that universe). Yeah, string theory anyone? While the geniuses in the world will have a field day with alternate realities, as far as the movie is concerned, it works good enough for the normal movie goer.I'll accept all that, and the inconsistencies, as the movie was excellently shot, very enjoyable (up to a point), and acted quite well. I would recommend seeing this movie for any thriller/disaster types. The characters are well done, and things move at a perfect pace.Here's where everything went wrong... the ending. Horrible Hollywood ending that makes absolutely no sense at all. If they would have ended the movie at the time stop, when she pulled the plug, it would have been much better. Instead, there is 5 minutes of complete drivel at the end.My advice when watching this movie? Enjoy it, watch it, and then when the time stop happens near the end, leave. The last 5 minutes isn't even worth it. Again, Hollywood decimates another wonderfully done, and very enjoyable experience.",7,1,3,2 April 2011
