The Lobster," The absurdity of modern relationships.
","4 / 5 - I enjoyed this film more than I was expecting to enjoy it. I think the first half of the film is way better than the second one, that drags for too long a little bit. The film is a great example of absurd storytelling to magnify little aspects of our lives. It is through the lens of the absurdity that we will exam relationship in our modern society. In this dystopian near future all single people are forced to go through a 45 day process to find a romantic partner or they will be transformed into beasts and sent off into the woods. It is quite a simple premise and through this we are forced to reflect how we see relationships and our own image projected to society. In the movie, characters are described through one single feature, and they need to find a match on this singularity on another person in order to form a couple. It is interesting how this, which should simplify everything, actually make things even trickier. And how much absurd is this when we also dictate specific features that we look on other people and if someone is far off our standards we usually won't relate to the person at all?The film itself is good, great shots, photography, acting, soundtrack (including a Nick Cave mention).

The Lost City of Z," Average Hollywood (Play Safe) Film.
","3 / 5 - While the story the originated the film is remarkable and worth knowing, the movie and script are too obvious and do not explore the real complexity of a character such as the British explorer Percy Fawcett.I personally see two ways of dealing with jungle exploration films. You can follow the classic adventure style, think of Indiana Jones, or you can do something more serious like Aguirre and Embrace of the Serpent. I do not know if we had a clear direction in this film. It tries to verge into a more serious and tense moments to suddenly goes all Hollywood action packed.The acting is quite below average and even the script is just OK. Nevertheless, the film is still watchable and you do get some nice images from Amazon forest.",6,2,4,26 March 2017
