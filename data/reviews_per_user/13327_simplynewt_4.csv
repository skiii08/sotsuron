The Avengers," Simply Awesome
","This was another one of my most favorite flicks of all time. A movie that kept me on the edge of my seat and finding it hard to hit the pause button to go do what comes needed after several cold refreshments.I appreciate the serious side of the movie with the battle scenes but for me, what was more enjoyable was the comedic parts that kept me interested and laughing at just the right times.The special effects and sound score was something worth mentioning and I would suggest turning the lights down low and cranking up the surround sound whilst watching this epic tale pulled straight from the comic books of Marvel.",10,1,4,13 September 2013
The Expendables 2," Old Dogs Don't Die
","I seen this movie for a second time not remembering that we had viewed this flick a couple months earlier. It only took a couple of minutes of the opening scene for me to recall that I have seen this one before.Not surprised by my memory lapse, I went on to watch this flick once again and I think it was better seeing it the 2nd time. There was a lot of action right from the beginning and ebbed and flowed throughout the entire flick.A decent plot kept me interested and seeing all those old timers acting in this was a treat in itself. The cast, in my opinion is what makes this series special. There were a few good chuckles as the flick went on as well which was a real treat away from all the action.",8,1,2,21 September 2013
Evil Dead," Gore Fest
","I am not one who gets a movie for the gore effect but the trailers for this flick seemed to interest me and I wanted to check it out. I was informed by my wife that this was an old movie and it was recently remade so I was even more interested in watching this flick.After getting into it, I found that there was an extreme amount of gore in it. We had the lights down low and the surround sound cranked up. Probably not the best thing to do if you have an uneasy stomach or suffer from bad dreams.I gave it an 8 out of 10 because there were some spots in the flick that became predictable. Then there were scenes that just blew me away, hence the 8 and not a 5 or 6.",8,2,7,13 September 2013
Black Hawk Down," My Favorite Flick
","This is my All Time Most Favorite Flick. It reaches the far depths of my imagination on what it was like for our brave soldiers to battle against a drug induced enemy who will stop at nothing to rule their world. I paid attention to this conflict until I watched the movie and then it seems I could not get enough information about it. I purchased the box set and now have two versions of the movie, several key interviews with actual soldiers who participated in this battle and a couple documentary's that were made depicting what actually took place during this event in time. My hots off to the brave soldiers who were there.",10,1,2,13 September 2013
