Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock: Scintillating Sequel
","Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law â€“ They just seem to go well together like Ben & Jerry, like peanut butter and jelly, like . . . . . Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively.Once again, we find the two friends, Holmes and Watson, attempting to outwit Sherlock's archenemy, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). During John Watson's bachelor party, Holmes saves the life of Moriarty's intended victim, a fortune-telling gypsy, Madame Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace). She joins forces with Holmes, his brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry), and Watson in their wild escapades across Europe, as they pursue Moriarty.(Seeing Rapace in this role, it was hard to remember that she was Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 Swedish film trilogy, starting with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.') This is director Guy Ritchie's second Sherlock adventure. Despite the violence, I liked the sequel more than his original 2009 'Sherlock Holmes.' Special effects, in this 2011 comedic action/adventure, were spectacular. The starring pair of unintentional buffoons made me laugh. Plot development was a bit SLOW here and there, but the well-timed antics and wisecracks were STEADY.In a convoluted and unrelated way, I agree with Sherlock's line: 'Slow and steady wins the race.'",Null,0,0,30 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Supremely Suspenseful
","'M:I- Ghost Protocol' is edge-of-your-seat gripping. The Impossible Missions Force is connected to a bombing at the Kremlin. Therefore, in an attempt to clear its name, it must operate without government help. As in real life, not everything goes according to plan. How the characters improvised in unexpected situations greatly added to the suspense.The following comments focus more on the actors rather than the storyline or plot. Tom Cruise still shows amazing agility as he scales the world's tallest building without the use of a stunt double. Although he is -finally- losing his boyish features, he is quite appealing in a more mature way. Tom still exudes charm, as does 'Lost' alumnus, handsome Josh Holloway. As for Michael Nyqvist: his character (Kurt Hendricks) was interesting but lacked depth if compared to his Blomkvist character in the 2009 Swedish film trilogy (e.g. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'). It was great to see Anil Kapoor in a playful role as the rich, womanizing tycoon. (He was outstanding as the serious President Hassan in the TV series, '24.') Simon Pegg, as Benji Dunn, gave a seriocomic performance that was scene-stealing, refreshing and relieving in tense situations.I was easily able to overlook the many 'goofs' in this movie to enjoy it as a supremely suspenseful, full-throttle thriller.",Null,3,6,30 January 2012
