Blade Runner 2049," Don't waste your money on it
","This is a total waste of money and time. 1st: the story line is screwed, but u may argue against it and i might understand. 2nd: it soooooooooooooooooooooo unnecessarily long. i mean its an 'intersteller' long but with a material of a quick 30 mins TV sketch. Really unnecessarily. 3rd: Graphics (and MAYBE sound) can be rated as 'good', and that's why it got 1/10. 4th: Big names are promised to be in action in the movie, but at the end of the day it is more like just one man show. In summary, its a terrible movie. You wanna want to watch it later when its on a streaming service somewhere. I still Have no idea y its t so much high rating. i would understand if this movie got a 5/10. as a person who watches a movie after checking the ratings, i was totallllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy disappointed.",1,7,16,29 October 2017
