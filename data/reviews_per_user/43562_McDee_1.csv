The Blair Witch Project," Annoying as Hell!
","Whoever summarized this flick as 'Scary as Hell' (a Rolling Stone critic?) must have a very low opinion of Hell.  I got sucked into the hype, and when the movie (thankfully) ended, I felt like I had been had.  Now I'm doing what I wish someone had done for me: letting you know that this movie is not worth the ticket price.  I'm all for the triumph of indies over big budget Hollywood fare, but I am frankly bewildered at how this shaggy-dog story has carried the torch as far as it has.  Surely, there are more deserving films than this to spring forth from the festival circuit and take the B.O. by storm.  How did Artisan pull this off?",3,0,1,9 August 1999
