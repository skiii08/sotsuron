Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Unbelievable
","The scenery and costumes are great. The acting and story is a mix of boring and irritating, particularly the Gungan (JJB) characters and droids. It's bizarre how the characters often spoke without much emotion or energy. Really pale in comparison to the original trilogy which is gripping and exciting .",4,0,3,15 September 2018
The Favourite," Great, Interesting, Dark and Disturbing
",The visuals and acting are brilliant. It leaves you wondering about British history. There are some funny scenes which is brill. Great cinematography and sound. The story is interesting but it's very dark for most of the film. It may leave you feeling quite disturbed depending on your mood at the time.,7,4,9,26 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Really puzzling
","The visuals were great, the music was great and there was some good humour.
I like a lot of the previous marvel films. In this movie, I was confused in almost every scene. I felt that the characters' capabilities seemed different from what I saw in earlier movies and, a lot of the time, their actions/choices were bizarre and unfounded. I was often thinking 'Why did...?' 'and How on earth did...?' 'Whaaat?'
Having so much of this confusion in the fast-paced, action-packed movie ruined it for me :( I wish it happened otherwise...",4,6,15,1 May 2018
