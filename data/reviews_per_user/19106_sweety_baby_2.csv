The Sound of Music," I love this film
",The sound of music is a very special film because it tells the true story how it was in a more family loving way. i am only 14 but this film is my favourite film ever. it is also my mum's and most of my families favourite film but they know that i am a really really big fan of this film and Julie Andrews. since i was little i watched Julie Andrews films mainly sound of music and Mary Poppins though. she does a wonderful performance with the help of Christopher Plummer and the children. Without anyone of the characters in this film it would not be complete. THE SOUND OF MUSIC REALLY DOES REMAIN THE HAPPIEST SOUND IN THE WORLD!,10,2,8,31 October 2005
Titanic," It is one of the best films ever
",I absolutely love this film to bits. i think it is the most real and touching movie of all time no wonder it won 11 academy awards. great story line and great choose of actors for this movie. i could watch this film over and over again because i know i would never ever be bored of this film and if some of you who think this film is boring then your'e mad and need to actually watch the film properly . if you watch the film properly then you will see how touching and emotional but real this film can be as it was based on a true story.so if any of you out there who don't find this film fascinating then i would consider you as disrespectful to all those people who lost their lives that morning on the real R.M.S Titanic.,10,3,6,28 November 2005
