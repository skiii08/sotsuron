Skyfall," The worst bond movie ever
","I believed in the hype and those 'professional' critics and went to watch this movie and now completely regret it. What a waste of time and money!The plot is so stupid that I thought it must be a joke, it is worse than a steve siegel movie.I swear I will never believe any critics from now on, they must have all been bought by Hollywood. I can't believe even NPR was touting about it.compared to this, Quantum Of Solace can almost be called good.1) What happened to the agent's list? 2) The villain Silva was interesting in the beginning, then suddenly became an idiot. 3) the bond girls suck big time! 4) the siege at the end is worse than 'home alone'!!",2,50,96,11 November 2012
