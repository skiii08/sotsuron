Vertigo," Hitchcock's lost masterpiece
","This movie is really great!  At the time of it's release, it was considered a disappointment, but now it's considered one of Hitchcock's finest.  I also think it's one of Jimmy Stewart's best performance, and is acting is incredible, especially at the end in the tower.  He starts shaking Madeline (Kim Novak) because he's so angry.  I think that part is very unlike Stewart, who usually played the nice guy who never lost his temper.  I also think the performance by Kim Novak is brilliant.  She was known as more of a sexy leading lady without really dramatic parts.  But in this, she really shows her ability to use her beauty to fool a man, and drive him to near insanity.'Vertigo' is a wonderful movie, with a beautiful score.  Any Alfred Hitchcock fan really needs to see this, which many consider today to be his 'lost masterpiece'.",Null,3,3,31 January 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great!
","Although I've seen 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' several times, my boyfriend made me gain a new enthusiasm for it. It's really a fantastic movie that has to be seen by everyone. And it's the kind of movie that you appreciate more every time you see it. I think it's one of Steven Spielberg's greatest movies, and one of Harrison Ford's most memorable roles. I definitely recommend this movie, so go out and see it if you never have, and watch it again if you have.",1,2,68,27 February 2002
Casablanca," 'The' Romance of the century
","This is the greatest movie!  Everyone always remembers the final airport seen ('Here's looking at you, kid.'), but there's a great movie before the end!  It's full of wonderful dialogue, great actors, and an outstanding plot.  It's become a legendary classic.  'As Time Goes By', 'Casablanca' never loses its charm!",10,1,1,21 June 1999
Chinatown," My favorite Nicholson movie
","This movie is really great!  Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are great as the main characters, Jake Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray.  And John Huston gives a frighteningly good performance as incestuous Noah Cross.  'Chinatown' is a great film-noir with the classy yet sleazy setting of the 1930's.  If you're a fan of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, or John Huston, you really should see 'Chinatown'.  You should also see it if you're just in the mood for an incredible movie!Rating: 9 out of 10!",Null,0,2,31 January 2000
Se7en," This is great!
","'Se7en' is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It has great actors, especially Morgan Freeman, who's wonderful.  But I think the man that steals the show is Kevin Spacey as Jon Doe.  He's absolutely Oscar worthy in this challenging, complex role.  He's magnificent.Therefore, 'Se7en' gets a 10!~",10,0,0,16 June 1999
As Good as It Gets," Funny, witty, and overall enjoyable!
","I can't say enough about this movie, which is one of the best from the 90's. Jack Nicholson is absolutely hilarious as the cranky obsessive-compulsive Melvin.  Helen Hunt proves that she can be a fantastic movie actress, as well as a TV star.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is fantastic as usual.  And can anyone honestly say that they didn't adore that dog??  'As Good As It Gets' is a sophisticated comedy-drama that will win over everyone.  It's truly one of my favorite movies, and I strongly recommend it.",Null,0,0,30 September 2001
Citizen Kane," Simply the best!
","'Citizen Kane' is quite possibly the best film ever made.  It was a masterpiece of it's time and still is today!  It's uniqueness and creativity is something film makers have been wanting to accomplish since it's release. Orson Welles, dubbed the 'Boy Genius' really proves his talents in this. He's incredible as the part of Charles Foster Kane...a power-hungry leader. It also features magnificent performances by the Mercury Theater players. Even though 'Kane' was made 58 years ago, it's still as brilliant as it was the first day.",10,1,2,17 May 1999
12 Angry Men," One of the best movies ever made!
","This is one of my favorite movies.  Henry Fonda once again proves that he's a fantastic actor with his brilliant performance.  There are also great performances by notable actors such as Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Klugman, and John Fiedler. '12 Angry Men' proves that you don't need a fantastic scope to have a great movie: all but a few minutes of this takes place in a jury room, plus it's in black and white.  All you need to create a classic is great actors, and a magnificent script.  '12 Angry Men' has both of these, so I strongly recommend it!  It's a must see.",10,0,1,24 September 2000
L.A. Confidential," Fantastic film-noir
","Although most of the greatest film-noir movies were made in the 1930's, 40's, and 50's, 'L.A. Confidential' breaks that tradition.  Kevin Spacey is his usual fabulous self as Jack Vincennes, a cynical cop, and Russell Crowe ('The Insider', 'Gladiator') is also riveting as Bud White.  And Kim Basinger is great in her Academy Award winning role of Lynn Bracken.  I think it's her greatest achievement.Winner of two Oscars, 'L.A. Confidential' is a cinematic masterpiece, and should be seen by any movie buff.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",8,0,0,17 May 2000
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A brilliant biography!
","This is a wonderful movie!  I think Paul Newman and Robert Redford are both outstanding as Butch and Sundance.  The movie takes two outlaws and turns them into sympathetic characters, particularly at the end when they lay there, mortally wounded.  My favorite part is the knife fight, where Butch throws Harvey off by talking about rules.  Then...whack!!  1, 2, 3, GO!!!!!!",Null,0,4,1 January 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Stanley Kubrick's finest
","This movie is pretty cool.  I love the names of the men...they're so funny! My favorites are Major T. J. 'King' Kong, General Jack D. Ripper, President Merkin Muffley, and, of course, Dr. Strangelove.  Peter Sellers is amazing at portraying three different characters.  I also think that George C. Scott is really, really good as General 'Buck' Turgidson.  He says one of my favorite lines in the movie: 'Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops...depending on the breaks.'This is certainly an interesting and very different movie, as are all of Kubrick's movies.  Some parts can be a little boring, but the end with Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones is really full of suspense.  So, I give 'Dr. Strangelove' a 9 out of 10.",8,1,3,1 October 1999
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of the best WWII movies
","The reason 'The Best Years of Our Lives' is so great is because unlike so many World War II films, it doesn't show what happens before or during the war.  It shows the aftermath of the war, which was the most dramatic.  For instance, Al Stephenson (Fredric March) doesn't want to return to his position at the bank.  He also drinks heavily.  And Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) tries to adjust to his life after losing both arms at the elbows. He doesn't want anyone to pity him, and he doesn't trust the love of his before war sweetheart Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).  Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), married a flashy girl (Virginia Mayo) he barely knew while he was in the war.  She was just impressed with his uniform, and wants him to wear it even after he's discharged.  So Fred turns to the comfort of another girl (Teresa Wright).This movie tells the story of three men (Homer, Al, and Fred), who meet on a plane going home, and who try to adjust to post-war life.  It's sweet and very moving.  Although all the actors are brilliant, I think the best are Myrna Loy, who plays Al's wife, Millie, and Oscar winners March and Russell. I think Russell is especially good, because he wasn't a 'real' actor.  He was a guy who lost his arms in the war, and he literally plays himself in this.  If I didn't know that he wasn't an actor beforehand, I wouldn't have been able to tell.  He shows the talent of March and Andrews, and of some of the best actors ever in cinema. 'The Best Years of Our Lives' is so unique and wonderful, that everyone really must see it!  I give it a 10 out of 10.",Null,2,3,18 April 2000
The Grapes of Wrath," John Ford's Classic
","This is a good movie.  Although I find it really depressing, the actors make up for it.  Henry Fonda is incredible as Tom...he breaks my heart with his soft speech and gentle looks.Like I said, the movie is very, very depressing, but you really should see it.  It's a classic, and you shouldn't miss Henry Fonda's greatest acting, which makes my vote a 10!",9,3,6,12 July 1999
Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar!
","I really enjoyed this movie.  It made me laugh and cry, but it also made me think.  Forrest might have a low IQ, but yet, he smarter than most people I know.  He knows it's not right for Jenny's boyfriend to hit her.  He's also very loyal.  Even though Lieutenant Dan gives Forrest a hard time, Forrest always stays his friend.  He also keeps his promise to Bubba, by starting the shrimp business.  Finally, he's always loyal to Jenny, the love of his life.  She changes with the times, but Forrest always waits for her.  Also, when Forrest goes to visit her grave, he leaves the note that young Forrest wrote to her.  He told his dad not to open it, so he didn't.  That too shows that Forrest keeps his promises.Just when I thought that Tom Hanks's performance in 'Philadelphia' was his best, he comes out with Forrest Gump.  He is one of the best actors today, if not the best.  'Forrest Gump' is a movie you'll want to see again and again...it's a masterpiece!",Null,0,2,9 January 2000
The Godfather: Part II," Because the original just wasn't good enough
","'The Godfather: Part II' is one of the best sequels ever made, because it's so unlike other sequels.  It not only tells the ongoing story of Michael Corleone, but it also tells the story of his father's rise to being the Godfather.  Al Pacino superbly reprises his role of Michael, and Robert De Niro is, in one word, perfect as Vito Corleone.  Imagine not only learning your lines, but learning them in Italian, and all the while trying to sound like Marlon Brando.  If you can't imagine any one else besides Brando as Don Vito, just check out De Niro's brilliant, Oscar-winning performance.  This is a must-see for any film fan, and especially any fan of the first 'Godfather.'  I actually know people who prefer this sequel to the already fantastic original.  I can't say enough about this movie.  My one piece of advice is see 'The Godfather: Part II.'",Null,1,1,3 October 2001
North by Northwest," Suspenseful masterpiece!
","I think 'North by Northwest' is great!  Cary Grant is his charming self as Roger Thornhill, and Eva Marie Saint is delightful as Eve Kendell.  I also think James Mason gives an excellent performance as bad guy Vandamm. 
My favorite part is the auction scene.  Roger knows that Vandamm's men are surrounding the place, and that he would never get out alive.  So the only way to escape is to create a disturbance, and be escorted out by the police. This is exactly what he does, and it's hilarious!Although everyone has seen the famous and climactic chase scene across Mount Rushmore, there is a great movie before and after that.  I think that this movie contains one of Hitchcock's best 'Mac Guffins', which is an extremely slight reference to what makes the enemy so bad.  As the Professor says, Vandamm exploits 'government secrets'.  Hitchcock always said that this wasn't important to the plot, because we only need to know that Vandamm is after Roger.  I definitely recommend 'North by Northwest' to any Hitchcock or Cary Grant fan, or someone who just wants to see an outstanding movie!",10,1,1,25 February 2000
Doctor Zhivago," Another David Lean classic
","What more can I possibly say about 'Doctor Zhivago' that hasn't already been said?  It's full of great performances, especially by Rod Steiger, one of the most versatile actors ever.  And the lush musical score adds to the romantic yet tragic story.  Even if this movie doesn't seem like it will appeal to you, it's one of those that needs to be seen.  Plus, it's got something for everyone to enjoy.  I strongly recommend this as another David Lean masterpiece.",7,0,5,7 November 2001
American Beauty," My favorite actor's Oscar winner
","Kevin Spacey is definitely the best actor today, and he's magnificent as Lester Burnham.  Although he looks very strange to us, sometimes when a person goes through a mid-life crisis, they can do some very peculiar things.  'American Beauty' also shows us what can happen behind closed doors.  Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) looks like the perfect modern woman: career oriented, a good mother, and of course, an expert gardener. But behind that, there lies a neurotic, self-absorbed woman who is never satisfied with life.  'American Beauty' is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Although everyone is superb, I think Wes Bentley turns in a magnificent performance.  The part with the plastic bag shows deep and true emotions and feelings, and incredible acting skills.  So I recommend 'American Beauty' to anyone, not only because of its 5 Oscar wins, but because it truly was the best picture of 1999.",9,0,0,15 May 2000
The Usual Suspects," Kevin Spacey is magnificent!
","This is a great movie that echos the classics from Hollywood's Golden Era. Kevin Spacey is great in his Oscar winning role.  And even though his part was technically considered a supporting role, he really steals the movie and makes it truly memorable.  I highly recommend 'The Usual Suspects' to any movie fan!",Null,0,1,31 January 2002
Gone with the Wind," A masterpiece
","What else can you say about 'Gone With the Wind'?  It's a perfect movie!  It has brilliant actors, a fantastic score, and beautiful scenery.  It also includes a history lesson!  It's one of my favorite movies, and the American Film Institute ranked it number 4 on their list of the century's top 100 movies.  If you don't agree with my comments, see it again (maybe for the first time!)  I assure you, you won't be disappointed!!",10,0,0,23 December 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," A classic
","'Lawrence of Arabia' was recommended to me by a friend.  I didn't think I would like it, because there isn't a woman playing one of the main characters.  But I was wrong!  'Lawrence' was incredible!  There are excellent performances by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and many, many more!  I also love Claude Rains in one of his later roles as Dryden.This movie is a classic, and as far as dealing with World War I, it's as great as 'All Quiet on the Western Front'.  Both movies give an idea of what the war was like from a non-American point of view.  'Lawrence of Arabia' is a great movie, and everyone should see it.",6,4,13,14 August 1999
The Graduate," Great!!
","I like this movie.  It shows how Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) struggles with his life and what exactly he wants to do with it.  And I don't think the Mrs. Robinson thing helps him any!!  An affair with a woman old enough to be your mother never does help a situation, I gather!  If the story doesn't sound juicy enough for you, at least watch it to see what all the fuss is about, with all the imitations everyone has seen!  =)  It really is an awesome film though.  Definitely see 'The Graduate' at least once this year. Let it be your New Year's Resolution!",6,1,4,1 January 2000
Singin' in the Rain," Fantastic!!!~
","I have adored this movie for years!  The singing and dancing are fabulous, and the story is witty and highly entertaining.  Although there are magnificent performances by Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen, I think it's Donald O'Connor who steals the show.  His dancing is magnificent. When you watch the 'Moses Supposes' number, it looks like he is just as good a dancer as Gene Kelly, who was considered one of the best.  And no one can deny that 'Make Them Laugh' is hysterically funny and shows great talent.Nominated for two Oscars, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a wonderful musical comedy with romance and unbeatable performances.  I highly recommend it to anyone, and give it a rating of 10 out of 10!",10,2,6,24 June 2000
Life Is Beautiful," 'Life is Beautiful'
","This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in years.  What I think is so spectacular is that it doesn't try to be perfect, with fancy locations and extravagant costumes.  It gets right down to what a movie should be, which is an incredibly acted and heart-warming story. 
I hadn't seen this movie when Roberto Benigni won the Oscar for Best Actor. In fact, I thought he was just an enthusiastic guy, and really nothing more. But when I saw 'Life is Beautiful' a few months after the Academy Awards, I realized that Roberto Benigni was truly a talented actor...one of the best today!  'La Vita è bella' or 'Life is Beautiful' is a wonderful story that is romantic and touching.  It also shows the horrors of concentration camps. So I give it a 10 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone!",9,1,3,28 February 2000
The Untouchables," A great crime-drama
","This is definitely Brian De Palma's best film, and an ultimate crime movie. Sean Connery shines in his Oscar-winning performance, and this could also be Kevin Costner's best performance.  This is definitely a must-see movie that I strongly recommend!",Null,12,22,22 February 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," A Holiday Classic!!~
","This is one of my favorite movies of all times.  I love James Stewart in the part of George Bailey.  I especially love the part where he's praying at the bar...that always makes me cry!!~I also love Henry Travers as Clarence the angel.  He's so funny and so sweet...I wish I had a guardian angel like Clarence!  Everyone, of course, loves the end when the townspeople contribute the money to George and Mary.  And I just love Harry's toast:'To my big brother George, the richest man in town!''It's a Wonderful Life' has become a Christmas tradition in my house, but it's great to watch any day of the year.  I give this movie a 10!",10,1,4,16 August 1999
Psycho," Hitchcock's best!~
","This is the greatest horror movie I've ever seen!  It's fabulously suspenseful and eerie. . . altogether wonderful!  The actors are incredible, especially Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates.  If you've never seen this movie, it's the kind that you must see at least 100 times in your life! =) So, I give 'Psycho' a 10/10!!~",10,5,9,30 May 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," A modern classic
","I absolutely love this movie!  It has everything a great movie should have: a clever, witty, romantic, touching, and absolutely hilarious script, and fantastic performances.  Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan make the perfect couple, because they start off as friends but end up in love.  Another reason why this movie is so great is because it appeals to both women and men. Everyone should see 'When Harry Met Sally' because it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen.",Null,1,3,21 October 2001
All Quiet on the Western Front," A different kind of WWI movie...
","'All Quiet on the Western Front' is different from most movies about World War I, because it tells the story through the Germans' point of view.  Lew Ayres is heart-breaking as Paul Baumer.  My favorite part is when he returns to his school while he's on his leave.  He tells the young boys what war is really like.  'When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!' he says in disgust.  But the boys only argue with him, and call him a coward.Another moving part is when Paul is stuck for hours with a man he has stabbed.  Paul is guilt-stricken, and promises to write to the man's family. He is so overwhelmed by the fact that he killed someone.With all his friends dead, Paul feels lonely and hopeless.  But then he spots the first beautiful he has seen in a long time: a butterfly.  He comes up over the trench to reach for it, but one of his enemies sees Paul and kills him.  It's so sad, because Paul was reaching for something alive and beautiful...almost like hope.'All Quiet on the Western Front' is a movie everyone needs to see because of its powerful message.  It shows the viewer the true horrors of war, which most people never even think about.  Most people, like most of the boys in this movie, only think of being heroes, and dying like men for their country.  But there's more to war than just that.",10,4,6,28 August 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," Gregory Peck, Oscar winner: Need I say more?
","Actually, I do!  This movie is amazing!  It not only features Gregory Peck in an excellent Oscar winning role, it also features other great actors and actresses.  Gregory fits the image I had of Atticus Finch while reading the book.  If you've never seen 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'it's a sin'!  This great movie gets a 10 out of 10 every time.  It's a classic.",10,1,3,28 June 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A depressing yet fantastic movie
","Jack Nicholson gives an Academy Award winning performance as a cynic who decides to go into a mental institution as opposed to going to prison.  I don't want to give away all the details, but as you would assume, the stay in the mental institution changes Nicholson.  Look for excellent performances by some classic TV stars, as well as an Oscar winning performance by Louise Fletcher, who plays the infamous nurse. 
Although this movie can be very depressing, it has funny moments, and is definitely a movie that is worth seeing.  I strongly recommend 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'",Null,0,2,30 September 2001
Jaws," Fantastic!
","This movie is absolutely great!  I just watched it again recently, after I hadn't seen it in several years.  And it does get better every time you see it.  The three lead actors are brilliant in their roles.  Their interactions with one another makes 'Jaws' more than just a story about a shark.  The way each man is a foil to the other two makes for a very interesting story, and it's great to see how they all feel about each other at the end, after their incredible adventure.  'Jaws' is a classic movie that has to be seen by everyone at least once. And trust me, it gets better each time you see it.  I give this movie a 10 out of 10!",9,0,1,27 January 2002
Stalag 17," See this movie!!!!
","I mean it!  Everyone has to see 'Stalag 17' at least once in their life. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The acting is perfect, especially by William Holden, who won an Oscar for his portrayal as Sefton. Sefton is the perfect 'non-hero'.  This is thoroughly entertaining, with comedy, drama, and edge of your seat suspense.  I definitely recommend it!Rating: a 10 out of 10!!!",10,7,12,24 March 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Perhaps the best prison story ever
","Tim Robbins gives the performance of a lifetime as Andy, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife and her lover.  He is an unconventional prisoner who forms a friendship with Red, played brilliantly by one of the greatest actors of his generation, Morgan Freeman.To give away any more of the story is a crime, because this is an incredible movie that needs to be seen by everyone.  I give 'The Shawshank Redemption' a 10 out of 10.",8,0,0,28 January 2002
Ben-Hur," One of the best!
","This film is fantastic!!  It's tied with 'Titanic' for the most number of Oscars won, so you know how good it must be.  Charlton Heston, who is one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, is magnificent in this, his Oscar-winning role of Judah Ben-Hur.  While everyone is familiar with the famous chariot race scene, my favorite scene is when Judah Ben-Hur is offered some water by a mysterious man, who happens to be Jesus.  His kindness renews hope for Ben-Hur, who was totally despondent.  I adore that part.I definitely recommend this movie.  I think it's one of the greatest movies ever made.  Everyone needs to see this fantastic cinematic wonder.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,27 November 2000
The Producers," I laughed so hard it hurt!
","I cannot even begin to tell you how incredibly funny this movie is.  But if you know Mel Brooks's work, you can probably guess!  Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are absolutely brilliant together...I think they make one of the most memorable on-screen duos in the history of movies.  So instead of telling you the plot, I'm just going to say rent this movie!  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,30 September 2001
Rear Window," One of my favorite Hitchcock movies
","I adore this movie!  James Stewart and Grace Kelly are great as the main characters, Jeff and Lisa.  There are also fantastic performances by the supporting cast: Thelma Ritter as Stella, Wendell Corey as detective and friend of Jeff Tom Doyle, and Raymond Burr as the bad guy Lars Thorwald.My favorite part is the whole sequence when Jeff, Lisa, and Stella try to get Thorwald.  It begins with Lisa entering Thorwald's apartment, and reaches a climax when Thorwald gets home and discovers her.  He wrestles with her and Jeff gets panicky, but luckily he had called the police and they arrived before Thorwald could hurt Lisa.  The truly frightening part is when Lisa is wiggling her finger back and forth so Jeff could see Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.  Thorwald sees what she's doing, and looks up into Jeff's apartment, and right into the camera.The really climatic part comes when Jeff answers his phone, thinking that the caller is Doyle.  He blurts out a lot of information about Thorwald, but then stops suddenly.  He realizes that the person on the other end hasn't said anything, and then the person hangs up.  The look on Jeff's face says it all: he knows Thorwald is coming to kill him.  And since he's in a wheelchair, and now the only one in the apartment, there's nothing that can be done.  He can't even get up and lock the door.  'Rear Window' combines suspense with romance and comedy.  It's truly one entertaining movie!  Anyone who is a Hitchcock fan should see this movie.  I gave 'Rear Window' a 10 out of 10.",10,2,5,29 January 2000
Saboteur," Fantastic!
","I really loved seeing this movie.  I think it's a brilliant, underrated Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Everyone is familiar with the famous Statue of Liberty scene, but there's a really great movie before that.  Robert Cummings is great in what I consider to be his greatest role, and the beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she has a lot of talent too.  But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance.  His character, Fry, is so evil and devious.  Even though he's not in it for very long, the movie wouldn't be the same without him.'Saboteur' is a great movie that every Hitchcock fan should see.  I give it a 10 out of 10!!",10,2,3,25 July 2000
Goodfellas," 'Murderers come with smiles...'
","I think this is a great movie.  Based on a true story, it shows how friends go from pulling petty crimes to committing bloody murders.  Rat Liotta is wonderful as Henry Hill, the small time gangster who eventually gets caught up in the serious and deadly mob life.  Robert De Niro is brilliant, as always, as Jimmy Conway.  And Joe Pesci is great (even if he's a little vulgar) as Tommy De Vito, his Oscar winning role.  The saddest part is when Tommy is really excited about getting in to the exclusive, 100% Italian mafia, and then ends up getting killed.  I really feel Jimmy's pain when he mourns the loss of his friend.  Even though they're really bad people, they still have feelings for their friends. Martin Scorsese does a great job directing this mafia masterpiece.  I definitely think that 'GoodFellas' is a movie that everyone should see, because in the end, Henry does what's right.  So I give 'GoodFellas' a 9 out of 10!",9,0,0,1 October 1999
The Wizard of Oz," A classic!
","'The Wizard of Oz' is great!!  My favorite thing about it is the color change from Kansas to Oz.  I also love the Scarecrow and the Tinman. Maybe I was the only one who noticed, but I always thought the Scarecrow had a crush on Dorothy!!  I also love the little guy who follows Dorothy into Oz from her home: Toto!!'The Wizard of Oz' is such a classic, it has become a part of American culture!  So if you've never seen this movie, you really have to!  It's a definite 'must see!'",1,15,103,1 January 2000
From Here to Eternity," One of the classic war movies.
","This movie is fabulous!  The acting is out of this world, especially by Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift.  But not to leave out the wonderful actresses like Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr.  And you cannot forget Frank Sinatra in his Oscar-winning role of Maggio.  He really IS Maggio!  He has to be if I approve of him winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar instead of Eddie Albert for 'Roman Holiday'!!This has become one of the most famous World War II movies, and everyone has seen the famous beach scene!!!  If you've missed 'From Here to Eternity', you have to see it at least once in your lifetime.  It's a masterpiece!Rating: 10 out of 10",10,0,0,26 July 1999
The Godfather," Fantastic!!
","'The Godfather' has become a classic in the 28 years since its release. It's definitely a great movie, that hasn't lost any of it's brilliance.  The problems of Don Vito's life are still strong today, especially the issue of drugs.  Marlon Brando gives an Oscar-winning performance as the patriarch of a Mafia family, Don Vito Corleone.  There are also incredible performances by Al Pacino and James Caan, who play Corleone's two sons, Michael and Sonny. Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), 'The Godfather' has become a staple in my house.  I think it's a movie that everyone should see, and I think many people will agree. Therefore, I give this flawless work a 10.",8,1,3,28 February 2000
