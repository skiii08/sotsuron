Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Urrgh! someone kick George Lucas!!
","oh no! i watched this movie in a star wars video session at home, immediately after watching the first (or the last, whatever) movies. i goddamn nearly puked (pardon the language, but it was 6 o'clock in the morning, and my defenses were pretty low). i found the dark saga of force and temptation, of bad against evil, torn apart to do something like...this. some kind of...disneyan thing with no plot at all, nearly no credibility in character (what?? that little runt is gonna be the meanest man of the universe?? COME ON!), and lets not mention that really annoying ugly fella (i deliberatly forgot his name) who was there SO obviously to please the little 'uns...that's why the only person i know who liked the movie is my cousin of eleven years. less box office thinking, mr. lucas, you already have enough money.(but i really fear that the other ones are not going to be better).",2,5,10,1 April 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," don't watch it after reading the book!!
","i'm sorry that i can't give you a..waddyacallit...unspoiled(dunno if that's right, you get the picture), perhaps i would have cried because the movie is so wonderful, if i hadn't read the (incredibly wonderful) book shortly before. this way, i cried because it was such a wicked attempt at unravelling the wonderful book. the book gives you an innocent view on a small southern city, from a childish perspective(scout's). the movie shows a small southern town, it shows scout, and all the stuff, but it somehow fails to deliver all the rest. the feelings i got reading the book(twice in 3 weeks, dammit!) didn't connect. watch something else. (perhaps, if i was a girl it could have saved me the experience, i watched it with some girls-they had read the book, too- and they loved it because they were infatuated by gregory peck)",2,5,25,31 March 2002
