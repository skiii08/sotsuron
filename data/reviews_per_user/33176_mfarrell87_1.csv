Come and See," None
","'Come and See' was a very difficult movie for me to watch. Some of Klimov's scenes were so realistic they were frightening and made my stomach turn over and over again. The movie expressed how impersonal the warfare was during WWII. The scenes that stood out for me the most were 1) the burning of the people in the barn, 2) the bodies that were stacked against the house, 3) when Florya shoots the picture of Hitler.The first two scenes that I mentioned are difficult to watch because they are so monstrous. Klimov demonstrates a very tasteful measure of restraint and doesn't show much of the scenes, but he leaves the majority of it up to the audiences' imagination, which is probably worse. The bodies stacked against the house were only shown for a matter of seconds, but your mind is so focused on them that it takes forever! Not to mention, right after that scene the audience encounters the man that was burned alive. The makeup was very realistic and it is very difficult to keep your eyes on the screen.One of the last scenes of the movie when Florya shoots the picture of Hitler over and over again is probably the most prominent and realistic images in my mind, yet it is ironic because it was the most formalistic and unrealistic scene in the movie. The sequence disrupts space and time, but because I knew that the stock images of Hitler were authentic and that all of the destruction of WWII was because of him, it weighed on my mind and on my heart twice as hard as the rest of the film. I amounted all of Florya's pain and frustration into those pictures and was all for Florya shooting the picture, but then when Florya doesn't shoot the picture of Hitler as a baby it makes you question your own morality.Overall, the movie was put together very well, and although the content is difficult, it is a movie worth watching.",8,1,1,13 June 2009
