The Ring," Really effective, for about half an hour
","Yes, this movie was truly creepy and very well made.But once I'd finished watching, the questions began, such as,
Why does that girl have the ability to project her evil onto videotape, specifically?  Why doesn't she just run a pirate video feed into, like, ESPN or A&E or something and be done with it?  Or better yet wait until Super Bowl Sunday?Where did Samara come from?  They 'went away' and came back with her, telling everyone that she was adopted; Richard said that Anna wasn't ever meant to have a child and that Samara wasn't his child and yet we see the birth certificate in Richard's house, naming him as the father.Katie clearly took the death threat seriously, since she told Aidan about it, so what was with the joking and then 'sudden realization' that it was all true the night she died?How did Samara manage to live in so many places for so long?  She lived in the barn, she lived in the hospital, she lived in the family's mainland home. . .  And why hasn't that tree gotten bigger in the last 14 years?Why did Aidan say all that about 'the horses keep her awake; she doesn't like living in the dark' when he should have said, 'she's *evil*; don't help her'?  That is, of course, why Rachel couldn't drag Aidan around with her, not because she'd be exposing him to danger, but because the whole movie would have ended right then.Why bother setting up an ongoing theme of maternal love and rejection if the real message was 'she's evil and it's never going to stop'?I understand that this movie is the remake of a part of a trilogy, but they should have made this movie make sense within itself, rather than, apparently, just copying down the bits that were revealed in the corresponding movie in hopes that the American moviegoing public will foot the bill for two more.",7,0,1,24 March 2003
The English Patient," As long movies go, this was *really* long
","I normally love talky, romantic, period drama type movies, but this one just left me unmoved.  The romance of Kip and Hana was wonderful, and earns this movie the six stars I gave it.  I would have loved it if they had been the focus of the movie.But the main story, Laszlo and Katharine, did nothing for me.  Their scenes before they *ahem* consummated their attraction for one another had less of flirtation and discovery, and more of two dogs in heat sniffing around each other.It's telling that I have a window open with the cast listing so I could see what Laszlo's and Katharine's names were, because I just plain couldn't remember them.  But I remembered Kip's and Hana's.",6,1,4,15 May 2002
