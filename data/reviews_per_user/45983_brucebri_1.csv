The Ring," Worst Movie of the Year
","I just came out of this and I am completely at a loss for words.   It was absolutely the most tedious, poorly acted, unoriginal and boring movie I've seen all year.I thought Naomi Watts should have won the Oscar last year for her amazing performance in Mulholland Drive and now am rethinking that opinion.  I'm starting to think that she owes that performance to typecasting and David Lynch. What I thought was a brilliant job of intentional bad acting for the first half of 'Drive'  may have been the work of a bad actress being brilliantly used by a great director.there is so much wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start but suffice to say that you will lose count of the absurdities that fill this movie.  And all for nothing.  There may be a couple of scenes that make you jump but nothing is in the least bit scary.Watts should give 90% of everything she makes to David Lynch and take out a contract on Verbinski.  He may have killed what I thought was a promising career.BTW, you'll see a lot of good reviews by critics around the country but believe me they are being baffled by BS (lit. degrees can be catered to by the way).This is a load of crap.",1,0,2,18 October 2002
