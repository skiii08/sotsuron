Walk the Line," Excellent
","'Walk the Line' is one of the best movies I've ever seen!!Joaquin Phoenix (in particular) and Reese Witherspoon show extraordinary acting-talent portraying country legend Johnny Cash and love of his life June Carter. I was completely in awe through out the entire movie and didn't find even one little second tiresome or drawn out. The only little thing I will hold against this film is my disappointment (as a huge fan) with the character they've chosen to portray Elvis Presley... I see no resemblance at all!! But then again, this movie isn't about Elvis but Johnny Cash so it's only a minor flaw.'Walk the Line' is definitely a MUST SEE!!",10,0,0,14 February 2006
