Kill Bill: Vol. 2," AWESOME
","This is Quentin Tarantino's Spahgehtti western. I liked both movies equally, but it was hard to feel the continuity between the two movies. I loved the close ups, the bloody faces, and that western music playing throughout the movie. just awesome, Uma's best acting performance ever. i voted a solid 10 for this one. Elle driver was so perfectly evil, and Budd the perfect hillbilly. This movie probably had some of the best writing I have ever seen. David Carradine was so perfect for this role with his leathery face and smooth voice. The wedding chapel masacre made it hard for me to believe he was gonna kill everyone at all. If you want to see some harsh bitchin ass kickin then go see this movie it is the most fun you will ever have at the movies.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
