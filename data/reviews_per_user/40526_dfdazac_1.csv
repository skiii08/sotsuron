It," Why?
","After hearing from several people about how scary this movie was and how people would leave theaters in the midst of terror I decided to give it a try. I was disappointed at the ridiculous and repetitive jump scares, and the super cheesy moment at the end did it for me. Seriously? The saving-kiss moment is so cliche I think that was the actual reason why people left the theaters. I'm not even against it, but why? Why was it needed? Why did it work? This question generalizes to the movie because we never get to know in depth who the clown is, why does it exist? Why does it do what it does? Why every 27 years? This is just a fireworks show with no real story development. Its merits are decent acting and visual effects.",3,0,0,7 January 2018
