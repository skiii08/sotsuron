Alien 3," Reading other peoples posts
","I can't believe people are rating the movie so bad because they didn't like the story direction???Not every movie should have a fair tale Hollywood ending, and you cannot and must not base all your views on a few things that i have read that users had gripes about.The number 1 thing that people are voting this movie down for is that they didn't like the fact that newt and hicks died?What the?Are you people actually serious? voting this movie below a 6 out of 10 because you didn't like the direction of the story?Also complaining about how the eggs got on board the ship?What the?Are you people so nearsighted and dimwitted that you will vote a fantastic movie such a low score because of those 2 things?IMDb should remove all those posts and this movie would be at the 8out10 mark, its what it should be.I love that a story can lead down the path of disaster for a unhappy ending rather than everything being nice and flowery.Answer me this?Did you see Ripley kill every alien? Did you see Ripley kill every egg?No you didn't? so whats to stop her from commanding her drones to save a few eggs?? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.HOW DID THE EGGS GET THE SHIP? BECAUSE THE QUEEN PUT THEM THERE, IT WAS UNNECESSARY FOR THEM TO TELL YOU HOW, BECAUSE YOU IF HAD HALF A BRAIN YOU WOULD WORK IT OUT.",10,3,5,28 October 2010
The Mist," Don't waste your time.
","The movie concept is brilliant.I loved the story line behind this film but the way it was delivered was a let down.I did not feel for any of the characters as the movie didn't portray them right or give me enough time to bond with any of them.The movie tried to hard to shock you in moments, but all it did was leave a bad taste in my mouth or make me laugh. It was truly poorly delivered.The conflict between the main character and his neighbor felt forced, and badly acted/scripted.The religious freak was too predictable, and lets not forget about the ending???? Somehow out of everything I knew exactly what was going to happen..... and I was hoping that they didn't go there, but they did.How can a character like David Drayton be portrayed as the most well rounded hero in a crisis situation, throughout the whole movie he shines through as the smartest one there, and is a survivalist, he tries to keep everyone safe and away from harm.Then someone flicks a switch, he becomes a dumb ass, who shoots his own son, but cant kill himself due to lack of bullets...... and here is the best part, 5mins later the mist lifts and the military is rolling through, and his just sitting there screaming up at the sky.....I have never laughed so hard in my life.Such a BAD film, trying too hard to shock you, and doing it poorly.",4,0,1,4 July 2012
