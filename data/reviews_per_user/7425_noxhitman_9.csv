Minority Report," Worth a 10, but there is one little flaw
","First i must recommend this movie to everyone, specially if you are a Sci-Fi Fan, a movie really worth a watch with super action scenes and moral questions. After watching this movie i couldn't help but feel good for the 'happy' ending and the doubts it lets, i was going to rate it 10/10 ( it deserves ) but there is one flaw in this movie( DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT ) :After John Anderton is arrested , his wife discovers that he is 'innocent' and goes there to free him, the thing is that she gets in all the system using John's eye, now you tell me, how can some HUGE protected system with something so important to take care, do not deactivate John's access in any way (considering that he is accused by  murder )???Despite that, a great movie: 9/10",7,0,0,2 August 2002
Memento," One of the best! ( if not the best )
","Don't Even Dare on *not* buying this DVD! This movie is amazing, the kind of movie that keeps you guessing right to the end, it is so well encoded so well acted , and most of all , it is original it is all in backwards, i thought the thrillers had ran out of ideas, but then came this movie :) So, go watch this movie! nine STRONG stars out of ten, that means it is almost a ten",10,0,1,18 March 2002
The Girl Next Door," Not the usual flick for chicks...
","The movie sure looks like all movies we're used to see. Fortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. I was waiting for usual romantic-comedy crap and what i got was something way funnier and a lot more deeper than typical teenage films.I recommend it as a light movie that should be seen by people on their first semester at college. Obviously the movie does not stand up among the others( it has a nice ending, a lot of hot women, some of the same old jokes... ), but it is quite better.When the movie finished i ended up very excited about life, and how it can turn it all around. It is all up to you.8/10.",8,0,0,17 July 2004
Spider-Man," Fine Movie... Couldn't be great...
","This movie is o.k. I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend some with a movie that finishes happy and wants get out smiling. Sometimes we all get tired of the same old sh*t, but this one does good and times in times you will have yourself inside the movie, that means this movie is really entertaining. The effects were a bit of a let down, if you pay attention you will see that sometimes he 'throws' his web in the air ( I really don't know how can that glue in the air :p), although it has some flaws there is never a HUGE mistake. Go to see this one with an open mind and try not to pay attention to the effects, it is not good to see flaws in a movie, it spoils everything. All in all good movie.My Rating 7/10 ( by the way the USA flag in the end of the movie sucked )",7,0,0,7 September 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Crap...
","Here we have a movie for teenagers getting 18 years old and dying to have a car. This is the specific public for this movie. Fast And Furious fails in everything.Acting: None of the actors have a nice performance, and they tried to put some conflicts with people, it is something like : 'I don't like you' all of sudden.It just doesn't work.The Cars: Although the car sequences may seem a bit 'cool' it has several flaws, and you don't need to pay so MUCH attention to see it. Again they think we are dumb enough to don't realize it.THE MOVIE: I don't even know if i can call it a movie, when i finished watching it, all i could remember were cars, and hot women, and cars and women and some cars with women. Is this really a movie?Conclusion: DO NOT WATCH IT! Unless you want see some women with some cars put in a movie with no sense.I am sure you will find worse movies to rent than this one, but not much.My rating : 1/10",1,3,8,5 September 2002
Spirited Away," I believe it is as good as it gets
","Every little detail you get to know about this movie will spoil a nice surprise you would have while watching it, so all i can say is that you should stop reading this and go see it.Deserved the oscar as any movie ever did.10/10",10,1,2,18 May 2003
Pi," A Great movie to think about the world
","Mathematics is the language of nature That is a fact, at least in this movie, and it maybe a fact for the 'real' world, but it is up you and your thoughts, this movie may help you build this opinion. Could the World be explained by numbers? If you want more questions to your life, go watch this one. No doubts... 10/10 movie :)",9,0,1,16 May 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Now this is a 'movie'
","Sometimes i ask myself, what makes a movie after all? Well, i have just got the answer watching this movie. When  the movie ends, you can't help but feel the magic, the music, every single frame of the movie in your head and above all that, the strong story line which is funny and at the same time violent, but i am pretty sure you will like the 'violence', because it is not about rape and murder, it is a hard critic to society and that's why it is so perfect. Stanley Kubrick was a genius, and in this movie you can see it so well, that will take a long time for you to forget how much you enjoyed it. That's why i think it is 'The Movie' cause it has music, acting, art, beauty, life, realism, sci-fi, violence and humor. Clockwork Orange gets a 10/10 Because it is perfect...",10,1,2,2 July 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Better than Good Will Hunting
","Although it may seem just a boring drama, it is quite good for a biography and it is also entertaining. When i went to watch this movie i didnt know it would be so focused on his mind,I didn't know he was crazy , and only at the end i was sure he was, his visions were so powerful that i believed he wasnt crazy, it is all because Russel Crowe's acting, it is super, I dont think Denzel Washington deserved the Oscar... Well anyways, go see this movie if you want some powerful stuff, not some crying tear jerker... And I must say that this one is far much better than Good Will Hunting :)my rating 9/10",9,0,1,28 August 2002
