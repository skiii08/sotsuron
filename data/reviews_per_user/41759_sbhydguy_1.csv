Airlift," Every Indian Must Watch this film
","This is the most beautiful ever made. Inspired by the true events happened in Kuwait in 1990. Iraq attacks Kuwait. How the Indians in Kuwait are saved form the crux of the story. Akshay Kumar has acted exceptionally well. Hats off to him. He also learnt Arabic language for this movie. Nimrat kaur was good. In a scene, where she speaks for husband about a guy who is humiliating her husband was very good. Special mention to director Raja Krishna Menon. Kudos to you sir. Every Indian must watch this movie. Music was good, especially back ground music is very good.All the remaining characters are appropriate. Please watch in it theatres and do not encourage piracy.",Null,1,2,25 January 2016
