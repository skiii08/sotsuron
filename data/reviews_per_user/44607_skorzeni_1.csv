Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Another great adventure!
","I'm also weary of people trashing the Pirates of the Carribbean movies. I thought they were imaginative and great fun. The latest, 'On Stranger Tides' was excellently done. I've seen the movie twice, both times in 3-D. The first time, I thought the movie probably wasn't as good as the first three, as Captain Jack Sparrow wasn't as many steps ahead of me as he was in the first three movies. However, after seeing it a second time, I think Captain Sparrow did a great job of planning things out, given the circumstances. Not as many betrayals going on in this movies as in the second two in which he can strut his stuff.I just love how the supernatural is reintroduced in these movies. Not especially gory, just exquisitely spooky. White Camp Bay would now give me the frights as it did the sailors in that movie. Excellent! A lot of people put in a lot of work in order to make this movie, and they did a spectacular job. They deserve our praise and our support. Unfortunately, I'm now addicted and am eagerly waiting the next movie. I sure hope there is another one.",10,2,4,4 June 2011
