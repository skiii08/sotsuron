"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," An Insult to Marathon Runners Everywhere
","Now I'm not an ideal audience to review this movie. I don't like Simon Pegg, I don't find him funny and I've never enjoyed one of his films yet so this review might be just a slight tad biased against the film.I'll try my best to be objective but it won't be easy. Pegg plays Dennis who jilts his stunningly beautiful bride to be (played by Thandie Newton, is he insane?) on their wedding day.Don't you already hate him? NO? Did I mention she's heavily pregnant with his child? Do you hate him now? Yes? Good!Now I truly don't understand why they chose this title. At the start of the film he's not fat, 5 years later he's not fat either. That's just a bit of a paunch, and as he's a smoker it's not a surprise.Pegg is an exceptionally pathetic character who is hard to root for. There aren't many laughs in the film (the little boy giving Pegg the finger on the night bus is hysterical!) and the running 'joke' (because it is never funny) of Pegg locking himself out of his flat isn't even funny the 1st time it happens.The whole training sequence is totally wrong. I've run 2 marathons myself and been a road runner for more than 15 years, you NEVER train by running in the middle of the road. It'll get you killed really quickly. Also for man who just had a nail jammed into his foot he isn't limping when he goes to see the Nike people.Whats even worse is he's still training in the same stupid plimsols that gave him a gigantic blister in the 2nd training sequence, I also don't see how skipping or running up steps is going to help train for running on mostly flat roads. The whole drinking raw eggs thing is a total myth too (and tastes disgusting!). I understand their parodying the original Rocky training sequence but that's only funny if your making a movie where Dennis's end goal is a boxing match, which it isn't.Now as kind as his landlord may think he's being, giving Dennis a brand new pair of running shoes less than 3 weeks before the race is a really stupid idea. He'll have no time at all to break them in, it takes at least 2 months to break in new running shoes fully.The chances of them televising a Marathon thats only in it's 1st year is pretty low to be honest, especially one that's only got 10,000 runners (that's not a very big field at all).Also them putting a drinks station away from the actual route of the race would never happen. Likewise the shots of cars behind Dennis, most Marathons keep the roads closed for at least 5 hours for slow runners & stragglers so that wouldn't just happen either. It's stupid that they wouldn't know who Dennis is, they can see his race number, its a matter of minutes to ask who registered under that number.The TV guy says Dennis broke his ankle, I'm sorry but no matter how fit you are, your not going to run even a metre on a broken ankle let alone another 9 miles like Dylan Moran told Dennis he had left to go. Anyway, the race organisers would have stopped him and pulled him off the course after a certain amount of time (especially after the report of his broken ankle) due to insurance reasons.Once Dennis spots Thandie Newton & his son past the finish line he suddenly 'forgets' his broken ankle (he doesn't even limp or hobble like he was before, highly unlikely).It's never said exactly when the next scene takes place but Dennis is walking OK so I'd have to assume its at least 6 or more weeks later (thats how long a broken ankle would stay in plaster). This is an incredibly weak ending, nothing is resolved.Has Thandie left Hank Azaria? Has Dennis got his flat back? Are Dennis and Thandie getting back together?Far too many questions left unresolved. A really weak ending in a pretty bad film.",2,8,26,23 February 2008
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," As good as the original
","In action movie series its rare that the sequel is as good or better than the original but this is just as good as National Treasure.Again we have lots of puzzles, hidden maps and travelling this time all over the world to find The Lost City Of Gold just to clear the name of Ben's great great grandfather who has been accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination of President Lincoln.Ideas that places like The Oval Office in The White House and The Queen's Private Chambers in Buckingham Palace would be so easy to gain access to are totally laughable and unrealistic, likewise the shelves of The Library Of Congress.Some suspension of belief is required there, well a huge amount actually. Once again Ben is being pursued by bad people (Ed Harris playing a mercenary very badly). The locations are excellent, the action is slightly over the top. Casting Helen Mirren as Ben's mum is a stroke of genius, her scenes with John Voight are all totally brilliant and improve the film a great deal.It's quite funny seeing John Voight playing a former treasure hunter here especially as that was his role in Tomb Raider as Lara Croft's father.The film is very watchable and I'm sure there are lots of little things you will spot if you watch it more than once so it can definitely stand up to multiple viewings. Hopefully the next one in the series will be just as good, I guess it just depends what was on Page 47? Highly recommended.",7,1,3,8 January 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," Cool but weird
","I've wanted to see this ever since I saw clips of it on Jonathon Ross's 'Japanorama' show on BBC3 several years ago. I guess you'd class it as Anime but it was clearly made with a Western audience in mind as most signs and numbers are written in English (Although I did see a poster written in German & some boxes labelled in what looked like French).You don't need the subtitles switched on as there is English dialogue but the subtitles were clearly translated from Japanese as they do differ from the spoken English dialogue in grammar and structure, not all translations are exact either.The look of the movie is very much like something from the mind of animator Terry Gilliam, especially the castle on legs striding across the rural countryside. Its very much like something he'd have thought of. It's difficult to know what time period the movie is supposed to be set in seeing Cavalrymen on Horses but steam powered Trams, Trains, Steam Cars & Sedan Chairs too.It appears the lead character of the film is Sophie who works in a millinery shop (thats hats to you philistines) and we start off meeting her leaving work, being rescued from the over amourous attention of 2 soldiers by a chap who not only seems to know Jedi Mind tricks but can also fly and is being chased by evil black ectoplasmic creatures.Sophie discusses her encounter with her sister Lettie and they also discuss Howl (he's clearly a Wizard and everyone thinks he's evil and eats womens hearts), returning to the Shop Sophie has a spell cast on her by The Witch Of The Wastes which turns her into an old women. She avoids her mother and leaves town rescuing a scarecrow which repays her with a walking cane and helps her to find shelter, inside Howls Moving Castle. A bit like the Tardis, even though its moving the inside of the castle always remains stationary as though it were a normal static dwelling.This is obviously a world where magic is totally normal (as Sophie wasn't surprised by a magical scarecrow) as meeting a Fire Demon called Calciifer didn't even seem to phase her, it seems Howls Castle is even more like the Stargate as it is able to be static yet its front door and exterior can be in many different locations at once (Actually it seems to be based on the Terry Pratchett idea of Wandering Shops).All of the callers seem to think different Wizards live there but none think it is Howl. We discover the man who saved Sophie is of course Howl (who can't be that great a wizard if he doesn't recognise someone under an spell) and to remain close to him she pretends she is his new cleaning lady.We also discover (thanks to Howl) that Sophie appears as a normal girl when she sleeps. One thing can be said for certain, this is a world where several cities or countries are involved in a war (with flying battleships and iron ships that look like US Civil War steamers) but even the Witch Of The Waste seems to have a Tardis-like Sedan chair, definitely bigger on the inside.It's rather strange that whilst talking to the Kings Head Sorceror Sulliman (a mistranslation surely as she is clearly female) that Sophie briefly transforms into her younger self whilst making an impassioned speech on Howls behalf. Sulliman had also taken all the magic from The Witch Of The Waste and tried to trap Howl who saves Sophie.Sophie escapes back to the castle and wakes up but is still young, checking on Howl she tells him she loves him. When he rejects her she becomes old again but it is difficult to know if that was a dream or not. Afer using Calcifer to move the Castle it also completely reconfigures and repairs the interior (again like another aspect of the Tardis, able to add new rooms), Sophie also appears to get younger again when Howl takes her into his secret garden.From what I could understand Sophie gets younger when she acknowledges her feelings of love for Howl. Sophie is visited by her mother (who was forced to leave a spying bug by Sulliman) but it is destroyed by The Witch Of The Wastes using Calcifer to burn it but it leaves him weakened and unable to protect the house from invasion and bombing.So many of the images of flying ships and burning birds remind of Battle Of The Planets (Gatchaman) it made me wonder if the maker of this had seen the cartoon as a child. Trying to help Howl Sophie removes Calcifer from the castle which destroys it but he is able to reconfigure it only smaller when she returns him and gives him her hair.The magical scarecrow saves them from certain death and she kisses him which releases him from a spell, he turns out to be a missing Prince who can stop the war. Sulliman also stops the war using her royal contacts and calcifer repairs the castle and Sophie and Howl fly off into the sky.It's an odd ending to an odd but sweet film which is apparently very loosely based on a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, the film is just under 2 hours long but I think it could be cut by about 20 minutes as it is just too long in places.",6,0,1,3 January 2009
The Incredible Hulk," the jury is out
","OK, start by forgetting Ang Lee's 2003 version of Hulk. As far as this movie is concerning that never existed and this is the one and only definitive version of Hulk (despite being also known as hulk 2).Edward Norton is playing Bruce Banner (so Eric Bana is now confined to the annals of Hulk history and almost certainly doomed to be forgotten). This movie throws you right into the deep end having all the accident that turns Bruce into Hulk happen over the opening title credits as well as his running away, being chased by the authorities then going missing.The last newspaper report says he hadn't been seen for 5 months. Bruce is hiding out in Brazil & we get our 1st nod back to the TV series when he sees Bill Bixby (Bruce Banner in the TV version of The Incredible Hulk) on TV in something, so their pleasing the hardcore Hulk fans pretty much right away.Bruce is being taught by a martial arts instructor how to contain his anger by learning breathing techniques. We also get a joke about Banner's inability to full speak the local language when he mistakenly says 'Don't make me hungry' because he doesn't know the right word for angry.Stan Winston gets his standard cameo playing a man with gamma sickness infected after drinking a soda infected with Bruce's blood. This death alerts the military who send out a SEAL team plus Eric Blonsky (Tim Roth) on load from the Royal Marines so we're supposed to assume he's at least a Commando to capture Banner alive.Banner goes Hulk in the Bottling Plant where he works having been chased there by bullies from his job after trying to avoid the SEAL team. Hulk is barely seen in this fight, even when Blonsky sees him its only for a few moments so they're sticking to the old tried & trusted adage that a creature looks better the less you see it.After waking up in the jungle Banner discovers he has managed to travel from Brazil to Guatemala while he was Hulk. We also get another nod back to the TV series when they play the TV end title music as Banner is walking the streets in Mexico. He is also sold some purple trousers which is a nod back to the original Hulk comic strip.He makes it back to America to Culver University where he's looking for Dr Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) who we'd seen get injured during the Hulk accident in the opening titles. It was her father General Ross (William Hurt) who sent the SEAL team after Banner in Brazil. We get yet another nod to the TV series when Banner meets the night security guard (played by Lou Ferrigno, the original TV Hulk!). We get a flashback to the accident & it's practically the TV version stolen shot for shot replacing Bixby with Norton. There's a very huge plot goof that Betty has the lab data on a USB stick (most can hold 16 gig max?) but that she was able to get it at all seeing as she was very badly injured in a hospital bed you'd think the data would have been moved/deleted while she was out of commission? The 2nd big Hulk fight sequence has him in clear view and the CGI model looks good (but I still think Ang Lee's Hulk looked better!), this battle appears to end in the death of Blomsky. I assume Hulk banging his head in the cave was thrown in for the children likely to be watching this? Way to make your hero seem like an idiot, I thought.That scene in the rain with Betty was very reminiscent of the original Frankenstein movie where he plays with the little girl though. We're shown Blomsky was badly injured but survived being attacked by Hulk, he goes onto make a 'miracle' recovery almost certainly thanks to whatever it was they had injected him with before the battle. We also get yet another nod to the TV series when they refer to student Jack McGee (the name of the reporter who constantly hounded Bruce Banner in the TV series) who is a reporter for the Culver campus newspaper.Betty & Bruce decide to meet with Bruce's contact in New York, the mysterious Mr Blue who turns out to be Dr Stern to try and cure him which at the time does appear to have taken effect. We then get a bit of pseudo science explaining why Bruce didn't die of radiation sickness years ago.Blomsky forces Stern to inject him with whatever had been removed from Banner & Blomsky becomes SOMETHING (you can't call it Abomination because it's never official named that. Stern only said Blomsky would become AN Abomination) that the Delta Force soldiers (how have they gone from being Navy SEALS to Delta Force?) mistakenly think is Hulk. In an attempt to stop whatever it is Blomsky has become, Banner jumps from a helicopter hoping he'll become Hulk. Which luckily for him he does as it'd have been awful to have ended the film with Banner as pavement pizza.It's pretty clear from the start that the Blomsky beast is stronger than Hulk & their fight is pretty impressive but Hulk manages to defeat the Blomsky beast by choking him with a chain (where'd that come from, by the way? And did Hulk actually KILL Blomsky there?).The ending is very weak, the Tony Stark (fron Iron Man) cameo is short & pointless. I hope this doesn't lead to a sequel.",6,1,3,19 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Oh Dear
","Wow. What a weak plot. Ethan gets married and the bad guy captures his wife. And the rest of the plot is a weak rip off from True Lies.That's sinking pretty low, not only stealing the plot from an Arnie film but stealing a plot from a film that's actually better than yours.Mission Impossible 1 and 2 were excellent films with good plots and original ideas. The bomb in the head is a Robert Sheckley idea (which I bet they never paid him for either). Your wife not knowing your a spy (True Lies).The raised freeway being shot at by a plane (again, True Lies). Simon Pegg's character seemed shoe horned into this film and totally didn't belong. And Ricky Gervais wouldn't have played it any better.This was a big let down and the lack of new ideas was really sad. best avoided.",1,1,4,21 March 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Twisty twisty plot!
","Take an excellent big name cast. Sir Ben Kingsley (Sneakers, Ghandi), Morgan Freeman (Deep Impact, Shawshank Redemption), Lucy Lui (Charlies Angels), Bruce Willis (Die Hard, The Jackal) and Josh Hartnett (The Faculty) who I actually thought was Benicio Del Torro (because of his haircut at the start of the film).The film starts out leading you down the path of a plot that revolves around an apparent case of mistaken identity. Hartnett is mistaken for his friend who owes the wrong people a lot of money.The friend owes money to two opposing groups of gangsters who hate each other and are in a bit of a war where only the innocent will suffer. Or at least thats what you'll be thinking until well into 2/3's of the way through the movie. Then the plot will twist and turn and you won't have a clue who has hired who, who is killing who and who is an assassin and who isn't.Bruce Willis is basically revisiting his role from The Jackal.The film is brilliant, and will leave you thinking. You are never taken for granted and made to wonder and question things.All in all a very good well made film.",7,0,2,13 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh Dear, a remake! George, spare us please.
","The Phantom Menace is simply Star Wars remade. Made the way George Lucas would have made A New Hope if he'd had the technology. There are so many similarities between it and the previous 3 Star Wars films it's unreal.1)Opening with a space battle. Hmmm! Didn't Star Wars open like this? 2)Jedi meets with student. Again we've seen this before. 3)Pod racing, made me think about Luke's speech on Beggars Canyon. 4)To the Tatooine spaceport. Mos Eisley, anybody? 5)Droids in a workshop. Like father like son, Luke fixes 3PO and R2! 6)Attacking the green planet. Endor? where were the Ewoks? 7)Jabba's slave girl. Seen that outfit somewhere before? Leia wore it! 8)Jedi fight Sith Lord (pronouced syth-si, OK Samuel Jackson?). Kenobi vs Vader on the Deathstar, or vs Luke on Cloudcity or the new Deathstar) 9)Attacking a big space station. the trench sequence? 10)Being presented with medals. the end of Star Wars.OK. George Lucas has ripped himself off, and conned the punters. Neeson and McGregor hold the film together. Jake Lloyd looks out of his depth in every scene. Ray Parks was killed off too easily and should have been used a lot more.All in all - what a waste of time and money. It could have been so much more. George, you must redeem yourself.",3,3,5,7 January 2008
The Longest Yard," Don't sell this film on the wrestlers!
","I rate this film a zero. The film is pure garbage. I thought if your going to sell a film because you have some big name wrestlers in it then they'd actually be in the film quite a lot. Even the British remake with Vinny Jones was better than this. Even they managed to work in the whole 'mean machine' name in a lot better than the shoe-horn attempt of this huge pile of steaming crap. Stone Cold Steve Austin hardly appears, how he managed to hurt his hamstring in the football scenes in beyond me. We see him play for all of about 5 minutes. Do the guards not bother with their field goals because we don't see them in the 1st half (in fact we only get to see the con's 2nd field goal during the whole 1st half). Bill Goldberg just magically appears in the film from no-where when the hunt for players starts. Kevin Nash, he's here - he's there, he's pointless. How did the prisoners get Estrogen in an all male facility? And if Mr Nash was taking steroids like candy like the film shows it would have taken months of Estrogen to upset his hormonal balance. Is it legal for Bill Goldberg to wear the letter X on his jersey on the field of play and not a number?Why isn't Sandler sent to a Federal Prison? He's already on federal parole for match fixing/points shaving. He then commits DUI, resists arrest, damages police property, flees arrest, leaves the scene of an accident, has an open liquor container. I'm not going to list Grand Theft Auto because thats a bullsh1t charge. How did people NOT notice Courtney Cox Arquette in this film (and since when did she get breasts?)On the whole this film is a POINTLESS remake. I assume Happy Madison is Sandlers company? Burt Reynolds should never have attached himself to this, he's lost a lot of credibility - however much he had left.Chris Rock is the best thing in this film and he's f()cking awful so that's saying something.In a film that's a remake of a remake I laughed once. Lets see - the longest yard 1974 (US) which was sold as the mean machine in the UK, remade as a UK mean machine then remade again into this huge pile of camel dung again as the longest yard.Now I did some checking up, Richard Kiel aka jaws from James Bond was in the original and he was in Happy Gilmore too, couldn't Adam Sandler persuade him to be in this as well?Adam Sandler, find something better to do with your time. Just don't waste ours with this tripe.",1,0,2,3 July 2005
Deja Vu," Utterly brilliant!
","For every little detail you see happening to Denzel during the first three quarters of the movie you will see a little pay-off after he has traveled in time back to the past.The film is really good and keeps you glued to the film through it's run.Denzel plays a ATF agent who is called upon by the FBI to analyze footage of an explosion that kills hundreds in New Orleans. But it turns out their footage is from the past and they have the ability to see into the past but only 4 days into the past.They are trying to catch the bomber and he is also trying to catch the same man who had killed a young woman and tried to disguise her murder as part of the casualties of the ferry bombing.Referencing Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing this film plays the humanist angle of America as being open to trouble, like terrorism.The plot plays out well, Val Kilmer doesn't really add much to his role as the leader of the FBI time surveillance squad.The guy who plays the lead scientist is pretty good and plays his role well but the young lady whose murder Denzel is trying to solve doesn't really bring much to her role. Anyone could have played that role and most likely have done a better job than her.It's pretty obvious that Denzel will time travel at some point during the movie to try and prevent the girls murder and the bombing. The bombers motive is never really explained and it almost seems that just before he is killed he is about to reveal he is a time traveler himself? The film looks good visually, the effects are excellent and the plot is pretty decent. The bloke playing the terrorist is pretty rubbish and anyone could have played that role as well.On the whole the film is very enjoyable and will require several viewings to catch all the little nuances that happen in the 'present' that are paid off in the 'past' after Denzel does his time traveling.Well worth a look.",9,1,2,10 May 2007
Fight Club," Possibly THE weirdest film ever made?
","This is as confusing as 2001 A Space Odessey.Edward Norton plays Tyler Durden. Well he does eventually! Brad Pitt also plays Tyler Durden, or at least certain aspects of Tyler Durden.Norton starts out as an ordinary businessman who descends into madness and creates chaos with nothing but a figment of his imagination.This chaos all starts with Fight Club. Obviously I can't talk about that because of it's rules. Likewise Operation Mayhem.The film is really weird, incredibly difficult to follow. At times you won't know if Pitt is real. Meatloaf plays a man with testicular cancer and breasts due to hormone excess.Helena Bonhom Carter plays a woman who constantly cries for attention and thrives on that attention.The film is difficult to follow, for both Nortons life and Pitts life.It will leave you with more questions than answers.But well worth not only watching but re-watching.",6,0,4,24 July 2007
Stripes," Don't Join Up!
","worth 10 stars for several reasons. bill Murray at his best (uncle Hulka?) Harold Ramis who gets without a doubt the BEST line in the entire movie (I once got the sh*t kicked out of me in Wisconsin!) - and also acts his posterior off, this is most likely his best performance in anything he's ever been in, the man just shines. John Candy - the legend, the big man making a little part very huge, again he is excellent (especially in poker sequence). He steals every scene he's in, gotta love the guy. Elmer Berstein creates an excellent and hugely memorable score, my favorite has to be the tune behind johns girlfriend leaving. Looking across all the tunes elmer created, his legacy is them, most definitely. The chap playing Sgt Hulka is also excellent. Makes a lot of his character. Drill Instructors are definitely like this guy. I should know! I can watch this until the cows come home, well worth a look if you like SNL, Candy, Ramis, Murray.OK, I've now seen the extended cut. And wow is that a different (and better!) movie. The whole extra scene in John's girlfriends apartment about the Winnibago which adds more to John's motivation to actually join The Army. Every time I watch this I totally fail to notice Sean Young (Rachel in Bladerunner) as one of the female MP's but she looks amazing!There's also an extra scene of dialogue in the barracks between John & Russell which leads to a huge cut segment of John & Russell aboard a plane with Special Ops guys, jumping out, getting captured by bandits and almost getting killed (I assume this was cut for pacing) but saving themselves by getting the bandits high on acid and singing 'Quando'.Having seen where the scene was cut from, I totally understand why it went (it spoiled the flow of the film, it didn't make any sense, it took up too much time). It does upset the following scene where Hulka asks about men leaving the base but at least explains why that happened.Stillwell briefing the men about Hulka's accident is a new scene which explains their reason to go to the mud wrestling bar better. There are also a few extra small insert shots inside the bar as well.The rifle drill sequence for graduation is longer with more moves than the normal cut. I'm still quite annoyed that they take Hulka to Italy with them. That just wouldn't happen, He was drill training staff. The likelihood of them posting him with that squad would be very low indeed. The fact that the female MP's (Stella & Louise) were posted to Germany at the same time John's Platoon had been sent to Italy is too contrived a plot device as well.The scene loading the EM-50 (An armoured Winnebago!) with shells is another new scene which explains why John & Russell are guarding it alone before they borrow it. Combine that extra scene with the Winnebago scene near the start and this scene now makes even more sense to the plot!There are extra scenes of John in the bedroom with Stella and Russell in the bathtub with Louise, cutting quite a bit of nudity from both women! The shots of the tanks blocking the road into Czechoslovakia has been added. The conversation about Russells sister is new too.I did notice once in the Czechoslovakian base the soldiers stopped speaking Russian and some of them were speaking German? Good goof! The bits that were added on the whole do improve the movie and make the scenes that follow them make a lot more sense. I prefer this version I think. I am annoyed about the press cutting they use for Louise in front of the EM-50, it's supposed to be Top Secret but it's appearing on the front cover of a magazine?Russell's headline is wrong as well 'Zitzsky rates The Russians', actually they were Czechoslovakians! In general the whole 'welcome home' ending is wrong, this was supposed to be a deniable mission, no-one back home would have even know it had happened. Also Hulka shouldn't be saluting John (and vice-versa) as neither of them are Officers. Watching the end credits I saw Bill Paxton played a soldier.My final words? Gentlemen, It's Party time - Italian style!",10,4,7,12 May 2005
Madagascar," Some good movie Pastiches
","Parodied are Tom Hank's Cast Away, Charlton Heston's Planet Of The Apes, Silence Of The Lambs. Oh, and Tarzan (twice) and George Of The Jungle I suppose.Sacha Baron Cohen sounds like he is trying to do a voice somewhere between Jim Broadbent (who I actually thought it was until I read the cast list) and Spike Milligan doing some of his Goon's voices.Chris Rock's animated Zebra actually does look a bit like him. Right, my main question - what kind of animal is a Foosa? They look a bit like some of the Lions and big Cats out of The Lion King.By the way, WHO THE HELL IS Cedric The Entertainer? Why should we know him? We in the UK assume he's been in some TV show in the US? Generally I think this film is a little on the short side, could have done with about an extra 20 minutes or so. The little kids will love it like they loved Nemo. Not quite in the same league as The Incredibles though.Also the 1st time I've found Chris Rock not only bearable but funny as well on screen. He must be improving in his old age but I wonder how much dialog recorded was cut because of obscenity?",6,0,1,30 July 2005
Blade," Good apart from the plot holes
","Visually and action scenes are excellent.The 2 plot holes are stupid. the whole 'need 12 pure-bloods to do a revive but we killed one and it still worked' plot hole. and the 'whistler shot himself but he still appears in movie 2' plot hole.I'm always trying to decide if the tattoo's Wesley has here, he also has in demolition man.The visuals are wicked. the fighting is well done. i didn't spot the silly plot holes until now (3rd time I've seen it) but they now annoy me.If your prepared to watch this with brain disengaged then it's a brilliant movie.",6,2,8,10 February 2006
Superbad," never was a title so accurate!
","there's bad and there's super bad. this is just plain awful. think of the worst parts of Napoleon Dynamite and thats still better than this. target audiences are males from 17-25. anyone older than that is going to hate this.i don't know about the show these people were in but none of the actors are funny. None of the scenes or plots are funny, most are gross, lewd or sexually pointless.This is a movie for 15 year old boys. They'll love it!generally it's a sequence of unconnected events, really bad plot and dull stuff.now the cops that knock the main kid over and then pull a GUN on him? WHY? He has no reason to pull his weapon at all!These guys are having the worst night they could possibly have, so much going wrong for them, sidetracking them.Now the guy turning down not only a blow job but sex as well? Is he queer? So she's had a few drinks but he's still saying no, dude you are so GAY!That scene where their telling each other 'I love you', how homo-erotic is that? The film just gets so GAY there! Queers!Guys that age don't have that kind of relationship, not even if their THAT drunk!The ending is rubbish too, the film just tails off with no real finish.",1,41,84,20 September 2007
Hot Fuzz," Awful
","Have you seen Shaun Of The Dead? Yes? Then don't bother with this, it's pretty much a very similar film. They even copy the shortcut scene over the back gardens.Pegg plays Angel, a cop injured in a stabbing who is sent from London to the countryside as his arrest record is making the rest of the Met look bad.Angel starts as he means to go on, kicking all the kids out of the local pub and arresting what turns out to be his partner for drunk driving. Drunk driving isn't funny. And never will be. So that joke was always going to bomb.We're faced with stars like Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent really desperate for money? They must be to appear in this rubbish.Basically Frost & Pegg watched Bad Boys 2 (which is awful) and Point Break and decided to take all the best bits from both films (that must be all of about 3 seconds?) and put them in their movie.This clearly shows a very obvious fact 'We don't have any ideas of our own'.The film was rubbish, the action scenes were far too over the top and didn't help the pace of the film.This could have been so much better and the film was sold on Pegg and Frost. Not on what the script contained.",1,18,64,28 March 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pretty Weird
","OK, I'm going get this comment out of the way first.This film is far too long. By about 30 minutes. Several shots that lingered on one thing where nothing was happening several times could have been cut short (saving about 10 minutes right there) and the scene where Jack goes mad in the locker could have been cut completely as could the scene aboard the Dutchman where he's talking to his multiple selves and that would have made the movie half an hour shorter with no ill effects.The plot is pretty complicated, there's lots of betrayals and confusion and misdirection - all of which are resolved during the course of the overly long film. Keith Richard's cameo isn't all bad and quite fun in itself.I think the kids will fidget during the almost 3 hours of the film and you DO have to sit through the end credits to see the little bit of information at the end of the film.I do assume they'll make Pirates 4 where they are looking for the Fountain Of Youth with Jack and Barbossa.",5,0,2,27 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," pretty rubbish
","This film is being marked down harshly for it's need to re-write Spiderman 1.We saw who killed Uncle Ben.But suddenly the writer felt the need to invent a totally new person who had killed Uncle Ben, rewrote his already well established death and then have that person being a convicted criminal on the run. Wouldn't the very first place the police look be his old home? The open to the air particle accelerator was a laughable plot device too. He'd have been torn to pieces by the sand.Along with the really bad science that a carbon based life form can be transformed into a silicon based life form.The whole new Green Goblin angle was really poorly explored and the question of where the new Goblin gadgets came from wasn't answered.The feel to introduce a new love interest in Gwen was pretty pointless, even if it did mirror a scene from a previous movie. I personally always thought Venom was Spiderman taken over. Not this Brock person, whoever he was.The films set pieces are incredibly weak, ambling from big fight to big fight with no point or reason at all.The film is heavy on action and special effects but very low on story, plot and any attempt to further the Spiderman movie series.Watch with brain turned off.",1,7,12,6 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Actually not bad
","The film starts a lot like the original movie and for about 5 minutes it had me thinking I was watching that, until the nice twist and 2nd twist. Clearly someone had been watching a lot of zombie and End Of The World films as just about every cliché in the book from the 2 genres was used.From trying to domesticate zombies (Romero already did it more than 20 years ago), living in a radio station and traveling in convoy (Mad Max all over again, eh?) your not going to see much in this film you haven't seen elsewhere in the horror or sci-fi genre. Clones are nothing new, a hidden research center underground was best done in 'The Andromeda Strain'.Mila looks good in the film as she has in the previous 2, they kept a few of the cast back from part 2 but some are very obviously absent. the twist at the end of Resident Evil: Apocalypse doesn't seem to have been used much. There are a few nods back to it now and then and Alice seems to have developed telekinetic abilities as well from no-where (no idea if that was ever used in any of the games having only played 1 of them).There is a lovely old school nod in homage back to the Hitchcock classic 'The Birds' at one point during the movie.One scene doesn't quite ring true. Where their attacked by the zombies in the container in Las Vegas. Now this is a well co-ordinated group who have clearly survived and held their own for a good long time against the zombies. But here they are panicking, firing randomly, firing on automatic when ammunition is clearly in short supply. They would have been firing single shots, 1 shot = 1 kill with every round fired being a kill.The chap with the SA-80 (up on the Eiffel Tower) was happily firing away on automatic with no indication of having changed his magazine. And I can tell you for a fact they only hold 30 rounds having used one.The black guy who was infected days back when they cleared the motel took FAR too long to turn. Also the soldier had seen him get bitten in the hotel but didn't kill him then? Killing off the soldier (the only other character to have made it into this film) leaves Alice alone to fight against Umbrella and whatever is inside this hive.The ending of this is left very open for part 4 to be made, no doubt this will happen. Generally the film is a little too long to get going and would benefit from a cut of about 20 minutes (where the survivor caravan is established). The action in places is cut a bit too fast to be watchable but the film brings some new ideas to the Resident Evil franchise.",6,1,3,25 September 2007
The Terminator," Not Only Stolen from Harry Harrison
","Someone sent back from the future to the past by murderous robots intent on total domination to kill someone to make sure a future event happens but by going back in time they make that event happen.Try Doctor Who - Day Of The Daleks.That's basically the exact plot of that episode made in 1975. Why hasn't Terrance Dicks sued James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd as well? They stole his idea - BBC America may have been airing Dr Who and Cameron thought it was a good idea and stole it.Have a soldier trying to protect the woman who will be the mother of the man who leads the rebels against the robots. The Dr Who version is some terrorists try to assassinate a man who they think has started a war which lets the Daleks invade Earth dead easy.Another idea stolen from someone else. The film is the classic nightmare of being chased by someone trying to kill you but you don't know why. Elements of Frankenstein, the monster built and never rests and is almost impossible to stop in its mission.Why did no-one try a rocket launcher or a few grenades, or even a high power taser or anything to deliver an electric shock. Once the robot has taken a shot of EMF his CPU would be screwed. End of film. People never see the easy solution, do they?",7,1,3,29 June 2005
Cloverfield," I really wanted to like this film
","Seeing how many trailers ran for this before it's release I was already worried this film was going to be truly awful. Anything getting hyped that much normally is awful. The film is all shot on hand-held cameras which is an incredibly bad idea. If Blair Witch taught us anything, it was hand-held cameras in a movie look abysmal! And this movie is no different.It's incredibly slow to get started, with no action until your 20 minutes into the film & that's where they jump the shark. If your in a building & just experienced an earthquake then on a roof to see an explosion & running downstairs from falling fireballs the VERY last thing your going to do is carry on filming at eye-level from a hand-held camera. Your either going to drop it or lower it down to waist height to allow yourself to run faster.And thats the kind of basic rookie mistake that ruins films. The bad hand-held camera work was already doing that anyway but a stupid goof like that killed the film before it ever got started. The people photographing the head of The Statue Of Liberty are just WAY too calm. There would be absolute hysteria, people would be going mental! As far all the destroyed buildings & falling rubble? In a post 9/11 climate is a movie with these images really a good idea or just incredibly stupid. The latter I feel.Rob getting a call from Beth on his cell phone? Highly unlikely after that kind of city devastation, lines would be restricted to emergency calls only. The scene on The Brooklyn Bridge is not believable at all. No-one seems frightened. Even when the bridge collapses the camera guy turns around to film whats happening. No-one would do that, you'd be too busy running away or getting trampled in the panic.When we finally do see bits of the monster it's an incredibly cheap looking effect. Even 1970's Dr Who would have been embarrassed about that thing. It looked like it cost all of $10, if that. A very cheap rubbery monster. A cheap Godzilla rip-off.Rob's motivation for rescuing Beth is zero. They had a huge argument at the party and he was upset when she left. His mood towards her suddenly changing is incredibly suspect & a very POOR plot device. The soldiers they encountered, not 1 said get down (before they started firing), not 1 said turn back. It just wouldn't happen. The plausibility of the movie just gets less & less by the scene.You also have to question Hud not knocking Rob out by the time their in the subway. Even truly good friends would have punched his lights out by then. As for 'walking the tunnels'? If there's a light on the camera, why isn't Hud walking at the front so everyone behind him can see? As far as them being attacked by those creatures? The movie should have ended right there because they were outnumbered & should have all been killed.The way they just suddenly meet the soldiers is far too simple. Marlena dies (even though you never see anything, she's bleeding from her eyes then is taken behind a curtain where you see an explosion of blood so its safe to assume she's VERY dead).With Rob saying to the soldier 'If you want to stop me you'll have to shoot me', the soldier should have pulled out his gun and done us ALL a favour. Even after seeing Beth's building half knocked down Rob STILL thinks she's alive? I'm sorry but 1 of the 2 remaining friends would have actually knocked him out cold at that point.After pulling Beth off the spike, why wasn't she bleeding like crazy? Also the awful & incredibly predictable scare when the monster hits the helicopter? And they survive the crash? I think at this point in the movie they had run out of ideas & were just doing anything to kill time.Hud gets an excellent death (bitten in half by the monster) & then you get Rob & Beth talking to the camera, an explosion, rubble falling, Coney Island then nothing. No ending, no resolution? And to those who think they saw a splash in the sea at the end? It's a ship sailing from left to right, certainly nothing splashing into the sea like so many claims I've read. What an awful film. From start to lack of finish, utter garbage! Not recommended to anyone, ever.",1,27,40,27 April 2008
Ocean's Twelve," The Title is the 1st mistake
","Never at any time are there 12 people in the crew. Error 1. If they've taken the egg before it ever reached the museum then why is Tess ever sent for? Pointless. The French Thief is hit by at least 3 lasers and the alarm never goes off. Error 2. The Asian guy would have died in the bag. Big error, Error 3.Why didn't we get English subtitles every time he spoke, we'd like to know what he said. Why didn't Albert Finney or Bruce Willis get a credit in the film? The Entrapment pastiche is quite funny. I don't know why the film makers felt the need to bleep the guy in the music studio. Did the film really need a 12 rating?Quite a lot of the film is quite pointless. the set-up for the egg theft, the whole being in prison, being broken out.god the film is utter crap. watch the 1st one, it's much better.",1,1,2,11 January 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Woefully outdated & full of mistakes.
","When this was made, it was very much of it's time and quite accurate. With Reds under beds and paranoia at it's highest level until The Bay Of Pigs incident & The Cuban Missile Crisis, this movie fitted the time it was made. The height of The Cold War and neither side looked like backing down made this film what it was then.Sadly now with the fall of the USSR, Glasnost and the ACE treaty this could never happen. B-52's no longer circle in constant readiness having been superseded by ICBM's and even those are constantly being disarmed.The entire plot revolves around the idea that one rogue US General decides to start World War 3 all by himself by issuing irrevocable orders. This is of course ridiculous as the only thing required to stop the very slow Bombers is to scramble very fast Fighter jets after them and blow the Bombers out of the sky which would be done as soon as The Pengtagon found they were unable to communicate with the Bombers to recall them. They would willingly sacrifice their own Bombers rather than risk a full scale nuclear war.The 1st mistake is a General wouldn't command a Wing, it would be a Colonel. The US equivalent rank of Mandrake would be a Colonel. The 2nd mistake is General Ripper telling Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellars) to implement Plan R for Robert (when he should say Romeo and an officer of his experience should have known that). Mandrake should have refused to follow the order for that reason alone (Incorrect procedure). Fortunately the actors in the plane do NOT make the same mistake.Likewise General Turgison's phone conversation with Colonel Puntridge is a mistake as it would never take place over an insecure line with the topic they are discussing. Ripper's tannoy to the base is also incorrect (no matter what, he would never say 'Commie' over a tannoy, he'd more likely say 'The Enemy').Mandrake soon finds out there is no state of war by listening to his own radio and goes to see what's happening. Kong's message over the flight intercom telling all the men about the radio frequency is wrong. Each man has those orders printed in front of him and would know that frequency from them, him telling them over the intercom risks that frequency being overheard. Likewise he would not give the target over the frequency or warhead yield for the same reason.The Plan R they discuss in the war room is now an outdated concept since the introduction of ICBM's as they are programmed to fire without human operators to give MAD (mutally assured destruction). An Army Unit is ordered to take Ripper's base and put him in contact with the War Room, the base troops of course think anyone attacking are Russians in disguise because of what Ripper told them (another ridiculous idea).The Russians reveal their Doomsday machine and it is explained to the US President (Peter Sellars) by Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellars). In the shots where Rippers office is being shot at there are several times where Ripper should be hit and killed. After his men surrender, Ripper shoots himself to make sure the recall codes can't be found and the Bombers can't be bought back. Now, if the missile that was fired at Kong's B-52 was a nuke, it would have been unable to finish it's mission once it detonated (even though it didn't actually hit them). The EMP would have destroyed all the on-board electronics forcing the B-52 to land. This destroys the radio and the B-52 can now no longer communicate with the outside world (the pilot should have immediately stood down from his mission).The B-52 Navigator is played by James Earl Jones in his 1st ever movie role. The recall code is given (having been worked out by Mandrake from a note on Ripper's desk) and acknowledged by 30 planes and with 4 shot down all planes are accounted for until The Russians admit 1 plane may have only been damaged (Kong's B-52). When they discover they don't have enough fuel to even hit their primary target, Kong's B-52 should turn back but Kong is determined to hit any target no matter what and diverts to an ICBM complex at Kodlos (now if The Russians were using ICBM's what was the point of the Americans using B-52's which were much slower?). A really huge mistake is Kong ordering an air-burst attack but then setting detonation altitude at zero feet (or ground level, so hardly an air-burst!).On finding the bomb doors have failed Kong has yet ANOTHER reason to to stand down (especially after both manual opening fails and explosive opening fails) but doesn't. By refusing to stand down by this point Kong far exceeded any field authority he had as Captain. His co-pilot, navigator and bombardier should have all ordered him to stand down and in fact relieved him of his command for refusing to do so.Now without this film Dark Star would not exist and Alien would have never been made.The height the bomb was dropped from it would never have time to arm itself. The ending of discussing how to continue life in mine shafts (there must have been a huge section cut where they said the Doomsday Device went off) and the shots of all the nuclear bombs is a very weak ending indeed in a generally bad film which isn't funny and hasn't stood the passage of time well at all.",6,5,20,21 October 2007
Blades of Glory," Almost but not quite
","They almost made a bearable Will Ferrall film. Almost, but not quite.Take 2 male skaters who fall from glory and eventually team up, settle their differences to become the 1st all Male figure skating couple.Watch them try to work together. A few laughs which actually are funny but most of the jokes are pretty rubbish.If your skating fan then your bound to recognise lots of people in this film (and will have no clue who the hell they are if, like me you aren't a skating fan) but I think skating fans will truly hate this.Ferrall actually manages to make himself bearable for 90% of this film. Jon Heder, better known as Napoleon Dynamite brings nothing to his role and is there on name value alone. He plays the role sounding and acting like Napoleon Dynamite. He could have at least tried to change his voice a little. Ferrall plays the same role he's played in every movie he's ever been in but has obviously been reigned in by either the writer, producer or director as he isn't as much of an asshole or idiot as he usually is and he actually managed to make me laugh (once, during the entire film).The film isn't really all that funny, it's a case of disengage brain and watch. Forget the fact that 2 men would never be allowed to compete like this, forget that they would most likely have to qualify to even appear in their 1st event that got them to the winter sport games.The ending (where they fly out of the arena) totally ruined the entire film, making a mildly bearable film totally ridiculous.Will Ferrall fans will love it.",2,1,2,15 April 2007

Elf," better than most of Ferrel's films
","I'll start by saying I can't personally stand Will Ferrel and usually don't like his movies. I don't find him funny and I don't normally find any humour or anything to laugh at in his films.This is a rare exception. It's a Christmas movie and I'm reviewing it having seen it on TV at the weekend.This movie is in the same kind of genre as Dudley Moore's 'The Santa Clause Movie' and Tim Allen's 'The Santa Clause'. Ferrel plays Buddy, a baby who crawls into Santa's sack one year when he's delivering gifts to an orphanage. Sadly the film derails itself right there as a baby manages to open a locked cot and fall safely from 2 feet up without making a sound.Ignoring that (and we must, unfortunately) the baby is only discovered when Santa returns to the North Pole workshop and is adopted and raised as an Elf. Eventually he discovers he is human and sets off to discover his real father (James Caan, not suited to comedy or kids films which this is really).The film follows Buddy as he tries to fit into Human culture and how badly he is suited to that task having been raised in the Elf culture. The film is decent enough and is greatly improved by Buddy's love interest Zooey Deschanel (who I only knew from the Hitch Hikers Move and had the feeling that Reese Witherspoon turned this role down).She looks great and plays her role well enough. James Caan has some good moments but really isn't suited to this type of movie.The locations and sets are very good, there's a small appearance from KG (of Tenacious D fame) as a creative writer and the role of Caan's wife (Mary Steenburgen) could have been cast a lot better as she really isn't suited to this type of film either so both her and James Caan were very badly miscast.The film is mildly bearable with the brain disengaged, even Ferrel manages to not annoy for a change.OK for kids.",6,2,2,5 December 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," pretty poor
","this is basically the same actors from the previous 2 movies with a new target, this time their robbing Al Pacino.most of the movie is spent laying all the background information as to how the various parts of the heist will go down and not much is kept back for the end to surprise you apart from the diamond robbery.Brad Pitt was obviously busy elsewhere as he has almost no screen time, Clooney and Damon get more on-screen time than Pitt. Or at least it seemed that way to me.Eddie Izzard provides a few scenes of relief from the various Hollywood egos but the movie is pretty rubbish, thin on plot but heavy on visuals.The worst of the trilogy so far to be honest.",2,1,2,18 June 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," not very good
","Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep make this film bearable.it's almost like trying to watch an overly long episode of 'Ugly Betty'. I don't care if this is based on a book, they totally stole the idea for the film and the book from Ugly Betty.Hathaway is far too pretty to be playing a girl being called 'fat' or unattractive. I'm a man, I have eyes, she's stunning. And nothing Meryl Streep says is going to make me think otherwise.I feel Streep was only cast in this after seeing Glen Close play Cruella DeVille.You can see how the plot is going to play out from a mile away and it's far too predictable.Good for Anne Hathaway fans only.",3,0,1,28 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Best Film Ever Made
","George Lucas has drawn a line in the sand and DARED other film makers to cross it.All the complaints we directed at Phantom Menace were heeded and have culminated into simply the best movie I have EVER seen. So much is waved in our faces as temptation, Jedi Battles, A young Boba Fett, Luke's Aunt and Uncle as they were, and some excellent Jedi and Sith Powers used and well displayed.If you don't see this film at the cinema then you HAVEN'T seen it.It needs the large screen and THX to appreciate the nuances.  This is a film that will require at least 3 viewings to take it all in. I forgive George for allowing Jar Jar Binks to return, but if a Jedi falls over 1000 feet he'd leave a big hole in a spaceship when he hit it or rip his arms out trying to catch hold of it, OK?  This mistake and the fact that the film is a little too long do not detract from it's sheer beauty. Christopher Lee, you are a GOD in this, perfection personified.  ILM have raised the bar with the most mind blowing special effects.  The pieces are finally starting to fall into place and the big picture is becoming clearer.This one's gonna run and run.Loved it George, Now do the same with part 3. And reconsider making the 3 films after Return Of The Jedi please?",Null,0,1,16 May 2002
Corpse Bride," looks stunning
","Another excellent film by Tim Burton more than making up for his Planet Of The Apes fiasco! So many signature Burton moments, Victoria's striped dress which looked like it was made from the same cloth as Beetlejuice's suit. The standard Danny Elfman musical set pieces.Johnny Depp is himself and his puppet looks like a cross between him and Burton himself. Burton has obviously only ever seen Joanna Lumley in Ab Fab or James & The Giant Peach as this is how her puppet looks. Nothing like the stunning beauty Joanna actually is.The plot is sadly thin in lots of places. The whole 'Til death us do part' thing. Victor only needs to say 'I was practicing my vows and there was no priest there so we're not married' as a simple explanation and he's out of trouble.The old skeletons loft looks a lot like The Scientists house in Edward Scissorhands, and I think the reference to Vincent is more likely to be to Vincent Price in Edward Scissorhands.I love the look of the film and will no doubt watch it again to spot things I previously missed. The whole Alfred Hitchcock homage to The Birds (or it's possibly a homage to The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe).A few of the musical numbers went on too long, some of them felt too tacked on as after thoughts, but the movie was lovely to watch. A little too long, I'd have chopped about 15 mins from the running time, it's not for kids as they'd start to fidget very quickly as the film takes it's time getting to certain places.All in all, Tim Burton has redeemed himself.",8,1,2,21 February 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Not very good actually
","Yes, it looks pretty. Yes, it's got a ton of action (sadly 90% of it is highly questionable in it's realism). Yes, it ties up loose ends.If your thinking of going to see this film then watch parts 1 & 2 before you go. You'll understand this film better. This film on it's own doesn't bear well to scrutiny as a stand-alone movie.Once again we're following spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, still looking 12 years old in certain scenes). He seems to be having flashbacks about who he really is (come on, be honest - do we really care?) and the memories seem to be coming back in floods.Such is the premise of the film and what I laughingly refer as 'the plot' is wafer thin.Anyway the CIA are wandering around the world,waving guns in the street without ever getting shot by the local police forces (I think the scene of them getting arrested in Turin should have turned into a shoot-out as they'd already been told shots were fired). A case of Hollywood saying we (Americans) rule the world and can do what we like anywhere on the planet.Get stuffed, you'd be killed by the local police if there were even an iota of realism in this film. Especially in London.Anyway, Bourne happily roves around the world (never being caught at any borders, despite the fact the CIA are looking for him. And just HOW did he even get into America?), a passport of his is noticed as he enters Morocco (HOW? The agent very clearly says it had NEVER been on the grid so how did they catch it?).He is even stupid enough to contact the CIA and mental enough to enter the building (how DID he manage that, by the way?) to rob some documents to allow him to work out the final bits in his identity mystery.The film rolls from action sequence to lull to action sequence . The music is the main factor in keeping suspense and interest.Generally the film is quite bad. Best avoided I think, hopefully it will be the last Bourne film.",4,11,21,21 August 2007
The Aviator," Take a pillow
","You'd better take a pillow. This film is so dull it's unreal. It goes from bore to bore. Yes, we knew Howard Hughes was a recluse. So they blame it all on his mother, very Freudian. The descent into madness is very quick, the whole 'hygiene' plot isn't very well explained at all. I was just bored almost all the time. Even the plane sequences weren't particularly inspiring. basically it's the story of a rich kid left money by his parents and he decides to use it to make films and build planes. More power to him I say. I'd have liked to have seen more of Howard's life explored instead of just concentrating on the Hollywood bit. Jane Russell and Jean Harlow (played by the stunning Gwen Stefani who really looked amazing on screen) could have been used a lot more. Leonardo Di Caprio isn't very watchable at all as Howard Hughes, i think they hired him so the woman would flock in for his nude scenes. A very very very very very very very BORING film. Go see something else.",1,9,18,27 May 2005
Watchmen," Too long and badly cut
","Like Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy and Alien 3 this film was in development hell for a very long time before an extended legal battle finally allowed its appearance on the silver screen. It may had made millions in both the US and UK box offices already but its still not a very good movie.Based on an extremely obscure cult comic book series set in a parallel universe it catalogues the lives of a set of retired super heroes on a world where vigilante super heroes have now been outlawed after 40 years of service to their countries and their planet. Now someone is hunting them down and kills one then frames another for murder, the US is on the brink of Nuclear war with Russia (the movie is set in 1985 where Richard Nixon is serving his 3rd term in office) and the nuclear clock is set at 5 minutes to midnight.The movie constantly moves forwards and backwards in time with no thought given to anyone who has never read the comics or knows nothing about The Watchmen, characters aren't explained very well and one in particular is made to seem very ambiguous about not being a very good person (The Comedian who I actually thought was being played by Robert Downey Jr) as we see him assassinate JFK and help end the Vietnam war, he is also seen to kill American civilians in the 1970's civil unrest race riots and appears to be enjoying his work far too much.With the constant movement in time you are never exactly sure who is who and what is going on, characters aren't given the chance to develop on screen much and your going to spend almost all of the over 2 and a half hours of the movies duration being extremely confused.Confused and bored, as the very poorly explained plot (what little there actually is of it) is interspersed with fast action sequences almost immediately followed with long drawn out scenes full of very dull dialogue. Its very badly paced indeed, no thought seems to have given to how the movie should play out and it also seems to have not been cut at all. You get the feeling that what you are watching is everything the director filmed and nothing has been left on the cutting room floor.The film does show characters like Dr Manhatten (at least you see how he gets his powers) developing a clean alternative to nuclear power & fossil fuels much to the chagrin of various captains of industry, this project is being funded and assisted by the 1st super heroes to ever reveal his real identity Adrian Veidt formerly known as Ozymandias.The film has a few twists and turns which will catch non comic book fans off guard and ends with Russia & America uniting against a common enemy. I wont reveal who that is or any of the twists but if you can follow the film for any longer than 5 minutes at a time then your doing a lot better than I was.The special effects are amazing but considering the films budget was $150 million they darn well should be, sadly it seems all the money was squandered on effects and nothing went on a decent script or hiring someone to adapt the comic books to a format that the non comic book geek could easily understand.Terry Gilliam said it best when he stated the idea of making Watchmen 'was unfilmable' and that by 'Reducing the story to a two or two-and-a-half hour film seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about.'. When someone who made great almost unimaginable movies like 12 Monkeys, Brazil & Baron Munchausen tells you your concept is 'unfilmable' then you should really listen to him.Watchmen is a visual spectacle that is too long, badly cut, very badly paced & very badly adapted. More could be been done with Rorschachs narration which could have been utilised to explain the characters much better, also to have dropped the original Minutemen from the movie completely as their appearance just confuses the viewer as to who you are watching.I guess if the movie is watched with brain disengaged most viewers will enjoy it on the action and effects alone but will get bored during the quiet moments and start to fidget way before it gets anywhere close to the closing titles. Cutting about 45 minutes out of the film would vastly improve its watchability and pacing, in its current form the nicest thing I can say is that it is bearable but only just. Personally I was left wishing for movies like Howard The Duck & Masters Of The Universe, thats how little I enjoyed this film.",1,20,38,26 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," How sad
","Peter Jackson clearly never bothered doing any research about turning long books into films before he started this.If he did he'd know that the original cut of Dune lasted 8 hours for just 1 book.The Fellowship Of The Rings is over 5000 pages long (I should know, I've read all 3 books).The film is far too long by half, I'd have used a narrator to improve pacing across the whole film. The film generally looks very good apart from certain places where the green or blue screen and CGI really show very badly (places like Isengard when they are making the Orc Army and The Moria Mines when they are being chased by the Orcs, it reminded me of a section of the game Serious Sam).The film goes no-where slowly and they could have subtitled all the Elvish to help people or just had them speak in plain English.This film is very over-rated. I really didn't enjoy it.",3,0,4,7 November 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," Worst of the trilogy
","Picking up where the last movie left off (meaning this film is of no use to viewers as a stand-alone movie by expecting you to see its predecessor) we pick up with Trinity watching over the injured Neo and our recently discovered survivor who we know from the previous movie is inhabited by Agent Smith.Of the 3 films this 1 is unique because it doesn't start with a Trinity action sequence like the other 2 did.1 of the themes explored in this movie is the idea of artificial intelligence, computers or programs able to comprehend human emotions and concepts much like the family of Programs that Neo meets in the station that exists as a transit point between The Matrix & the machine world.The 1st hugely bad idea in the film is the coat check scene. This has really already been fully explored in the original movie when Neo & Trinity rescued Morpheus so this wasn't something we hadn't already seen. It also very closely mirrors going to find The Keymaker from the 2nd film so it's not like it hadn't been seen just once.Once the film hits the 30 to 40 minute mark it really starts to drag its feet with the preparations for the war on Zion. It seems like at this point in the film they just ran out of ideas and decided to just drag scenes out for as long as possible whether they contributed to the plot or not regardless of how it effected the pacing of the movie in general.Neo is incredibly stupid as are all the freed Zionites who have ever seen or spoken to Agent Smith. None of them recognise Smith's voice from the guy he took over inside The Matrix.The Mech's defending Zion aren't anything new (Almost certainly stolen from Quake 2 or RobotJox, depending on your frame of reference). Their defence strategy is laughably American, shoot as many bullets as you possibly can in the hope of hitting something. (Clearly not a good idea when Zion obviously has limited resources?). I also didn't understand why they weren't using EMP weapons which would have been the quickest and best defence against electronic creatures like the squids. Zion had already shown they HAD EMP technology in film 1 (destroying the squid that boarded the Neb).Now clearly they DO have EMP weapons as their using them to defend Gate 3 and the guys reloading the Mech's so why the hell weren't the Mech's fitted with them? It is obvious Trinity will die, really she has to for Neo to be able to truly destroy The Matrix and save Zion. Without the pain of her death he would never have enough power.I did wonder exactly how he was going to get back into The Matrix without anyone to jack him in but they solved that quite nice with the machine intelligence doing it for him, leading of course to the final battle with all the Smith Clones.Yes, it's ridiculously over the top and far too over done and goes on for too long. I assume by allowing Smith to infect him Neo then has the ability to control all the Smith clones and destroy them which in turns destroys the entire Matrix as Smith has become so many people in The Matrix.In actuality by destroying all the Smiths Neo has simply reset The Matrix into its 7th incarnation. This is an incredibly weak and poorly explained ending which could have been done much better. as the ending of a trilogy this is not a good movie. It is not a good movie in its own right either.The best of the trilogy as in most cases was the original. The 2nd and 3rd films really aren't worth bothering with.",4,1,3,22 February 2008
28 Weeks Later," oh dear, not again
","forget anything that happened in the original film because it won't be relevant to this one.Robert Carlisle is rubbish in this. But he's not to blame for the awful script and filming.this film suffers from all the problems the original did.far too much filming in the dark or in low light where you can't see anything happening.far too many fast cuts from shot to shot.the fact that we're dropped into an attack right at the start and then shown the progress of the disease dying out in Britain, people being introduced back by American forces.1st goof is the plane that lands at London Airport but disembarks at Heathrow, miles away.Bob Carlise's kids are brought back to live with him and they stupidly decide to go to their old house to find a picture of their mother despite the fact they have been warned how dangerous this is.I was surprised they weren't shot and killed as they were detected on the bridge (oh, and the person who thought that tourist boat was a goof? It could have quite easily been a NATO Patrol Boat).Ignore the fact that their mother survived the attack at the cottage AND made it back to their own home in London.It's obvious someone's going to get infected when we find out the wife is a carrier (her room wasn't constantly guarded from the outside, I think thats a pretty huge goof right there) and poor old Bob is that person.One of the best goofs is the radio message authorising the use of Non-Lethal Force. So they can't kill anyone there then.I'm sure he got blood on his sons face in the underground car park and the son definitely did get blood on him from another infected when they were all getting shot.I still can't work out exactly how the son escaped that either. The fact that he 'manages' to find his sister and the friendly Doctor in all that confusion was a bit too much to believe.Most of this film is too dark to actually see what's going on, adding to the confusion of what little awful plot is still left. Especially the sequences where they run from the sniper whilst trying to meet the chopper in Regents Park.The fact that the area gets bombed and then there's the really pointless and stupid radio message authorising the use of Chemical weapons really kicks hard at the American Military and their love of overkill.The chopper pilot saying he's going to be with them in 60 seconds, well, i'm sorry but that's utter tripe as they'd already be able to hear him coming towards them.A huge point is don't the infected ever get tired? Or are unaffected by lactic acid build-up in the muscles that occurs when you run? Not even world class sprinters can run that fast for extended periods. They'd get tired, get muscle fatigue.I'm not exactly sure what the white smoke was supposed to be but they wouldn't have been much safer inside that car they took shelter in as it wouldn't be airtight. Possibly it was some sort of chemical agent as they had authorised the use of chemical weapons earlier on in the movie.The delta force guy saying he'll meet them at the stadium. Er, which stadium? Did we miss a whole scene or something? he'd asked for an extract but never did anyone say where that next extract actually was.It was pretty laughable that they expected us to believe a Volvo estate could outrun a military helicopter shooting at it. And then annoying us even more by going into the underground to have yet another excuse to film somewhere dark and meaning we can't watch the film again.I don't understand why the woman with the night-sight wasn't leading the way (which would have been the most sensible thing) instead of trying to guide the 2 kids.Once the infected guy attacked them after they had fallen over in the dark and lost each other they may as well have ended the film right there because he was going to have killed all 3 of them anyway.It was too hard to believe the boy would have managed to wander off so far away from the girl and the Doctor (he didn't hear them shouting his name, he didn't hear the doctor screaming as she was being attacked, he didn't think to start shouting their names the second he lost contact with them both?).To suddenly show infected Bob Carlise still alive (unlikely, he'd have been killed in the bombing) and then equally as suddenly introduce a gun to kill him (if the doctor had a gun why didn't SHE use it to defend herself a few scenes earlier?) made the film really really stupid.By this time, anyone with even 1 braincell wouldn't be willing to suspend belief any further. You now have to wonder if the people who made this actually set out to insult the viewers intelligence on purpose.When he asks 'am I one of them' she blatantly lies to him and even as a 12 year old he's got to know she's lying and he's infected.Another good goof is them getting Wembley Stadium wrong, and using the new one and not trying to digitally insert the old stadium. Clearly the pilot saw the blood on both the kids but took them anyway (I think he'd have shot them).The predictable ending of them infecting France and leaving it opening for another sequel shows how pointless this whole film was.Best Avoided like the plague.",1,19,38,18 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Incredibly DULL!
","I've not seen the original so I won't be comparing this to that, OK? Apart from the minor scare and the guy killing the 2 scientists at the start this is really boring for a very VERY long time. The travellers dog gets killed (we see nothing apart from it's body) and then not much happens. We're almost 40 mins into the film where their truck is sabotaged by the hill people (they use a stinger on it) and then lots of not much happens.The dad of the family walks back to the truck stop and the son-in-law finds a vehicle graveyard in a crater (and really should have sussed what was happening by then, it's totally obvious). The truck stop owner kills himself and the dad of the family is caught by the hill people and things actually finally start to happen.The son-in-law returns to the camper and the families second dog is taken (which should make them really suspicious but doesn't?).There's a major goof where one of the hill people gets into the trailer (we clearly saw the people LOCK it from the inside, so I'm sorry but NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!). Even after they set fire to the dad to distract the others away from the camper (like it needs 3 people to go check out a fire) not much happens.The hill people trash the trailer, they 'rape' one of the girls (even though you see nothing - it's implied) and finally someone goes back to check on the screaming. Was that Hill guy breastfeeding off that girl? That child looked a little bit too old to still be breastfeeding so I think they got that very wrong.Mum of the family is shot, the girl he breastfed off is shot and killed. Still not really a lot happening. If it's a suspense thriller then it's really heavy on suspense and very light on thrills.Amazingly mum isn't dead from being shot at such close range by a Magnum. One of the hill people loses an arm and the 2nd dog comes back alive and unharmed and the remaining campers find a radio the hill people were using.Come the dawn the son-in-law takes the dog to search for his abducted baby which the hill people took during the night raid. The brother and sister of the family set up tripwires to protect themselves by the camper and the son-in-law finds the old miners town camp.Even when the son in law is caught in the house by the hill people there's lots of talking and not much action. Even during a fight sequence which Wes Craven probably thought was action.When the boy follows the blood trail, he has ample time to pull his gun and kill the guy eating his sister but he chooses to fire wildly behind him, wasting his rounds like an idiot.The fake scare after the son in law had shot the last hill guy in the chest, throat and body and then he got up (so Ruby had to push him over the cliff) was too much to take seriously. Also that the guy in the camper had survived the huge gas explosion too.Obscenely dull for a horror/action film and had me reaching for fast forward far too often.",1,2,4,18 April 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," truly, truly dire.
","It gets a 4 for the special effects only! This film starts by making basic mistakes and then progresses to bigger and bigger howlers.Let's see. Mistake number 1. The T-X. Right well X = 10. The last bad guy was a T1000. So she's a lower rated model than him then ? Any wonder when she materializes in the window of a clothes shop she ignores the abundance of clothes around her. Also it looks like she's in Rodeo Drive. And she still can't see clothes so she has to rob someone? And the person she robs just happens to be her exact size? Odds of that? Not really going to happen is it? Then the next mistake. She's looking for the lieutenants. So she accesses school records by phone (as these are supposed to be secure under the Data Protection Act it'd be unlikely their kept on a server that has dial-up access.)Then to compound that mistake she manages to locate where they work from their High School records? Wouldn't it have been easier for them to have had her accessing the IRS or DMV records. DMV as they would have a more recent picture than their high school, then IRS as it'd show where their paying income tax.She identifies Jose with a badge id and she scans his eye. Why? Like his High School records had retina information on them? No, I truly think not. Then she shoots him 4 times. The most advanced model can't kill with 1 shot from 5 feet? She must be an older model then.Then Arnie can't decide which model his robot is. Is he a T101 or a T800? Make your mind up Arnold! Also why John avoids the deer, he's an idiot. Why hurt yourself, at that speed you would have barely wobbled when you hit the deer.He seems to get a ride OK, but you'd think anyone giving him a ride would take him to a hospital. He could give a fake name and address, pay for his treatment in cash. He wouldn't appear on the grid by doing that. Another overlooked mistake.So why does the logic driven T-X go to Kate's work address at 5am? Like she's going to be working at that time in the morning. Really logical, isn't it! And again when she kills the cat lady, she fires 5 or 6 shots. An advanced killing machine that can't kill with 1 bullet? Even when Arnie said in the last film he had detailed files on human anatomy.The next chase sequence where the sun seems to rise very fast is lifted wholesale from Terminator 2. It's far too similar, showing lack of creativity. Having the Doctor from Terminator 1 & 2 shows a nice bit of continuity.And the T-X killing Kate's boyfriend is just like the T1000 killing John's foster parents. Not a new idea. I had to double take and think when I saw the T-X dressed as Kate (she pulls her out of the truck near the start, that's when she touches her. Where she could have easily killed her as well). Also the fact that this multi-million dollar US Government secure installation, Kate gets into a seemingly very high security area so easily? I think not.And that they don't seem to have any bespoke Anti-virus software or any contingency plans for a virus or a system collapse? Like a back-up system, or the ability to kill all operations without using Skynet? Give me a break!The whole magnet thing was utter garbage. If the T-X was being subjected to high levels of magnetism she'd shut down. Computers and chips don't like magnets! And how did Arnie get to the surface without passing the magnet? Wouldn't the T-X use a safer route as well as she's a newer model (just another indication that she isn't the latest model).Also why Kate isn't starting up the plane as John is clearing everything from the ground. The World's about to end and their on a dead-line and she's taking her time, why? I'll assume the T-X learns where they are going from Arnie's memory when she re-programs him. Now he's in the helicopter with her so why he doesn't try and blow her up while their in flight? And she found a helicopter already with fuel in it? The end of the film is pretty dire. Skynet has gotten itself into computers so there's no core. No Big deal. It just started a Nuclear War! When bombs drop you get EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) That fries computers. The only systems that would then hold Skynet would be in the bunkers where the humans are hiding. All that means is they yank their power for a few vital seconds and then the only place Skynet could still be, is in the satellites.No worries. Just never build anything that uses those frequencies or fire a few missiles into space at them. Or get whoever is in the International Space Station to shut them down. Then NO Skynet.That's the biggest mistake of the film, none of the writers seem to know what would happen to computers and databases after a nuclear attack. Piece of cake. The so-called 'inevitable' has just been derailed by me very easily. In a matter of moments, because I bothered to use my brain.Nick Stahl was rubbish. Arnie was fair to middling. Kristina Lokken was awful. Clare Danes was utterly awful. This film could have been so much better. Shame it wasn't.Hopefully the script writers read these reviews? Learn about EMP boys?",4,0,2,7 November 2005
Over the Hedge," weird in a weird way
","it gets 4 for the characters only. the plot is little to non-existent. a raccoon steals a bears food, destroys it by accident and then is told to replace it all or die. he then takes advantage of a bunch of innocent critters to help him rob food from a newly developed estate.stop right there.the hedge itself looks like its been there for at least 10 yrs. not just 1 winter. a housing estate that big would have taken several yrs to build as well so how long were these animals hibernating for?the characters are voiced pretty well apart from the humans and the plot (what there actually is of it) ambles from place to place very slowly.really this is only film for very young kids who will watch it on the visuals alone. if this was based on a comic strip then it suffered very badly in the translation to movie, as clearly its a comic strip where nothing ever happens and takes a long time to not happen.avoid.",4,1,1,20 January 2007
Wanted," Very weak!
","Suspend all disbelief. There's not a single element of realism in this movie & it's a very sad attempt to try & make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasn't strong enough.I'd normally class Morgan Freeman & Angelina Jolie as a good cast but sadly they've got awful roles. The script itself is truly dire, based on a comic I've never read or heard of ever.Basically we're in a world of superhero assassins where their abilities are right out of The Matrix. The film borrows heavily from things like Bulletproof Monk (I don't actually think there's a single original idea in the whole movie) and viewers are expecting to suspend way too much belief.The film has too much action (yes, you read that right! Too much!) and suffers in the same way Bad Boys 2 did, just having action scenes for the sake of it because there was no plot or script to follow so they'd just engineer an action sequence for no reason at all than seeing the hero or the other assassins use their magical powers.We're following Wesley Gibson, a nobody who is dragged into the world of the assassins and trains to become one to kill the man who killed his father. Except thats not the case, the man he kills IS his father and the guy in charge of the assassins (Morgan Freeman in possibly his worst movie role ever) has started to create targets for his own profit.The film is truly awful, ignore the plot because it's nonexistent. Enjoy looking at Fox (Angelina Jolie) until she decides to kill herself near the end of the film. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused & his character could have done much more.If you can ignore the ridiculous special effects, CGI and over the top action sequences then you might get a bit of pleasure from watching this. Personally I hated it and if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the best bits of the movie as it really doesn't get any better than the trailer.",1,234,386,2 July 2008
Save the Last Dance," basically break-dance for the millennium
","girl moves to big city. rough neighborhood. with the emphasis on the Hood part. moves to a school where being white is being a minority. hooks up with the local fly girls who take her to the street clubs. then one girls brother wants her to dance. basically then the plot of break-dance takes over.black boy wants to make good and be a doctor. she wants to regain her dream of being a ballet dancer.the lead girl isn't much on acting.basically i don't like this film, nothing worse than seeing a film where it's pretty much already been done before and they just fiddled with the plot a tad to bring it into a modern day context.Oh, and the scenes of the black guy watching her practice ballet, not likely. her teacher would either never let him in the room or kick him out in seconds and it'd probably have earned her a pass to the street. most dance classes hate having people watch who aren't taking part. also it'd be unlikely for Sarah to be out doing club dancing before an audition for fear of getting hurt or pulling something. ballet dancers become obsessed with things like that, not getting hurt.the 'oil and milk don't mix' comment was a bit unneeded. plus you know when she invites him in the house and puts on true colors they are going to have a really unnecessary sex scene. and a rubbish soft focus badly cut one at thatthe basketball game? no way. Sarah is due to have an audition, firstly she wouldn't even want to be doing sports. let alone fighting with someone. in the hospital the black kids look at Sarah as though they've never seen a white person.also far too many of the black characters are given very bad attitudes about themselves and their relationships to white people. I'd be interested to know what the ethnic origin of the films writer and producer were on this film.and Derek doing a 'your mother' comment during his argument with Sarah? How biased was that?and why the hell is Sarah training for ballet audition with Derek anyway? How the hell can he help her in any way, shape or form?When Derek is asked if he'll help his friend to take revenge it's obvious someone is going to get hurt when that happens and it's more likely to be Derek, the smart black guy who wants to be a Doctor.Sarah's dad is poorly written with little to do and say but there to make her seem more vulnerable.An annoying line that gets used to often is 'Why you tripping on that'. What the hell does it even mean. Oh, and bull-crap way Mordecai's car blew up when it got shot? NOT going to happen, it's really hard to shoot a petrol tank.even the grooving judges was stolen wholesale from the end of break-dance, and it would have been unlikely that the audition judges would have given Sarah a second chance to do her contemporary dance for a place like Juliard.",2,10,18,17 June 2006

Jarhead," Worked well until the final scene let it down!
","The film looks good. Yes, it's relatively realistic. The only unrealistic scenes are :- The marines getting shot by the A-10's.As memory serves me (and I was involved in Live Operations so I know what I'm talking about) only The British were shot at and killed by A-10's. Don't bother asking why this happened. About 100 people know and it's so classified it'll never be talked about.How Swoff isn't shipped out on a section 8 after he tries to kill the guy in their tent, God alone knows.Also the final scene where Swoff is bitching because he never fired his weapon and then they all started firing wildly into the sky. Even Jamie Foxx who is supposed to be in charge of discipline.Only a few scenes before Swoff had spoken about what would happen if he shot someone. He'd get done for negligent discharge (known as ND's) and then spend time in the stockade. Well, if the US do the same as the British do, you get billed for every round. About £400 (GB £'s) a round circa 1996.In that scene Jamie Foxx should be jumping on their skulls and telling them he'll shoot the next man to waste a round. If this was based on a real event I do hope the US military billed them all. This would have cost them thousands.I can't see the point of letting soldiers about to go to war watch Apocalypse Now. And sending a man in combat a copy of The Deer Hunter. Quite funny when it turns out to be a revenge sex tape from his wife!Swoff states his war lasted 4 days. Which Gulf war was he in then? The 1st Gulf War (and I was involved, so personally I think he's full of bull) lasted just over 2 weeks.The ending is weak, no explanation of why his friend died or what Swoff goes on to do next.Not a bad film but the ending needs work.

Ratatouille," actually quite good
","have you seen flushed away? yes, and so has the plot stealing idea thief named Brad Bird.Take a rat who wants to become a chef.

Although this young man IS NOT voiced by David Schwimmer, it may as well have been because he sounded EXACTLY like him.The plot is fairless harmless and the film is quite enjoyable if your turn off your brain.

Alien vs. Predator," This time, the director doesn't understand the film!
","WARNING! DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS! Oh dear! for a movie that lived in limbo hell and went through so many scripts and directors this really didn't manage to hit the spot. The director clearly didn't understand the Predator mindset, did he? Had he seen predator 1 & 2 or played Aliens Versus Predator 1 or 2? I think not in all cases. Predators are about hunting for honour. When the chap @ the bottom of the shaft whose freezing to death is casually killed, where's the glory or honour in that kill? There is none!Does the director understand Predator technology, again that's a no. The Predators view humans on heat vision yet they see the shoulder cannons? WHY? These are technology and would be seen on electric view or normal view only, idiot! The director might have known that if he'd played the game. Also, how destruction proof is that Pyramid? If it was blown up by 100 years before by a predator nuke, how is it so intact? Are the film characters totally insane? Millar must be. He kills a facehugger with 1 bullet then wastes 5 more making sure. Why does the main girl pull herself onto a ledge where an alien just was, even if she is hanging over a chasm? From certain death into certain death? Why when the 1st alien is speared by the girl does it not attack with it's arms at all? Why when the predator cuts the aliens head off his knife doesn't melt? Likewise with blades of spinner on facehugger? How come Millar seems to lose his Scottish accent just before he dies? The Queen is bitten multiple times but is fit to go on a rampage? HOW THE HELL does the Queen escape the bomb at all? Why are there so many Aliens? Only 8 people are facehugged! When the bomb is detonated how come there seem to be about 20 aliens in the main chamber as they board the sled? Clearly this film was not researched at all. Aliens and Predator fans will be picking holes in it for years to come. As for the pred-alien at the end? We'll be lucky to see a sequel I think, seeing as how long it took to get this movie on the screen. In the end, the jury is out, everyone must judge the film for themselves. I'm not happy, but it wasn't bloody awful. Just slightly crap.",Null,0,0,31 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," Very poorly written film
","I'd like to rank this amongst some of the worst films I've ever seen. Imagine a 3 hour long film with no introduction or ending, in other words your only watching the middle of a film.The film is very difficult to follow, characters are never really established enough for you to get to know them or feel any affinity for them. The only real known names in the film are Tommy Lee Jones playing Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (who you hardly ever see) & Woody Harrelson playing Carson Wells (who is in no more than 5 scenes). The main characters are Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh (who I've never heard of) & Josh Brolin (playing Llewelyn Moss) who is only famous for being the son of James Brolin.Some how this pile of rubbish managed to win 4 Academy Awards (Best Picture which made me laugh - it must have been up against some right utter trash, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay which is also laughable because essentially all they did was film the book this movie is based on & it also won best supporting actor for Javier Bardem) and I wondered if the Acedmy were watching the same movie I was.If the book is the same as the film then I'm surprised it was ever made into a movie as it's a very poor story indeed. The basic idea is good enough, that a man accidentally finds money & drugs after a drug sale goes wrong & everyone involved gets killed. Moss doesn't want the drugs but he does take the money but the people who were behind buying the drugs want their money back.Basically the rest of the film is a chase movie from that point onwards with Moss & everyone close to his life being pursued by the man hired to retrieve the money by the people who were buying the drugs who is killing anyone in his way on the journey.Ed Tom Bell is the local sheriff from the town near where the drug sale went wrong & he is tracking Chigurh who is searching for the money stolen by Moss. The pursuit is long & violent, pretty mindless and quite boring. You can't just expect a movie to be good because 1 guy is killing a lot of people, it has to have an actual story or protagonists you know & care about.And thats where the movie suffers, never knowing enough about Moss's character. With Bell we at least get a bit of insight into who he is from his voice-overs & scenes with his wife & employees but he's not the lead or even the 2nd lead character & we never get told enough about either of them. We learn almost nothing about Chigurh's character, only a short scene where Wells is hired to find & stop Chigurh (even the reasons behind this are never fully explained).The ending of the movie is also very weak & difficult to understand. Apparently Moss is killed (I didn't even realise this, thats how hard the film is to follow!), we never know if Moss's wife lives or what happens to the money. We never know how Moss's mother in law dies, who hit Chigurh's car & why.The film ends very badly, Chigurh walking away from a car accident & Bell wondering how he'll pass the time now he has retired.Not recommended as there is no start or actual end to the movie.",1,4,8,20 July 2008
The Love Guru," Awful & unoriginal!
","Take every bad idea from Austin Powers & Wayne's World, liberally mix them with 'The Guru' (starring Jimi Mistry & Heather Graham, obviously where Myers stole the idea for this film) and you've got this excuse for a film. Most of the jokes (if you can call them that) are 1 laugh only, if that. Most of them are actually no laughs at all but that doesn't stop Myers jamming them down your throat with the vain hope you might find them funny if he repeats them often enough. A lot of this movie is recycled ideas from the various Austin Powers films and Myers' love of bad puns and word play (he might want to watch Ronnie Barker in 'The Two Ronnies' who has been doing it longer, much better and without repeating himself).Possibly the only funny moment in the film is when Pitka is being beaten up by 2 children in a bar fight. Worst moment would be the '3 girls named Ann' joke. Myers also managed to not only ruin my favourite song by Extreme but also missed a great opportunity for a good cameo (he could have had the Extreme lead singer playing the sitar). Most of the jokes in this film are funny if you are a boy of 12, sadly I'm not 12 any more and Myers is just trying too hard for the entire film. Most punchlines can be seen from a mile away. Verne Troyer has pretty much destroyed any credible career he might have ever had by agreeing to be in this garbage. And don't even mention the 'Elephants' scene which is not only totally pointless but slows down the movie at exactly the wrong moment. Myers doing a cameo as himself is the ultimate in ego indulgence in a film, the eventual outcomes are way too obvious as well.Roanoake wins The Stanley Cup, gets his girl back from Jacques Grande (played very badly by Justin Timberlake), stands up to his mother and Guru Pitka loses his chastity belt, gets the girl & thus is the rip-off of Jimi Mistry's 'The Guru' complete, right down to the Bollywood version of a Western dance number at the end.Sadly this was just a movie to indulge Mike Myers and his love of childish humour so he's made no progress as either a writer or an actor since he made Wayne's World. Anyone could have filled Jessica Alba's role as she's completely forgettable (Heather Graham was much better in 'The Guru', far sexier, a better actress and she could actually sing & dance better too!) and not enough was made of Pitka's sidekick/manservant who deserved a much bigger part in the movie.Not recommended to even the most hardcore Mike Myers fan. Avoid!",1,12,25,11 July 2008
Batman Begins," No Continuity with ANY other Batman film
","Here's what I liked about this movie:- I liked Gary Oldman as Sgt Gordon, he acted very well in a part that really didn't give him all that much to do. I liked Morgan Freeman, it was nice to show how Bruce Wayne acquired all his 'toys' for Batman. I liked Rutger Hauer, but the story behind him working for someone else really didn't come out at all, just a 'stolen microwave' thing. His character could have had so much more to do. He would have been an excellent pawn in the baddies master plan. I liked Micheal Caine, excellent as Alfred. I liked Christian Bale but I really didn't believe him as Batman, sorry. Not enough trauma and too much showing of him going bad.OK, here's what I didn't like. I didn't like Liam Neeson pretending to be a bad Jedi/Sith again. Liam, you died in the Star Wars series - get over it! Let's train Bruce Wayne in the art of Ninjitsu (supposedly takes a life time but Bruce is only away from Gotham for 7 years?) and teach him to be a force for good but when he questions his teacher about ethics and morality they suddenly want to kill him? Er, WTF?Newly trained 'ninja' Bruce Wayne defeats a whole room full of people who were teaching him - I Think NOT! If you've seen the trailer then you've seen the best bits of this film. If the police chasing the Batmobile looks familiar then it should do, thats Lower Whacker Drive in Chicago, used in The Blues Brothers over 20 years ago.The creators of this film thought ' Right, lets use tons of stuff out of Batman comic books' - This is of no use to those of us who don't read Batman comics is it? Most of us are going to know Batman from previous films or the old TV series. Yes, we know The Joker, The Riddler, The Penguin. Scarecrow - who the hell is he then? No explanation behind why he's The Scarecrow, what made him this way - how he got the name. The whole 'have you seen my mask?' and the voice changer inside along with the hallucogenic drugs still don't explain how or why he became Scarecrow.The attempt (And it was damn feeble) to explain how Bruce becomes Batman and chooses the nickname. 'I'm scared of bats so I think i'll use a bat'. He was attacked by bats. NO HE WASN'T! He fell down a well and spooked some bats who tried to fly away from him, there was no attack, just bats fleeing from a perceived threat. (Oh and real bats wouldn't fly anywhere near a person, they have excellent radar so whoever did the computer generated bats did NO research into how bats fly)Sounds pretty normal but nothing like an attack, eh? Adult Bruce goes down the well with no torch but finds a torch which seems to just appear in his hand like magic. No attack from the bats again? No, of course not. That'd be far too damn sensible. The flashbacks that seem fairly useless, we don't really see why Bruce is arrested. Stealing stuff that belongs to Wayne Industries. Not really theft is it, especially once they've asked him what his name is?The appearance of Liam Neeson in the prison cell. We've put Bruce Wayne into solitary to protect other prisoners who you were fighting with but this hasn't been deemed serious enough to warrant any further prison time, we'll just release you like we were going to.The whole 'people spooked by gas that makes them scared and insane' just looks like a scene from a Romero film, them shuffling along like Night Of The Living Dead.The girl whose supposed to be insane from gas but sits meekly in a strange fast traveling vehicle. She doesn't recognize Bruce Wayne's voice until near the end of the film, despite the fact they were childhood playmates. No, I don't think so. Plus Bruce already had the cure and he didn't carry it with him when he went to save her? The reason for her being in the house isn't explained? I assume her mother works for the Wayne family. Why do they take Bruce to the opera at all? Why do they leave by the back door?We aren't supposed to question this person killing Bruce's parents when we already know about Jack Napier (aka The Joker) from a previous film.Watch the film and forget about the plot. There isn't really MUCH actual plot to forget about but if you just watch the action and enjoy the fights and the gadgets and The Batmobile then you will love this film. Turn off your brain.The fact that The Batmobile has to jump into The Batcave but it looks like it would be physically impossible for it to jump out. Lets paint the Batsuit black but it's black already - why? Two guys get into an elevator in a fire - the most dangerous thing you can do. Really smart message to the kids, ignore the danger warnings - lifts are safe in a fire if you need to get down from somewhere.The plot of the film gets a 2/10, the action gets a 5/10.",3,4,10,3 July 2005
Saving Private Ryan," gets better each time
","i saw this with my 3 brothers when it was released. It was the first time i've ever sat all the way through and not uttered a sound until the film was finished.that's saying something. the film was incredible in the cinema.next watching was on DVD. the whole film all the way through with no breaks. again, the film was awesome.and today i've just seen it again on the TV.the film does get better each time I see it. I notice more and more things, recognize more actors and notice more mistakes.Things that annoy me. Hanks salutes his superior when he goes for his 'find Ryan' briefing but his translator is chastised for doing the same, why? The men that don't spot the Panzerfaust leaning against the wall when their trying to stop the 25mm gun from flanking them. It's right there in plain view in the middle of the screen leaning against a wall and not one of 4 men spotted it.This time I did see Ted Danson and that weirdo who played Riddick. Second time in a week for the guy who played Phoebe's brother in Friends to be on telly (he's also been on twice in Gone In 60 Seconds).the film is excellent.If your considering ever joining the military of ANY country, watch it.",10,2,4,4 September 2006
Cars," Rips off Doc Hollywood
","Steal a plot from another film and set it in a world populated by CG cars. By blatantly stealing pretty much the entire plot of Doc Hollywood, the writers of this film have had little or nothing to do.They have also stolen lots of the film Days Of Thunder, not that anyone will care that they couldn't bother to come up with their own plot.Owen Wilson plays Lightning McQueen, a racing car with an ego and no idea about how to be part of a team. He sets off to a race, gets lost and destroys a road in a little town and from there he's firmly stuck in the plot of Doc Hollywood - stuck doing community service until he learns some life lessons about himself and how to be a team player and not just think only of himself.The film looks lovely, the race sequences are far too long. You know that before the end of the film he will be helping the townspeople and the town will be set back on it's feet.The guest voices from racing legends such as Mario Andretti & Micheal Schumacher are well cast. I like the Pixar re-hashes of Toy Story, Monsters Inc & A Bugs Life all done with cars and all played with the original voice talent somehow persuaded to parody themselves.The THX goof at the start of the DVD is excellent and really funny too. The kids will like this as it looks really good but the adults might find a wee bit boring to be honest.",4,1,2,31 January 2007
The Number 23," Truly, truly awful beyond belief
","Starring Jim Carrey. That's always a bad idea. He can't play serious, he's far too annoying. Every scene he's trying to be intense you just can't take him seriously one iota. He is an animal control officer who is bitten by a dog. His wife gives him a book for his birthday which has heavy symbolism of numerology based around the number 23.He starts to find patterns in the book and in real life around him and thinks the book is about him. We follow his descent into madness and insanity as he reads the book and becomes obsessed with it's symbolism.The pursuit of trying to find the truth behind the book and it's writer lead to the truly awful twists of this film. Carrey was the writer, the book is entirely factual and he is a murderer.The film drags on far too long getting from scene to scene, the resolution takes far too long.Carrey's character would have been executed or given life without parole as not only is he a murderer, he is also insane.Worth avoiding like the plague.",1,2,6,28 July 2007
Ghost Rider," 1 trick film
","I knew nothing about the ghost rider comic strip apart from the fact that it existed before I watched this. It was purely the trailers for the movie that made me want to see this.If you've seen the trailers then you've seen the best parts of the film. Once you've seen him become Ghost Rider once and seen ghost rider do his thing then you've pretty much seen the film as it's quite definitely a 1 trick pony.This film could have had anyone playing Ghost Rider, I assume Nick Cage is a fan.Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a fairground stunt rider who sells his soul to The Devil to save his father from cancer. For all of less than 24 hours. Tip 1, if your dealing with the Devil - state specifics! He is called to be the Ghost Rider when The Devil can no longer control his own son and sends ghost rider to send his son back to hell.The visuals of the film are amazing, but you can't build a film just on how cool it looks or the 'wow' factor. It needs plot and story and this just doesn't have enough of that.I assume Cage decides to not regain his humanity at the end of the film to leave this open to a sequel. Which would be a very bad idea.Enjoy the visuals, ignore the rubbish and paper thin plot.",3,0,2,24 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Very rubbish
","I'm reviewing the DVD version and I've watched it with both sets of commentary and seen all the deleted scenes but not the Easter Eggs.The film is too short and would have benefited for most of the deleted scenes being put back in.The film is based around Jean Greys transformation into Dark Phoenix. And right there the film makers lose everyone who isn't an X-men comic fan.Killing off Scott (Cyclops), Jean and Charles (Professor Xavier) are all really bad ideas. Even with the little tease that he has moved bodies at the end of the film.Having Magneto lose his powers (or not?) and Mystique lose her powers too.The film tries to use big action set pieces to make it watchable. And the fight in Jean's home and at the prison are over done far too much. Vinny Jones is just plain stupid as are Magneto's new sidekicks.the plot could have been a lot better but it was nice finally see Beast and Jubilee (even if they were in very small roles).It was totally pointless calling this The Last Stand, as we know they will make an X-men 4.",4,1,3,28 February 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Another one that's too long!
","The 1st 20 minutes of this film is flashbacks to movie 1. We don't need them. Generally again, the pacing in this film is too much.It just lasts far too long.It's a bit annoying that Frodo & Sam go to a place in this film where they don't actually go in the book.If the director thought it was a good idea to adapt a book then why not stick to the story of the book.They stick to book one and they stick to book three but they start inventing things for book two?Who died and made him Tolkien?Of the 3 films this is the best as it has the best action.I still really didn't like it though.",1,1,7,20 November 2006
Across the Universe," Not as good as you'd think
","Take a whole bunch of songs by The Beatles. And then make a film around them using the songs & character names. Doesn't sound like much of an idea for a film does it? But somehow they managed to sell it.When I saw posters and adverts for this film I had the feeling it was an animated feature, not live action. How wrong I was.It hasn't got any actors or actress's I know much about so I can't really talk about how this compares to previous movies they've been in. There are a couple of basic plots of a boy called Jude who goes to America to find his father who'd been a GI stationed in England during the war. There's also a plot about a guy who gets drafted and decides to have a final blow out before he leaves to go to Vietnam.The plots are intertwined with Beatles songs & characters who feature in Beatles songs.There are nice locations that do look very 1960's but nice locations and a good soundtrack aren't enough to make for a good film. Trying to use The Beatles songs to link the plot together makes for a bit of a weird plot to be honest.Even with guest cameos from people like Bono, Joe Cocker & Eddie Izzard doesn't make for a good movie. It's just too weird to make for a decent enough film to follow. The whole idea of wanting to be a free spirit during the era of protest and freedom and peace are all good themes but nothing is ever explored thoroughly enough to make a decent or lasting plot thread.The film is just too surreal in places and to be honest there are too many songs sung by the cast constantly breaking up the thread of the film itself making it harder than ever to follow.It's fine to have an Anti-Vietnam film but the fact that the cast keeping bursting into song every 5 minutes is exceptionally distracting from what little actual plot exists.Dr Robert's (Bono) rendition of 'I am the walrus' does nothing but allow the film to move from New York out to the middle of no-where for pretty much no reason. He's only in the film for 2 scenes linked by his song, Izzard gets 1 scene and 1 song, Cocker gets a tiny cameo in 1 scene singing 1 song.If this had a lot more plot and a few less songs it might make for a half decent movie. I'd cut at least half the songs out, not have any of the characters singing at all(the music could stay but just as behind the actual action) and then it might stand a chance of being a movie people might actually be able to watch and enjoy.Comparing this to other Beatles related movies? This makes 'A Hard days Night' bearable. Avoid, even if you are real huge Beatles fan.",3,3,8,8 January 2008
The Mist," As bad as previous attempts at King's books.
","I'm a big fan of Mr King's books. Movies based on his books though? Not so much. People get them wrong and screw them up and I wasn't expecting this to be any different.The film starts VERY slowly, we get a little bit of character development, learn about some character relationships as well. Then the sirens start going and we get our 1st warning about The Mist and that someone has already been got!We also have the 1st person to run for freedom to his car and once he's covered by the very fast moving Mist all we then hear is screaming. Generally the film likes to lead you by the nose as if your really stupid or actually retarded.Stuff like showing us the fireaxe on the wall as Norm gets grabbed by the tentacle. I don't need the film-maker to tell me what he's going to be doing in a few moments. I can watch it for myself, I'm intelligent enough to actually watch a movie.Obviously Norm was going to die but the monsters looked like very bad CGI and not much money was spent creating those shots. The 1st law of horror, hide your monsters for as long as possible then show as little as you can, revealing tiny bits until you see the whole thing near the end. That's been thrown right out of the window as we got to see the tentacles very early.Obviously opposing groups are formed and the group that wants to leave does so (I'm amazed that not one of them carries a torch into The Mist to try and see any better?) but their all killed (the scene with the rope is pretty cool!) and the religious nut that has already been scaring folks and preaching the end of the world is just fired up even more by this occurrence.Once night starts to fall we see our 2nd type of monster (the dragonfly thing) and the even bigger dragon thing. Sadly these monsters suffer the same CGI issues as the tentacles they just don't look very real (especially the dragons & even more so when their on fire & flying).Although David & his son are fighting for their lives what shocks & amazes me is neither of them have expressed concerned for mom at home all on her own and this is halfway through the movie!When David's group go out for medical supplies their intelligent enough to take torches with them. Here we meet the spider monsters (How did they not spot the web stuff all over the columns before they ever found the MP?) & they steal a page right out of Aliens with monsters using live human hosts to incubate their young.Eventually we find out the monsters and The Mist are all the fault of the military doing some experiment on a local base and its all from another dimension.Once most of David's group reached the truck I did wonder how they were going to stretch the movie at least another 10 minutes. Going back to David's home its covered in the webs and we see the wife cocooned and they decide to see if they can drive out of The Mist on what fuel David has left. Obviously they run out gas and start to contemplate suicide but only have 4 bullets to kill 5 people (obviously someone would sit with the little boy in front of them and kill 2 with 1 shot).This slows down the movie at the wrong place, right now we either want resolution or confrontation and this lull was a really bad idea. Pulling away from the truck we see 4 shots fired then going back inside we see only David left alive who gets out obviously wanting to be killed by what's in The Mist.I'm not going to describe the ending but I can't remember the book well enough to know if that's the same ending or not but it's a pretty dire and weak ending. It's not much of a resolution at all in my opinion and quite an incredible cop-out considering the effort and time that was spent on the rest of the story.Not recommended even to King fans.",6,0,2,30 March 2008
Stardust," Magical
","When I read the description of this film I truly expected to hate it with a passion. Then I saw the trailers.Unlike most films where if you've seen the trailer you've already seen the best bits, Stardust has a lot more to offer than just it's trailer contents. A LOT more.Running over 2 hours if it's supposed to be a movie for kids then they are going to fidget through this. It's overly long for the sake of it in places. Based on a book by Neil Gaiman I assume the film is long to stay as true to the book as possible.Surely they should know you have to cut a lot for pacing. There are a lot of big names attached to this although the main 2 lead parts are played by unknowns (to me at least). You can tell this was a film that Terry Gilliam should have done (he turned it down) but it doesn't suffer for his absence.Take all the Gilliam classics like Time Bandits, Brazil, Fisher King & Baron Munchausen and this film would easily slot right in there with that very excellent and extremely prestigious company.It has all the makings of a cult classic but could very easily do extremely well in cinemas as well.Michelle Pfeiffer plays a wicked witch very well, Peter O'Tooler as a dying king, Robert De Niro as the very camp pirate. There are many recognizable faces especially for the British audience like Ricky Gervais and several of the deceased brothers.The effects and locations are fantastic. The film is only spoiled by how long it is and would truly benefit from a harsh cutting of about 20 minutes or so.Still it is a very enjoyable movie which will stand up well to several viewings.",8,3,5,10 October 2007
I Am Legend," I am, well, a rip-off really
","OK, here's the Will Smith version. I've seen Chuck Heston in the classic Omega Man. I've seen the dodgy I Am Omega which is truly awful.I'm yet to see Vinnie Price in the original that set all these imitators off but hopefully I will before the year is out.Will Smith is Robert Neville, an Army Colonel, seemingly the last uninfected human living in New York. Well thats right out of Chuck Heston, isn't it? He travels around with his dog, foraging for provisions.The fact that the city has reverted back to the wild with deer and lions (from the zoo, I assume) roaming freely is a good idea. the infected have been caused by a Doctor (Emma Thompson) who had discovered a cure for cancer by mutating The Measles virus.It's side effect is creatures who thirst for blood, hate sunlight or UV and are hairless. Pretty much vampires then. These aren't the organised infected from Omega Man, these are pretty much mindless hunters.We are given insights into Neville's life and family before the disaster as flashbacks He seemingly find a cure that heals a rat and tries it on an infected woman but it doesn't work. Later in the film he is caught in a trap and his dog is killed.He descends into madness without his dog for company seeking sympathy from mannequins. Driven seemingly insane he goes out at night and attacks an entire pack of infected in his jeep but is saved from certain death by an uninfected woman.We also discover (well we infer from information given) that his wife and son died in a helicopter accident on the night of the evacuation. We also meet his female rescuer Anna and her young son Ethan (who Neville thinks are his own wife and son in moment of insanity).In a conversation with the woman we find out they refer to the infected as 'The Dark Seekers'. The night attack on Neville's home is pretty much right out of Omega Man as well. For an Army Colonel, Neville is an awful shot and very bad under combat stress.Forced to shelter in his lab they discover his cure is starting to take effect on the female he had injected earlier in the film. Giving a sample of her blood to Anna, he hides her & Ethan in a cupboard in the wall. And then blows himself and a lab full of Dark Stalkers up with a fragmentation grenade. (Which incidentally don't produce fireballs like the one in the film). So our hero dies, exactly like Heston in Omega Man.Anna & Ethan drive off to the survivors colony in Vermont which turns out to be real and she gives them the vial of blood containing the antibodies. The movie ends weakly for such a strong film.This is better than 'I Am Omega' but not as good as 'The Omega Man'.",7,1,3,22 December 2007
Shrek the Third," Unfunny
","Worst of the 3. Hang on, didn't I say that about Oceans 13 yesterday? It must be Groundhog Day then.Mike Myers brings back Shrek for a third run and there's no plot, no story and none of the great little one screen jokes we had with the previous 2 Shrek films.King Harold is dying (actaully he dies) and Shrek doesn't want to be King so he goes off to look for the next heir to the throne of Far Far Away.And Prince Charming takes over the kingdom while he's gone.The rest of the story is Shrek trying to persuade Arthur to be King, trying to face up to the idea he's going to be a father, Their journey back to Far Far Away and the rescue of Fiona and her friends which turns into the rescue of Shrek.Exceptionally weak plot, the film stumbles from scene to scene and shows no imagination at all.Extremely BORING and best avoided. This will go straight to DVD.",1,16,22,19 June 2007
The Illusionist," very good film
","the start and structure of this film are a bit weird as the film actually starts about 10 minutes from the end of the story as the illusionist Isenheim is being arrested.We then go back over his life from his childhood through to modern day, slowing catching up on how he discovered magic and met a sorcerer as a child.meeting a local girl who turns out to be a duchess and he falls in love with her but their love is forbidden as he is a peasant (the son of a cabinet maker). they try to run away together but are caught and she is sent away and he decides to roam the world on a journey of discovery and learning magic.the film looks wonderful, the magic tricks are amazing and the cool final twist in the plot is sheer brilliance.watch it and love it.",7,0,0,14 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Truly, truly Awful
","I've no idea what they spent on this movie but clearly none of it went on plot. Most of it went on special effects.I've got a feeling a LOT of movie got cut as it feels a lot of action sequences and even some plot got chopped.In the 1st part of the film not a lot happens at all. The large majority of things happening is in the last 20 minutes of the film.I've only ever known The Silver Surfer as a good guy so him playing a heel here is pointless to me. I also thought Dr Doom was killed at the end of the previous movie?An over rated movie, best to wait until it's released on DVD.",1,2,6,18 June 2007
Transformers," Better than you'd think
","We get some background which gives us a head-start on the plot with the Optimus voice-overs at the start of the film.The action comes pretty early into the film and I'm pretty happy we get to see some of my favourite robots. Starscream (didn't he used to be an F-15?), Soundwave (who their calling Frenzy) and Bumblebee.I liked the use of the 'More than meets the eye' line twice and they actually DID use the Transform noise that we all know, love and grew up hearing in the 1980's.Basically this is The Autobots trying to stop The Decepticons getting hold of a cube that can animate technology to allow them to create an army aligned to them.The robots look brilliant and the original voice artist returned to voice Optimus so it was like the time had never passed.I would have liked to have known more about the boys grandfather and his back-story when he discovered Megatron.At least the ending was open enough to allow a sequel to be made. This wasn't really worth the wait as some of the battles were shot and cut too fast to make them watchable which seems to be a problem lots of current films are suffering from.The look of the robots made it watchable and the plot wasn't bad.",6,0,5,4 July 2007
Saw II," let's go back to where we started
","damn, and yes damn, I love this. We are still left with a feeling that we don't know who Jigsaw really is. not this cancer patient who was unable to defend himself against an angry cop. this same person who escaped and ran and fled so healthily in the 1st movie.I don't see why we couldn't have Danny Glover (even in a cameo) to provide some continuity with movie number 1. Mr Wahlberg was so cro-magnon looking! I thought he was wearing some sort of weird special effects make-up appliance on his forehead.Had he over trimmed his eye-brows? In certain scenes I couldn't stop watching them change from shot to shot. He looked like a damn caveman! I thought he was the missing link in a few scenes.Wahlberg is a bad cop gone worse. The opening scene grabs you into Jigsaw and his world and won't let you go until the end credits roll to let you go. the way the movie returns to the scene of the 1st film is very nice indeed.This killer invisible gas that Jigsaw describes sounds like the Ebola Virus. This guy is a cancer patient who has gone through a car crash and being impaled. Where did he get a nerve agent like that? It's not exactly a thing you can just pop off down to the chemists for is it? Anyway. Some of the puzzles and traps are really crappy. Like the 'X marks the spot' garbage. Also the key in the syringes. The fact that they don't even find the hole until they have virtually no time left. We really should have been given a chance to find out what was behind that door. Did no-one think of entering rooms through walls? The spiky baseball bat would have helped there. The idea of the video feed not being live was fun.Anyway, this was like Cube and Cube 2, It left me wanting to know when the next one is out.Loved it.",10,1,2,16 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Typically Burton!
","take a pinch of chocolate powder, mix in 2 spoonfuls of Mr J Depp and his unique madness, coat thoroughly with lashings of creativity by Roald Dahl and you have this movie. look and think, remember all the madness that Tim Burton - Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice - has brought to us over the years.This retelling of the story of Charlie Bucket sticks more close to the original book than the Gene Wilder version which was so Hated by Roald Dahl.The film still bumps off the various horrible children one by one in methods that reflect their vile personalities and character flaws. The Oompa Loompa's still sing stupid songs in almost Busby Berkley type dance numbers.One man plays all the small dancing freaks (Deep Roy), although I think there must be more midget extras who are unseen to carry the huge bar of chocolate in the homage to 2001: A Space Odessey.There is no Mr. Slugworth appearing to tempt the kids to steal Mr Wonka's secret's, although he is mentioned by name in another section of the movie. Charlie has a father and mother, differing from the Gene Wilder version.The ending of this actually does tally with the end of the book, leaving open the option of finally making Charlie and The Great Glass Elevator.Money, lawyers and Roald Dahl prevented the making of the second film when Wilders first version was created. Perhaps the madness of Tim Burton can tempt the Dahl estate into allowing this to finally appear on the screen.",7,1,1,29 July 2005
World Trade Center," Never should have been made
","I don't think Hollywood should be making any movies about 9/11. Not this, not United 93.They would have been better served donating the money raised to finance this film to the families of those who lost people in the twin towers.I am amazed they only got 1 big Hollywood name to try and hang this whole film on. yes, Nicolas Cage sells tickets but not all on his own. there should have been at least a few other names. And don't try telling me Maggie Gyllenhall sells tickets. I have no idea who she is or what else she's been in.This film really can only be watched in the DVD format with the commentary of the men who were there and the rescuers (which is included along with Oliver Stone's commentary.You will learn some interesting things you may not have previously known but this story was NEVER strong enough to be a movie. TV featurette maybe, movie, no way. Sorry.",5,0,2,5 February 2007
The Dark Knight," Not all that dark if I'm honest
","OK, ignore the so called 'great opening scene' of the bank robbery. It's good but its nothing to be spouting the word 'brilliant' over. The 2nd scene with fake batmen is better but you don't know who the real Batman is, especially when he's talking like he's got a really sore throat or is doing an incredibly poor Clint Eastwood 'Dirty Harry' impression.And that's what ruins his dialogue with Chief Gordon in the 3rd scene in the bank vault and in the rest of the movie in fact. Call me old fashioned but I like to be able to HEAR clearly what the lead character in a movie has to say.The movie looks OK, its suitably dark in places. The plot is average at best with The Joker robbing mob banks to get their attention so he can offer to kill Batman for half their money. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is unimpressive, its not this ultra-dark madman that all the critics & fans will have you believe it is. Cesar Romero's Joker was scarier than that. Jack Nicholson's Joker buries Ledger & keeps the shovel as a souvenir.Ledger's Joker is not only not scary he's also a liar who can't keep his stories straight. Like the story of how he got the scars on his face. That his father did it or that he did it to himself with a razor to appease his wife.In the scene where they are having the parade for the dead Commissionar is that Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh as one of The Jokers gunmen? We're shown Gordon is killed (and the movie just jumped the shark at that exact moment) and then Bruce Wayne offers to turn himself in as Batman to stop Joker's killing spree.Local District Attorney Harvey Dent organises a press conference then outs himself as Batman to the surprise of Bruce Wayne.During the prisoner transfer scene there's lots of views of Lower Whacker Drive so yet again this was filmed in Chicago and they obviously don't think anyone has ever seen The Blues Brothers. More vehicle chase and the ONLY good moment of Ledger's Joker is him demanding Batman run him down on the motorcycle then Joker is captured & its revealed Gordon wasn't really dead & he's appointed Commissionar.Telling Batman he's captured Dent & Rachel (Batman's love interest from the previous film) he then reveals where they both are so Batman can only rescue one of them. Batman goes to where he thinks Rachel is but it turns out that's where Dent is. Rachel is killed in an explosion (unfortunately her 'dead' body blinks when we see it) and half of Dent's face is burnt (this is how he becomes Two-Face).Having distracted Batman & the Police away from the station Joker uses his phone-call to detonate a bomb inside one of his men then goes to find the Japanese Mob boss that the police had in custody.The trouble with the movie is it's at least 1 hour too long. It takes too long for Dent to become Two-Face, it takes Joker too long to put his millions of plans into action & achieve all their aims. Threatening the hospitals to allow Joker to get to Dent. The other back story (fronted by Two-Face) of 2 traitors within Gordon's unit (with the 2nd turning about to be Gordon's PA) is played alongside the main plot of The Joker trying to get people to kill each other is just one of the reasons why this movie is too long by an hour. You can't have 2 villains with 2 different agenda's. Pick 1 guy and 1 story and stick with it.In the hostage situation it was painfully obvious that the clowns were hostages as soon as Gordon looked at them through the binoculars (only a brain dead idiot didn't work THAT out in a microsecond). To have Batman attacked by dogs a 2nd time is just to return to the start of the movie (and whats the point in doing that so close to the damn ending!) and we already knew he'd improved the costume to be bite-proof so this was a pointless scene.The only really good scene in the whole movie is the reaction of the prisoners on the ferry (throwing their detonator out of the window). The conversation between Joker & Batman is too long and pointless, the movie should end right there (actually it should have ended over an hour ago but that's beside the point) but the director felt the need to close his final storyline with Gordon confronting Two-Face (not like Gordon ever did anything to Dent but why let a huge plot-hole like that spoil you dragging out the ending of your movie).Two-Face shows exactly how weak (for weak read 'incredibly crap paper thin plot idea') his justification of taking Gordon's family is. When a villain is actually telling you the audience that his motives are crap, you (Warner Studio's) should really be considering sacking the person who wrote the script as he's completely derailing himself as having a believable motive.Two-Face shooting Batman is pointless as the audience already known his costume was upgraded with Kevlar after the 2nd scene. The ending (if you can call it that) is sheer crap. Batman telling Gordon to make Dent a posthumous hero & blame the deaths he had caused on Batman. Batman telling Gordon to send the police after him. And not finding out what happened to The Joker. An incredibly weak movie, WAY too long for its own good. Too many villains with individual story lines to follow. What little ending there is is left gapingly open to allow for a sequel.",4,6,13,2 August 2008
Into the Wild," Incredible story
","I don't want to rate this too highly.Don't get me wrong, it's a very good movie. But the motives of the main character are highly questionable.He's a guy who just graduated college and gives up everything he has to go travelling around America. That might not sound like a big deal.He donates his life savings to charity and basically becomes a tramp, travelling from place to place and surviving on what he can forage for the main part. He's got no survival skills or expertise, all he has is books.And that's pretty damn stupid & incredibly arrogant to think he'll make it. He doesn't ever try to contact his family who he estranged himself from. He doesn't really like his parents, he found out his father was married to another women with another child when his mother had him & his sister.He does seem to like his sister but his father is prone to bouts of aggression & some domestic violence to his mother. Their not a dysfunctional family by any means, they sound like pretty normal average people to me.This is not their story though, its his story of travelling across America, adopting a new identity (he decides to call himself Alexander Supertramp) and the people who he meets and whose lives he interacts with and for some of them influences and makes changes upon.The film looks amazing, the locations are beautiful. All the minor characters he meets along the way are also played very well by the supporting cast (Even the normally unbearable Vince Vaughan playing a totally different role from normal shines in this movie). I didn't believe in the character of his father (played by William Hurt) very much, he just didn't convince me.The eventual ending of this film is quite sad but I won't spoil it. The musical soundtrack is also fantastic, as written by Eddie Veder. Even if your not watching what is quite a long film for the plot or characters then enjoy either the locations or music which add hugely to the very moving story.It's a bit meandering in places and very difficult to watch in places also but it's worth sticking with. Not a hugely feel good film but quite an interesting story which is based on someones real life.I'd recommend it.",6,0,5,25 April 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," A wonderful feel good movie
","This a review of the DVD version.Right, Take the wonderful Sir Anthony Hopkins who is a fellow Welshman and we share the same birthday!Have him playing Burt Munro, a man who wants to ride his 1920's Indian Motorcycle faster than 200 mph ot the Bonneville Saltflats. He isn't a young man, in his 70's and his bike is rebuilt and held together with anything he can find.This is the story of his trip to America and across the country in his quest to ride his motorcycle to a land speed record for it's class.This looks beautiful and is a real feel good film. You find yourself getting behind Burt and supporting him like everyone else at the Salt Flats.This is a true story but I would have liked to have known how many things in the film really are true (like the policeman letting him off after speeding in Nevada).My only real gripe with the movie is the accent of the taxi driver who takes Burt to Hollywood, his accent comes and goes which annoyed me a little bit.Watch it with an open mind and be enthralled.",9,0,0,29 July 2006
Victory," Mistake in film
","As The French are digging in the sewers a big mistake in continuity occurs.They have been digging in the sewers under the team bath.My first query is how do they know they are under the correct dressing room and not about to break into a room full of Germans? They do miraculously dig into the correct bath.Which is very full.They break through the floor, and the water pours out the hole in the floor.The guy at the top of the ladder is barely wet but that's not the mistake.The walls of the tunnels where the water just fell through as they go down the ladder are bone dry, as is the ladder.Someone forgot about the water they just released.Idiots.",2,2,8,20 February 2006
Inside Man," utter rubbish
","OK, firstly i need to mention the fact that Clive Owen is my cousin.Clive, you need a new agent! this film is Shite! you see your face hardly at all and it's the old case of casting a Brit as a bad guy and even worse making him speak with a truly dire American accent.Right, now I've got that out of my system.Basically this is a film about a man who is worried people will find out he has links to the Nazi's in his past. Jody Foster adds nothing to the film and any woman or any person could have played her part.The film is basically a bank robbery where nothing is stolen, and no-one gets hurt. The only things taken are from a safety deposit box that actually doesn't exist according to the bank records so nothing is stolen.The point of the film (if there is one) is to make you work out what links the guy who owns and runs the bank to the Nazi's and how the robbers planned to escape the bank.I'm not too sure what the point of the robbers digging the hole in the storage room floor was (that is never explained), I thought it might be their planned escape route? Generally this is a film where nothing happens and it takes a long time for that to not happen.I urge my dear cousin Clive to get a new agent, this script was way below his abilities as an actor.",1,6,11,20 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Some HUGE howling mistakes
","OK, I watched this on DVD last night and tried to have as open a mind as I possibly could.It's very obvious that Tom Hanks was never the 1st choice for the lead role in this film. Not even 2nd, 3rd, 4th 5th or 6th choice I would have said. And reading the trivia for the film I was gratified to discover my feelings were correct.I totally didn't recognise Audrey Tatou but she was excellent in her role and out performed Hanks in every scene they were both in. Jean Reno was excellent as the Opus Dei police inspector but he was a bit clichéd in certain sections of the film.Sir Ian McKellern was brilliant and his unexpected heel-turn totally threw a spanner into the smooth running plot of the film.The locations and sets of the film all look wonderfully, some of the characters are a tad annoying, Silas the albino monk especially so.I noticed a couple of huge mistakes. The British Police vehicles, namely the grey BMW's with orange stripes. No Uk police forces use BMW's and all police car markings are yellow, not orange.Also in the sequence where Silas has shot the armed police, they would have no need to issue him a verbal challenge to open fire. Under the armed rules of engagement he could have shot and killed Silas with no problems at all.When he was shouting at Silas to drop his weapon, the gun Silas was holding was clearly empty - with the working parts fully forward meaning there were no rounds in the pistol and he was no longer a risk.The officer who opened fire therefore committed an act of murder.Once Ian McKellern told us the Holy Grail was a living person I worked out it was Audrey Tatou right away. That outcome was totally predictable.The films ending is very weak, where they show where the tomb actually is. Right back where the story 1st started for Tom Hanks, in The Louvre.This film was way over hyped and no-where near as good as the hysteria over the book and the stories behind it led us to believe.Watch with an open mind and enjoy the visuals.",6,0,2,11 February 2007
The Happening," Awful!
","Brought to you by M. Night Shyamalan who had the inkling of an idea, pitched it to the studio then realised he had nothing else BUT that idea but made the film with no script, no plot and 1 idea which never turned into anything.Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel & John Leguizamo are the stars here, but Leguizamo is killed very quickly once 'The Happening' starts and is utterly pointless. He is only there to bring the young girl to the group, nothing more.Alan Ruck also appears in a 'blink and you'll miss it' role as the principal of the school were Wahlberg & Leguizamo work as teachers. Basically this is director Shyamalan's incredibly preachy message about how badly we're treating the planet & that we should do more to save plants.It's that bad an idea that plants have identified humans as their biggest threat and are now emitting toxins that kill them or cause them to kill themselves. All it does it give them a reason to leave New York and get stuck in the countryside where Wahlberg thinks he's figured out what's causing the deaths. He also thinks its to do with the sizes of groups people are in.Eventually the 'Happening' or event as they refer to it on the news ends as suddenly as it started and we're left in the slightly emptier city where Deschanel is clearly pregnant with Wahlberg's baby and Leguizamo's daughter has been adopted by them both.The film ends (if you can call it an ending) with the same thing happening somewhere in France. Awful film, really weak idea to base it on, it isn't explored enough or explained clearly enough and people are killed off way too easily. Avoid like it's trying to kill you!",1,6,14,23 June 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Typical Sequel!
","Opening exactly like the 1st movie and throwing us right into the action we get yet another Trinity action scene which is revealed to be Neo having a dream.Replacing some of the crew killed in the 1st film we get to meet Link (who will go on to be famous in LOST), this is also our 1st mention of and chance to actually see Zion.A lot of scenes in Zion go on far too long and are not needed at all, the huge dance rave being the worst offender by far. Likewise a lot if not ALL of the fight scenes go on far too long as well.Neo's 1st fight with the Smith's, Neo's fight after meeting The Keymaker are both far too long. Do the Directors not know how to cut a scene for pacing reasons? Yes, it looks cool. Yes, it's exciting but also sadly yes it detracts you away from what little plot there actually is at this point in the film.Basically all the stuff inside The Matrix this time is Neo trying to find The Architect who claims to be the creator of The Matrix (obviously this is impossible as The Matrix itself has clearly been in existence for hundreds of years and no human can live that long).Of course Neo is told this Matrix is not the original but the 6th version and the same cycle of creation and destruction has been going on since the original Matrix was made. Neo is then offered a choice, save Trinity and allow all humanity to die or to save Zion.Obviously he chooses Trinity (as this is the dream he has been having, seeing what looks like her impending death) and of course he catches her but she dies from her bullet wound and of course he brings her back to life in The Matrix just like she did for him in the 1st movie.We are told the squids have attacked Zion and that surely there must be a traitor and they had found a survivor (who turns out to be someone Agent Smith had taken over earlier in the movie).This is the very weak ending (even weaker than the 1st film!) and this is the trouble with being the 2nd in a trilogy, nothing is resolved and the plot has not progressed much.",4,0,1,21 February 2008
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Awful
","I want to start by saying I am A HUGE tenacious D fan. Loved the HBO stuff, I own both albums and the other DVD.This film has some of the d's history but there just aren't enough new ideas to keep it going.The simple idea that rock groups are good because they use a pick that was part of Satan is OK. the trip to find the pick is far too easy and should involve more things happening on their journey.what makes this film are some excellent cameo's from meatloaf as young jb's dad and Dave Grohl as Satan.there is a lot that old d fans will know about and there's enough to introduce new people to the tenacious d lore and history.some of the deleted scenes (like the song in the gun shop) were taken out and it was a mistake as it screwed up bits of the context of the film.the songs all fit well into the process of the movie but as i said i do wish there was more happening as the trip to the roll & roll history museum is just far too easy.even the nod to The Blues Brothers with the car chase on the way back to the gig which they never play anyway.i would like to have seen the original ending to see if it was better than this one. (having now seen the original ending, it really wasn't much better than the ending they used. It was just a different version of the rock off). not as good as it could have been, i'd have rather waited for a better film than this.",3,1,6,14 March 2007
War of the Worlds," An American Tale (For a 2nd Time!)
","OK, this visually looks excellent. It sticks quite close to the actual book. Mr H. G. Wells was British. The book was set in England. Then that egotistical idiot Orson Wells put it on the radio and set it in America - forever clouding the mind of every American to be born after this.The Jeff Wayne musical version followed the book the most closely by actually being in England. This film at least tries to stay close to the original storyline without being set in England. This film stinks of a story line that says 'America versus The Terrorists!', The Terrorists being The Martians that have lived amongst us unseen for years. The red weed growing on Earth and the walking Tripods are all as seen by H. G. Wells in the book.Visually the film looks fantastic, but rather shockingly the visible cast only contains 3 stars. Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning & Tim Robbins. Of course if the voice of Morgan Freeman is included then it still only makes 4 sale-able known names. How the makers managed to sell that idea to the studio, only 4 big stars to back the movie?The main gripe of this film is how the boy playing Cruise's son managed to avoid the Apocalypse Now style Explosion, that thing would have killed anyone with in 20-30 feet of it. No real other gripes with the movie but lots of the science could have holes torn into it.Watch it, enjoy it. I did like this film and found that genuinely surprising. I tend to expect to hate things hyped this much.",10,0,3,30 July 2005
30 Days of Night," 30 days of tripe
","I don't know anything about the comic book this is based on but the trailers looked great (as all trailers do & are supposed to of course!) so I decided to give it a try.The film is extremely slow to get going, sticking to the adage 'don't show your monsters too soon'. The film has classic horror ideas, 'town with no power' & 'the phones are all out'. The 1st 3 attacks are shot too quickly and over as quick as they start. If their supposed to be heightening the suspense level they only succeeded in increasing my levels of annoyance and frustration.The trouble with the film is it goes from nothing at all happening to a lot happening with no explanation or transition of events between, which makes the film seem very badly cut.The monsters are vampires & when Hartnett finds one of the 1st to be attacked becoming a vampire it is clear the gore factor is going to be low (the attack with the Axe is implied) but does show the vampires can be killed.The film is slowed down again, with a side story about a guys dad escaping the house (why were they whispering inside? Do vampires suddenly have super hearing?) but neither of them were characters we knew enough about to warrant caring if they lived.Even after showing all the vampires they insisted on killing the son in a blurred attack. There's no point in hiding your monsters once we've already seen them. The trip to the store for supplies was bound to find a vampire once Hartnett didn't search the place when he first entered it. A vampire child was a nice touch though.The attack by her was shot too fast and the camera was over-cranked too much. The female vampire hurt by bright light then suffering in pain was stupid. Why show your monster to be so weak? The guy attacking them from the JCB made them look even weaker & again shot too fast & over-cranked to hell. His driving into the shopfront seemed pointless and had no motive.Why they waited so long to reveal the power station guy had been bitten by the girl is a mystery. It was obvious she'd bitten him so why wait 20 minutes for the guy to tell them himself is beyond me. This slowed the film down yet again, another bad idea.Once we'd gone back into the shredding plant which was so unsubtly introduced at the start of the film it was a foregone conclusion that someone or something was going to fall or be pushed into it. Clearly someone had been stealing ideas from Wrong Turn 2: Dead End.Predictably enough, after being attacked & bitten Billy pushed his attacker into the shredder (in a blink and you'll miss it moment) & lost an arm as well. Hartnett cutting off Billy's head with the Axe is about the goriest thing in the film.With 15 or so minutes of film left to run and the biggest gimmick in the film already used I wondered how they were going to wrap this movie up, if they were going to take the 'everyone dies' approach or 'the hero kills all the monsters' approach or 'the hero gets infected and has to be killed' approach or something else.When their thinking about saving the female cop I was amazed that by this point no-one had introduced a hunting rifle with scope. This is a town that's bound to have bears & wolves close by and no-one seemed to have one? They were also saying that the following day was sun rise so 29 days had passed? The vampires using the oil pipeline to burn down the town is pointless. We already established they hate bright light (so they are going to hate fire), they already snatched and killed or infected most of the towns people (they said there were only 5 left alive in the jail). Saying it was done to cover their tracks so they could do the same thing again in another town is a very weak idea.Likewise the idea of Harnett infecting himself (with Billys blood) to save the lady cop (Why not just let her and the person with her die, he didn't seem to care her about her anyway?), an equally bad plot device. Also we had already seen the vampires kill other vampires if they were injured or showed weakness so why he thought they'd let him anywhere near them in his partially infected state is beyond me.Realistically Hartnett should never have been able to defeat any vampire in a straight fight. They looked like they'd been around a long time (the weird language indicated that too) and he'd had all of 2 minutes of being a vampire. Of course their fight was shot too fast and over-cranked like every other action scene in this film & I still couldn't really tell how the vampire was killed (shot it looked like but Hartnett lost his gun earlier in the film).Having killed their leader the rest of the vampires leave what's left of the town and Hartnett is left to die and burn up as the sun rises (a scene stolen & lifted wholesale from Blade 2). You never see the whole process and we linger in the female cops eyes for a long time which is never explained.An exceptionally weak ending in a really awful film that has no redeeming qualities at all.",1,40,80,10 December 2007
Wedding Crashers," Truly, Truly, TRULY AWFUL!
","Another film where I wish I could give 0 as a score. I'm not really sure exactly what kind of audience this film is aimed at.It's clearly not aimed at men. If it were, Vaughn would not have been such a pussy to allow himself to get trapped by the mad bunny boiler played by Isla Fisher and end up getting married. Likewise Wilson would not have fallen in love.It's clearly not aimed at women, the films demeans them and makes them looks like sex objects and sluts who sleep with men at the drop of a hat.It's clearly not a date movie. If a guy were to take a women to this for a date she'll know exactly what he expects after the film, sex. And having seen the film most women won't be in the mood at all, despite the really weak 'Feel Good' ending.This is supposed to be about 2 men who gate crash weddings and then receptions to meet women and have sex with them, and then leave before they wake up. They have a clear set of rules and invent rules when they feel like it. I'm quite amazed that there are no rules regarding what to do if your fellow crasher starts ignoring the rules.Try Rule 1:- Every man for himself.The film shows Vaughn and Wilson (by the way, can't he afford plastic surgery on his nose? It looks bloody awful!) attending several weddings then going to the receptions. Are they never asked for invitations at the receptions? Every wedding I've ever been to, the reception was invite only and there's always someone checking invites on the door. Normally 2 people so between the 2 of them they know everyone coming through the door.Any crashers then get the cold shoulder and shown the door, or never make it inside. I don't know why they even bother going to the actual wedding and just go to the reception. It's rare a reception happens RIGHT after the actual wedding. Most have a private invite/close family/friends only dinner and then an evening do which is also invite only.One of the rules is about getting in at all costs and another states why bother with invites. In that case why aren't there any scenes where Wilson & Vaughn have to bluff their way into the parties? Or any scenes of them failing to get in at all.The only party either one gets kicked out of is the most obvious, the engagement of Wilson's love interest. Not a wedding, an engagement. Aren't they screwing with their own rules here? Pointless.Going to a family house after a wedding as well. Way, way off the rules in my opinion. Right there Vaughn should have left Wilson to try whatever he wanted - he was already in danger from a female and should be allowed to think of himself 1st.This film looks nice. It's way, way too long. By about an hour. It's boring, the plot circles round aimlessly looking for places to go and never really manages to get any where.The outcome at the end is against all rules of wedding crashing. The appearance of Will Ferrall is not needed. The ideal ending would be Wilson crashing Vaughns wedding and rescuing him and taking him to a different wedding to crash or them going to the new thing to crash - A funeral.Avoid this like the plague.",1,2,4,13 February 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," hmm
","Take Jack Nicholson, Brad Douriff, Danny Devito & Christopher Lloyd. All playing patients in a mental institution. And they look like they belong there.Jack looks he literally just walked off the set of The Last Detail and nothing like he did in Tommy (both of which predate this film). Devito looks about 12, he's so fresh faced. It's hard to believe this is the same Brad Douriff that will go on to be in Dune and Chris Lloyd seems to get typecast as mad or a crackpot going on to be mental in The Dream Team and a crackpot inventor in Back To The Future.You get Jack imagining the World Series, Jack escaping, stealing a bus then stealing a boat to take the guys fishing. Jack being given electro shock therapy and faking catatonia.Douriff as Billy is amazing, playing his role so fully. Little wonder he was Oscar nominated for the role that year. The party they throw in the ward with the help of Scatman Caruthers (the voice of Hong Kong Phooey, no less!) is an excellent section of the film.The films main stumbling block is in huge parts so little happens for a long time. Recognisable faces that I couldn't put a name to like The Chief (I know he was in one of the Poltergeist movies) and one of the patients is a hill person from the original version of The Hills Have Eyes. Another one of the men is the subway ghost who trains Patrick Swayze in Ghost.Jack's planned escape fails due to excessive alcohol, the aftermath of the party when the patients are lined up by the head Nurse as they all behave like naughty school children is so funny.Billy (Douriff) is discovered in bed with one of the women Nicholson had invited into the hospital and is welcomed back to the group like a conquering hero having had sex with her.His stutter had gone completely until Nurse Ratched mentions telling his mother. The blame for Billy's suicide can only placed on one person, Nurse Ratched and Nicholson's almost fatal attack on her is not without merit.We are left to assume that Nicholson has been given possibly a labotomy after attacking and almost killing the Head Nurse as he is totally unresponsive and catatonic.When The Chief kills Nicholson, it is in silence with no rage or malice. It is done as an act of release, to free Jack from the prison they have placed him into by doing the labotomy on him.The fact that he then carries out Nicholson's original escape plan is like a final act of defiance to show he was truly free all the time.A weird film but quite enjoyable.",3,8,23,9 June 2007
Jaws," So the old girl is finally 30!
","Even after 30 years this is still good. the bloody scenes and effects, the scares that you KNOW are coming, the rubbery shark. Roy scheider as chief Brody going on to to be in Blue Thunder, Richard Dreyfuss going on to be in Mr Holland's opus and close encounters (or had he already been in that?) and Robert shaw (he of the Rank - gong banging fame).They definitely needed a bigger boat, and a saner captain. the shark is most likely the biggest star. lines like needing that bigger boat, asking that son of a b*t*h to smile. the singing in the boat at night to break up the tension.how would this be made today? seeing the shark more and earlier in the film no doubt, a cgi shark and more violent attacks i think. but this is un-re-makable!excellent!",7,7,13,5 September 2005
Hancock," Pretty Dire
","Take a script thats been rejected many times and had been doing the rounds for over 10 years. Then make it into a movie by adding your own ideas. And you get Hancock, Will Smith's latest offering about the not very super Superhero.He's a bum, he's a drunk and all his crime fighting, thief taking & life saving end up costing tax payers lots of money. So he ends up going to jail to reform his ways. He gets himself a publicist to improve his image and eventually he's released early to help foil a bank robbery.The movie is OK until Charlize Theron is revealed as another superhero and then it well & truly jumps the shark, with an awful CGI fight across the city & pointless storms that are never explained. the film then gets even worse when she says she's his sister and then gets totally pointless when she admits to being his wife.The whole 'we become mortal when we get close to each other' seemed very much like an after thought added to the script by someone who was desperate to make this movie last longer as it had run out of ideas. Hancock got out of jail way too early, there wasn't a bad or powerful enough villain to put against him so they fabricated the pointless romance to make him vulnerable.Will Smith plays the drunken version of Hancock far more convincingly than the sober side. If the film had stuck to 'what if a city had a superhero who wasn't really suited to the role' idea then it might have played out much better & been a more enjoyable film. As it was the 'we become mortal when we get close' idea was truly awful, no wonder this film had been rejected for over 10 years.Best avoided as it adds nothing to the superhero film genre, in fact it actually detracts from it.",2,15,25,5 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Too much to take in!
","So many promised aspects of this story thrown down the drain, wasted! Wookies - pointless, wasted. Why even bother? Death of Count Dooku - I seriously expected a darn sight more there! General Grievous, like Darth Maul, much promised, zero delivered. Wasted! Skywalker becoming Vader - I think I'll call you Darth Vader. Yes, Padme was pregnant but hadn't given birth yet so he wasn't a father. Idiot! This film ran way too long (2hrs 13mins from start of start credits to beginning of end credits), It threw us way too far into the deep end at the start of the film with a huge space battle that was ripped wholesale out of A New Hope (we've seen this before). The film teemed with things pulled out of the previous 5 movies, (Oh and some of the stuff out of the Star Wars PC games as well, someone called Lucas is running out of ideas I think? Perhaps this is why he won't bother making the last 3 movies) I just sat there thinking 'Why show me something I've seen already? Where's all the new stuff?'. Ships looking so much like X-wings, Star Destroyers, Tie fighters. Grievous died way too easily, I was expecting something else from him after his death. Crap, George, sheer crap there. All the Jedi were killed far too easily, These people are supposed to be expert fighters trained to know the feelings of those around them, little evidence of that happening at all. We'd previously seen them use force powers in the last film) that would have held them in good stead against numerous enemies at once (like force push & force shield) but none were seen used here. If Samuel L Jackson thinks he had a good death as Mace Windu, think again Sam. I personally think you did go out exactly the way you didn't want to, like a punk. If Mace Windu was able to defeat Palpatine so easily why couldn't Yoda? There were just way too many inconsistencies popping up everywhere. See the film if you must. I found it too long, and badly thought out in sections that should have mattered. I waited all this time and was given a pile of poorly constructed scraps. George had to literally cobble things together to force (no pun intended) this film to flow into the next one. It saddens me that the Star Wars franchise was reduced to this, wasted on someone who obviously didn't care what he gave us, as long as he has our money lining his pockets. UPDATE - So I've seen it again and this time I took notes. Why doesn't R2 use his rockets to stop from slipping/falling when the Chancellors ship is crashing? Why does Grievous think 1 light saber is a collection? In order to be flying 'Half a ship' they'd need the engines! Palpatine tells Anakin Sith Legends & still doesn't guess he's Sith? Where did Grievous's other 3 light sabers come from? Anakin says to Mace he only THINKS Palpatine is a Sith even though He SAID HE WAS TO HIS FACE! When Palpatine blows the window out, why do the cloaks only move in the long shots? When Mace is about to kill Palpatine, Anakin says its 'not the Jedi way' to kill someone like a bitch but HE did it to Dooku! Padme says '3PO will look after me' - so he's a combat droid now? Why send 1 baby to where Anakin KNOWS he has family? There's a whole galaxy, Luke could have lived with Yoda and been trained from birth. Why isn't R2's memory wiped as well?The film is still too long, the giving of the name Darth Vader is not explained at all, Padme has no real reason to die and medical science can't keep her alive but they can rebuild Vader? I've now seen the DVD. With the 6 deleted scenes. The film wouldn't have suffered in either length or pacing with these scenes included. If you listen to the commentary by Lucas he talks about how he changed so many scenes with re-writes and pickups. You can bet there's gonna be a new issues with the 1st 3 films with all the bits George slashed out because he can't stick with a script once he's written it.Don't bother making the last 3 films George. You'll only change your mind once you've shot half of it.",2,2,5,18 May 2005
Shooter," too many mistakes
","Lets start with the framing for the shooting. He hasn't fired a weapon and his weapon hadn't been used in the shooting. He'd have no Gun Shot Residue on his hands and the bullet used wouldn't match his rifle.I can relate to the people drawing similarities with this and First Blood because of the way he treats his own wounds (which you actually never see).I do like the FBI guy who spots the obvious frame-up right away and Rhona Mitra (one of the original Lara Crofts!) plays his sidekick pretty well.Are the 2 guys who try to stop and ask Wahlberg for ID rent-a-cops? They aren't dressed like Police? And even if they are, since when do police have the right to ask for id? America - Land of the free, isn't it?Hooking the FBI guy up with Wahlberg is good idea and plays well but the notion that he could learn to shoot as well as a marine sniper in such a short time is pretty silly and unbelievable.The ending where Wahlberg goes and kills Glover and the Senator is predicable and very weak, the ending could have been much better.",2,2,7,14 April 2007
WALL·E," Pure Brilliance!
","Pixar have done it again. I'm going on the record here, this is THE best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It's simple, beautiful, enchanting, it has a message & has memorable characters.Wall-e (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is a robot. His job is to tidy up rubbish. A very noble cause & even more so when it's all the rubbish we humans left behind before blasting off into the stars to leave The Earth in hope that nature could regenerate itself. And this is Wall-e's (he pronounces it Wally) huge task.I assume centuries ago there were millions like him (you get to see 1 that has broken down that he scavenges parts from) & they all compacted the rubbish until they broke down, leaving only Wall-e left to continue the job on his own over a period of 700 years during which time he became self aware & developed a persona with only a cockroach for company.The film looks amazing, Wall-e is based the design of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, he also has elements of E.T in his persona along with the robots Huey, Lewie & Dewey from Silent Running. If you were to take all the best parts of those movies & put them together then you'd start to get close to Wall-e.Wall-e is alone until a probe lands on Earth containing Eve (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) who is there to search for life. And what does she do as soon as she encounters a hint of life? She shoots at it. That was the cockroach. And again when she meets Wall-e who falls in love with her and helps her to achieve her mission when he finds a plant growing under the rubbish he clears.This means Wall-e has to protect Eve from the elements until her ship returns to take her back to the last remnants of Humanity. A society living in complete apathy, reliant on robots for everything and have atrophied to the point where they are even unable to walk or sit up without assistance.Eventually we find out that 700 years in space have caused this to occur & that the autopilot was given orders never to return to Earth as it was declared uninhabitable. Obviously Eve's return with the plant throws a spanner in the works and we spend a short time having Eve & Wall-e being declared rogue robots, being hunted down for destruction so the Autopilot can cover up that life has returned to Earth.The film does end with the ship returning the humans to Earth & Eve having to repair Wall-e after it seems he has been destroyed but her repair job is too good and he no longer is aware like before. We do have a happy ending as Wall-e regains his awareness and the Humans decide to help earth rebuild itself and get it green again.There is a strong message behind this film about pollution and the destruction of the ecosystem but its never rammed down your throat or made to seem preachy. It's done tactfully & thoughtfully and does make you leave the film thinking about the issues. M.Night Shamaylan tried to achieve this in 'The Happening' & failed miserably. Perhaps he should take a leaf out of Pixar's book and not try so hard.A simple film with a very strong idea, an excellent & well thought out plot with a positive message and strong ending all put Pixar's message across very well. As Disney were involved, sadly there are moments of too much saccharine but the very strong film makes these bearable.I would recommend this to everyone!",10,7,13,5 July 2008
Halloween," hmmm
","I'm going to start by saying this film does not stand up well to the passage of time and seems to get a little worse each time you see it. I was amazed when I looked at the list of stuff I'd reviewed that this film wasn't there! I've seen it many times and just re-watched it so here goes. So much in this film goes unsaid leaving far too much to the viewer to interpret.I assume at the start it's Micheal Myers (i'll now be calling him MM) watching the girl and guy on the sofa. I think the camera POV is far too high up to be a child's eye view but thats just my opinion. How the boyfriend fails to spot MM as he looks back up the stairs is beyond me. MM's motive for grabbing the knife is never explained either. Also why the sister never tries to push him off, run away or defend herself in any way. His hair is light brown for those who debated it. And that knife looks very dry for having just stabbed someone seconds ago.The next scene really bothers me to, The patients are out in the rain so we're never told hold MM escaped. He's clearly been out in that rain a fair while just waiting on a car to arrive to steal. Now another thing that annoys me, he was locked up as a little boy and has been there 15 years but he knows how to drive?As Laurie Strode is walking with the boy to the Myers House no houses appear to be displaying any kind of Halloween decorations, that seemed odd to me.Also how MM found where she lived is a tad unlikely too as he drove away from them and was at the house when she got there. I was trying to work out why Lauries friends car didn't fill up with cigarette smoke(and her dad would have totally smelt it as Laurie opened her window).How far away was Laurie going to babysit? It was light when she left and dark when she got there. When Loomis & the sheriff 1st go to MM's house Loomis quite happily goes up to the stairs 1st with no gun or torch. Now what did Laurie's friend spill on herself (and where) that meant she had to take off her shirt, t-shirt and trousers? (she later says butter, it must have been red hot for her to pull her clothes off like that!) The friend also just walks right back into the house where she was sitting (clearly having left the front door unlocked then?)Who are the couple that go to where Lauries (now dead) friend is babysitting? They just walk into a total strangers house, have sex in their bed and smoke & drink in their house? And that single carving knife would NOT hold a grown adult off the ground like they show.Right, Laurie ALSO walks out of a house where she's supposed to be watching 2 sleeping kids, leaving the door unlocked! Does NO-ONE lock their door in Haddonfield? Once in the other house she never turns any lights on - thats everyones 1st instinctual action in a darkened room, turn on the lights!OK, Laurie discovering the bodies, Who screwed up there? Body 1 is her friend on the bed (still dressed only in a shirt). Body 2 is the boyfriend of the couple who had been having sex (but he was left in the kitchen stabbed to the wall with a knife!). Body 3 being the blonde girl of the couple who were having sex.The fall over the banister down the stairs should have killed or at least crippled Laurie. And can't everyone spot the obvious pane of prepared stuntglass in the window waiting for Laurie to break it?Laurie shouts for help a total of 11 times and no-one responds. Once or twice might be kids playing a prank but a girl on her own shouting 11 times? Real public spirited folks who live in that street, eh?Now they expect us to believe that MM got through that tiny window ( and we didn't see him doing it in the background? Or that he'd survive being stabbed in the neck (in an artery no less!) with that knitting needle? And he pulled that needle out (at least 2 inches was coated in blood so he should have been spraying blood all over the place!)Loomis put 6 (i counted them!) bullets into MM. He's dead. End of film. And no, screw getting up and walking away. 6 bullets from less than 10 feet, a needle in the neck and a carving knife. You Are Dead!",5,3,6,16 September 2007
1408," damn weird!
","John Cusack plays a writer who reviews Haunted Hotels and is about to go and review the killer in his career.Room 1408 in The Dolphin Hotel, New York.i haven't read the short story this is based on so I can't comment on if this a decent translation from story to film.The film is weird, it deals with levels of reality.What is real, what matters to us most.Cusack is forced to face the demons of his past by the room and watch various former occupants of the room play out their final moments like a macabre tableau.The final has many twists and decent enough scares and is very entertaining and actually does make you think as well.Well worth a watch I'd say.",7,0,0,22 September 2007
Saints and Soldiers," Pretty good
","Don't expect to see anyone you know in this.It's a complete cast of no-namers. And that's a good thing. When you have unknowns, you aren't sitting there thinking 'Are the famous stars going to die?' Basically this a group of men who escaped from execution from the Germans and were trying to get to the Allied lines.They overhear Germans talking about a downed Allied plane and reach the airman first. He tells them he is carrying vital intelligence that could prevent the Germans from over powering an Allied position.So the film then becomes their journey to help him to the closest Allied Command post.We have Deacon, haunted by the memory of killing civilians. Sarge, from Chicago who holds them all together. Kendrick who will do anything for a cigarette.One by one the guys are injured or killed but they do manage to help the RAF Airman back to an American position by disguising themselves as Germans.The film looks excellent and the characters are well played by all the actors. We even see the human side of war, that Germans are just people. Even to the point of helping the Americans get past German positions.",7,1,4,4 April 2007
Iron Man," Pretty dire
","I'll start by saying I know NOTHING about Iron Man the comic or cartoon so I don't expect to get any in-jokes or subtle references.I'm not going to score it on the very over the top special effects. I'm also not going to score it on the cast (with Jeff Bridges looking so much like Kris Kristofferson & Terrance Howard looking so much like Cuba Gooding Jr that they may as well have cast them both or did they turn those roles down?).The beginning of the film is FAR too disjointed. To be honest it got to the point where I thought he'd been blown up & kidnapped twice. I totally didn't trust the guy working with him in the cave & thought he was a plant to gain his trust even if he didn't turn out to be so.The whole 'shrapnel in your heart so we've given you this implant' idea? Utterly awful as anyone whose ever seen a single episode of MASH will tell you. It was a very bad idea & an incredibly weak one to try and drive an entire story on.It's a very A-Team/Macgyver based idea that he can build a bullet proof killer robot style suit in such a short time (not even the movie can decide if its a few weeks or 3 months) and most people would say that he'd killed the leader of the Afghan Terrorists & his 2nd in command (the bald guy & the guy with the beard) but both of them turn up alive & well later in the movie.Basically its a tale of betrayal, under the counter arms dealing & more betrayal with a couple of good robotic suits (though 1 looks so much like The Iron Giant its unreal). It has an incredibly weak ending (why he wants to reveal he's Iron Man is utterly pointless & kills any idea of a sequel as his identity is known, most of his factory is destroyed & his evil business rival is dead.Worth a look for the pretty effects but low on story and not very helpful in explaining things to those who know nothing about the comic or cartoon before watching this movie.",3,5,19,7 May 2008
Blade Runner," There's none so blind as will not see!
","Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and Sean Young are the stars of this 80's masterpiece. The visuals are stunning, the music (by Greek keyboard wizard Vangelis) suits the film perfectly, and the effects (mostly created by Douglas Trumble of 'Silent Running' fame) all still stand up very strongly to the test of time.Bladerunner. A cop who seeks out replicants, artificial humans who have been created for hard and heavy manual labour. They have a limited life span but are forbidden on Earth under penalty of death, and this is the Bladerunners job, to hunt them down and 'retire' them.They are stronger and faster than real humans which makes a Bladerunners job so much more difficult. these replicants have decided they want to live longer and have sought out their creators. People like Choo (who makes eyes), JF Sebastian (who designs replicants) and Eldon Tyrell (the self styled 'God of bio mechanics).this film explores identity, the concept of the self and if we truly know ourselves from our memories.After the 15th viewing of this classic I finally found what I was looking for! Ridley Scott hides the evidence that Deckard is a replicant in plain sight, right in front of our faces. I must have been an idiot (with an IQ of 118) not to spot what Gaff says in his final scene. 'You've done a man's job, sir' Thank you Ridley. I see the light now!",Null,1,1,3 June 2002
Casino Royale," Could have been better
","This gets 4 purely for the action sequences and the locations. In his 1st outing as the new James Bond we have Daniel Craig, so hired because he'd done similar stuff in the film Layer Cake.This is set before he acquires 00 status and seemingly working as a gun for hire but under government control.Craig doesn't look the part, he's far too muscular and top heavy to be the James Bond style character I've grown up with. There's a lot more violence and aggression in the fights in this film (and a wicked HUGE goof where he's hit by the machete, taped up and the scar magically vanishes later).This is certainly no-where as good as the Peter Sellars spoof version. This version of James Bond is certainly no gentleman like all his previous incarnations, he's very rash and hot headed. Far too quick to react to things he could have got out of using his brain instead of his brawn.The story is overly complicated. Once he's got his 00 status he's following something called Ellipse but that story just tails off into no-where once he catches up with Le Chiffre and is promptly forgotten about.Suddenly Le Chiffre is a huge bad guy for no explained reason and James must gamble government money against him to bankrupt him into seeking government protection as it's his clients money Le Chiffre is using to play with.So the scene is set for the meeting at Casino Royale with a pretty female agent from the US Treasury Department (for eye candy of course as this seems to be the 1st Bond film without an actual Bond girl) to mind the purse strings.We meet James's contact who later turns out to be a traitor working for Le Chiffre, but he still wins the game with money given to him by the CIA in return for the capture of Le Chiffre.There are a ton of plot twists where we discover various traitors (like James's contact is a traitor), double and triple crosses and the film is at least 35 minutes too long because of these being fully explored.There was no need for the female Treasury agent to be a traitor and her double cross plot was impossible to follow and far too complex for it's own good. Capture of her and James's pursuit, capture, torture & escape only to fall in love with her all seemed tacked on as after thoughts to the script which for me petered out after Le Chiffre lost the money.The film should have ended there to be honest, it would have been a much better movie if it had.James is double crossed by the female Treasury agent who sends the money to another account to save her hostage boyfriend, another seemingly tacked on after thought to the script.The whole sinking house in Venice was good but pointless as we had no idea who the guy with the money was and the ending was really weak.",4,3,5,15 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Pretty good
","After the huge array of really poor sequels I've seen recently (POTC 3, Oceans 13, Shrek 3) there is finally a sequel I actually enjoyed watching.Ignore the many howling goofs that there are (like McClain hitting the guy with his car, him hitting a wall at 40+ mph with his back and getting up and walking in seconds).This is good. The action doesn't go overboard for no reason (unlike Bad Boys 2) and there is a bit of a plot but not much. The story of the Cyber Terrorists could have been explained a little bit more in my view but thats just me.Bruce Willis is just a little bit too long in the tooth to be taken seriously as an action hero of this level and the blatant steals from Terminator 2 and True Lies were a tad annoying that they couldn't think of anything new themselves.The film is maybe about 20 minutes too long and a few scenes seemed like they were added on as after thoughts to get the film to its 2 hour running time but generally the film is very watchable.I give it a thumbs up.",4,2,6,4 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Could this have been any longer if it tried?
","How long was this awful film? Almost 4 hours?The last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms. The ring gets destroyed, that's it, movie over. We really don't need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves (does that even happen in the book?).The end of the film drags on far too long. Also the build-up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well.If you are going to adapt a very long novel, learn from Frank Herberts Dune which originally was 8 hours long when Dino DeLaurentis shot it.Don't Bother.",1,2,20,20 November 2006
The Matrix," Still good
","Well here I am almost 10 years after the release of this movie and I'm finally reviewing it! I'd seen it on TV a few weeks back so I thought it was time to commit my thoughts to cyberspace. Take Thomas Anderson, AKA Hacker Neo. He is contacted by an underground resistance whose leader Morpheus he has been looking for.Exactly why Neo is looking for him is never explained, we are thrown into a different story because Morpheus had been looking for him. When he finally gets to meet Morpheus he is offered the choice to join them and awakes in a tank of goo connected to dozens of hoses before being ejected from the comfort of his pod.He discovers The Matrix and what he thought was his real life are nothing but computer illusions with computers running The Earth and using humans as a source of power. Basically this film is about the ideas of reality, what is real? Using a lot of imagery and references from Alice In Wonderland the film still looks impressive, has plenty of action (maybe a little bit too much fighting) and a sound enough plot and cast.Even if Keanu Reeves wasn't 1st pick to be Neo he still did a great job. Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity looks incredible and Laurence Fishburne plays his role brilliantly. Hugo Weaving is almost always overlooked as Agent Smith but he is so deadpan its unreal.Despite being almost a decade old now the film is still more than watchable even if it's ending is a little weak being left open for it's sequel to explore.",7,0,1,21 February 2008
300," Don't even bother
","Have you seen the trailer? Then don't bother paying good money to watch this. And don't buy the DVD. It's trash.Far too much slow motion, especially during the fight scenes. Not enough concentration on the fight scenes ( I wish they'd watched Troy before they made this, the fight scenes in this might not have looked so bad then).The story is already set in stone, 300 Spartans against an army of thousands. their all going to die, it's just a matter of when, how and how long it will take for them to die.This isn't based on total historic fact, it's an adaptation of a graphic novel (for which read Comic Book!). it's mainly shot on green screen and uses lot's of CGI which is painfully obvious.It show's it's comic book roots in the fact that there is little to no character development.OK, yes. we follow how a Spartan child becomes a warrior. then you see the wolf and even John Landis must have been laughing at that having created a better wolf in the 1970's for American Werewolf In London.the King of the Spartans is a good character, and the guy who has sex with his wife - Well, you know she's going to kill him once he spills the beans on her bedroom activities.the fact he was being paid by Xerxes was quite a good and unexpected twist.i would have liked to have seen the final battle that was about to start as the film finished. i assume they left that open to make a sequel.generally this was very poor. it shows how a well cut trailer can make a bad film look really good.",1,97,174,24 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Crap film, Opinion - It's clobbering time!
","None of the main characters are really given any kind of introduction. At least in Spiderman and X-Men there is some kind of character outlining.powers are acquired far too easily, not explained - no real back story. they get into space too easily, the mission isn't explained. why victor doom is aboard, no reason given.This is an excuse to put Jessica Alba into a low cut top to show us her cleavage. The scenes in the mountains where the powers are first shown like Human Torch's flame on. Totally pointless and there for thrill value only.Why each member gets the particular power they do, they were all hit by the same rays but all get different powers?The 'cloud' that altered their DNA? Hmm, Cosmic Radiation that would have mostly likely killed the whole lot of them.Every member is able to manifest their powers and return to normal except The Thing - Why? I can't look at The Thing without thinking about Hellboy (they look far too similar). When The Thing is hit by the truck he has no idea he is able to do this, he is risking his life to an unknown factor.There is a LOT of UNNECESSARY action at the start of this film. Purely there for the sake of being there.The middle of the film does little to nothing, show case the powers a little more, do nothing for the story line.A poor and weak ending looking far too much like parts of X-Men 1 and 2. Doctor Doom seeming too much like Magneto by far.Generally this was a film that never should have left the pages of the comic book.DC Comics need to find a better and more worthy franchise. My fingers are still crossed for the return of Superman. Only he can save us from Hollywood.",5,0,1,29 July 2005
Click," Supporting cast makes for a good movie
","I'm scoring it low because it's got Adam Sandler in, who I can't stand. This is only the 2nd decent movie to come out of his Happy Madison production company, the other being Little Nicky which I do actually like.The supporting cast make this film good. I guessed Chris Walken was Death/The Grim Reaper/Morty. The fact that the whole sequence was a dream, wow, were the writers watching Bobby Ewing's comeback from the dead in Dallas (It was just a dream Sue Ellen had) as it was totally a stolen idea.I figured that was the lead singer of The Cranberries singing linger at his sons wedding as well.The film looks good and it is a definite feel good film. If you can get over the total hate for Adam Sandler then people like Henry WInkler & Julie Cavanah make this film really bearable.It's weird to see Sean Astin as a grown-up, he's still that little kid in The Goonies in my head.Watch and enjoy for the pretty weird ride.And David Hassellhoff as well.",3,1,3,5 February 2007
Sin City," Mmmm, very weird - but watchable
","This is good. It's tough to believe some of the actors never met each other even though their in scenes together.Right, we'll talk about the cast 1st. Benicio Del Toro - wasted. Could have made so much more of this guy. I liked the scenes where he's 'dead', their very surreal. Bruce Willis - very good, comes across a bit too 'Die Hard' in certain scenes (I think the director should have told him to act, not pretend to be in another Die Hard Film). I still found escaping from the noose a bit difficult to believe though. Nick Stahl - Damn, I had to look up to see where I remembered him from - Terminator 3! He was pretty average, nothing to write home about. Even as the Yellow Guy he was difficult to watch. Micheal Madsen - I figure he was doing this for Quentin Tarentino as he barely appears at all, and the scenes he IS in he loses to Bruce Willis every time. Michael Clarke Duncan - I will apologize for mistaking this guy for Ving Rhames every time I see him. I think he played his role well but didn't really have very much to do in the film at all. Mickey Rourke - unrecognizable but brilliant. Took this role and ran with it, totally made it his. Sheer bliss to watch every frame he's in. Rutger Hauer - hardly appears but makes nothing of his role. I think it's time he quit the business, he seems to have lost his edge. Elijah Wood - badly cast, totally unable to play a psycho killer. And I still keep thinking he's damn Tobey Macguire from Spiderman, that I WON'T apologize for. Clive Owen - OK, 1stly I'd better make it very clear I AM actually related to Clive (he's my step-cousin) but I won't let that relationship cloud my judgment. This role is excellent, and Clive acts his damn socks and shoes off. I think this kind of role shows he CAN be the next James Bond if they wish to choose him (please do, I really want to be related to James Bond!) Clive doesn't have be American to prove himself as he shows here, he does the hard character acting, the gritty tension, the love interest, the slightly bad and mad to know talking to a corpse person. He covers the whole board and not once did I doubt him. I was shouting internally 'NO!' when the tar just seemed to happily wash off him in the rain though. Right, the female cast. Apart from Rosario Dawson, the women were generally rubbish. Rosario as Gail was excellent, a very tough yet street savvy lady, able to hold her own in any situation. I don't really know Jessica Alba or Brittany Murphy (whose voice sounded familiar then I found out she was Luanne in King of the Hill.) and quite frankly from their performances in this film I don't want to know any more about them.The film is weird, it's more like watching cut scenes from a computer game, It reminded me a lot of Max Payne and XIII. If you like film noir, or comic book style films then I think you will enjoy this. I'd say to the comic book crowd hold off for the DVD which is bound to have boat loads of extras. Oh, and can someone cast the girl playing Miho in a bigger role very soon. She cast one of the rays of hope into an otherwise (apart from Rosario Dawson) bloody awful female cast. Not everyone is going to like this film, some people may not even be able to sit in the cinema through the whole film, they might get bored. Wait for the DVD then and watch the whole thing, it IS worth the effort. I didn't really understand the sequence at the end with the girl and Doctor in the elevator but maybe I wasn't supposed to. The film certainly has too many traces of Quentin Tarentino's director style and they don't improve the film or make it any more watchable. Oh, and Quentin? There are more actors than Madsen and Willis about you know, try casting some new faces we don't know.",8,0,2,26 June 2005
Coach Carter," Sam holds another movie up by himself
","Why is Ashanti even in this film? every scene she's in could be cut from the film without effecting the movie in general or even the plot lines. Sam Jackson shines again, the guy playing Worm is excellent. i couldn't remember where i'd seen him before. he filled the screen every time you saw him, more roles for that chap please! the guy playing Cruz, very good actor, very believable. i would have liked to have known if the shooting of his friend was based on a real event or not. on the whole i wasn't sure exactly what genre this film was trying to fit into. Sports movie? biog-Pic? feel-good film? if it was aiming for feel-good factor then it failed miserably. Is this film an accurate reflection of the American education system? jocks just sail by on their sporting abilities only and have little to no educational grounding? if this is the case then the future of America is bleak indeed. hopefully this film has shaken the educators of America into working harder for these students. all in all, a good movie but the love interests were not needed at all, Ashanti's fee could have been better spent elsewhere.",6,0,1,24 May 2005
The Breakfast Club," Awful
","Clearly this was made on either a really low budget or no money at all.Everyone raves about how brilliant it is and how 'of the time' it is. The film is awful. Nothing happens. In hardly any locations. The film must have cost about $10 to make?The budget most likely went on the soundtrack artists.There is little to no plot. It's a basic idea of bringing together people from all walks of life to see how they differ and eventually find common ground.Judd Nelson looks like he's about 30 in this, all the rest look just about old enough to be at High School/College.Ally Sheedy is totally miscast as the loner and crazy chick. All the roles she's had since were all good girl roles. Molly Ringwald seems to have always been cast as a whiner in John Huges films.Nothing happens in this film. Sitting in the library, running in a few corridors and a ton of really dull dialogue to get to an obvious conclusion - they find some common ground. No shock there then.It might have been an interesting movie when it was made but its a pile of garbage now. Only the music gives any relief from the awful and DULL script.Best avoided now.",1,20,47,14 June 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Utterly Awful
","I'd like to give this film a 1. It's that bad. It's overly long, incredibly bleak, dark and miserable. I can't see how American audiences even managed to sit through it, I thought they'd be walking out on it in droves. not just for the length of the film, for the amount of attention it requires to stick with it.Based on a true story Will Smith plays a salesman who decides to train to become a stockbroker. We follows the lows and even lowers of his life. the plot isn't very interesting because it's pretty obvious there's got to be a happy ending at the end of all this morose bleakness.Avoid it. It's dire and miserable and far too long for it's own good.",1,11,27,28 February 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Really quite awful
","Ignore the awful plot, ignore the dig at the audience at the very start of the film. Try (if you can) to ignore how many times the church moves. (it's NOT next door to Moe's, and isn't later on either!)This film was not intended for those who:-A) Can see. B) Pay Attention. C) Have an attention span longer than 3 minutes. D) Have seen more than 20 episodes of The Simpsons.The continuity is dire. (the moving church for starters!) The geography is dire (clearly there is no link between this and any of The Simpsons computer games and The Kwik E Mart is NOT within 1 block of Moe's!).The number of truly awful HOWLING mistakes is terrible. A Clear Glass Dome that casts a shadow, Homer falling through his roof and NOT landing in his attic?Julie Kavner sounds like she has an awful sore throat for most of the film. So much of the film is stuff recycled from old episodes (I don't think there is a single new idea in the movie).There are a few laughs but they are blatant. Like Homer telling Harry Plopper to drive from the back seat of his car and the adult deer covering the baby deer's eyes.The main Simpson family all go completely go against their normal on screen and well established characters. Apart from Lisa. Homer, the worlds best known meat-eater saving a pig from slaughter? Bart loving Flanders? (Been done before as well). Marge swearing?Generally the film is bad and I would not even recommend it to die hard fans.",1,17,35,28 July 2007
V for Vendetta," Very, very, very, very disappointing
","This film is getting 5 on it's visuals alone.Imagine you've seen a trailer for a film, it looks brilliant. Full of thrills, action packed, explosions and good actors. Then it's released onto DVD very quickly. That should be your first indicator that all is not good. Including the film.If you have seen the movie or TV trailer for this film then you have not only seen the best bits of the film you know pretty much how it ends seeing as it's shown in the trailer.Set in some future England, where we are ruled by an oppressive government who control every aspect of our lives and any thought of rebellion is destroyed. We have V. No, stop hoping you are going to see his face as it never happens. Yes, I spoiled that fact for you but I didn't want you wasting your hope.Hugo Weaving plays the mysterious man in the mask who seeks to bring down the terrible tyrannical government and instill hope into the hearts of the populace and free them from their mental and physical shackles.Natalie Portman plays Evey (but anyone could have played her, quite frankly, Portman brings nothing special to the role at all). Stephen Fry plays her boss, a man with secrets of his own and the excellent John Hurt plays the Chancellor of England, the maniac behind the tyranny.This film is bits of things like 1984, THX1138, The Island, Logans Run and other films about Dystopian futures.There are no new ideas and the creators of The Matrix just generally rehash part of their own movie trilogy. Having never read the comic I have no clue how close this is to that.I watched this with an open mind but was disappointed.",5,3,7,6 August 2006
The Island," Not an Original idea but a decent-ish film
","All the ideas of this film are taken from other places.The whole one story which we think is right and actually turns out to be the total opposite is taken from The Running Man. The whole being chased, once again The Running Man & Blade Runner, also Logan's Run.Establishing that there has been some sort of pollution and people can't go outside apart from one place on Earth known as The Island is the first 20 minutes or so of the film. We learn about their lifestyle and characters, learn a little about The Island. You get there by winning the lottery. Everyone dressing the same and looking the same and not knowing anything about sex? Directly lifted from George Lucas' THX 1138.The main character has weird dreams of drowning, being chased and killed or hurt. You totally know most of these things are going to happen or come close to happening which they do.Ewan McGregors character is lost in a sea of people who want to all live the same life and strive for the same dream. He wants to explore, learn new things and ask the difficult questions that he can't seem to get answers to. Very Blade Runner.Scarlett Johansonn is pretty and nice to look at but her acting is utter garbage. I had no fun trying to watch her, she gave no assistance to the story at all. Her part could have been played by anybody.Steve Buscimi plays himself pretty much, but I felt his character could have been used far better. Killing him was pointless, especially after he'd just told the clones not to trust anyone. The whole point there could have set him up to finally be the person to betray them.Sean Bean's character really seemed to me NOT to be the kind of person to get his hands dirty, so his fight scene near the end seemed pointless and tacked on. The last 20 minutes of the film were pretty pointless, these clones seemed intelligent. They escaped, they were free. Why they thought their sponsors would help them puzzled me.Why they went back also seemed very tacked on at the last minute, the script writer thought perhaps he didn't have enough material. The 'sex' scene was totally pointless, it was not needed.On the whole the ideas behind this film were good, visuals were excellent and the plot ran fairly well except for a few strange ideas. The whole missing a shoe thing could have been resolved. Most people will enjoy this film, I personally felt it could have been a whole lot better and was left wanting more.",4,2,3,29 September 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Pretty Dire
","OK, take the worst parts of Days Of Thunder then add my least favourite actor - Will Ferrell. Add my second least favourite actor Sacha Baron Cohen and the fact that I laughed 3 times during the whole film.The film is pretty awful. Nascar is possibly one of the most boring sports ever, like driving in a circle is so difficult.I think the most entertaining part of the film in all honesty was the out-takes before the credits ran.Ferrell was bearable (just), Gary Cole played his bum of a father really well, the 2 boys playing his children were very good and the guy laying his best friend was OK as well.I guess the supporting cast made this film for me.",2,1,3,17 April 2007
Semi-Pro," One of Ferralls better films
","Take Kingpin, The Mighty Ducks, Dodgeball then add Will Ferrall & Basketball. Doesn't sound like much of a recipe for success? That's because it isn't. This is a movie all about celebrating failure. Not success, failure. This team don't win the league. They don't get promoted into the NBA.The only reason they even win a trophy is they created it in the 1st place. The language is beyond course. The sexual references equally so. This really should be a 15 rating. NOT an R!.Ferrall as usual isn't funny, it's the minor characters that make this movie. The film drops you into the teams problems pretty deep right from the start of the movie (which is a very bad idea as it'd be a better movie for knowing how they got that bad in the 1st place).This only really gets going once the idea of becoming an NBA team is mooted more than a third of the way into the movie. If I wanted to see a movie about someone who bought his way into a sporting team I'd go watch Brewster's Millions as it's a much funnier movie, has a much better cast & script and also has much better sport in it.Ferrall is just about bearable as Jackie Moon, Woody Harrelson as Monix is the much better character and better actor. Even Andre Benjamin manages to make Ferrall look bad here. Just being set in the 70's and using a lot of 70's hair, fashion & cultural references doesn't make for a good idea.The whole idea of Ferrall's slutty wife never goes anywhere, likewise the story of Monix getting back with his ex. Even the plot of the team not getting promoted despite winning 4th place even manages to never go anywhere as the movie actually has no ending at all. It seems they just ran out of ideas and decided to end the movie on the fans trashing the whole town.There are some funny scenes and some very funny lines but that doesn't make for a movie. I thought they were going to use the hippy who made the freethrow but that never went anywhere (the tiny scene during the credits attempted to resolve that plot but still didn't).Also the idea that Coffee can be on the bench for the opposing team then go back to playing for his old team during the game? Never going to happen as he'd be unable to play due to not being selected for his team pre-game.The film attempts some lame humour with things like jumping the cheerleaders on skates and fighting a bear (neither scene really ended up ever going anywhere even if the bear did keep popping up afterwards) which was never a good idea and not ended well either (if at all).The film just doesn't have enough cohesive ideas to be any good. If it had gone with a better ending (the team taking its case for promotion to court and winning) then it might have achieved the 'feel good' factor it was looking for. As it was, it fell far short of the mark.At least in all the films I named at the start the underdogs did eventually win their championships or titles. This team only managed 4th place. Never anything to shout about or celebrate.I wouldn't recommend watching this unless your drunk or high.",3,4,7,26 May 2008
