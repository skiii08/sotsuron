Hereditary," First horror movie to scare me in years
","The amazing actors and acting that made me uneasy the whole movie as if it was happening for real, this person who made this movie definetly knows how to make a horror movieit would be 10 stars but the ending was not good in my opinion and the husband being a bit too much skeptical,and about the ending he should of gotten dragged in and back on his bed when he got knocked out from the fall lmao!! that would made me cry with horror, it would of been so good haha",9,2,6,14 November 2018
