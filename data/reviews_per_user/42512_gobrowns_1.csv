Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," not the strongest S.W. movie, but go see it at theater!
","The plot is there.  Not as strong or engaging as Episodes 4-6 because it is primarily doing a lot of 'setting up' for Episodes 2 & 3, but I think that most people will understand and accept this fact.  I think the current criticisms will fade somewhat in retrospect once Eps 2&3 come out.  It only relied a little upon your previous knowledge of the Star Wars mythos; I think the uninitiated will enjoy it just as much.  You Joseph Campbell fans out there looking for the same types of hero-myth cycle elements may have to wait for the other episodes, I think.  But there was one plot element setting you up (anakin's conception). Be prepared for some comedy relief elements that cater to the under-12 demographic (the Jar Jar Binks character and the race announcer(s) were silly, IMO). GREAT visuals, lots of good light saber play. Perhaps the strongest criticisms I have is that there were a couple of parts that felt too edited, like they were cut out for the sake of movie length or something- or underdeveloped.  It wasn't disjointed, necessarily, but seemed maybe a bit skimmed-over in parts (maybe it was just the script and directing).  Example: I thought Darth Maul could have been developed more. I'm sure we will see plenty more of the Sith in Ep.2&3, but I felt this character would have been able to play a bigger role in the overall plot (I expected as much, given that his face is all over the place!).  In fact, now that I am thinking about it, the difference between this and the other movies, and perhaps the source of some of the criticism, I think, is that there was not the clear definition of primary hero or primary villain (like Luke/Darth).  In fact, the best-developed character was Jar-Jar, whom I wanted to see least.   That makes it hard for many viewers (critics?) to swallow, as we are bred on this formula. Also, a sorta-scientific explanation was given about the nature of The Force, which took a little away from its mystic appeal, IMHO.Ewan McGregor does a great impression of a young Alec Guinness' voice.If you're wondering whether it's OK for young kids: to the degree that you think it is OK for a kid to see someone sliced in 1/2 with a light saber (no blood), it is OK for young kids.  I will take my 4-year-old, who is into Star Wars (he loves that part on the trailer where Obi-Wan 'pushes' the droids down with the Force). The theater where I saw it was one of those new ones with stadium-style seating.  I sat about halfway up, slightly to the left, and the sound was awesome! (Dolby digital)  The theater warned us that the sound was going to be turned up extra loud, which was fine by me. All in all, it was great- an 8/10. It could have been an hour longer as far as I was concerned.  I left the theater wanting more, not because I felt that the movie fell short, but because I live in an immediate-gratification world.  I can't wait 'til Ep.2!!!  I will go back again at least once or twice (and sit closer next time).",Null,1,1,19 May 1999
