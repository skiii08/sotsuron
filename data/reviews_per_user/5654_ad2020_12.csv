The Blair Witch Project," One of the most successful blunders of modern cinema!
","Coming out of the theater when I saw this, I can honestly say I was sorely disappointed, I could visualize everybody who partook of this project hysterically prancing to the bank! Why do people like this so much? Yes,it's original,Yes, it's somewhat chilling (I imagine those who thought this was absolutely scary apparently are not familiar w/ the woods),but is it executed well? F--- no!! The acting was decent, I'll give it that, but it's very brain-dead as well as poorly written and edited, (don't even make me use spoilers!!) You know what, I will use SPOILERS since I'm at a loss for words right now:Am I supposed to believe that they will keep filming when it's obvious they lost all hope, even when they won't film any sex or any other obviously hilarious material that they can cut out for their presentation? It's like the cameras became welded to their heads towards the end, or as Dave Barry put it, mounted on the top of a hyper-active seal!!They did so great w/ the chase scene, they shouldn't have drug it so much past that (the only good scene, except for Heather's last apology, which was good by itself, horrid when tied in w/ this movie) The jerky camera was an awesome idea, but did there have to be so much of it? Sometimes less is more.And yes, if your going to camp out, have survival gear! And why can't they figure out that following a river works? But then again, they can't have intelligent conversation or keep their heads!Enough, it got a 5 for effort.",5,0,2,7 December 2000
Chicken Run," Hey, I enjoyed it!
","I can't add much here, but everytime I think of this movie, I have to sing 'The Wanderer', Mel Gibson singing a drunken duet w/ Dion(the radio)on this song is tooooooooo cool! (although there is no actual drinking involved.) Hey, it might not be your bag, but the longer reviews should give you all the curiousity to get this film in front of your eyes. A 10!!",10,0,0,22 November 2000
X-Men," Formulaic, but a little terse.
","Can't say this is a bad comic adaptation, but it definitely got a lot more hype than it deserved. I liked the movie, but I still had qualms w/ it when I left the theater. The movies atmosphere definitely is in tune with the X-Men series. Not too much violence (Hmmmmmm) and more character introspection (although the faint script does blunder this aspect quite a bit). The script is half-baked and weak, but the characters acting does overshadow it, not by much though. Oh well, as quick as this was thrown together, you can't say you'll get everything.Spoilers ahead for the uninitiated, qualms for nobody:Why does Wolverine freak out when he wakes up in the X-Mansion? I'm sure Wolvie ain't gonna freak out if he wakes up and hears voices, he was alive in the 60's you know.And yes, everybody has a problem with Cyclop's lack of typecasting, I don't think it would've been hard to find the Playgirl model/ soldier boy typecast for Cyclops.And there was obviously a family friendly air with the body count at 2 with no obscenities (save for Wolvie, but ya figure he's gonna be like a trucker,'You're a dick!') This is a war here, c'mon!And, with that standoff with Magneto and the police, stopping that bullet from slicing that cop's brains in two, now that doesn't show how driven to hatred Magneto really is. In this same scene, you also figure Dr. Xavier would've manipulated Toad (he was holding Rogue), rather than Sabertooth. That would've been tactically smarter.I'd recommend it, but don't prepare to be dazzled-7",7,0,0,29 September 2000
The Doors," It's enjoyable, to say the least
","It's a sycophantic trip to see the MYTH of Jim Morrison, although the title would imply it was a movie about the Doors. How so many people who were actually there were technical advisors got there help axed (save for the credits and screen time it seems) should show that Stone has problems with the truth (sorry, everybody's done this argument, but why was this movie made then?) I read that Patricia Keneally-Morrison wanted to kill Oliver 'Soviet Loner' Stone when she saw it (that would've been interesting and maybe even cool!) It got a 7 from me for it's entertainment value (The Doors rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!) but I can't say the rest of the movie really did it for me other than it's tripiness. Look for all the band members and Jim's wife!!! (and A.J.Langer, she's the buck-skinned girl who kisses Jim)",7,1,1,2 November 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Why did Baz call this 'William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet'?
","Using this title in it's own right thumbs it's nose at the Bard!! Not that I'm a true member or anything, but pretension is going to have reaction's, most of which are going to be negative!!!! I haven't seen this flick for a while, but I do remember that everybody I associated with at the time absolutely despised it. I can see why, Shakespeare was a poet before a playwrite to my knowledge (don't hold me to it, I prefer his works to his life story!) so any well crafted dialogue of his is butchered for physical and visual effect in this movie, it's just wrong! Not to mention I find the acting to be thrown out for speed,and you can't just do what you please w/ the physical aspects of the original play, so many scenes that made the play a fatalistical tragedy are overwrought!! I have to give this movie it's due, though, it shows a great use of visual ability that should be used w/ these types of stories (even though it seems that Baz is trying to do everything that everybody else didn't with this movie) which does justice to the themes of this play. I'm not familiar with any of Baz Luhrmann's other work's, but after graduating to his sappy 'Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)', I'll be concise enough to say this is his best work (which definitely ain't saying a lot!) and that I'm afraid to meet him for fear of laughing at him or puking on him! A 5.5",6,0,1,23 November 2000
The Shining," I did the wrong thing, I read the book before I saw the movie
","Which may be why I gave this movie a 7, the idea of making a horror-noir movie like Kubrick did is a big gamble, but he pulls off some great work nonetheless.SPOILERS people! The shower scene is perfect creepiness, so are those twins just standing there (the lighting, directing and make-up for that still should be commended!) I can't really see how Delbert Grady is creepy in this movie, he's better in the book! Which is something that I must point out... this is STANLEY KUBRICK'S The Shining, not Stephen King's. The book I liked better and has more suspense, but this movie is practically nothing like the book, so comparing the movie would be unfair. Of course I have to watch the DVD on this one, it seems the editing makes this movie a little convoluted w/ continuity errors (why did Wendy start carrying that bat around? I know...) Jack Nicholson's ad-libbing in this movie does develop his character so well, I wanna be like him!! (Acting-wise that is!) Shelly Duvall was starting out her career it seems, I don't know how her character was supposed to be, also with Danny, you just don't quite know what's up w/ him! If you want a plethora of madness, read the book, if you want a creepy film w/ thrills to an extent, watch this flick.",7,0,1,14 November 2000
Apocalypse Now," Easily one of the best!!!!
","I don't know where to start, other than this movie is one of the best examples of perceptive cinematography and subject matter. I had to like it when I heard 'The End' by the Doors, which is my favorite Doors song, and it definitely took vision in how to incorporate a song about the violent blossoming of freedom and the scoring for it! I heard Eleanor Coppola had a lot to do w/ getting this movie finished, hands for her! All the elements in this film help to wield the manic presence that holds the viewer until the release at the end, I can't think of any  SPOILERS to use with my comments, but it's my feeling that if anyone is reading this before they see this movie, it's a SPOILER enough. Martin Sheen is drugged, driven and excellent in his performance, Marlon Brando and the film makers were so subtle w/ his character's presence that some people can't sense Colonel Kurtz' engaging and deviation of Captain Willard, in which the Colonel saves the Captain from his doomed end. Watch and you will see that the Colonel was the sacrifice. This little theme, if I remember correctly, is what deviated this movie from Joseph Conrad's book. Francis Ford Coppola and Vittorio Storato aren't the only names who should be praised, everyone who had something to do w/ this film holds my praise for great filmmaking. A 10, hands down!",10,0,0,1 November 2000
The Exorcist," It still stands on it's own!
","I dislike two things about this movie, the editing and the screenplay. But everything else is great, it still managed to deliver the same aural presence that I remembered when I saw it as a kid. I think it could be the fact that Jack MacGowran and several other people died making this movie, they are probably getting all the people who are watching this film, and bravo to them (poor guys)!! Although the editing in all the scenes that foreshadow this movie didn't seem to be planned very well, it had little impact on the rest of the movie, which is rare. The screenplay has one small thing, a SPOILER to be sure, but a small irk nonetheless, the crucifix scene (I can't see how she's raping or masturbating w/ it) looked a little silly to me, it should've had more eroticism to it, better subjective lighting would've been a plus. The way it's presented would make me think, 'Oh, what's she doing now ?' rather than '!' But I think that was the only way to get it past the censors back in 73', everything else is precision and atmophere, which this movie carries well. A 9, with another hand to the people who died on the set of this film, it'll carry on if they have a say in it!",9,0,2,1 November 2000
American History X," Just had to see it!!!
","And I'm glad I did!! I went into this movie like so many other people (probably because the thought of Nazis is enough to get me me to go get a gun and be rid of these people), and, of course, I came out better for the wear. The film and the way it portrayed (kind of cut-and-paste editing) is very effective for something this real and brutal. SPOILERS, it's not going to be pretty...... It states that Derek tries to prevent his brother from becoming a skinhead soldier like he was, if anything, he's preventing him from being affiliated w/ the neo-Nazis since he doesn't want him to be marked like he was (which we see power by affiliation and it's causes), also, I'm sure Danny watching his brother curb-check a Crip (who,if you ask me, probably wouldn't have kissed the curb anyway)and then look at his expression of anger and pride when he's arrested, it tends to keep one from ever wanting to become anything that barbaric. I couldn't swallow the fact that someone like Derek would reform their beliefs after prison, but being raped by your own kind and realizing that you should look to better your life rather than your pride (also finding out that your leader is a squealer helps), would make someone wake up and change things anew (good thing I realized this in my life as well, this validates this film portraying how hatred turn one's ability to love into destruction.) My qualm w/ this film, and this does tend to happen in real life, is the fact that Sweeney asks Derek to talk skinheads out of being skinheads, especially since Sweeney understands that Derek needs breathing room for being back into the outside world, that was just plain wrong, but it also makes the ending more hard-hitting than it would've been. I say no matter who you are, check this out, but if your looking for a political agenda, I have to say I deeply symphatize w/ your ignorance. A 10!!!",10,0,0,6 January 2001
Flashdance," A representative of the 80's to be sure.
","But it's the good 80's, and I'd like to point out that this is more of an artistic movie than anything else, especially with the lighting and the main character's quirks(even though it doesn't seem like that was the producer's intention!) Also the story of how this was cast makes me wonder (I would've voted for Demi Moore, but oh well)if the producers knew how this movie would've fared. It's started the 80's new wave look I'm told, and it actually enpowered women in it's own shallow way, so we can safely say it was a breakthrough, kinda like The Matrix restarted the whole industrial-cyberpunk goth trend. Still, why does she want to be a ballerina? It's doesn't make sense, she'd be better off in a chorus line where the people are likeable as she was!!! As a dancer back in the 80's (and yes, it was hard to admit to being a male dancer back then!!) this movie was cool to watch and the soundtrack was pretty awesome!! Oh well, this movie is weird, a high-energy sleeper that actually was OK. A 6.5",7,0,0,23 November 2000
Army of Darkness," Man, I can't add anything that hasn't been said before!
","I went to school w/ fanboy friends of the Evil Dead series, I'm waiting for a sequel and the video games as well (hopefully I can bumble, fight and talk my way out of situations like Ash can!) Bruce Campbell epitomizes every B-movie teenagers qualities must they be faced w/ the situations poor Ash gets himself into. Yeah, I watched the lengthly version of this flick and got a little bored, that's why this movie gets an 8, but ya gotta love Ash, cuz' everybody likes a piece of Ash!",8,1,1,13 November 2000
The Sixth Sense," Well crafted and popular.
","Oooooooooooh a twist! OK, this one's kind of obvious and I figured it out at the scene M.Night Shyamalan wanted to cut, but I didn't want to believe it and the movie is too contrived for you to wanna believe it either,(the perception of Bruce Willis' character can only carry on so much before it's obvious the ending is what made the movie!) I feel sorry for the people who didn't figure it out or went into this movie with expectations (which no one should ever do.) A lot of cutting went into this one,a lot of it good, some of it malicious! But the movie deserves the praise given it. It's obvious that it's a one trick pony, but it's good one!!!! (Oh yeah, my best friend's gonna kick me in the head!)It should be throughly enjoyed since there's so much good stuff (the writing, the music, the acting, the direction and whatever else.) Today, it's seems I'm bashing editors! If you watch the DVD, look at the alternative ending and think 'Who in their right mind would trade this ending for the one given!!!!!!!!!!!' A 8.5!",8,0,0,22 November 2000
