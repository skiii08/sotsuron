Changeling," A Perfect Movie
","After I finished watching this undeniable masterpiece by always-riveting Clint Eastwood (who wrote that rising, unforgettable score too), I told myself there should be some really strong reason why Academy thinks if they pretend they know better than Jury at Cannes, they do. However I came up with nothing to justify their obstinate enmity. There's not one false note in the entire picture. The story, script, direction, soundtrack, acting, set decoration, make-up design and cinematography are nothing less than perfect. Anyone who's looking for a shattering Anjelina Jolie performance and an indelible mark on their movie viewing experience, this is the right movie for you.",10,4,5,23 February 2009
The Machinist," A life laced with nightmare!
","An industrial worker, whose constantly losing weight and drifting away from the real world, imagines people and weird notes appear on his fridge. he chases a very strange individual and his best companions are a hooker and a waitress who all might or might not even exist!!! I believe that if Kafka ever wanted to make one movie, this would be it! Bale shed an amazing 63 pounds for his role and his emaciated body seems to be falling apart in every scene... he gives a powerful performance though. he is surrounded by a good cast and the photography and colors are commendable as well. An impressive movie from always-riveting Anderson whom I truly admire.",8,2,2,23 June 2008
Underground," The best movie of my life!
","Having watched around 4000 movies so far, this has been my all-time best cinematic experience since its release date in 1995. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch Kusturica's chef d'oeuvre in Cannes Film Festival. The story of wartime profiteers and victims stretching five decades since the early days of WWII to Balkan genocide in early 1990s is a surreal, hypnotic visual treat for which no words of commendation are adequate. The movie looks and feels like having been made by some superior intelligence which transcends human understanding and imagination. Superbly realized story invites repeated viewings to absorb all that writers Dusan Kovacevic and Emir Kusturica have put into it. A true masterpiece. Don't miss this one.",10,22,30,21 August 2008
Departures," An Unforgettable Contemplation on Life and Death
","A Cello Player in a Tokyo orchestra loses his job after the Orchestra is disbanded. Together with his kind, gorgeous wife, they move to his hometown of YAMAGATA and start a new life in his late mother's house. He then chances to find a job in a company preparing dead people for cremation. The stigma of having a job in which he must touch dead people, soon gives way to people's respect for a profession that is as important and beautiful as life itself. The Japanese title of the movie - おくりびと (OKURIBITO) - literally means SENDING PEOPLE OFF and that's what the movie is about; But this beautifully written and exceptionally acted movie - which is 'perfect' like anything else out of Japan - is an intense, philosophical contemplation on Life and ultimately rebirth through Death - which I have only seen in Abbas Kiarostami's 'THE TASTE OF CHERRY' - and how people even in a traditional society like Japan sometimes fail to understand that we have been born to help each other make this world a better place and to love and forgive each other and respect our elders no matter how many mistakes they make; But this lesson is eloquently and modestly taught and learned. The heartbreaking denouement, where Daigo prepares his father's body for cremation and the cremation of the lady owner of the village Bathhouse are just two highlights in this gem of a movie which demands multiple viewings and deep reflection. The direction, screenplay, acting and cinematography are top-notch and the scenes with Fujisan in the background are strikingly shot and edited. Forgiveness is one of the greatest blessings ever granted to human beings and it's heartrendingly pictured in this deserved Oscar winner. Don't miss this one.",10,7,16,29 March 2009
Moonrise Kingdom," What is this steaming piece of crap?
","I have rarely seen a movie that I would call 'an utter and total waste of time'; I wish I had cleaned dog poo off the streets of Toronto. Is this for real or a nightmarish joke? The amount of visual detail is suffocating and dizzying at best! And are these lines supposed to make anyone with a brain laugh: 'I'm going to find a tree to chop' or 'Get out of my chimney'. This stinking, entirely disgusting piece of crap shows that if you know the right people and figure out how to give the right people oral pleasure, you can make anything in Hollywood; that's I think how Roman Coppola and Wes Anderson - who I believe is one of the most over-rated Hollywood filmmakers - were able to get their totally ludicrous, laughless, unbearably crappy and genuinely appalling script produced. Those two kids who play the leading characters are extremely unattractive and mental-looking; I can't believe that dance scene on the beach... it almost made me puke! I wish I could rate this total waste of talent - I would never be able to wrap my head around why those actors even considered reading this boring, shitty script much less say yes to it, -10; but even that would be an over-estimation. One more thing: Bill Murray's part is impossibly thankless and abysmal; every word coming out of his mouth is dreary and desperate for a laugh! And one last thing: I really would like to know what Scorsese thinks of Keitel's part and performance!",1,20,39,18 January 2013
