Ford v Ferrari," Never finds top gear
","Ford v Ferrari, or 'le Mans 66' as it's called here, is a decent above average based on a true story movie. It's very pretty to look at. It has very good actors being watchable and charming as mavericks to root for, and suits who are charmingly smarmy and inept. It has beautiful cars doing what beautiful cars should be doing, being driven photogenically.There's nothing to complain about. It's 2.5hr run-time doesn't drag at all, it swishes by as amiably as a Sunday drive through familiar countryside in good company. Bale does Bale. Damon does Damon. The GT40 is the prettiest race car ever. Things are as they should be.It's just not particularly memorable either.",7,0,3,19 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Meh!
","Saw this last night with my wife and son, we usually differ on scoring films but we were all hugely disappointed with Captain Marvel. At this stage there are two types of Marvel movie: the ones they spend time and money on, with fully developed characters and a script to match; the flat pack generic ones built from standard set pieces and stocked with cardboard thin characters devoid of any emotional heft so there's little to latch onto if you're looking for anyone to invest in.Captain Marvel never really gets going on any level, it pootles along not doing very much of consequence via some standard set pieces: a dull car chase; a top-of-the-train bit of bish bash boshery; a moment of realisation as to how much power she actually has - all of which never rise above a low bar of competency. What's the point of a super hero movie that doesn't have anything memorable about it other than a cat, which uses the same gag 3 times, and, yet again from Marvel, another forgettable bad-guy and latex alien prosthetics that wouldn't pass muster on an episode of Star Trek.Actually, it's not just the bad guy who is forgettable: Brie Larson, fine but charmless, will do much better with a better script and direction; Samuel Jackson, youthful CGI face aside, walks and runs like an old man too tired to breathe life into a flaccid story; Ben Mendelsohn is dialled back to zero; as is Jude Law; while Annette Benning looks utterly lost.Nothing really sparks in terms of the excitement or thrills expected. It's on a level with Thor: Dark World in terms of not mattering much in the whole scheme of things.",3,1,3,10 March 2019
Knives Out," A Try Hard Farce
","While not anywhere near as clever as it would like to think it is, there's a lot to like about Rian Johnson's Knives Out. There's an almost comic book pantomime quality to it all, a farcical Agatha Christie filled with Cluedo styled characters who serve their limited purpose as red herrings with aching archness.There's the bitterly cynical rich old man, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who dies on a night when he is surrounded by his children, their partners, grandchildren, and caretakers, most of whom have a higher opinion of themselves and their achievements than Harlan does.It's obvious everyone's enjoying themselves, most of all Daniel Craig. Chris Evans chews up his bad boy role. Toni Collette is fabulously OTT as a sleepy eyed health guru. Jamie Lee Curtis sneers derisively at everything she disagrees with, which is mostly everything, including husband Don Johnson. Ana de Armas flitters about as the hapless caretaker. Christopher Plummer enjoys himself immensely as the man with all the money in the world who laughs last before he pops his clogs.Then there's a will.There's a dispute over whether Harlan's death is suicide or murder.And there's Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc, who deserves another run out as the Southern fried consulting investigator. Everyone involved gets their moment to shine, with the initial questioning session giving them all the chance to show how good and decent they are which may come back to haunt them as the story plays out.It does sag in the second third before gathering pace and racing towards the finale, one of those intricate Agatha Christie double-triple twists in the tail that really doesn't feel as though it's anything more than a handy way to tidy things up despite relying on far too many coincidences. There's few things more frustrating in cinema than watching a movie that tries to be so very smart and then trips up over its own laces as it approaches the finish line.There's no shock in the revelation that it was this thing all along, you just go along with it because this is where you've been led and it's just not entirely satisfying. Pity.",7,1,2,29 December 2019
The Irishman," An Awful Lot Of Not Very Much
","Let's get this out of the way first: the CGI used to youngify the leads proves that indeed you can make actors look younger, in this case a 76 year old De Niro looks like a 50 year old De Niro with too thick make up and a bad wig playing a 35 year old De Niro with dodgy knees. Yes, it's marvellous that they can de-age faces to a certain extent, but the body language is completely out of whack - as are body sizes and shapes for anyone who knows what these guys looked like in their young gun days. It's off-putting, a distraction, and a bad call all round.I'm old enough to remember watching Raging Bull in the cinema when it first came out, being blown away by De Niro and, as a young teenager, wondering why more films weren't shot in black and white; I'd always been a fan of old black and white movies and it was a revelation that there was someone who still thought it was a good idea to shoot that way. After Raging Bull I was hooked on Scorsese and De Niro, eagerly scouring film magazines to see what each of them were up to - back then films would take months to make it across the Atlantic. I wasn't disappointed, their collaborations and individual output filled up my teenage years and saw me through college. Scorsese had The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Color of Money, Goodfellas (easily the best gangster movie since The Godfather), and even Cape Fear, a wonderful hammy genre flick that indulged both of them before returning to more grounded form with Casino. De Niro had other movies too: The Deerhunter, Once Upon A Time In America, Brazil, The Untouchables, The Mission, Angel Heart, Midnight Run, and Heat.These are all films that The Irishman is not nearly as good as.I think there's too much nostalgia for what Scorsese and de Niro have given us over the years, how we feel about them and their legacy is being conflated with how we ought to feel about The Irishman. I've watched it twice now and, although I quickly skimmed through it the second time, it seems to be a whole lot of hoo hah about not very much. De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, an ex-soldier and truck driver who becomes a hitman for the mob. Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Al Pacino are all correct and present. Pesci quietly threatens with eyes that seem weary and weighted down by a lifetime of hard calls, Pacino always looks like the liveliest dancer in an old folks home, the one who can't sit still and wants everyone to join in whatever trouble he has brewing.The movie plays out like the longest day of exposition. We don't really get to know these people at all. We get told a huge amount about an awful lot of stuff, but everything happens at a sit-down pace until those few moments when De Niro can gather up enough energy to walk to a location and blow something up or blow someone away - but those are only brief interludes. Honestly, even now, so soon after watching it I have trouble thinking of a memorable scene or even a line that might become quotable. Stephen Graham's Tony Pro turning up to a meeting, smug and arrogant, is pretty much as close to dangerous as this thing gets.It all looks beautiful. The re-creation of different eras. Shop sign typography. Music. Cars. Street scenes. Clothes. All the incidental things that provide a wonderful backdrop. But gangster stories need larger than life characters to pull you in, not a bunch of old guys reminiscing about who did what to whom before looking around and realising they're the only one left breathing.Disappointing.",4,3,7,17 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Welcome to the Rumble
","It's been a long old journey since Robert Downey Jr started to build the MCU in a desert cave with nothing more than a trademark smirk and a high-powered quip. Back then the Iron Man suit was bodged together from scrap and imagination, a clunky knight's armour that clanked with destructive heavy metal weight rather than the fizz and pop weapon of mass entertainment it later became. Endgame is a fitting tribute to the journey this unlikeliest of superheroes (genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist) has brought us all on.All the things you might have speculated about to make this grandest of finales work probably doesn't happen, of course, but enough of the chit chat was on the mark to let the fanboys pat themselves on the back. After Infinity War everyone left alive is dealing with things in their own way and the world has moved on as best it can with the leftovers scattered and scarred; given how the universe ended up with 50% of living things disappeared from existence this was always going to be a film about how to fix things so that the MCU could move on with its film and TV and merch slate intact - you don't kill the franchise that lays the universe's first billion-dollar weekend.The mission, should our superheroes accept it, means some assembling and avengering has to be done again so they can do the improbable against the impossible to take on the inevitable. How it's done doesn't matter as much as the nostalgia ride it takes us on. It's an accomplished bit of story-telling that manages to bring 11 years of franchise work together in a way that propels the action forward without getting too bogged down with unnecessary filler - everyone has their part to play, and true to their characters there are plenty of thrills and more than enough laughs to keep things light.However, there are so many nods to so many characters that it does descend into a spot the cameo competition at times. While it can be fun to play along it's also the point at which things flounder slightly, feeling more like a necessary roll call to check who's attending the Endgame CGI bish bash boshery. That said, and with only one or two minor exceptions, there is a very satisfying sense of completion to this heroic journey.In the beginning there was one man in a cave with an iron will to survive, now there's a universe where everyone's lives have been touched, character arcs have been fulfilled, technology in the stories exists at the point of being magical, and everything is possible. So, what next?",9,0,0,29 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The King of B-Movies Makes Another B Movie
","Another miss from Tarantino who's rescued once again from sun-drenched nostalgia by great cinematography and actors doing their best in an indulgent and plodding damp squib of a movie.Pitt and DiCaprio are in good form, while Robbie is pretty as her role requires without needing to do much more than look vacant. Margaret Qualley does substantially more with her role despite Tarantino's leering camerawork.There's a fight at the end.And that's about it.",6,1,4,5 December 2019
The Lion King," Looks fantastic. Lacks female power.
","I must be one of the few people old enough to have seen the original Lion King who never saw it in all the years between then and now, so I went in to this with no expectations. First impressions were good, it looks fantastic. Then the ever familiar tones of James Earl Jones rumble in as the Dad everyone deserves. John Oliver's unmistakeable delivery provides the smiles in this piece of heaven on earth, while Chiwetel Ejiofor's voice drips with derision as he plots and schemes.There are plenty of other talented actors and guest stars - Alfre Woodard, Keegan-Michael Key, Donald Glover, Beyoncé - but none of them really have speaking voices I would immediately think of as being distinctive, lines feel flat where they need depth; voice is character in animated films. About halfway through the movie Seth Rogan shows how it's done, and brings some welcome humour and bounce with him.Plotwise, it's Disney basics 101: Good v Bad with no shade in between. The set up is as predictable as it gets - good king, scheming brother, naive prince, what could possible go wrong. That.I can't imagine that if The Lion King was written today that so many female lions would be so easily dominated by one male. Alfre Woodard's Sarabi would kick Scar's ass far sooner.The songs are uniformly forgettable, except for two.",7,0,6,24 July 2019
Midsommar," Disappointingly Silly
","Like 'Mother' and 'The Wicker Man' this sets itself up as a modern day strangers-in-a-strange-land fable, but unlike those two films the weirdness feels silly because it's trying to hard.Florence Pugh's 'Dani' is about to be dumped by Jack Reynor's 'Christian', egged on by his friends who see her as being manipulatively needy; her sister has mental health issues and Dani is distraught when she can't be contacted, something that seems to happen regularly. This accomplishes two things: it provides us with an overcooked and unnecessarily long prologue; shows us Will Poulter can ham it up with the best of them, and Jack Reynor is working from a limited range of woodeness to emote from.It's an undeniably pretty film in terms of visuals, there's something Wes Anderson about the composition and stylistic flourishes but none of the wit and humour. It drags. Things really begin when Dani and her companions travel to Sweden at the invitation of a friend to witness a Midsommar festival in a remote part of the country, apparently it only takes place every 90 years - although why is never fully explained.Dani and her 'friends' witness some odd behaviour, but for the most part they carry on even when others disappear - because if they were wearing red shirts in a star trek film it wouldn't be more obvious that that was the only reason they were in the film. Other characters, like Will Poulter and William Jackson Harper, also do dumb stuff because they have to in order to move the 'plot' along. This is a story that is so desperately contrived that every dramatic turn is signposted so far in advance that it's a trudge waiting for the consequences to be delivered.At two and a half hours it's far too much for Florenece Pugh to carry on her own. As good as she is in giving some emotional heft at the start of the film, that all dissipates rapidly once the dumbness of the middle act takes hold, and by the final act I didn't care about anyone involved.A pity.",3,4,7,13 October 2019
Marriage Story," Love Hurts
","Essentially a two-hander between Johansson and Driver, with extended cameos from others, this is the story of two extraordinary people in search of a way to feel fulfilled creatively even if it means their marriage falls apart. While Nicole and Charlie are both relatable in terms of being decent human beings, they're also quite extraordinary in terms of their careers - she an aspiring actress finding success in TV after building a great reputation in her husband's off-broadway plays, while he's a naturally gifted award-winning director director. As a couple they have worked as a team to build each other up, but their achievements bring opportunities that pull them in opposite directions - Nicole to LA and Charlie to stay in NY. Which is when the problems start, exacerbated by Nicole wanting their son, Henry, to accompany her to LA while she shoots her TV series.At its centre Johansson and Driver play two people who were deeply in love and drove each other to success, that much is obvious in the way they behave towards each other throughout, even when arguing. Both actors have great scenes in which allow them to move from one emotion to the next with a slow build intensity that suddenly explodes: initial compassion brimming up to overflowing bitterness, civil reasonableness descending into festering anger. They both shine. Despite things spiralling from promises once made between young lovers to the grab-all-you-can machiavellian greed of lawyers, these two still care for each other and if they can resolve their differences is at the heart of their story.Nicole and Charlie's wealth - her family isn't poor, and he wins an award that gives him means - allow them privileges that most would envy, which is where the story loses points for relatability. There's no real struggle to make ends meet when hiring top line divorce lawyers - Charlie struggles for a moment, but it then becomes too one-sided and just in time he wins an award which evens things up...insert convenient plot-device. Make no mistake, these are no ordinary couple: they are privileged, extremely gifted, white, and any day-to-day struggle is easily mended so that it doesn't become a gaping crack to be papered over later.While Johansson and Driver make the most of their roles their son, Henry, goes about his day to day almost as if there's little affect on him - other than looking like a dead ringer for the child in The Shining; alas, neither parent come to find him writing 'RedRum' at any time, the most he can muster is an occasional whinge about a first-world problem.I could watch Merritt Wever all day long, she steals every scene she's in and is an absolute star. Between this and Unbelievable she's certainly made a lasting impression as one to watch for the future.Laura Dern is silky smooth as an unctuous divorce lawyer well-practiced in buttering up clients and leveraging innocent comments, while Ray Liotta is aggressively persuasive as her battle-hardened counterpart always in fight-mode; Alan Alda is the sage old 4 times married semi-retired lawyer Charlie is saddled with when he first becomes aware of how serious things are. The lawyers live in a completely different world to Nicole and Charlie, theirs is a world of emotional manipulation and direction for profit, not art.Everyone gives it socks and there's plenty of good humour, tenderness, spite and compassion to make the characters rounded and full of life. All-in-all, a feel good aspirational divorce flick.",8,0,1,8 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Hitler's Not Funny
","If you're going to do a comedy with Hitler and Nazis in it, at least make it funny - like Mel Brooks' The Producers.There's enough of a potentially good farce here with Jojo as the Nazi Youth who's mother, Scarlett Johansson, who is sheltering a Jewish friend (Thomasin McKenzie) of her deceased daughter. Jojo goes about his daily routine of dressing up in uniform and keeping a diary of hateful propaganda he's digested, going to Nazi boy camp with his best mate - Archie Yates, who is far funnier - to be schooled by Sam Rockwell, as a reckless master who's all but lost the will to live, and Rebel Wilson, as an instructor all too willing to die for what she believes in.These are all fine, but it's Taika Waititi's Hitler who stands out as an annoying and redundant pest: he steals the scenes he's in by being boring and juvenile, slowing the pace down so he can gurn his way through whatever attention he can grab. Why is he in it at all if he does nothing to advance the story? It all seems a bit too much of an over-extended and unnecessary cameo by a director who's lost the run of himself after some delightfully human stories and finely weighted cameos.It's shot in that sub-Wes Anderson way, bright pastels and saturated primaries, but with none of the compositional precision, intricate dialogue and editing, nor any second viewing wit.Obviously, from the trailer, no one is expecting to watch a childhood war film along the lines of 'Come and See', but this isn't anywhere near as funny or controversial as it would like to think it is and for the most part simply fails to deliver on its potential to be either.A pity.",6,1,4,7 January 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Jumble In The Jungle
","There's a rushed feel to Da 5 Bloods, as if everything was thrown at it as fast as possible and put together without waiting to see what sticks. 4 old black guys go back to Vietnam, the son of one of them tags along, to search for the remains of a fallen colleague and maybe find some lost gold bullion. So far, so good, in an Apocalypse Now meets Three Kings kind of way.Everyone meets up and enjoys a night out on the town before heading into the jungle on their quest, which is all fun and games as the characters are introduced. Delroy Lindo is the big MAGA man, a forceful my-way-or-the-highway presence who doesn't need or want anyone's help. Clarke Peters is Mr Sensible, the smooth that holds everyone's rough edges together. Isiah Whitlock is the joker in the pack, and Norm Lewis is the flash guy. Obvs, they all have their faults which have to get exposed, because that's the kind of film it is.The trouble starts once they head into the jungle. everything looks like they walked along a trail to get to a spot to shoot, and then took five steps into the trees. It really looks like they're on a camping holiday and decided to shoot a movie while they were at it. They don't ever seem to endure the hardships of outdoor living so much as potter around slightly of trail for a bit before being cheaply rewarded by a hackneyed plot device - eyes roll rather than heads.Because they complete their objectives so easily there's nothing been invested in their struggle. There's been no drama at all other than a few flashbacks to Chadwick Boseman, his righteous charm guiding them to victory over an ambush before the inevitable befalls him and sets in motion the 50 or so years wait for his buddies to go back and find him. Yeah, it's a hokey AF premise.After the gold is found things kick off like a rejected Chuck Norris script. There's bad guys who can't shoot straight. There's good guys who spray bullets everywhere randomly without much by way of a need to conserve ammo. There's CGI puffs of blood that stand in such stark contrast to the real life footage shown earlier of Nguyen Van Lem being shot in the head, and how death by gunfire really looks - it makes Da 5 Bloods action sequences look like a COD video game in comparison. Awful. If you're going to use real world documentary footage of what actually happened to help set the tone of your story then tonally you need to have some grit, not cheap fluff.There's too much going on and none of it feels particularly well thought out to be anything other than a first pass at what could have been something with depth.On the upside, Whitlock and Peters are as watchable as ever - Peters is the glue that holds this all together. Lindo desperately needed better dialogue to get his acting chops around as he had the most showy bits, that he elevated what he had to work with to where he got to says more about his skills than that of the writers.Everyone else in the movie is a plot device, there to be used to create a reason for something to happen rather than to breathe life into situations.Maddeningly disappointing.",6,0,7,13 June 2020
