Hereditary," Spooky and Creepy
","It's weird, but it is spooky, there are some inconsistencies and some uneven performances but it is a nice production with some genuinely scary moments. there are also some gross out moments, but not too much.
Toni Collette is amazing in this film. 
What it lacks in coherence it makes up for with style. If you like ghost stories this one is worth your time.",8,13,24,23 August 2018
Darkest Hour," This is a great film. Watch it.
","Beautifully made. Compelling. Astounding performances.
Its not a documentary and some liberties were surely taken and embellishments added. This is a historical drama and it succeeds brilliantly.",10,2,4,19 December 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," My 3rd favorite Star Wars film.
","I was 8 years old when 'Star Wars' blew our minds in 1977. It was a work of genius and 'The Empire Strikes Back' was a worthy sequel. Finally we get a worthy Prequel. This is actually the first Star wars film since Empire that i consider to be a truly good film in its own right. I thought the performances were terrific particularly by the 2 leads Felicity Jones and Diego Luna. The supporting characters were memorable and i found myself actually worrying about these people. Also, it is action packed and as others have said, puts the War back in Star Wars. Darth also has some cool scenes and reminds us why you do not mess with Darth Vader! Great movie.",9,1,2,30 March 2017
Pawn Sacrifice," Interesting well made film
","this is a good movie. If you are interested in chess, bobby fischer, the cold war or just history in general this is for you. Great performances all around and Tobey Maguire in particular breathes life into the legend of eccentric chess genius Bobby Fischer. The production values are top notch. The photography is artistic and the script is compelling.",9,2,2,27 June 2017
1917," Best Picture of the Year
","The real best picture of the year. Great - sets, costumes, cinematography, acting, tension, drama, realism ....
Perhaps the best WWI film ever made.
Cheers to Director Sam Mendes, cast and crew.",10,1,1,1 March 2020
Garden State," Interesting and quirky
","If not for the well known cast I would have thought this to be a indie film. It is rather off beat, but it is a satisfying film and well acted and written with a few flaws. The mostly deadpan low key comedy works, and its refreshing to see comedy without bathroom jokes, until ... the scene where a dog humping the protagonist's leg is used as a plot device ... that and another really tasteless scene involving a dog really stuck out in a bad way in an otherwise enjoyable film. Overall I thought the film worked, but it is weird, and all the characters have these major flaws that make me think i might not want anything to do with them in real life .. but maybe that's part of why it was interesting. And Natalie Portman is adorable.",8,0,0,21 November 2017
Brave," Bad Movie For Kids and Adults alike
","This movie is poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly executed. The animation is high quality, but the story is semi coherent, mean spirited and lousy. The heroine seems like a real brat and she doesn't change. Her father is made out to be a Scottish highlander so huge he dwarfs everyone, kind of makes him hard to like. The only sympathetic character in the thing, the mother, gets turned into a bear by a magic tart made by a witch. The girl feeds her a cake that makes her sick and then turns her into a bear, in danger of being killed by the father. It's not cute, or charming. It is very creepy, it's like she poisoned her mother. It's terrible, and i'm a grown man. I can't imagine how a child would perceive her ghastly transformation. It only gets worse from there. The movie is scant on charm and bereft of real laughs. Apparently the studio paid for a bunch of fake reviews so i felt compelled to share my feelings. Brave is the worst of all the Pixar films. Avoid it.",2,1,2,24 November 2017
Mother!," Not for everybody
","There is no conventional plot. It is creepy and odd and frustrating and confusing. It is also unique and meaningful and memorable. I'm surprised a film this offbeat was made, especially with a big budget and A list actors. Great performances. Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful. Many people will hate this film. It is an art film. Watch at your own risk.",7,0,2,14 December 2017
