Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The force is strong with this one
","I think 'The Phantom Menace' is the best movie of the decade.The special effects were excellent. I like the plot of the movie. I didn't really like Qui Gonn Jin.At the beginning, R2D2 is a hero. I like his character. He was a brave droid. John William's score is very different. It wasn't like Episodes 4-5-6.",Null,0,0,14 June 1999
The Godfather: Part II," A sequel that equals the excellence of the first
","Now, this film was superior, to say the least. One of my top 10 favorite films of all time. I thought this film was every bit as excellent as the first Godfather. What elevates this film making it better than any other film sequel ever made, is the fact that the film is a sequel and a prequel in one.Robert DeNiro does a brilliant job reprising the role that Marlon Brando made so famous as Vito Corleone, showing how the Corleone family rose to power, and in the present day Michael Corleone, (Al Pacino in his best performance yet) is now the head of the family business, who gets so caught up in success and himself that he ends up losing his entire family. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and Talia Shire also do fine jobs reprising their roles.My favorite scene in The Godfather Part II is at the end, when Michael has flashbacks to the way his family used to be, and how everyone left him alone at the table when he announced he enlisted in the Marines, which fades into the final shot of the film as you see Michael Corleone sitting all alone with no one else in his life (as if he were in hell for his sins). It was an intensely gripping scene.You haven't seen enough if you have only seen The Godfather, so Part II is one of those rare sequels which completes the story. Need I say more?",10,1,1,23 June 1999
Apocalypse Now," Strange, Tedious, and Confusing
","Most people that I know hailed Apocalypse Now as the greatest and strongest war film ever made, however I have a slightly different approach to this film. As it said in that above title, this entire movie is weird, it seems to drag on struggling for greatness, but it never quite gets there. The whole film is based on Martin Sheen hunting down Marlon Brando to terminate with extreme prejudice. But so much time is wasted on such unnecessary factors, such as Brando's character development, and the Playboy bunnies who entertain the soldiers in Vietnam, a scene that seemed to come out of nowhere. To be fair, this is not at all a bad film, but I believe that it is the film's own excesses that drag it down, failing to achieve the goal that it so desperately wants to achieve.",5,1,6,2 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," A Masterful Crime Thriller
","Not only is The Usual Suspects 1995's greatest film, but it is also the 2nd greatest film of the 1990's, next to Saving Private Ryan. It is also one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. It is an exciting, brilliant crime thriller with a powerfully, fascinating, Oscar winning screenplay, on target direction from Bryan Singer, superior ensemble work by the leading cast members, and an excellent suspenseful musical score.The film is about what happens when five career criminals are brought in for a line up by the NYC cops. They decide to make use of their time by bringing down a few corrupt NYC cops, and then flee to L.A. One of the members' fence gets all five of them hooked up with another job, however they soon become entangled in a deadly mysterious mission organized by an unknown mysteriously evil crime lord who calls himself Keyser Soze, and for the rest of the film the viewer is left on the edge of their seat trying to figure out who this mysterious Keyser Soze is.Another bonus for this film is the acting. Gabriel Byrne gives an excellent performance as the hardened career criminal trying to go straight, or is he? But, the film really belongs to Kevin Spacey in an Oscar winning role as the talkative cripple, Verbal Kint.Nothing is quite as it may seem in this mesmerizing crime thriller masterpiece, and if you love crime film as much as I do, then The Usual Suspects is a must see.",10,0,1,28 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg's Finest Masterpiece
","I honestly don't know where to begin in praising this film, but I will say that this is without a doubt the strongest and greatest film of the 1990's. It is also my fifth favorite film of all time. Saving Private Ryan has to be Steven Spielberg's greatest film, I even think it's better than the very highly acclaimed Schindler's List.Spielberg has above all achieved the next to impossible: to create a film so realistic that it will make the veiwer feel like they were part of the film. The brutality of warfare presented in SPR was so realistic that it made me cry, and I never, ever cry at movies.I could go on and on about how great this film is but I believe that it is to great to be completely explained in just a few words. I strongly suggest that everyone see SPR, because if you don't see it, you will be missing a truly, profoundly, realistic experience.",10,0,0,29 May 1999
Schindler's List," A great historical film, no more, no less
","I'll admit that after seeing Schindler's List, I was moved, but not nearly as moved as when I saw Spielberg's second and better masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan. For some odd reason, however, Schindler's List did not appeal to me as much as it did to several other film fans. But, I am not saying in any way that this was a mediocre film. The cinematography was excellent, the acting superior and the film itself was very touching, however I found some parts in this film difficult to watch, especially after 3 hr. 20 min. of it. (especially the too long graveyard scene at the end) Schindler's List is a great historically important film, but in my opinion it just doesn't rise to the level of excellence as in some of my other favorite films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Star Wars, and Amadeus. But you should still see this film, specifically for its historical importance.",7,0,2,23 June 1999
Amadeus," The greatest film of the 1980's
","In what I consider to be the fourth greatest film of all time. An unknown musical composer named Antonio Salieri, who is now in an asylum for trying to cut his throat, confesses to a priest that he was behind the murder of the greatest composer who ever walked the face of the Earth, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Amadeus is nothing shy of a miraculous film. Oscar nominee Tom Hulce gives the greatest performance of his career as Mozart, the childish, immature brat that God chose to be the greatest musical composer ever. Hulce gives so much light to the screen annoying the hell out of everyone around him, especially F. Murray Abraham, (who overshadows Hulce with an Oscar winning performance) who plays Antonio Salieri, a mediocre composer who went insane with jealousy against Mozart for his God-given gift. Salieri, who is now comsumed by hatred and sorrow, swears vengeance on Mozart, and even God Himself.The film Amadeus, is like Mozart's music itself, miraculous. Tom Hulce and Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham add so much dramatic intensity to the 2 1/2 hr. film that it never seems half that long. You have to see it to really know what I'm talking about, but it is certainly well worth the time. In my opinion, there are only three other films the are better than Amadeus, (2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, and Star Wars)",10,2,4,25 June 1999
A Bug's Life," A Visual Masterpiece
","A Bug's Life stands among one one the top three films of 1998, and also among one of the 50 greatest films that I have seen. I enjoyed every second of this visual masterpiece and I am not even a kid. The voice casts could not have been better, with such actors like Julia-Louise Dreyfuss, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary, and one of my favorite acting talents, Kevin Spacey. Not only has Pixar outdone themselves by creating a more visually exciting film than Toy Story, but they have also added a bunch of hilarious outtakes during the credits.The film's plot is a simple one. A colony of ants are forced to provide food for a group of viscious grasshoppers year after year, until one brave ant decides to do something about it, by leaving the island in search of stronger bugs to help them fight off the grasshoppers. But, instead he finds a small group of failed circus bugs.Fast paced wholly computer animated film is almost too much of a good thing, with a brilliant screenplay, excellent character development, superior cinematography, and a great musical score by Randy Newman, who also did Toy Story. This film is perfect for the whole family, and it's absolutely not to be missed. A true 5-star motion picture",Null,0,0,28 May 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Greatest Motion Picture of All Time
","This is it. This is the best film of all time. (With The Godfather coming in at a distant second) The art direction, set design, sound quality, cinematography, and visually stunning special effects are all flawlessly perfect.2001: A Space Odyssey, is nothing shy of a miraculous movie. It is the only film to explore certain areas that no other film director has even attempted. The main theme of this film explores the knowledge of mankind from the past 4 million years, and through certain symbolic objects in the film, such as the flying bone, the monolith, and the star child, which all display what man has discovered about his universe.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film (even the credits), but the greatest parts were during the second half of this film, which involve the American spacecraft Discovery I, on its way to Jupiter to trace a signal made by this mysterious extra terrestrial monolith. Astronauts Keir Dullea, and Gary Lockwood, have it out with the HAL 9000 computer who controls the ship, when he has a mental breakdown. To this day I agree with the late Gene Siskel who said that HAL 9000 was the best villainous character in film history. Doug Rain's slow, calm, and monotonous voice make HAL the most intriguing character in this film. The scene where HAL refuses to let Keir Dullea re-enter the ship for fear of being shut down, is my favorite scene in film history, because it clearly shows the rivalry of computers and mankind.It took several viewings of 2001 before I fully understood and appreciated this film, but for a movie this good it was well worth it. It is one of the few films I can watch 100 times and never ever get sick of it. I loved this film so much that I own the box set for it, and I'm amazed how well 2001 has stood up over time even after 30 years. There are only a few other films that I would consider to be on the same level as 2001, such as some of my other all time favorite films. (The Godfather, Star Wars, Amadeus Saving Private Ryan) just to name a few. But excellent as those films are they still can't compare to such a visual masterpiece like 2001.After such a colossal amount of praise, I can't even go into the complex but extremely fastinating plot. If there was only one film that truly deserved a 5-star rating this would be it. It is a film that every person should see because this is the most unique film that has been created or will be created. A one of a kind must see masterpiece.",10,1,3,12 June 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The best and most perfect motion picture ever made.
","Oddly enough, the first time I saw this film, I hated it. However, after I watched a couple more times, I realized what this film was all about, and soon I became so fascinated by it that I couldn't stop watching it, and now the film ranks at #1 on my top 50 films list. (with The Godfather, and Star Wars as the next two).2001: A Space Odyssey is perfectly made in every aspect, but the best parts of this film are the HAL-9000 scenes, which make the film what it is. Several people were quite baffled by this film. But I believe that it is about many different themes, such as man's evolution, technology, knowledge, destiny, and man's ultimate struggle with computers. All of these themes are beautifully and brilliantly tied together to make this spectacular motion picture. The best thing about this film is the way it leaves such a mystery behind allowing the veiwer to figure out what it all means.For those you who have not seen 2001. I very strongly recommend it, and for those of you who have seen it and hate it I strongly recommend seeing it again because this has to be the most uniquely brilliant film ever to be created.",10,0,2,14 May 1999
There's Something About Mary," The Absolute Worst Film of 1998
","This film is not that sick, it's just plain stupid, not to mention unfunny. Ben Stiller tries very hard to generate some laughs but he fails miserably. Cameron Diaz is too hyper and also very unfunny in her shallow role, and Matt Dillon's supporting character is completely wasted in a pointless role.I remember seeing There's Something About Mary in theaters with my x-girlfriend and I ending up laughing more than she did, and she laughs at almost anything. I also didn't hear any laughter from anyone else in the theater. Just a few comments like 'that's so gross', or 'that's sick'. The material in this film might be funny to some people with extremely odd senses of humor, but I certainly didn't. If you would like to see a funny film, go rent some of the classic comedies, such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Dr. Strangelove, and Duck Soup.",3,0,0,12 June 1999
Titanic," A Titanic disappointment
","Winner of 11 Academy Awards, 4 Golden Globes, $600+ in the US box office, Oscar nominations for stars Kate Winslet, and Gloria Stuart, several floods of hype, and took Leo DiCaprio to super super stardom. But, does all of this praise really go to show for a film that is essentially empty. To say the least I was very disappointed.The acting was very laughable, Winslet's, and DiCaprio's characters displayed no chemistry whatsoever, Gloria Stuart's character displayed almost no emotion, and no one else in this film put forth a great effort for their character.I think that the thing that really set me off was the relentless hype that followed this film around everywhere. If a film is going to be constantly hyped about, it had better be excellent, otherwise, it will suck.Titanic is probably the worst 'Best Picture' of the 1990's, and it seemed to have won by default. 1997 was a bad year for films, and Titanic just goes to show you that. It may be the most successful film ever made, but it is certainly not the best. I give this film a weak 2 out of 5 stars.",4,1,2,26 June 1999
The Truman Show," A uniquely genuine masterpiece
","Jim Carrey proves to the world that he can do a whole lot more than talk out of his ass, with this brilliantly astonishing performance. He plays Truman Burbank, a normal white collar suburbanite who works in real estate and leads a simple normal life. However, his life is anything but normal. From the moment of his birth, his entire life has been shown on television live and unedited to an audience around the world, the island he lives on is a gigantic sound stage, with close to 5000 cameras, and with the great wall of China is one of two man made structures still visible from space, his wife, best friend, the people he works with, and the people he sees everyday are all just actors. The most amazing thing about this innovative premise is the fact that Truman is completely unaware of all of this. The premise of this film is how he finds out about the reality of his life, and how to escape this prison.The Truman Show is Peter Weir's finest film ever, and the always excellent Ed Harris who plays The Truman Show director, Christof gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. Jim Carrey gave the best performance that I have seen in 1998, and Laura Linney  provided some comic relief as an over acting actress playing Truman's wife. As the #2 film of 1998 (next to Saving Private Ryan), and one of the 10 greatest films of the 1990's, The Truman Show ranks as one of my top 30 favorite films of all time. This is a film that truly deserves a 5 star rating. Comedy, drama, romance, and even suspense, this film as something for everyone, and is one of those rare films that has something for everyone, it even has an important moral message behind it. The fact that life is too sacred and precious to be entertainment for someone else.This is one of the most uniquely original motion pictures that I have seen in a long time. Absolutely not to be missed by anyone.",10,0,0,15 June 1999
