Casablanca," A Timeless Classic
","Casablanca is one of the best films ever made! No matter who you are, seeing this film won't let you down. The silver screen has never seen anything more triumphant than Curtiz's cinematic masterpiece. Bogart and Bergman, two of my favorite actors, are magical together as well. Everything about this movie is utterly flawless!!",10,0,1,8 May 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Best Disney Movie of All Time!!
","Ever since I was little, Beauty and the Beast was my favorite Disney movie. Everything about it is perfect! The story, the characters, the soundtrack, and the animation are brilliant. This was also the first and only Disney movie to be nominated for the Best Picture oscar.",10,1,1,21 June 2018
Gone with the Wind," Best Movie EVER!
","This is hands down my favorite movie of all time. From its outstanding acting and directing to its ahead of its time cinematography and visual effects, Gone with the Wind is a truly amazing classic. It one a total of eight competitive Oscars at the time of the movie's release, and still, to this day, is the highest grossing movie of all time (considering inflation). I recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. You won't be disappointed!!",10,4,6,8 May 2018
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)
","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the very first feature-length animated film and is one of the greatest. From the animation to the dialogue to the musical score, Disney cannot get much better than this. I've seen this movie many, many times and it only gets better due to the timeless story and characters. Excellent first effort from Disney!",9,1,1,18 February 2020
