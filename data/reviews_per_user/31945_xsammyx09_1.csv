The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I was so disappointed...
","I have loved all the movies and read all the books multiple times i am a huge fan and i was heart broken when this sad excuse for a twilight movie came out. I thought scenes that were meant to be emotional and serious were made funny and laughable, even though the book is cheesy the movie just made it stupid and unrealistic. The three main characters were the only actors who put something into the film the rest delivered lines terribly and looked bored. The werewolf scenes wereÂ… i have no words they were terrible and for me ruined the whole movie they looked awful and spoke like transformers. the special effects were rubbish and music choice was terribble at some points. many people said it was amazing and i honestly don't get it and they all say but its twilight and i think many people have just convinced themselves it was good! if you haven't read the books you wouldn't find it as bad and also i don't think you would understand half of it! The more and more i think of it the more i don't get how awful it was and think i would could of done a better job of directing it! I personally think Bill Condon has ruined the twilight series and i cant believe that Stephanie Meyer helped produce this. The movie has nothing on the book which WAS amazing, and i just cant believe they made such a mockery of it!!!",Null,6,10,21 November 2011
