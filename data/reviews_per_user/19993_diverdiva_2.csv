Howl's Moving Castle," Amazing Anime!
","I've never been a fan of anime (I find the generic facial features of the protagonists a real put-off) until I discovered this film and the Ghibli studio. Since watching Howl's Moving Castle (dubbed version) I have eagerly sought out other films by Ghibli and particularly by Miyazake. The artwork is stunning and the attention to detail beyond anything, especially since this is hand-drawn, with little, if any, CG. So much better than the flat 2-dimensional work seen in much of Disney's offerings. I'm not sure how much was lost in translation - but I found the story satisfying if occasionally a bit light in content and explanation (without spoiling - the details of the curses and their 'cures' are mainly left to the viewer to work out) - but this is minor in the overall effect of the film, which is amazing. You get sucked into this fantastic alternative reality; the characters are appealing and the stellar cast for the English language voice-over (Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Jean Simmons, etc)did justice to the animation characters. My one niggle was why Christian Bale had to adopt an American accent for Howl (when he is in fact British), whilst the character of Sophie spoke with a British accent - but this is just nit-picking! See this movie! It's fabulous!",9,0,1,25 June 2012
Beauty and the Beast," Enchanting!
","Reading all the negative reviews citing the 'distracting' CGI, Emma Watson not being as good as the animated Belle(!), etc., etc. I wonder what people expect when going to movies like this. Do they leave their sense of wonder at home and just look to pick holes? Well, to summarise my feelings on seeing Beauty and the Beast - I thought it was lovely! It paid respectful homage to the iconic animated original, but can stand on its own two feet as an artistic achievement. The cinematography and set decoration was magnificent, Emma Watson was fresh-faced and feisty as Belle, Luke Evans was a funny and wonderfully hateful Gaston and the musical numbers were well staged (Emma has a sweet voice which suits the songs). Only down side was that we didn't get to see very much of Dan Stevens out of beast mode - but can't help the story-line! I thought that the beast CGI was effective and managed to convey both the savage and vulnerable sides of the character. Go and see it, take your movie critic hat off and prepare to lose yourself in this magical movie.",9,2,6,30 March 2017
