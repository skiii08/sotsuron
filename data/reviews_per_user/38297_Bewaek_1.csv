Source Code," Source Code=Totally Awesome!
","Yes, These are the kinds of movies that you really need to watch.I found Source Code a very Spectacular movie and the best part of it is the awesome storyline. Well,the story is not that complex but in fact it goes really amazing every minute.The movie binds you every minute in its amazing arena that you wont even engage getting bored for a sec.Wonderful performance by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie and the cute/innocent charm of Michelle Monaghan.And I've always loved the charming persona of Vera Farmiga. At first I actually thought of the movie as an ordinary movie with a bit of fiction but this turned out to be very pleasing and totally worth it.And a great Respect to Director of the movie Duncan Jones for his tremendous hard work.Great Works should always be praised which made me write this review.",8,0,1,17 September 2011
