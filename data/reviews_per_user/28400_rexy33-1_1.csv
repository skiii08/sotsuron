Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie is a complete waste of time
","I cannot see what people found 'funny' about this movie. I wish I could have the 84 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this movie. I believe that some unpolitical correct television and film can be funny, but even the parts of the movie that were supposed to be funny, I felt were just plain silly. I must have missed something though because a lot of people thought this movie was funny. But, I am not going to go back and re-watch it to find what I missed. The best part of the movie was when Borat put the wedding sack over Pamela Anderson's head. If that is the best part, that is pretty sad. I am going to recommend to everyone I know that this movie sucks.",1,7,14,10 March 2007
