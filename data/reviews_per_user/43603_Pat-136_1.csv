Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I loved it! I will be seeing it again.
","This was a great movie! I went to see it opening night (Okay Not the very first showing...but I got tickets when I could ^_^) I really enjoyed the movie, as did all my friends. The special effects were done well, and it kept the Star Wars feel.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
