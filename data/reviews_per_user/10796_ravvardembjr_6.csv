Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 A masterpiece
","Blade Runner 2049 is, in my opinion, better than the first movie. The movie, that is almost three hours long, it doesn't seem like that, in fact, I wanted to last 30 minutes more, at least. Denis Villenueve is proving to the world, that he is one of the best directors working today, with titles like 'Arrival'; now, he has another masterpiece to add to his references. This movie is gorgeous, the visuals are incredible, something that exceeded my expectations. Ryan Gosling does his best performance ever. Harrison Ford is good also, and his presence in the movie is not only for pleasing fans of the first movie, it has a purpose. Some will say that this movie it's more complicated that the first one, but I don't think so, in fact, this movie is more easy to digest than the first one. As a note, this would not be pleasant, if you have not seen the first movie. In the end, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece, something to not be missed if you love cinema (and if you like the first movie)",10,3,13,7 October 2017
It," It, a movie that will stay with this generation
","It, is a movie that may not scare you, but god, it's really good. If the movie would have taken only 20 minutes of the 2 hours and 15 minutes of it, to explore the characters, and the rest of the film would have been scares, i'll say that it's bad. Fortunately, that's not the case. All the actors are great, and Bill Skarsgard is a great Pennywise. But, the real heart of the movie, is their under age actors, they are so charming. This movie will be a symbol for this generation, not for traumatizing it, but for marveling it.",8,3,5,21 September 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," It will please fans? Absolutely
","Infinity War is one of the most unpredictable movies of the marvel cinematic universe (even when it has some predictable things) The movie is entertaining and funny, is an 149 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. The performances of all the actors is really good, but I had to highlight the performance of Josh Brolin as the villain, Thanos. The character is terrifying and you can feel that something could go terrible wrong when he´s on screen, he is the character that, to me, is the most interesting in the movie, and thetas really good, because a movie like this without a great villain could not be a good movie, and Brolin brings something additional to the character with his performance, even when the character is made by CGI, the performance is still very powerful, is like Andy Serkis as Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes movies. The visual effects are, of course amazing and makes what the best visual effects do, make you believe that what is on screen is real. Now, I have to speak about the negative points of the movie. First, it is a lot, the story tat they´re telling here could have been not a bit of a mess (like it is the movie) if they were telling it as a 10 episode series or something like that, but a movie can´t do that, so the result that we have on screen is a lot, and sometimes you can forget what some characters were doing at the beginning of the movie because they appear in minute 10 and the appear again on minute 40. Of course, everything that´s going on is important, but that problem makes you feel a little disconnected with some characters. Speaking about the characters, there were some that were really useless in the movie, and they were only there because they were introduced before. Stay for the scene after the credits, it is amazing, not like the one in Spiderman homecoming. In the end, infinity war will please fans and it will make them even more anxious for the next avengers movie. Watch out at the end, maybe you'll cry.",8,0,0,28 April 2018
A Quiet Place," The most original and special horror movie in years
","A must see experience. I already knew that the movie was getting excellent reviews, so my expectations were high for this movie, and I was shaking at the end of it. The movie is really tense and really (and surprisingly emotional) Some would argue that this is a suspenseful movie, but is actually a horror movie, but a lot of people wont se this movie like that because at this days were not used to this type of movie. The thing is that, the movie presents this family, and we care for them, and the things that they´re going through are really terrifying, so to us is terrifying as well. The performances are excellent, with the acting there is nothing more to say than incredible. Emily Blunt is the one that gives the best performance, but everyone is brilliant. Her husband (the director, co writer and star in the movie) proves that he is capable enough to take a project as interesting as this and not leave it just in interesting. The work that he does is fantastic, specially with the sound of the movie that is one of the main protagonist in the movie. I have two issues with the movie. The first is that, (this is not a spoiler) Emily Blunt´s character is pregnant, and that is not believable, not considering the situation that the characters are living, it´s true that the pregnancy stuff adds something to the movie, but still is not believable. And the second flaw that I found was the last twenty seconds of the movie. That is when you notice that the movie was produced by Michael Bay. At the end, A Quiet Place is one of the most intense and scary movies that I have seen, and I highly recommend this movie, I can say that the movie was an experience. And please, stay as quiet as possible in the movie, because it will not be the same if you're eating popcorn very loud, or if you're cellphone rings in the middle of the movie.",9,14,27,9 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the best Star Wars movie, but it´s a good one.
","Star Wars: Episode VIII- The last jedi, is a good movie. Is not the best of all, but is good, and there are some things that are interesting. Even that the movie is 152 minutes long, it doesn't´t feel that long. I like Episode VII more than this, but this movie feels a little more epic. Rain Johnson is a good director, not only let us see the characters developed in the way they do, but also visually, is stunning. The performances are amazing, specially from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill, not saying that the other actors are not good, because everyone is great, but Daisy and Mark gave the best performances of their careers in this movie. 
The issues of this movie, at least to me, is that the movie takes some decisions that they were not good for the movie (like the direction of a character, and the fact that the movie could be 20 minutes short) I would love to explore Laura Dern character a little bit more. Also, the movie could use some more dark moments. 
Leaving that behind, the movie was entertaining and has some epic moments, that in the future, Star Wars fans will look up to.",8,1,1,15 December 2017
Mother!," The best movie of Darren Aronofsky
","Mother! Is just excellent. This movie really is worth seeing, even if it's just for the talking after the movie. I understand why a lot of people don't like it, but I can assure you, that if you put all your attention on the movie, you will like it. It's better that if you're a serious religious person, you will not like it. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent, Oscar worthy. The photography is beautiful,so as the sound. Mother!, is a perfect movie, one that will keep people talking, and it will be a cult movie in a near future.",10,3,15,23 September 2017
