The Rock," A fun little action movie
","The first thing I must say is that I love Michael Bay movies. Even Pearl Harbor. (will be awaiting flames for that) I have not seen all of his movies yet, and this is the most recent of his that I have viewed. I used to think that Transformers was his best film, but all of that changed when I saw The Rock. This is a great movie all around. The chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage is great, and Ed Harris is great as a villain. (He also does a great job in Enemy At The Gates) Sure there is some cheesy dialog, but then again, what is an action movie without a little bit of cheese? Some of the action is over the top. But once again, that is what you would see in your normal everyday action movie. The only things I can say bad about this movie is the fact that there is not enough of it. Oh well, what can you do about it? 9 stars out of 10, due to the fact that there is not enough of it.",9,6,9,16 December 2007
Spider-Man 3," No, seriously, where is the actual Spiderman 3?
","Ugh. What the hell did I just see? Sam Raimi, you are better than this. Just why? This is such a huge disappointment compared to the last two Spiderman films. In fact, this is like the Terminator trilogy. Great first film, excellent second film, and horrible third film. Where do I begin? Well, be prepared for some serious spoilers. Okay, the correct title of this film should've been Spiderman 2.5: Mary Jane Can't Stop B!tching! Throughout the whole movie, all Mary Jane does is whine and complain about her acting career, and does not shut up for one second. It is annoying! I actually clapped at the part where Peter Parker slapped her. You also have Peter Parker as an emo which is equal to, if not, more annoying than Mary Jane and her whining. And for those of you Venom fans, you will be hugely let down. Venom happens to be my favorite of all the Spiderman villains, and Sam Raimi had to go f*** him up. The only good things I can say about this film is that the special effects done on Sandman were very good, James Franco was good as the New Goblin, and Bruce Campbell's cameo as the receptionist in the French restaurant was hilarious. If you are hoping for a good Spiderman film like the last two, don't be fooled, this is not what it is. Hopefully Sam Raimi fixes all these mistakes with Spiderman 4.Spiderman 3: 2 stars out of 10.",2,0,1,16 December 2007
Big Fish," A pleasant surprise
","Big Fish is an interesting movie for me to review. For one thing, it is directed by Tim Burton, and I generally don't like Tim Burton's movies. (What he did to Charlie and the Choclolate Factory was despicable in my opinion) But Big Fish did something that I thought any Tim Burton movie would never do: make me think that this was an enjoyable movie. Big Fish stars Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episodes 1-3, The Island, Black Hawk Down) as Edward Bloom, a man who considers himself to be a big fish in a small pond, hence the title of the movie. Now, the story of Big Fish is told on two fronts: the first front being Edward Bloom as an old man in the present day dying from cancer, telling his son's wife all of these stories of his own youth, however, the son believes that the stories that his father tells are nothing but lies, and this whole part of the movie is the son, William, trying to know more about his father by getting his father to tell him the truth about his life before his eventual death, The second front is told in the late 1950s and mid 1960s with the young Edward Bloom living these stories that the older version of Edward Bloom is telling, even though the stories told are pretty exaggerated. There are also nice cameos of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, and Steve Buscemi. I thought that Big Fish was a very good movie, and it easily earns a place on my Top 100 Movies of All Time list. Now this movie does suffer from a few weaknesses. One weakness is the fact that the movie has the same Burton-style animation, and I have never really been that big of a fan of his animation style. The second weakness is that I personally thought that there was a little bit of deadweight. However, I find these weaknesses to be pretty minimal. I'm surprised that this movie only got a very limited release when it first came out, because I think that it would have done very well in the theaters. Overall, Big Fish is a very nice movie, and it really surprised me, because I loved this movie. I give Big Fish 8.5 stars out of 10, and if you see it at your local video store, I say pick it up and give it a chance. It could very well worth your while.",8,3,4,27 November 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Ignore the bad reviews, unless of course you hated the first one.
","Well, I've been waiting for two years to see this movie, and now it is finally a reality. I loved the first Transformers, being a fan of the Autobots and Decepticons ever since I was a toddler, and since I loved the 2007 movie, it was no surprise that this was my #1 anticipated movie of 2009. Now, having read all the bad reviews and the negative word-of-mouth, I was so scared that this movie was going to suck. However, I watched this movie three times in a row, and I can easily say that it is so far my favorite movie of 2009. And it has also become my new favorite comic book superhero movie. Sorry Watchmen, you've been usurped.First, let's start out with the general idea.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen takes place two years after the first movie left off. Both the Autobots and Decepticons have been in a stalemate, while Optimus Prime and the Autobots have teamed up with a new, elite military unit that specializes in fighting the Decepticons, known simply as NEST. After discovering a Decepticon in Shanghai, wrecking most of the city in the process of fighting the Decepticon, the Autobots receive a warning that an ancient being known as The Fallen will have his revenge. After touching a sliver of the All-Spark that was caught in his hooded sweatshirt, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) starts seeing images in his head of the Fallen and starts drawing strange Cybertroinan symbols. While this is happening, the United States government wants to force the Autobots to leave, believing it to be the only way to stop the Autobot-Decepticon skirmishes from destroying all the major cities on Earth. Sam Witwicky, now a college student, is asked by Optimus to be a sort of peace ambassador for the Autobots to convince the government to let them stay on Earth, but Sam says no. Then everything stars to go really bad when the Decepticons steal a fragment of the Allspark from a Naval base and use it to revive the dead Megatron.The Good After seeing Transformers 1, I was actually wondering how they were going to top it, but they did. This has got to be some of the best action scenes that I have seen in years, even better than the action scenes in The Dark Knight. ILM has really outdone themselves, after seeing the effects they did in the first one, Iron Man, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. You had some entertaining new characters (Mudflap and Skids, also known as The Twins, and they are not racist at all, and they are not the new Jar-Jar Binks like some people say. The humor was very funny, and everyone, in all three times I was a the theater, laughed at every single joke in the movie. And the IMAX experience is just great.The Bad I don't really have anything bad to say about this one, except for the fact that it was kind of a little long, and could have been cut down a little bit. The Deceptions and The Fallen's plans to destroy Earth was kind of stupid, and I wished that Soundwave, my favorite Decepticon, could have had a few fight scenes himself instead of just floating around in space the whole time. Hopefully, he'll be in Transformers 3 and he'll actually have fight scenes this time.Overall The general consensus is this. If you hated the first one, then don't see this one, it won't change your opinion, but if you loved this one, then this is a must-see. If you loved the first one, then by all means, ignore the bad reviews, and go out and have a good time. And now, I wait patiently for July 4, 2012 for the third one.",9,3,8,27 June 2009
