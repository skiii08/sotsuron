Requiem for a Dream," The most powerful movie I've ever seen.
","Words really can not describe this movie. It must be seen to believe it.I consider myself a real movie lover. You know,  when you see so many movies, sometimes they begin to look mediocre. Then you watch a  movie and re-discover the power of cinema.Requiem For A Dream, even if there can be a very little number of people out there who don't like the movie, I'm sure that they can't deny the impact of it.It's an incredible movie.",Null,0,0,3 March 2001
