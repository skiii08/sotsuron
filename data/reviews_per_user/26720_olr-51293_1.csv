Blade Runner 2049," Sadly a right-wing universe instead of a humanist one
","Disappointing.What have they done to Blade Runner?? In the new Blade Runner in the year 2049 the cop kills innocent citizen despite his being peaceful and a productive member of society. The cop murders a man who has done nothing wrong in 30 years, but is simply to be taken in because he is who he is (his background).Later in the film the cop deals with a low-level thug and leaves the industrialist/capitalist who is putting the world in danger alone. The thug is a mere employee of the capitalist tycoon.Sadly, like any right-wing fascist state the cops are under the control of the industry and the thug walks into the police station and kills the chief of police without any objection. Indeed, earlier the employee of the rich CEO walks in and takes evidence from the police.Let us all hope this future doe snot come to pass. Fascism and right-wing rule are evil.The pictures are gloomy and expensive, but a film with bad morals is not for me and cannot be endorsed.",Null,5,10,24 October 2017
