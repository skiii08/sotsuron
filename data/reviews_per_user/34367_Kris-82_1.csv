The Blair Witch Project," I don't get it
","I saw the film when it opened this past weekend.  I was so excited for several days before I saw it because I had heard that it was the scariest movie ever made.  Well, I went to the film with five others and none of us thought it was scary.  Much of the audience was laughing during many parts of it.  I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read everything about it on the Internet before I saw it. We rented the 1963 version of 'The Haunting' afterwards and thought that it was much scarier than 'Blair Witch'. I thought the movie was good just because of the way it was made but it was not really scary at all.  The last scene was what I had hoped the whole movie would be like but then it ended.",6,1,4,20 July 1999
