Hereditary," This movie sucked.

The Revenant," Did not need the same modeling of other films
","I'm thinking this is one of the best films I've seen in years. Acting, production, scenery (of course), and camera work were all top notch. I know people wanted better character development and not such long stretches of quiet but the way it was filmed brings you back to that date and time, makes you know what it must have really been like trying to make a living hunting and trapping amongst tribes of Indians whom we were impinging on their way of life and ruining what was always their land, their animals and especially their ways.
The bear attack was phenomenal and so real I nearly screamed out loud and I've never done that at any movie, ever.
The attempts to save each other, when to run, when to not attempt to save others, all these things caused you to put yourself in their shoes and that's what I love in a story. Not how it's contrived or how it stands up to other contrived stories. It was a story that needed to be told, was extremely well acted, the scenery was worth the whole thing then you get so much more. Emotionally moving and stunningly delivered.",9,0,0,16 July 2018
