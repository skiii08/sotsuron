Ford v Ferrari," Walked out of Midway to see this
",Best movie decision I ever made. Great acting and story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both on top of their respective games.,8,1,4,20 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Good, not great
","Lasted only a few mins with Hateful 8. This movie is good, but besides Hateful 8, arguably Tarantino's worst. Still good, but was disappointed",6,1,1,31 July 2019
Midway," Walked out after 15 mins
","Tha acting and dialogue were so contrived and poorly done, there was no way I could sit through 2 more hours of it. Saw Ford vs Ferrari instead. Best move I could've made.",4,3,10,20 November 2019
