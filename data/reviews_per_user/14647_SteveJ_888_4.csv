Black Swan," A New Low for Aronofsky ...
","Is it possible for a filmmaker to make a good movie followed by a exceptional movie followed by a poor movie followed by a very good movie followed by an complete dud which earns the lead actress an Oscar? It is if the filmmaker is Darren Aronofsky.Black Swan is so bad it could be 'funny bad' - but it's such a weak attempt by a good director that it seems sad to laugh a it. The movie has little to offer. The story is slow and unclear. The characters are shallow and not one is the least bit likable, so even if it were possible to understand what is happening - which it isn't - why would anyone care?The usually good Vincent Cassel presents us with a lifeless cliché of a character – little more than a cardboard cutout with movable lips. Same for Barbara Hersey. Mila Kunis gives a passable performance – a stand-out relative to the others. Natalie Portman recycles the same three facial expressions for the entire film. Is that all it takes to win an Oscar?The viewer can't know if events in the film are real or imagined. That's not a problem if the events can be understood in terms of the characters' inner lives. That can't happen in Black Swan, so the events become arbitrary and meaningless nonsense. The feel of the whole thing is phony – slick, artsy, and without substance.The film is badly paced and visually unattractive. The music is relentlessly bombastic and headache-inducing, and the dancing is terrible. The film is boring and lacks humor. With the exception of a very brief segment which depicts a drug-induced experience Black Swan is completely devoid of anything resembling art.I never quit on a film. I consider it a badge of honor to have endured the worst of the worst. I must have asked myself 'How much longer?' a record number of times during Black Swan, even though the film is only 108 minutes long. It seemed like 308 minutes.",1,12,20,1 June 2011
127 Hours," A Missed Opportunity
","Part of the problem is that the subject matter raises the standard for a film such as this. The story would seem to require a tone and a style that's driven by some essential truth – not necessarily a literal dramatization, but something fundamental and permanent for the viewer to discover or reflect upon. If that's not in Danny Boyle's bag of tricks – fine. I just wish he had left the story for someone else.The film is noisy and cluttered. It's like a person with little to say that never stops talking for fear of a lull in the conversation. The music is abrasive and usually feels like an intrusion. There seems to be little effort by the filmmakers to create a mood that conveys what the experience must have been like. There is no passage of time – only images of a watch. Whenever something genuine seems ready to emerge it's preempted by some montage of remote events, as if the viewer constantly needs to be reminded that life goes on somewhere else.Visually, you would think that it would be hard for a film like this to miss. There are some great shots, but the effect is never sustained. It's always undermined by some subsequent material, as if the filmmakers have an unconscious need to negate anything beautiful in their own work.John Franco gives a decent performance, but many of the character's actions don't seem plausible in the given situations, due to the writing. The film's biggest flaw is that it's simply not believable.If you haven't already read the book, you'll want to after seeing 127 Hours. The film simply doesn't ring true. Hopefully other filmmakers who have a greater affinity for the subject will take it on at some point in the future – either as a documentary or a dramatization. It's a story that deserves to be told well.",4,9,16,28 June 2011
Mother!," Violent and Gross Failure!
","There's the good Darren Aronofsky, and there's the bad Darren Aronofsky. I should have checked first. It's easy to do. A minute or two on IMDB would have told me what I needed to know. A careful examination of the DVD box would have been a tip-off. I committed two hours of my time based on 5 seconds of observation and paid for it. I thought with Javier Bardem and Ed Harris in the movie it would be OK.Darren Aronofsky has made some fine movies, and he'll probably make others. You can add Mother to his list of stinkers.I can hardly bring myself to comment further, other than to say that if you like to drown in self-pity and celebrate all things lost, desperate and hopeless, Mother is probably for you. Maybe the movie is meant to be a black deadpan comedy. The same joke over and over again gets tired, though.If you look at Mother as a standard horror movie it's long, morose, and not scary. It's just violent and gross.It's sad to see top professionals taking themselves seriously in a miserable, ridiculous movie. I'll take a bad low-budget horror movie where there's some fun anytime.P.S. After watching the movie and eating a late dinner, I wrote this and went to bed. I had the sickest dream. It was sicker than Aronofsky's movie and a lot funnier.",4,4,7,10 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," I Was Shocked
","What could have been a decent movie is so horribly flawed by a major defect that it plays like a B movie with big-budget production. Most of the first hour is so laughable that nothing that happens subsequently can save it.The flaw is that behavior of the mission's captain and crew are are completely implausible. On a whim, the original mission is put on hold when a potential new destination for colonization presents itself. Because the planet has a breathable atmosphere the crew lands to investigate it without any concerns whatsoever for possible hazards, biological or otherwise. At that point, I reached for DVD box to double-check. Did Ridley Scott really direct this foolishness? Unbelievable. All I could think was 'Dumb and Dumber' in space.Even without this fatal defect, the movie is nothing special. With the exception of Michael Fassbender, the acting is weak. The characters are shallow, and unlikable, and there is no thematic development whatsoever. It's just another action movie in space.The movie goes from bad to just plain annoying - particularly the demonization of the creatures as some kind of pathological deviants. Unlike the humans the creatures behave exactly as they are supposed to, according to their design. World-class scientists would have some appreciation for this, even as they try to destroy the aliens.But there is no sense of awe - only cries of 'Let's get this motherf-----.' By the end of the movie I was rooting for the aliens.The usual big-budget production is impressive, but so what? No food for thought. Not even any artful suspense. Too bad.",4,2,4,30 November 2017
