Casablanca," Here's Looking at CASABLANCA
","Occasionally, great films are happy accidents. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN were written and produced in unconventional ways. So was CASABLANCA. It was a wartime romantic melodrama based on an unproduced play. Everybody thought that it would be good, but nobody considered it special.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman weren't part of the original cast; their roles were originally slated for Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan. George Raft was also considered for the lead. Raft and Reagan were unavailable, though, so the role of Rick Blaine went to the only man who could have played it.The screenplay is another oddity. Julius and Philip Epstein began by extensively revising a stage play called 'Everybody Comes to Rick's'. When the Epsteins were called away to another assignment, Howard Koch took over. Later, the Epsteins returned to collaborate with Koch on the film's final act. Despite the multiple writing credits, the film is very unified.The film is set in French Morocco in 1941. The port city of Casablanca is a stopping point on the refugee trail. Refugees are pouring into the city, but they can't leave without exit visas. Cafe owner Rick Blaine is accidentally left with two letters of transit, documents which allow the bearer to travel without a visa. No sooner do the letters fall into his hands than his former lover, Ilsa Lund (Bergman) arrives with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo is a charismatic Underground leader sought by the Nazis. Their only hope for escape from Casablanca is the letters of transit held by Rick.Ilsa is torn between the two men. She loves Rick, but she also loves Laszlo. She realizes that she is the inspiration for his work against the Nazis.The background for the love triangle is the film's array of memorable supporting characters. Louis Renault (Claude Rains) is the local police chief who trades exit visas for sexual favors. (The film is surprisingly frank about this.) Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a small-time thief who is arrested for murder. Ferari (Sidney Greenstreet) is a rival club owner and a key figure in the local black market. There are also the employees of Rick's Cafe, led by Sam (Dooley Wilson). The Germans are led by snarling bully Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt). All of these characters and their various story threads are introduced in a long series of scenes depicting a typical night at the Cafe.Movie plots usually follow a three-act structure. CASABLANCA has a more Shakespearean five-act structure. Act 1, which introduces the various characters and subplots, ends with Ilsa's reunion with Rick. Act 2 consists of Rick's reminiscences of his affair with Ilsa. Act 3, which shows Laszlo's futile attempts to get exit visas, ends with his confrontation with a group of Nazis at Rick's. After this, the events of the last two acts (the night of the resistance meeting and the resolution of the love triangle) are inevitable.Some of the film's plot points are pure fiction. For one thing, there's no such thing as a letter of transit. It's a plot device, a McGuffin. Besides, if the Nazis really wanted a person, no document would prevent them from arresting him. For another, even if Ugarte did get letters of transit, he wouldn't have sold them. He certainly would not have given them to Rick. He would have used them to leave Casablanca. These plot points don't make sense. The Epsteins slide them past us with great dialogue and wonderful characters. After all, if Rick doesn't get the letters, we don't have a movie.CASABLANCA is a movie about love and sacrifice. It has one of the greatest endings in movie history. In fact, it has the only ending it can possibly have.",10,1,3,10 July 2006
Singin' in the Rain," That's What They Said About the Horseless Carriage!
","'Singin' in the Rain' is a great movie about change. The change it describes, of course, is Hollywood's shift from silent film to talkies in the late 1920s. Ironically, it was made during another period of change. In 1952, Hollywood was shifting from mostly black and white movies to mostly color and from standard format (1.33:1) to widescreen. 'Singin' in the Rain' bridges the gap; it's shot in Technicolor in standard format.A better title might have been 'Dancin' in the Rain'. Almost all of the musical numbers have their dance sequences. From Gene Kelly's tap duets with Donald O'Connor to his fantasy ballet with Cyd Charisse, the film is a study of the human body in motion.In most musicals, the songs are written to fit the simple plot. In this one, a complex plot was constructed to fit songs that were over 20 years old, and it works. The film doesn't stand still during the musical numbers: the plot drives the songs and the songs drive the plot. The 'Broadway Ballet' finale and the corny but hilarious ending are epilogue; the film's real climax is the scene where Don Lockwood (Kelly) dances along a rain-washed street. He has fallen in love with the girl of his dreams. The problem of Lina's voice has been solved. Everything that follows is inevitable.Set in 1927, the plot revolves around silent star Don Lockwood, his on screen romance with Lina LaMont (Jean Hagen) and his off-screen romance with aspiring actress Cathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Mix the love triangle, the career-wrecking advent of talking pictures and comic relief man Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) and stir liberally for a great screwball musical comedy.The coming of sound destroyed the careers of many silent film stars. It was a form of entertainment-industry Darwinism. Those who didn't have good voices suddenly couldn't get work. Don is a wonderful song & dance man, but Lina's voice is sharp enough to cut steel. Until now, her job has been to look pretty and pantomime on the silent screen. As Cosmo puts it, 'She can't sing, she can't dance and she can't act. A triple threat.' Her well-rounded incompetence and her spoiled-brat attitude make her one of the greatest comedy villains of all time.Most movies try to hide the tricks of the trade, but 'Singin' in the Rain' is a movie about film-making. It revels in the secrets of movie-making and the technical foibles of early sound films. In one of its most memorable scenes, Don declares his love for Cathy on a movie set. In the process, he demonstrates some special effects machinery.For the 50th anniversary edition, Warner Bros. (which now owns the rights to the movie) has put together a handsome 2-DVD package worthy of the film. The documentaries on disc 2 are all interesting. The easter eggs (on both discs) are even better. In fact, the egg on disc 1 is one of my all-time favorites.",10,1,3,21 June 2006
Some Like It Hot," Cross Dressing and Cross Purposes
","Hidden identity is a running theme in SOME LIKE IT HOT. Two musicians, Jerry and Joe (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) witness a brutal Mob hit orchestrated by 'Spats' Colombo (George Raft). This is Chicago in 1929. Our two heroes know how the Mob deals with potential witnesses. They respond, in typical screwball comedy fashion, by disguising themselves as women, joining an all-girls band and fleeing to Florida. This doesn't really make sense, but hey, it's screwball comedy. It's not supposed to make sense.Of course, our two cross-dressing fugitives run into the ultimate real woman: Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). We know that at least one of them will end up in love with her, just as we know that a showdown with Spats is inevitable. It's the film's other twists and turns that make it unpredictable.There is one more predictable twist to the movie: a man will fall in love with one of our cross-dresing fugitives. The fall guy is millionaire Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown), who delivers the film's ultimate punch line. Naturally, Fielding passes up all of the beautiful women in the band and woos the homeliest gal of the bunch. He introduces himself in a priceless scene in which each punch line sets up the next. Eventually, Fielding tangoes with 'Daphne' (Lemmon) while 'Josephine' (Curtis) disguises himself as a millionaire and lures Sugar to Fielding's yacht. Brown and Lemmon tango with superb comic timing, even passing a rose back and forth between their teeth. Meanwhile, Curtis and Monroe engage in one of filmdom's most famous love scenes.Dialogue drives SOME LIKE IT HOT. It's high-octane dialogue, too. The script, by director Billy Wilder and screenwriter I. A. L. Diamond, is a marathon of punch lines. Even the best visual gags usually have a line or two of dialogue to set them up or follow them. Usually, the dialogue comments the film's oddball situations. For instance, when we first see Jerry and Joe in drag, they complain about how hard it is to walk in high heels. Sugar immediately appears, gracefully strutting in heels through some well-timed puffs of steam. The men see her and comment, 'It's like a whole other sex!'Like its main characters, SOME LIKE IT HOT is in disguise. It features gangsters, but it's not a gangster film. It has musical numbers, but it's not a musical. It's really a comedy about sex, and nothing more. It firmly cemented Marilyn Monroe's reputation. She is the benchmark, the ultimate sex symbol against which all others are measured.",10,5,9,13 July 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," Perfect For Black & White
","Most of my friends know that I prefer black & white movies to color. Black & white can be very visually expressive, with its brilliant foregrounds and its deep shadows. It can also be perfectly suited to certain subject matter. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD examines the difference between good and evil. For this, we need infinite shades of grey.The story takes place in a small Alabama town during the Depression. The central characters are Jem Finch, his sister Jean Louise (nicknamed Scout) and their father, Atticus (Gregory Peck). At first, the movie seems innocent. It concentrates on the children's attempts to get a glimpse of Boo Radley, the local recluse. This sense of quiet innocence is about to be shattered.Atticus, a lawyer, is appointed to defend a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman. The man, Tom Robinson, is an honest, hard-working field hand. The accusers, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are the town pariahs. Bob Ewell is an unemployed drunk, an abusive father and, as we will discover, a liar. His daughter Mayella is a truly pitiable character: she must deal with her drunken father and care for her siblings. In expressing sexual attraction to a black man, she has broken one of the deepest unwritten laws of her society. She lies both to cover her feelings and to avoid her father's wrath. Tom Robinson has also violated an unwritten law: he has felt pity for a white woman. Thus Tom is punished for a virtue while the Ewells are rewarded for bearing false witness.Atticus Finch seems untouched by the rampant prejudices of Southern society. Compared to the other characters in the film, he seems impossibly noble. Many of the film's adult characters claim to be Christian, but Atticus is the only one who seems to live by Christian principles. He has a choice between the easy thing to do and the right thing to do. As the story develops, we come to see him as a hero battling to the end against impossible odds. Still, every hero has an eventual Ragnarok. Though Atticus proves Tom's innocence beyond all possible doubt, prejudice has stacked the deck completely against him. Tom Robinson is found guilty and eventually killed.Still, we must honor the hero, even in defeat. So Stand up, Miss Jean Louise. Your father's passin'!",10,2,4,14 July 2006
