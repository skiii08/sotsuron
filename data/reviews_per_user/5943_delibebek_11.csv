Source Code," Outstanding
","This movie sneaks up on you, despite the basic premise being laid out early on. It reveals slowly, with great pacing. The science fiction aspect of the plot is daring, but the story hangs on to it without getting drowned in concepts. The characters, the acting, are exactly what they need to be to make you care what happens next, and the ending is totally satisfying. You don't want it to end until the end, and when it does, you'll smile, knowing that it all worked out.Asks the same question The Matrix asked, but without the pretension, without the slow-mo fighting, just with a perfect blend of science fiction, metaphysics and heart.",Null,1,2,15 July 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Boy was this different
","This movie was so unlike the original, and I don't mean just the extra 'u' and 'e' in the title words. For one thing, there was no black guy on the team. He was one of the best characters in the original, but I guess it would have been confusing for one of the Jewish-Americans to be black. Something like that would require a lot of explaining and would strain credibility.I don't remember so much of the girl and the war hero from the original. As I recall, it followed the team and that's it, but the movie was great, although being a relatively low budget production, it suffered during some of the action sequences. This new movie by Quentin Tarrantino had plenty of budget, but chose a different direction for the story, springing from some of the basic story elements and making something more ambitious from it.The introductory scenes for Landa and Emmanuelle were a bit long, longer than they really had to be, but thankfully, this was as indulgent as Tarrantino got in this movie. The rest of the movie began to weave together in crisper scenes, with dialogue that captured interest rather than leading the viewer into little eddies of vacant thought that would only get away from the main thread of the movie. Quentin steered us pretty well past lots of bits that might have been going on beside the main story.However, while the director reined himself in a bit, Mr. Pitt overplayed far too much. I'm not sure why he wants so much to be a character actor, but from this outing he just doesn't have a feel for it. I could find better work in a workshop, but I guess there's a machinery behind the presence of stars in movies.Overall, I got more excited about the direction of the movie as it went on, and I was very entertained by the climactic scene. It is definitely a movie I will want to watch again. Like much of Tarrantino's work, it has the semblance of layers in the dialogue and enough peculiarity to the perspectives in the scenes to make one enjoy watching it again as well. First, though, I'll have to go back and watch 'The Inglorious Bastards' just to remind myself why I enjoyed that one too.",Null,1,5,8 March 2010
Billy Elliot," Finding beauty
","'Billy Elliot' isn't about a boy wanting to dance. It isn't about a miners' strike in the mid-1980s. These are only the elements which happen to be chose to tell this story. The story is about finding beauty in the world, finding it despite the chaos and conformity that surrounds youth.Billy, through the course of the movie, struggles to find his own direction in life at a very young age. It's quite easy to understand this because of the choices of setting and character made for the sake of the story.Billy is relatively young, making him subject to the pressures of his father and older brother. The time and place of the story, with police riot squads being a fixture on the streets, underscores the difficulty in being drawn to ballet, an activity not considered fitting among his family and peers. Still he pursues his passion.The performances paint the picture perfectly. They are convincing and compelling renditions of the characters in this light, enjoyable drama.",7,3,6,27 August 2009
The Hurt Locker," Well-made movie
","My first instinct when watching a movie about the U.S. Army is to join the crowd of checkers mentally noting all the things that don't agree with my experience. I have gradually learned to stifle this, realizing that even the most devoted filmmaker has to make some concessions to the understand of civilians. There's a language within the military that doesn't filter out very well to something as brief as a typical feature. I also know that a movie like 'The Hurt Locker' isn't intended to be documentary.However, as I watch 'The Hurt Locker' barely a day after its win at the Oscars, I am interested to see how the movie weaves several vignettes in a cohesive story, and it manages to show several different types of experiences that soldiers have in the cities in Iraq - the uncertainty of each moment, the complacency that one has to fight during the last days in country. More, it shows a lot of different approaches to dealing with the potential threats - some good, some bad, but mostly just mediocre in varied ways.The main characters, the three members of the explosive ordnance team, are believable. One is bravado with a layer or two underneath, another the strict rulebook soldier and the third just looking for some direction and the plane headed south.In its essence, the images and the filming of this movie are refreshingly and disturbingly accurate. In its details, it brings together very rare experiences into a very small team of soldiers, which makes it seem as if every soldier has days like these - rolling through the city of Baghdad in a single truck, coming home to some whiskey, occasionally alluding to trips to brothels. I can say some of these things happen more often than others, but rarely to the same person in such close succession.But again, this is Hollywood, capturing the most interesting possibilities of the place and the characters, and creating a mood and setting that supports it. It isn't reality, but then, neither is 'Avatar.'",8,3,14,8 March 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Brilliant
","This is the way Hollywood should learn to balance the suspense of a thriller and the character of a good drama. The chemistry between the two leads and their ability to convey the complexities of their relationship are a huge draw when watching this movie.The girl is complex, and this first movie in the trilogy only gives a glimpse of her back story - a violent young woman, who at 24 years old is still saddled with a guardian who wants to oversee her money and all her activities. Even though she is the title character, the investigator/journalist who crosses paths with her is really the driving persona in the story. We follow him into a murder mystery, where her story is only a backdrop to her character and her motivation for helping the investigation.The murder mystery itself is just as compelling as it begins to take the lead. While the structure of setting up such complex characters before getting into the main storyline is a little foreign to the American audience, it's necessary for a story with such characters and it's handled seamlessly here. The story never loses its drive, and its climax touching on issues of race dynamics, twisted psychologies and dysfunctional families, is worth every moment of the film's buildup.And the second movie in the trilogy is even better!",9,11,17,18 August 2010
Into the Wild," Should have kept it simple
","It's a difficult to task to bring a true story to film and do justice to it. It's even harder when the main character, around whom the entire film revolves, isn't around to help out. Even so, if the filmmakers keep in mind the character's actions and movement through the various phases of the narrative, the story can come out both coherent and true to the existing knowledge of the person's life.In the case of 'Into the Wild' the film was unfortunately made in such a way as to overpower notions of the life of Chris McCandless by excesses in the making of the film. The slow- motion scene of Chris almost falling into a river might make sense to someone who has read the book but it just hangs around in the middle of the movie. The hand-held motions and quick zooms during the self-detox scene tend to obscure what's going on more than to tell the story. All throughout, the mood music is to monotonous. I have an understanding of the use of leitmotif, but this isn't the case here. It's just the same music used throughout the nearly two and a half hours of this movie.The performances are reasonably good, but the depictions of Chris's family back home are overwrought snippets that are emotionally detached for the viewer. I felt I was seeing outtakes of a drama workshop, rather than a professionally made film.This film could be interesting. It's an interesting topic and even more poignant because it's essentially true. I can't complain that the movie took liberties, because it didn't. It's failure is that the film makers worked too hard to make things interesting and their efforts are only distracting.",5,2,4,29 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Mythology from whimsy
","This version of the story really isn't a version but a continuation with the same title. However, this continuation treats Wonderland in a totally different light, with elements of Carroll's works thrown together into a mythology of Wonderland. Depending on what one liked about the original story, a viewer would either enjoy the new perspective or be incredibly offended.In the first place, two things are apparent: there are lots of special effects, and there is a lot of screen time for Johnny Depp. The effects are nice enough, in keeping with the level of quality of contemporary movies. It's better than average, although the color design seems drab. Depp doesn't display a good feel for the role, strangely enough. Maybe it's because we've seen too much of him and we can hear a bit of Jack Sparrow here, a trace of Willy Wonka there, but very little Chocolat anywhere. It's another Tim Burton movie for Depp.The story takes the whimsy of the original and creates a mythology from it. In this way, it becomes another Hollywood effort to turn an older and respected story into a sword and sorcery epic. In this case, the epic doesn't have the juice, since it squeezed all the satire out of the original and used the superficial husk that was left. The familiar whimsical elements are treated too seriously and fail to be entertaining. The story drags on too long and begins to look just like any other special effects movie, complete with roaring monsters, last-minute escapes and a chorus of women singing some unrecognizable words at a climactic moment.On a personal note, I can't fathom that the filmmakers didn't get the name of the beast - the Jabberwock. It's mentioned several times in the original poem, which they chopped up for no reason. The name of the poem in the original is clearly 'Jabberwocky' but at no time is that considered to be the name of the beast itself, until this movie. As one of those poor young men who took the time to memorize the poem for his own amusement, I'm personally offended at the carelessness in weaving these components from the original work.Overall, it's an unworthy contribution to the name of Wonderland. If you never liked Wonderland, you may like this more than I did.",5,4,7,11 August 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Great fun even without the kids
","I wasn't expecting a kid movie, and I didn't get one. Granted, this movie is kid-friendly, but it has enough substance in the story that it doesn't get weighed down with mind-altering attempts at comic relief. The story is enough without any inanities.Hiccup is about as non-Viking as a Viking can be, and of course, his dad is the chief of the island, and the biggest, most Vikingest Viking that a Viking can be. He tries to use his skills to fit in and impress his dad, but his skills aren't physical. He's more of a thinker and a problem solver.When he befriends one of the most legendary dragons, which no one else has even seen, he begins to see into the nature of the dragons and how to deal with them. It isn't easy to convince the Vikings of this, but the circumstances of the story eventually take care of that problem.The 'chemistry' between Hiccup and the dragon Toothless is amazing considering that this is animation. All the characters are well-designed to bring out the characters, but Toothless is an impressive feat in his movements and his ability to convey emotions through expressions and body language throughout the movie.The action in this movie is pretty eye-popping, but some of the more understated scenes are pretty striking in their own ways, such as the fight in the clouds when the Vikings are simply observing flashes of light. For a warrior people who venerate Thor and Odin, such a scene must have been dramatic in a different way.Comic relief is here in the form of some of Hiccup's peers, and while they may have had more character in the book, they seem to be kind of sporadic in their scenes here. As a compliment, at last they aren't overused meddling goofups filling in for plot points with contrivances, as you might see in lesser movies. They definitely have character, even if it doesn't have a chance to show. The story stays focused and gets where it needs to be by the end.Overall, all the elements in this movie make it worth seeing. I'd even be up for a second viewing.",7,2,7,27 March 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Mediocre adaptation
","I won't color my attitude of the movie with any notions about the subject matter. The movie only adapts the story of the best-selling novel. Obviously it wouldn't have been funded and produced had the book not established a following; controversy didn't hurt either.I watched this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I didn't find it captivating. I spent a lot of mental energy trying to follow it. I recently read the book (finally) and I found it not hard to follow at all. I found myself wondering what was wrong with the movie, that it couldn't capture the disturbingly over-explained exposition in Dan Brown's writing style. I watched it again this evening and I find the big problem to be that it follows the story too well.The story about the search for some great secret, a race between the hero and heroine and a criminal reformed by a sect of the Catholic church. They want to preserve the secret and he wants to destroy it. We spend most of the movie, as we spent most of the novel, not quite being told what the secret is, but it is clear from the beginning that it involves some of the great names in history - Leonardo da Vinci, Jesus Christ, Isaac Newton, etc. It must have something to do with the church, and there is a lot of implication (and explication) about the church having forced the secret to be kept hidden.Without debating whether the story has any validity, or even whether it is clever or pedestrian, the strength of it is in the way the story is told. Dan Brown wrote the book in short chapters, changing the point of view, working in minor cliffhangers of ideas here and there to keep the reader pushing forward. It is a quick read, as books go. However, when this is filmed scene by scene, it becomes tedious. It seems necessary to go into such detail, given the nature of the story, building on little bits of history and the revision and speculation of history as it has been unwritten and rewritten and wondered at even into our times.Two things this movie needed were a sharper screenplay, and a director interested in pacing the story by the key plot elements, not just the action sequences.Ian McKellan is excellent as Leigh Teabing. Even in his long explanations of da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' and the implied symbology contained in the composition of it, he sparkles, simply by the power of his well-trained and well-used voice. Jean Reno lives up to expectation equally well as the French police Captain chasing the hero and heroine.Tom Hanks is disappointing as Robert Langdon, the hero who happens to know the history inside and out, but has trouble with relatively simple anagrams that has most viewers (as readers) guessing the answer ahead of him. Tom gives us no sympathy for the character, playing him as a nearly obnoxious know-it-all that he seems in the book. Strange that he never seems to know much, but when he speaks, you would think he is only playing with us. Tom doesn't fit the image of Robert as an intellectual. He plays it as if he's the gamemaster who doesn't know what the game is. It doesn't make the viewer root for him or want to listen to his input as the story progresses. But his input and his point of view are vital and the lackluster performance gave us only the drawing star-power of a two-time Oscar winner, but none of the payoff of such a presence in the film.Keeping with the book, the film has trouble finding its climactic moment. It plays on continuing the viewers' thought processes, as if we are supposed to be left with a sense of wonder about these so-called revelations that we have encountered in the story. By the time it ended, I couldn't manage to care, even though I wanted to.",5,2,4,20 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What really gets me
","It's what movies are all about, really - sitting in a seat that's already been worn in by a thousand other tushes, crunching as much popcorn under your feet as you crunch in your mouth by handfuls, sipping a soda that's three times as big as you would ever really need... and then there's this very quiet little opening line written on the screen, like a new way of saying 'once upon a time...' and you know the fairy tale is beginning, but before you can even get ready to get interested, that fateful, stirring, uplifting and scary chord throws you deep into your seat, in time with a logo that's too big for the screen... and the rest is just a ride. That's what movies are all about and that's what Star Wars gave us.If you never saw it in the theater, get yourself a really great audio visual system in your house, pour soft drinks on the floor (prep this a day prior to get the proper sticky effect) put too much salt and too much butter on a bucket of popcorn that's too big, and hit the 'play' button on the remote.",9,6,7,28 April 2009
Cube," A surprising study
","The story in this movie seems simple, but it's the kind of story that could go in any direction. Several people find themselves in a series of room, many of which are booby trapped. This fact is presented to us before any of the characters themselves, so there's no surprise to us that they face danger at every turn. The suspense of this, and the fact that there are no Hollywood stars around keeps the viewer not knowing who may die and how.Beyond this simple fact, there are the relationships that develop between and among characters. While a truly thoughtful writer could have carried this aspect in other directions, the story here keeps those moments restrained. The script is very effective in moving things along, with a few contrived leaps in logic, but it's all in the characters, and it just so happens that they're right. Imagining myself in the same situation, I can't believe that I would automatically assume myself to be inside a giant cube formation, but in this film, and each of the following ones, that assumption is made by the characters without enough clues to work with.The mixture of personality types is intriguing and turns out to be key to the movie. Each character is presented well enough, although none of the acting stands out. Then, this movie isn't about acting, it's truly all about the suspense of moving from one room to another, and trying to outthink the characters as they reach their conclusions about the purpose of the whole thing.",7,1,2,18 August 2010
