Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as anyone expected?
","There was more talk about this movie as on anyone previously released. It was definitely the cinematic event of the milenium. Before the movie was even released, there have been negativ critics about it, what can you expect afterwards. Lots of people, who went to see it, had the idea that it was bad. Well folks, I have news for you. It is not. It just makes me angry to think about all the main-stream people, who let themselfes influence so much by critics. 'Well, when they say, it's bad than probably it is'. Give the movie a chance instead. Look at it as if you've never even seen the original Star Wars Trilogy, and - more important- as if you've never heard the opinion of all the critics who are just watching the movies to find any little mistake. Right, acting doesn't deserve any Oscars, nor does the Writing. But what is important about a movie? IT'S ENTERTAINMENT!!! If I were George Lucas, I wouldn't care all too much about critics, it's preferable to make an entertaining movie such as TPM, to making some highly acclaimed film like 'the thin red line', who made a lot of people leave the cinema after one and a half hour. Look at TPM as part one of an epic saga, it's just introduction folks, don't expect huge battles on the first pages of a novel, do you?",10,0,0,14 October 1999
American Beauty," just overrated
","God this flick was just boring and nothing new at all. I do not understand how so many people could give it a ten. Do you really think it deserves to be in the 2nd spot of the imdb 250 movies ever??? Don't think so, definitely not. This boring flick was the most overrated film of the year, just like Shakespeare in Love was last year. And why do you think it earned its Oscars? (Besides Spacey who was really great) Pure politics. Some powerful men are doing some other powerful men a favour, that's about it. In ten years nobody will remember this crap (just like Titanic, read my lips)",1,0,5,27 March 2000
Titanic," Not so bad the first time, but afterwards? ...it sucks
","As I first saw Titanic, I was indeed pleased with the result of the film. Nevertheless, I always thought about it as a typical love story as we have seen it a hundred times with the difference of the ...Titanic.Special Effects were good, the sinking was very well done. Even the more than three hours didn't bother me a lot. A few months later, I watched it again, this time on video. Since I'm not a di Caprio fan, I concentrated on the plot of on him. It was bad. This second time the movie bored the hell out of me. It is one of those movies you can get a complete awersion to. The plot is bad, dialogues are even worse and visual efects didn't look all too impresive either, just compare it with other, cheaper, movies.All in all after seeing the movie the first time I would have given it a rating of 9, now it gets a 1 (only because I can't rate below zero).",1,4,10,14 October 1999
