Ford v Ferrari," Fantastic
","This movie is awesome, the actors performances are amazing and the story is even more. I felt part of the movie during all of it at the point where I didn't feel the 2.5 hours. I hope this movie wins an Oscar!",10,1,2,27 November 2019
Joker," I can't see why people think it's a masterpiece
","I didn't dislike this film and the Joaquin Phoenix interpretation of the joker is incredible, but at the end i felt like something 'big' was going to happen and it didn't, after the film I felt empty. Maybe there was too much hype created for this movie, that I was expecting more and it killed it for me.I feel like the 10 out of 10 are just there because the movie is a trend and people are following the masses, not enjoying it as a movie.",7,1,5,3 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," THE dramatic comedy
","This movie is everything: funny, sad, heartbreaking, tragic...It's incredible how Taika Waititi made funny even the Nazis story, which is not easy, then recreates the tragedy of the war from the perspective of a young kid, who has been forced to be part of that world, but doesn't really belong there.It is a movie to watch at least one time in your life.",10,7,15,27 December 2019
Her," One of a kind
","I loved this movie like Theodore loved Samantha. It's so romantic and dramatic at the same time, it puts you in a state where you feel part of the story and at the end, you have gone through a journey. It handles subjects like loneliness and love really well. After, the movie makes you really think a lot about life.",10,0,2,18 December 2019
V for Vendetta," What a masterpiece
","This is not just an action movie, it is a part of history.One of the things that I love about this movie is the script, the characters interacts perfectly with each other and everything that V says it's poetry.It's sad to say this, but even in 2019, people should watch and understand, movies like this one to really understand what is like living in that kind of situations, and to not make totalitarianism live again.This movie brings really strong political ideas and I think that it could really change people's minds.",10,10,13,3 December 2019
