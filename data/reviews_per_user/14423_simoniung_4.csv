Blade Runner 2049," A Long Visual Experience
","Denis Villeneuve took a big risk taking on a Blade Runner sequel, and one could argue that it was a partial success.Vibrant action scenes, decent acting and a good plot line. Denis Villeneuve used what made the 1982 Blade Runner such a success, an immersive world with visually appealing panels. The dystopian world is well represented. This movie is a visual spectacle.However, the main reproach for this movie is that Denis Villeneuve managed to turn a 1h 30 mins movie into a 2h 40 mins one. With so many useless scenes this movie could have been a masterpiece but just another above average movie.",7,1,5,12 November 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor Franchise Reborn
","A new era of Marvel has begun. Ever since The Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) James Gunn's masterpiece, the Marvel cinematic universe has taken a new approach. Adding colors and vibrant humor to their movies.Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is the ideal example of how a Thor Movie should be made. The first two were frankly disappointments with misplaced humor and over-hyped action scenes. However, Thor: Ragnarok is a thrilling experience. Visually appealing and hilarious, Taika Waititi has salvaged the Thor franchise. An incredible cast with the likes of Jeff Goldblum, who played the Grand Master splendidly. Action scenes that keep us hooked to our seats and hilarious characters that we look forward to seeing throughout the movie. Following a recent trend that can be observed in movies such as Baby Driver (2017) by Edgar Wright or Guardians of the Galaxy by James Gunn, Thor Ragnarok uses music to perfection.A part from the inconsistencies in some of the characters' backstories the movie is a must see for marvel fans out there!",9,1,10,5 November 2017
Justice League," Disappointing Delivery
","As a fan of DC over Marvel I can sadly say that DC have been blown out of the competition this year. The release of Thor: Ragnarok at the same time made DC's flaws more obvious.Sloppy writing, cringe jokes and lines, and a shift between the atmosphere and the delivery of emotions.With such a promising cast it's a shame that the movie turned out be a simple watchable movie, and that's me being kind.Ezra Miller's jokes were funny at first impression but we're quickly overused. Every single time Zac and Joss had a chance to drop an unwanted one liner, they took the opportunity. Making viewers uncomfortable. Inconsistencies between the power levels of certain characters were questionable as well. I was really looking forward seeing some of these characters come to the big screen. I cannot recommend this movie.",6,0,1,18 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rian Johnson Disney Attempt
","As a viewer we could feel what Rian Johnson was attempting to do. A very different feel to what JJ Abrams brand to us in Episode VII, much more colorful and lively. However, this was not close to meeting our expectations in my opinion.The depth of the character was one of the two positive points for me. Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren was heads to tails compared to episode VII. Less fragile, deeper sense of meaning and a convincing performance for me. The second main point was the esthetics of the movie. Play on colors and sounds ws sublime compared to JJ Abrams darkish hue with constant solar falir usage. Contrast of colors to illustrate symbolisms as well as give it a visual appeal. Matching sound with the ambiance, there is a moment in the movie, I won't spoil which scene where Rian Johnson knew that there was no need to use sound the simple beauty of the moment was enough. Now we finally come to the negatives of the movie or if I had to summarize it in one word. Jokes. The amount of continuous jokes in this movie ruined it for me. It rarely felt like an actual Starwars movie but more like a Disney movie. Constant jokes just after moments that were supposed to be epic but just left us plain dissapointed. Unlike Episode VII that wasn't the best Starwars there were still goosebump moments that made us rejoice of the comeback of the Starwars universe, I did not have chills once throughout this movie. Don't get me wrong this movie is worth the watch but it is not a worthwhile StarWars Movie.",7,1,3,24 December 2017
