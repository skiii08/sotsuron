Despicable Me 2," Not as good as original
","I loved the first Despicable Me and thought it was one of the animations of the 2000's however this is worse the most disappointing animations off the year.While I wasn't looking forward to the over animations this year (The Croods, Monsters University and Frozen) this was the one I was most looking forward to and was expecting it to be just as funny and entertaining as the first one. It isn't.First lets start with what Despicable Me 2 does right.There are moments in this film which made me laugh. For example the first scene involving Gru dressing as a fairy for his daughters birthday party had me in stitches. Also the moments when Gru is trying to stop his daughter from socialising with the enemies son is also funny.I also liked the animation. I though that the animation was better than the first film and the voice cast including Steve Carell and Kirsten Wiig were good as well.Now lets look at what Despicable Me 2 does wrong.There is too many minions. I liked the first film because the minions were in the film the right amount of time. For the sequel they must have decided that they didn't more minions. This made the film worse for me and forced me to give it a lower rating. Plus after the while the minions aren't funny anymore and start to get on your nerves.The ending. I hated the ending to this film. Gru marries Lucy, All the minion are put to normal and enemy gets defeated to easy. I would have preferred to end differently. Also you can tell how the film was going to end and even a 5 year old could work it out.Alltogher I was disappointed and this was the film I was most looking forward to most for 2013. If you loved the first one avoid the sequel. I hope they do better with the third one. 4/10",4,0,0,17 February 2014
Iron Man 3," The Irons Turned Rusty
","Before I start this review I must say I am not a fan of the marvel films. I thought that Avengers Assemble was a disappointment, Thor was Extremely boring and Captain America: The First Avenger was one of the worst films of 2011. I also will admit that I think the previous 2 Iron Man films were OK. So lets get started with this review.Iron Man 3 was recommended by my brother who went to watch it in the cinema and said it was brilliant so I was expecting god things but boy was I wrong. The humour is weak, there is hardly any action and Robert Downey Jr's acting is terrible. However the worst thing is the Mandarin who only appears in the film for 10 minutes who is then revealed as a con artist and the real villain is Guy Pearce. This film is half an hour too long and Gwyneth isn't used enough.Altogether this is one of the worst films of the year and I would not recommend this. This is one to avoid at all costs.",3,0,2,25 December 2013
This Is the End," Not as good as expected
","I am a massive fan of Seth Rogens, James Francos and Jonah Hills films so I was expecting ts film to be the comedy of the year and as funny as all there other films. It is not. Sure it is wonderful to see lots of famous comedy actors to be stuck in house for and hour and a half doing what they do best but after a while you would just wish they would die already. The first 25 minutes are awesome with stars like Jason Segel, Rihanna, Christopher Mintz Plasse and Michael Cera at James Francos party but once they all die the film goes downhill from there. Sure there are some funny moments my favourites are when James Franco is refused into heaven after calling Danny Mcbride names, the scene where Jonah Hill becomes processed by the devil and the end scene where the backstreet boys sing a song in heaven. All together this film is a big disappointment but however I am giving it 3 stars because there will never be a another film again with all this actors in it at the same time.",6,1,3,13 December 2013
World War Z," The Z stands for ZZZZ!
",Before I start this review I must say I have only ever seen 2 other zombie films and they are Zombieland and Warm Bodies and I thought those were brilliant films. With this is mind lets get on with the review for World War Z.The start of this looked promising with Brad Pitt and his family trying to escape the hundreds of zombies from Philadelphia but after they escape the film goes down hill. After Brad Leaves the ship his wive and kids are not seen until the end of the film and the ending in disappointing. Its not all bad though Brad Pitt is brilliant in this and the zombies look amazing. It becomes good when Brad goes to Jerusalem and the zombies get clever and climb each over to get over the walls and invade the planes.I hoped this film didn't do that well at the box office so they don't make another and I hope the company lost a lot of money for making this rubbish film. Stay away from the zombie genre Brad.,4,0,2,14 December 2013
The Lego Movie," A fun Lego-tastic ride
","When I was younger I never played with Lego. I thought they were boring and a waste of time. Now I see them differently. So let's start this review.So The Lego Movie is about a normal Lego man called Emmet, voiced by Chris Platt who discovers that he is the special and teams up with Wyldstyle (Elisabeth Banks), Vituvius( Morgan Freeman) and Batman (Will Arnett to stop Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from destroying the world.I enjoyed watching this film very much. This film made me laugh, cry and smile. The laughs mainly come from Emmets stupidity and his discovery to finding out about the master builders and that he is the special. Also his chemistry with Wyldstyle kept me on the edge of my seat.There are a lot of cameos in this film including Han Solo, Milhouse from The Simpsons, Michelangelo from The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Abraham Lincoln, Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern. Also the cast is impressive you have got Liam Neeson, Charlie Day, Cobie Smulders, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill and lots more high profile celebrities.My favourite scenes in the film include when the police invade the master builders cloud base, the end battle between the Lord Businesses robots and the residents of the city and the big reveal at the ending which reveals that the Lego people are being controlled by a human Will Ferrell.However my problems with the film are some moments in the film could have been funnier and more use of the 3D would have been nice.Altogether The Lego Movie is an entertaining film to take the family to watch and will definitely be one of the films of 2014 and is better than the other film I saw this weekend Robocop. 8/10",8,0,2,16 February 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter Part 2 is Deathly Boring
",In the past I have seen many awful films like last years After Earth and Iron Man 3 but this is the worst by many miles. It is so bad that I am hating writing this review.So where to start. First lets talk about how very boring this film is. Most of this film is about how Harry Potter is tracking down items to stop Voldemort which ends up not working as he nearly dies once meeting him. Also there is less action scenes than After Earth and Iron Man 3 combined.Next this film is 2 hours long and should have been half an hour less and I might have enjoyed this film. This is the first film that I was tempted to stop watching it and turn over to the BBC1 and watch Sherlock which would have been 1000 times better than this.But the worst thing about this film is the ending. With it being the final film in the series I thought Voldemort would die in a big explosion but no he dies getting hit by Harrys wand which is disappointing. Also Helena Bonham's character dies in the same way. Plus after all the fighting we see Harrys and his wife's (This film was so boring I can't even remember her name)kids and Hermonies and Ron's kids go to Hogwarts.Altogether this is one of the worst films ever made.,2,4,6,2 January 2014
