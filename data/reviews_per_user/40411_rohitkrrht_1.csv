Hereditary," Just one word - Nonsense!
","The film had an interesting and gripping start, but spirals downwards as the plot unfolds. The storyline is weak and the horror element, I felt was quite low. I feel this to be a highly overrated one. There are a lot of films of this genre with great content. I would recommend not to go for this.
