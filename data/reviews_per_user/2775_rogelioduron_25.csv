The Blair Witch Project," Cool movie...I really became a big fan!!!!!!!
","This movie is very well done and the simple idea of making something like this is worth everything it earned,all the fame,reviews and fanatism is the art of good publicity,In those days when internet rumors made this film a masterpiece for a lot of people before even watching it,Im one of those people. What made me become a real fan of this movie was the obscure references that they showed on the internet,how people shared what they felt when they saw the movie and how terrified they were after watching it,as a true horror genere fan i was in the need of a good scare and a rollercoaster of a ride into the unknown existence of the Blair Witch. The Blair Witch Proyect is what it pretends to be,A well planned proyect that became a huge success and a profit making scheme of a Documentary or `Mockumentary'/Snuff film about 3 college students that went to the woods in the making of a school proyect and got lost. They involve a lot of psichological horror and the chemistry between the actors is not so good and the performance of each of them on the side (See `Cubbyhouse' and you´ll pray for evil spirits to teach Joshua Leonard How to act) is a horrible experiment gone awry,Im sure in a few months we´re going to see this guys in a `Where are they now' Tv show,anyway,they deserve credit for being pioneers on this kind of movies in the 90´s,Thanks to the Blair Witch proyect we got a lot of people interested on making good horror movies and invest in them so that´s a good thing and on the down side we got a sequel that sucks but some people say it´s actually better than the original,You decide,This movie is worth being on a good movie collection,I´ll give it a nice 10 out of 10 on horror at the woods movie.I was such a fan of the blair witch that i actually made some stick men for halloween that year and im the proud owner of a Blair Witch movie maniac figure by todd Mcfarlane,it´s cool. There´s a scene when the lead actress played by Heather Donahue say´s goodbye to all her family and that she´s sorry for all that has happened,and she is crying and sobbing,I found this scene pretty disturbing until i saw it a thousand times later in `Scary Movie' and the `Bogus Witch Proyect' of Pauly Shore (who is funny sometimes).",Null,0,1,23 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I liked it, It has good moments...But Vol.1 is still MY FAVORITE!!!!
","I liked this one, i mean, after seeing vol.1 3 times at the movie theater and expecting this thing to come to an end for quite some time, now the tables have turned and i felt i had to go into the movies expecting something less that what i've seen before. I got a huge chance to see a bootleg of this movie and i did, cause i was dying to see it,and i didn't like it, plus i cheated Quentin..I cheated My girlfriend and I cheated Myself......My girl took it hard but forgave me...Today i saw it on the movie theater to give Quentin his gross money and made peace with him and with myself because of volume one's love. Now that i saw it I loved it, i love how Tarantino make is pal Michael Madsen look like a sorry Bum,Darryl Hannah become a goddess and a hell of a fighter and Mr. Kung Fu himself, Carradine Bill look as old as the cars they were driving, The cementery scene was cool cause it had all that a Lucio Fulci movie looks like and Pai Mei was wonderful. Ill give it a cool 9 out of 10 on Revenge flicks. Can't wait to see them both volumes together on theaters this next december.",Null,0,1,31 May 2004
Requiem for a Dream," It will scare your dreams away!!!!!!
","Yesterday i was very tired in the afternoon after going to school but i managed to see a copy i got from this movie...Just let me say that i didnt get to sleep anymore, as the director of this movie said in an interview: 'DonÂ´t be fooled, This is a HORROR movie...' He was right, the performances were exellent and ellen is better than ever..i hope she nails that Oscar, the finale will blow your mind away. I give it a 10 in the line of Usual suspects and Arlington Road.",Null,0,0,9 March 2001
Minority Report," I think this is one great movie..loved it!
","Its one of the best movies iÂ´ve seen in years, Tom Cruise was espectacular and the future was cool as hell, i had a lot of fun and the twist at the end was a surprise, I feel that my favorite director steven spielberg just scored another touchdown!!!!!Max von Sidow was superb and the Lucy Liu cameo no one has noticen that..ha,ha,ha..look for it in the train station. Go see it its oscar worthy on special effects.",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Its Good and it was cheap!!!!!!!
","I loved the movie and i loved the fact that i got it for 2 dollars here in mexico as a bootleg and im seeing it again on theaters when it comes here in one month, in the mean time in showing it to all my students at my school. Go see it..or get a copy..it rocks.",Null,0,1,29 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," This movie is a really good ride.
","This movie was a real ride,it has some great action scenes and a breath taking car chase that comes close to the one on the movie `Ronin' with De Niro,Now,Matt Damon is no De niro but he can pull off the action scenes and the Jet lee ability to handle guys without guns,Franka Potente is not as good as in `Lola Rennt' and could have  been replaced by any second class actress because of her two dimensional character (Choose any new good looking chick from Hollywood) Julia Styles comes out as a character the movie really didn´t need so you can guess they used her to get some teen audience,The bad guys play their roles well enough and the story is interesting but sometimes the movie slow down and if youre sleepy youre gonna need a good cup of coffee to keep up with it. I´ll give it a good 9 out of 10 on Action Movies with Matt Damon.",Null,0,1,24 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One word: 'EXELLENT'
","I loved these film, in all my years as a movie fan i´ve not seen anything like it, it just made me an instant fan, now im trying to get all the LOTR books but the just ran out of them in the book stores, im going insane. In the mean time let me tell you that the story is fantastic, the special effects are so cool youll be drooling from beginning to end,Its a must see film.",Null,0,0,10 January 2002
Spider-Man," My one and only HERO!
","Spiderman to me is the ultimate hero of all times and its not only because he is a guy who everyone can identify himself with but because hes just plain cool. This movie is a great homage to spidey and for real fans, Since i knew the movie was really getting made i started getting ready to buy all the products that spierman was going to come with this year and Boy did a get a lot of stuff..lately my girlfriend hired a guy in a spiderman suit to give me a present on our 4 year anniversary, it was cool, because this guy just came in my work and he was dressed as spiderman and everyone was like 'What is going on' It was cool, For me its a great movie..ill give it a 10! and 2 thumbs up.",Null,0,0,2 August 2002
Captain America: Civil War," It was completely what a Superhero movies should be like !
","I must say I really liked this film, It succeeded my expectations fully and was was way better then other superhero battling movie I saw recently, It was a fun film and it used a lot of cool CGI that looked awesome, It included a superhero that has been an all time favorite of mine and was not even announced on any poster of this film at all, One battle scene was the best scene of the film, lots of action, forget about great acting or common sense, it was just fun to watch and that's why we watch this movies sometimes, just to have fun right? So if you are a movie fan it's a must see, SPOILER WARNING - If you have not seen this film stop reading right now - o.k., Spider-man was so much fun, I loved watching him in action, He was just as I expected to see him on any film before, they just upgraded him and it was something else, I recommend the Spidey fans to go and check it out, Ant-man was funny and Black Panther was as good as Batman on any film, we was just awesome.",9,4,10,8 May 2016
Saw III," Saw 3 was everything i really wanted it to be...a great wrap up to the series!!!
","I truly loved this film, I traveled from Mexico all the way to Orlando Florida's Universal Studios only for 1 day for the 31st of Octuber Universals Halloween Horror Nights festivity and spent almost 2 hours on its cineplex at the beginning of the park watching SAW 3 , a lot of people might think that if i was only to stay for 1 day in Universal i shouldn't loose time watching a movie, but let me tell you that for Halloween it was a real treat,Saw 3 was all i ever wanted to see in this episode, it has great flashbacks to the other 2 movies and made me think that it was so greatly done that it made SAW 2 look good and to make saw 2 look good was a hard task but they pulled it off just right...just like that guy with his chains...oh god..this movie has to make you cringe in your seat. It has some hard scenes that i was just into them so much...i my, it had some cheesy dialogue too but besides all i loved its twist and everything that had to do with its ending, it had me completely...its a must see but make sure to see part 1 and 2.Saw 3 was way better than the Haunted Houses at Universal.",10,2,5,5 November 2006
Batman Begins," I loved the movie, I feel it's the best Batman yet on Screen!!!
","This time it's different,Batman is really dark and really, really good. Most of the other movies centered in the infamous villains but now the tables have turned and it's batman's chance to shine on the silver screen with his training to become the dark knight till his battle movies, he is the star. This movie really made me feel like a kid again, i was just watching for my watch cause i didn't want the movie to be over..i just didn't want it to be over but at the end i felt it was great..loved lot of scenes in it and the ending was cool..i can't wait for a sequel. The Villains were real enough to make the movie feel realistic and the bat-mobile is spectacular...i will definitely give it a 10 out of 10 on cool Comic adapted movie.",10,3,3,17 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The long awaited sequel was good but not as expected
","++++++++Possible Minor Spoilers+++++++++ There was so much hype for this film that at the very end of it I was not left with that humongous regret on waiting another 12 months to see the conclusion. Please don't get me wrong, This movie was superb and had a lot of great scenes that surpassed the fellowship movie and I loved the fellowship of the ring, as a matter of fact it still is my favorite LOTR movies between the first 2 installments, This movie has great moments, Everyone is very involved in it, Frodo and Sam on their quest, This time they travel with Gollum, who was played in a wonderful way by Andy Serkins and stole every scene from the hobbits, at first it gave me some sort of vibe to be like that little servant `Dobby `from the Harry Potter movie, but later on Gollum became a very likeable character and I hope to see him at the Oscars next year. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli did their job very well and Merry and Pippin just helped in their small way to the film, The wolves of the Orcs and the Ents and the Olifants look great, CGI have come far now a days, The last battle scene is very interesting and long, only some few surprises and a lot of action made The Two Towers a second chapter worth it's time, Now everything's set for next years grand finale, I don't want anyone to hate me for saying this (I know it's going to sound mean) but Starwars: Episode 2 did kept me at the ending waiting for more, anxious to see the last Episode, This movie kind of lacked in that department. I'm going to still give it a good 10 out of 10 on cool movies of all time.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Easily one of my top 10 movies of ALL TIMES!!!
","This movies was Exellent, I liked every little aspect of it and i must admit that i used to talk s*** about Trantino, since now and forever ill recognize how good he is doing his stuff,I liked all the Explotation references, the Trix reference,The Green Hornet one and the Bruce lee one´s, this movie has it all, damn, I had a great time at the movies today, as a matter of fact i feel like a kid again, i really want to watch it again, Im going to the theater one more time i guess, its been a while since I´ve done that of watching the same movie on a movie theater, as a matter of fact i did it on freddy vs Jason but thats a whole other story,I loved O-ren and Go Go are my sweethaerts as crazy as they are, I liked the house of blue leaves fight scene and the Crazy 88, everything was cool, i want to say to everyone that this movie is supposed to entertain..thats it..dont go around looking for what is coherent and whats not...Enjoy..Its only a Movie..have fun. Ill definately give it a 10 out of 10 on revenge flicks.",Null,1,2,30 November 2003
The Fly," A Journey into deep grueling Horror!!!!!
","-Contains Possible Spoilers- Let me introduce to you an egoistical,self absorbed,egomaniac Dr.Seth Brundle,He is the inventor of the famous teletransportation pods,¿how do they work you say? Well,you get into one pod and then by some genetic codes and some gamma rays you get moleculized and transported to the other pod on the other side of the room and get molecularly fused back again and then you have traveled some distance in the matter of seconds.Impressed!Well,what would you say if i tell you that if by any chance a house common fly gets inside the pod with you, the machine will fuse you with it to a matching molecular level and by this in a matter of days you´ll slowly decay as a human and morph into a horrendous humansize fly! This is the story that this movie give us,Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum are great in their roles as the love interest and the Scientist,there are some raunchy sexy scenes and some grotesque scenes in it that will make your skin crawl,I saw this movie when i was just a little kid (10 i guess)we got to the movie theater and we were like 10 people counting cousins and friends,all tickets to it were sold out and we decided to but tickets for the movie playing on the next room to it and we all sneaked into it and got to see it on premiere,i was not horrified by it but the scenes involving vomit did bother me,I really recommend this movie for the strong stomach people,i mean,if you can take the vomit scenes in `Stand by me' and `National Lampoons `Van Wilder' movie' without feeling sick then you´re o.k. Cronemberg has done it again,I´ll give it a 10 out of 10 on Horror transformation movies with cool makeup and im also a proud owner of a Brundle Fly Movie Maniac Figure from Todd Mcfarlane...It´s so sweet.",Null,0,1,24 October 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," It´s better than the first one.
","Well,I really enjoyed this movie, to me it was far better than the first installment, i mean, the first time it felt like a kids game or something and now Harry is not important anymore,his friends are funnier and the things that happen are fantastic as they could, so harry finishes up on second term,It´s funny and i sure ah hell laughted a lot and the fire alarm on this theater had a short-circuit on it´s wiring and we were all screaming out of the theaters halfway through the movie so that was fun too.Nothing happened and we came back to see that we didnt get the idea of the chamber of secrets. Ill give it a nice 10 out of 10 on Magic Movies.",Null,0,0,9 December 2002
War of the Worlds," I liked it...but sometimes it didn't make any sense!!!
","When i went to the movie theater i expected to see a really good movie...i mean..after watching the amazing 'Batman Begins' This summer and actually having a dream about the end of the World i was more than ready to see Mr. Cruise save the planet. Don't get me wrong, i have always loved Spielbergs movies (Not Amistad...never seen it, hopefully never will) to me JAWS is my all time favorite movie,but for some time now he has changed, he's got old and his movies are not as cool as they used to be. I mean come on,He had in his hands a perfect recipe for disaster on biblical proportions and i say that in a cool, action-packed, adrenalin rushed way, and what does he do...he makes it a movie from the point of view of only one man and his family and the quest to take care of them...BORING!!! There is a small moment when even 'THE AMAZING' (To a lot of people) Dakota Fanning came to be really annoying and said a line that not even the little boy in Episode 1 (Jake Lloyd) could have acted worse. Tommy Cruise is Tommy Cruise with his pearly white and his running skills that put an Olympic runner to shame, he does it well, he has a serious scene..a very..very serious scene that made it for me..i mean..that final scene with the other survivor (Tim Robbins) was what made me like it...it was crude and well played...even for Spielberg...it makes you think that the situation is not a joke...well played. The ending was a head scratcher for a lot of people i saw it with so I'm giving it a poor 8 on a good and o.k scale. Definitely you have to see it to talk about it.Tons of plot holes and more.",8,1,5,2 July 2005
Scream 2," It is only ¡O.K.!
","This movie is a good follow up to the first installment of the 'Scream' trilogy,But there are some issues that i just didn{t like, the problem is they kill likeable characters and let live some less likeable ones. If you could decide between killing Courtney Cox,David Arquette and Neve Campbell you can easy choose a winner!Well,I this movie was at my command i´d kill everyone in it but the heroine to give it another sequel.Tons of blood,tons of makeup,tons of blood again,make a real slaughter out of it,but hey, you can´t get everything you hope for. Here we get to see all the cast who survived and new people to kill and make fun of,this Scream movie is o.k but the ending leaves a sour taste in the back of your throat you can´t just get it to go away even with a whole bottle of tequila,but it´s a fun way to try. I´ll give it a sad 8 out of 10 in Horror Slasher Movie Sequel.",Null,0,0,30 September 2002
Jaws," My all time favorite movie and one i share only with the peoplle i love.
","I love this movie, i love every aspect of it and its the first book that i've read out of curiosity,I loved it at the universal theme park and its the only framed poster with fiberglass on my wall. Chief Brody has to save the day when a big white shark starts snacking on tourists, everyone is exellent on it and spielberg is my hero for making such a film. I fully recommend it.",Null,1,3,10 January 2002
Scream," Witty,Exiting and Cool!!!!!!!
","What can i say about a movie that awakened the new wave of horror genere on the big screen, Yes, we did get a lot of movies that tried to copy it and turned out to be trash and Yes we got a lot of sequels that we just didn´t need to see (Talk about 'I still know' and 'Carrie 2')but in the process we got a lot of people to put a buck on horror movies again and we got the genere to live again even if some hardcore genere fans don´t want to admit it. Wes Craven re-invet´s himself with this slasher movie...it´s been a long time since there was an interesting teen mad slasher like this,this guy uses horror movie trivia to kill people,I just loved it. I´m definately a big fan of this movie, everyone was cool in their roles but my favorite actor is Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks 'The horror movie buff' mabe because i also used to work on a big video store, the big 'BBV' if you know what i mean and i really felt identified with him cause he´s suck a snappy and sarcastic guy just like me. Check out Matthew 'Shaggy' Lillard as Stuart Matcher, he does a great job here. Check out this movie is worth the watch and i´m very proud to say that i own a movie maniac figure of this cool slasher called 'ghostface' from the movie. I´ll give it a 10 out of 10 on Movie Maniac Slashers from the last century.",Null,0,0,29 September 2002
Halloween," 80´s Horror icon slasher Michael Myers Debut!!!
","'The Babysitter Murders' was the original name they wanted for this great film, but now i really feel that halloween was a great one to use. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her screaming debut here along with Donald Pleasence they make a great cast for this Horror movie that has come to be an icon of the 80´s and slasher movies around the world. Michael Myers is a silent killing machine and it is amazing to watch over and over this timeless horror jewel. Im darn proud to have Michael in my collection of movie maniacs so i can play a tribute to this shape of death. I really fully recomend this movie to everyone who considers himself a genere fan,it´s a priceless movie,Buy it or rent it at least i´ll give it a 10 out of 10 on horror films.",Null,0,0,17 September 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," DisneyÂ´s Funniest Movie Ever!!!!!!!!
","This is a Classic into Disney ranks of funny and cool movies...its almost like it wa smade just for adults to consider it so good. David Spade uses his acid and ironic humor almost the whole movie and with funny people around him to do a great film what else can go wrong. I dont need to tell you what is about cause you have read it all along other places so ill just have to say that i had fun watching it and i even own it cause its a hell of a maovie. i truly recommend it to everyone...ah....and kids too. I need to at least add a line or two to make this comment go through so ill say this: This movie is fun even for die hard Horror fans like me because you get great laughts in it and the voice inpersonations are great, the guy from Seinfeid does Kronk...This stupid guard that will make you cry of laughter...its a great movie..a must own on DVD.",Null,1,2,12 May 2004

","Mel Gibson gave a great performance as a Preacher who lost his fate and River Phoenix did a great job as the baseball retired brother and the kids were o.k, of of the culkin clan and the other a little girl with a great line. The story is interesting and there are some tense scenes that you{ll remember forever,Even M. Night Shamalayan was o.k in his weird role,check him out, the only problem was the forced twist on the tale at the ending,it just took away alll the buildup it had for a long time in the movie. Liked it but could have been better, anyway i can´t wait to get the DVD,I´ll give it a good 8 out of 10 in suspense.",Null,0,2,17 September 2002

A Nightmare on Elm Street," 3 words:Freddy Kicks Ass.
","Freddy Krueger is if i may say so one of the best serial killers in movie history. Wes Craven is the man who created him out of Bully experiences and Nightmarish visions,A serial Killer that stalks people in their dreams and if they get killed in dreams they really die,cool concept. Nancy is a girl that must battle Frederick Krueger, a disfigured child molester,son of a thousand maniacs to send him back to hell. The first time i saw this movie i got really scared and loved every single second of it, when i was 12 i used to dress for halloween as Freddy Kruger and later on cry becuase someone would always steal my hat and i wouldn´t feel it because of the mask. Kruger is one of my favorites and Jason Voorhees,Those 2 are my top killers and im dam proud to have the movie maniacs figure of Freddy Kruger,He Rocks!!!!!!

Donnie Darko," Liked it a lot, must be in my collection!!!!!!!
","This movie is cool in many levels,I was not really into it until someone just gave it to me as a present, they i was still not expecting anything, Then i started seeing it and i was hooked on it, the movies is about the life of this guy who is weird, takes medication and has an imaginary friend called Frank who is a demonic huge rabbit, Still doesn´t sound interesting?..o.k...Now this guy starts to get some predictions of the future, cheats death and beats off to Christina Applegate from Married with Children!!!!!! Not interested yet?....o.k, then he mocks a motivational speaker in front of all his school in a bad way,starts commiting vandalism acts and everyday he wakes up somewhere but not at home!!!! still not interested!!!...Damn...o.k, last try! he know when is gonna be the end of the world, he talks about sex referring to the smurfs, gets a beautiful girlfriend and has a grest trash mouth fight with his siter at the table when his father laughed incontrollably!!!!!!!!
