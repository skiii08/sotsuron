The Avengers," Avengers is an amazing movie with an amazing cast
","'The Avengers' brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time.",10,48,68,30 October 2014
Titanic," Review of one of the greatest adventures and love stories in movie history
","Many love stories have the same plot. They are predictable and boring, and by the end of the film viewers are done watching the couple kiss and be cutesy. However, The Titanic ties in not only a love story, but an adventure, an intense inner battle, and a mortifying loss. From the beginning of the film, viewers are attached to Jack Dawson, feeling like they want him to succeed. So when they see how how happy Jack is that he won a ticket on the RMS Titanic, viewers want nothing more for the poor and extremely attractive boy to be happy. Jack and Rose have a love that is almost sickening, but the affection they show each other makes viewers want to experience a crazy love story of their own. It is nice to see a rich girl let her guard down and be herself around Jack, something that is lost in the craziness of every day life, and the fact that it is human nature to try and impress people we like. When watching the Titanic everyone (I hope) knew what would happen at the end, but it was heartbreaking to see Rose's lover's life come to an end. Honestly, I think they both could have fit on the old door when they were waiting to be rescued, but there had to be a heartbreaking tragedy that leaves one crying on the couch wanting to dive into the ocean to bring Jack Dawson back to life. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are phenomenal actors, and they have amazing chemistry together on and off screen.",9,1,2,30 September 2014
