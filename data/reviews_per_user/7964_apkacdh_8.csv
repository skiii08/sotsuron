The Blair Witch Project," Darn that theory/reality dichotomy!
","In theory, this would have made a great film.  The theory was no actual script because the entire story is explained in the first frame you see, have no stars playing the roles, and that the viewer watches 'actual footage' of the blow-by-blow events of these people who were investigating the local folklore.In reality, it didn't work.  There's nothing really scary that happens except maybe for being lost in the woods, unfortunately no one gave the 'Rodney King Treatment' to the guy who tossed the map after getting lost (which was well deserved), and, all in all, paying a single dime to see this is as much a rip-off as paying anyone to watch the video of their kid's birthday party on the RCA Handi-cam.Fortunately, I got to see the movie for free since I UNfortunately worked in a video store at the time (see also my tirade in my 'Clerks' review).",Null,0,0,11 February 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Junkies by choice come to Junkies' ends
","One Little Junkie wound up with a bad arm that had to be amputated.One Little Junkie wound up in jail.One Little Junkie wound up in a cheaply made porn film she didn't want to be in at the time.The only person to feel the least bit sorry for is the one Junkie's mother, who did not CHOOSE to be a drug-addict, but wound up insane with shock treatments due to certain ingredients of the prescription medication she was taking.Very well done 'sit-through-able' movie about what happens when you choose to be a Junkie.  But the only one to feel sorry for is the one who didn't obviously CHOOSE to wind up where they did.That's a wrap.",Null,0,1,16 January 2003
The Ring," Thank Heaven for Little Girls ...
","Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist', the twins in Stanley Kubrick's version of 'The Shining' and now this girl in this movie.  CREEEEPYYYYYY!!!!I've been watching movies filed under 'Horror' since I was about 8 years old and I'm in my early 30's right now.  There are very few 'Scary Movies' I've found to be genuinely scary and able to make one feel uneasy: 'The Exorcist'(especially if you have your VCR hooked up to your stereo), 'The Shining' (again, the sound among many other things), 'Hallowe'en' (mainly the music), David Cronenberg's version of 'The Fly' (for his audacity to put in everything he DID put in), ... And now, THIS MOVIE.Okay, there are a whole bunch of things that can be found wrong with this movie; a lot of it seems like you're watching This Movie meets That Movie meets Another, and so on.  But originality (or lack thereof) aside, THIS MOVIE SCARES.Oddly, there are movies I find scary that don't get filed under Horror, even though they do scare.  For example, there were quite a few times during the first half-hour of 'Saving Private Ryan', I had to keep reminding myself that I was not in danger of getting drilled into Swiss Cheese or being blown up, I was sitting at home in my Living Room watching the most unsettling battle scene I'd ever seen on ANY screen.  I'm not saying 'Saving Private Ryan' should be filed under Horror; I'm just giving an example of the difference between a Movie that Scares and a Scary Movie.The Ring is BOTH of these.  To the folks who made it, both behind the camera and in front, TAKE A BOW.That's a wrap.",Null,0,1,1 March 2003
In the Name of the Father," Completely different genre than 'Green Mile'
","First thing I wanted to address was that although it does take place in a prison, this cannot be compared with such movies as 'The Green Mile' or 'Shawshank Redemption'.  Those two are completely fictitious stories, although they are entertaining.  You wouldn't put 'Stripes' or 'In the Army Now' in the same basket with such films as 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Shaving Ryan's Privates', would you?   Oops, excuse me; I meant 'Saving Private Ryan'.Anyway, excellent film.  I don't see anything anti-English about it; it just Happened in England.  Just like 'Murder in the First' Happened in The States.  Things like this happen in all sorts of places, so making a movie on them doesn't make it an Anti-(country of choice) film.Kinda funny how a previous comment mentioned Pete Postlethwaite and Tommy Lee Jones in the same sentence; I spent half the time debating to myself whether the actor was Tommy or not (until I read the credits, of course). Sometimes they're spitting images of each other, sometimes they're not.Anyway, very well done film and I look forward to reading the book sometime. Good soundtrack, too.",Null,0,0,8 December 2002
American History X," A more realistic 'Clockwork Orange'
","I don't know how many viewers of this movie (or non-viewers who are just reading these comments) have read Anthony Burgess''A Clockwork Orange' with the 21st chapter, but in that chapter, it shows that it's a 'Coming of Age' story when Your Humble Narrator, Alex, doesn't have his heart in the things he used to do anymore.  He's no longer into it.If you take out the rhetoric about personal choice, then this excellently-done movie is quite parallel to that plot:The surrounding story is that Edward Norton's character, Derek, was a bad guy who turned his life around in prison and is now trying to stop his brother (who idolizes him) from making the same mistakes, which gives us the premise of all the flashback scenes/Clockwork Orange plot.You see all the scenes of Derek being 'not just A skinhead but THE skinhead' and all the rhetorics he preaches that sometimes start off seemingly intelligent but always go downhill from there and ultimately into utter chaos and disorder.  Alex from 'Clockwork Orange' is a gang leader, too, and they all go out and steal cars, beat up bums, and create other chaos and disorder.In both stories, the title character goes to jail for over two years.Alex in Clockwork Orange had the Ludevico Technique to 'rehabilitate' and release him and, unfortunately for him, show him what it was like on the other end of the atrocities he used to commit.  Derek was apparently White, but while in jail, he was a 'minority' and it was clear that without any kind of 'friends', it meant big trouble if he was caught by his lonesome (to put it nicely).  Both characters have some leader-figure to help them while they're in the slammer: Alex had the prison chaplin and Derek had the school teacher.  Both characters also have horrible things done to them by people who were once their friends.At the end of it all, they are 'cured' of what they were before jail (Although Derek didn't have to be cured of the first 'Cure').As I said, the plot is not original, but it is excellently done.By the way, the ending is hugely tragic, to say the least.  So see this movie for a better version of the 'Clockwork Orange' plot but be prepared for the ending.That's a wrap.",Null,0,0,6 September 2001
Schindler's List," The Passion of the Jews ... DEVASTATING! Excellent movie, but devastating.
","First of all, I hope that no one takes my title out of context and thinks that I like watching movies that show the suffering of ANYONE, unless, of course, the suffering is on an obvious villian or villians,  thank you.I also need to mention that I have seen this film at least three times before I even HEARD about what Mel Gibson was working on.Anyway, after seeing 'Passion of the Christ', I thought that was THE most devastating (but excellently done) film ever made about Anything or Anyone that took place in History.  Then I remembered watching 'Saving Private Ryan' (another Spielberg movie, excellently done) and it's being so intense that I literally had to remind myself a few times that I was in my living room watching a video; the intensity of the scenes and the sound made me almost FEEL bullets whizzing by my head.Then I remembered THIS movie.It is one of the hardest movies to sit through.  And it's hard to sit through almost the ENTIRE TIME.Even though everyone and their brother has at least HEARD about the Holocaust, this is a movie about two things.  A)Yes, of course, The Holocaust, and B) a person who was a womanizing, sweat-shop owner type (who was, at first, only nice for the sake of production) member of the Nazi Party who eventually SAVED so many people from annihilation.It is one thing to see the story of some 'Plain old guy' save a life or two,... but to see someone who was FRIENDS WITH THE ANNIHILATORS manage to save over a thousand Jewish people and still be more or less friends with the Nazis during that time ... All I can say is WOW!!!Before any violence even takes place, a dark cloud forms just by watching the Jewish people being marched toward the ghetto and there's that girl screaming out 'Bye, Jews!' over and over again along with other people being nasty.  A) It's like watching a whole bunch of Jesuses being marched down the road to their eventual crucifixions while the crowd throws insults and objects at them.  B)You don't know whether you want to jump into the film and strangle her for her hatred (or her parents for teaching it to her, perhaps), or cry because of her innocence of not knowing better because the parents TAUGHT her that level of hatred because of buying into what was Politically Correct at the time and place.  I know it was just a fictitious character, but such things as hatred toward specific types of people being taught by the parents DO happen in REAL LIFE.I won't tell what actually happens with the women at Auschwitz (or was it Dachau?), but that was another one of the most chair-gripping 'Oh no ... Oh GOD NO!' moments in the picture.And, of course, there are all the 'Liquidation' scenes and the especially significant scenes with 'The Little Girl in Red', which requires a cast-iron stomach to watch at that point in the film.  By the way, don't you, Dear Reader, just love that euphemism 'Liquidation'?  ACCH!Not to mention, all the people who get picked off simply because ... well, they were ALLOWED to be.  Double-ACCH!I read earlier of a comment about how there should have been more focus on Hitler, as it was a movie regarding the Holocaust.  But this movie wasn't about Hitler's List of People He Wanted Dead; it was about Oskar Schindler's List of People He Could Afford to Keep ALIVE!Even after all the carnage is over, it still makes anyone who is a human being get a huge lump in their throat when Oskar is breaking down because of however many more he could have saved with his own possessions.As I said in my title and opening of this commentary, this is one of the best movies ever made about something that took place in history, but it's also one of the HARDEST movies to watch.I really gotta give Spielberg credit not just for making this picture, not just for releasing it with as much as it has intact (after editing and getting past the authority boards and such), but ESPECIALLY for having the 'juice' to get American television stations to show it without a single frame edited or altered.  Even the private parts you DIDN'T want to see when the prisoners are given physical exams and they're so skinny that their spines are almost glued to their belly-buttons.Take a bow, Stephen.Aaannnnd ... cut!That's a wrap.",Null,9,13,8 March 2004
Mulholland Drive," I'm sorry to sound like Homer but ...
","BORING!!!And, worst of all, I love almost everything David Lynch has had to offer up to this point.  I guess I'll just look at it the same way I look at any moviemakers' 'Runt of the Litter' (i.e. Episode I of the Star Wars Saga, and the A-list actors who wound up in 'Dick Tracy').   I don't see much to not understand about this movie:  One girl gets in a car accident, has amnesia, and eventually we find out what happened. 
   WHOOP-DE-BLOODY-DOO!   Oh, and some weird stuff happens, too.  Typical Lynch style.    I'm sure there's a lot more to it than that, but this time around, I honestly don't give Squat One what that would be, because after getting up and out of the house to go rent it, I was almost put back into a deeper sleep than the one I'd just awakened from an hour earlier.
   If you've seen anything by Lynch before, you've basically already seen this movie.     Unfortunately, I can't recommend this for anyone who has a pulse; at least my interest in 'Lost Highway' was saved by the rock stars' cameos and Trent 'Nine Inch Nails' Reznor producing the soundtrack.",Null,1,1,1 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," ATTENTION PARENTS: Here's a movie that both your kids AND YOU should enjoy, unlike other 'kid' films ...
","Back in the mid-1970's, George Lucas started a wonderful saga for children of all ages, children between 7 and 107!  It was wonderful and it appealed to ALL ages, whether or not there were huge amounts of toys to be spawned for the children's third of the fanbase.Later, unfortunately, came the remake of 'Return of the Jedi' and the abominable 'Phantom Menace', ... which could have been shown as double features with STRICTLY FOR CHILDREN's movies 'Pokemon' and any film with the Olsen Twins.I'm 32 years old, I have no children, and I have never read a Harry Potter book.  So, I have no idea how loyal this movie is to the book series' mythology, setting, etc.  Nor do I hear about it 24/7 from any kids who live around me, so I can't be bloody SICK of hearing anything that mentions Muggles, Quidditch, ANY-flavoured jelly beans, etc.I HAVE, however, seen this film and found it much more enjoyable as an adult (with or without kids) and as the kid I once was.And both of those sides of me find it much more fun to watch and ENJOY than the 'Special' version 'Return of the Jedi' and the nightmare 'Episode 1' of the Star Wars Trilogy.  If those two are any sign of things to come, I say George Lucas should hang it up, because ... HERE COMES HARRY!!!  By the way, does anybody wonder about any kind of lawsuits between  This Harry Potter and the Harry Potter character in the movie 'Troll', which came WAY BEFORE the first book was even written?EXCELLENT FOR ADULTS AND KIDS OF ALL AGES!!  That's a wrap!",Null,0,0,28 November 2001
