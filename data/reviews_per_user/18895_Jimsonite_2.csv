The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I adore this movie
","In my opinion the best teenage/high school movie ever. I highly recommend. Even if you don't like that type of movie, this one feels more deep and meaningful than others of its type, and you really connect with the characters.",9,1,2,16 April 2019
It Follows," Booooorrrriiinnnngggg
","Not scary at all, comically bad in parts. Really don't understand the high ratings for this. I don't watch many horrors but this is definitely the worst.",4,0,5,23 July 2018
