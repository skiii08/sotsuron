Black Swan," Demented
","The first word that came to mind after watching this film was 'demented'. An absolutely demented film.Natalie Portman gives a performance that is equal parts sweet and tragic. She has always shown flourishes, but not since her first break out role in The Professional, has she been this open, this exposed. The story is simple, yet the emotions complex. Portman plays 'Nina', a 28 year old woman who still lives with her mom, chasing a dream that her mother had; to have the lead in a major production. But there is a new girl in the troop, 'Lily', played by Mila Kunis, who Nina sees as a rival. Kunis is fantastic. Lily is the exact opposite of Nina; open, free, though just as talented, Kunis is wonderful and gives Lily the right amount of edge. The real problem in her life is that Nina's mother dots on her as if she were still a young girl. This has, in many respects stunted Nina emotionally and she is still the 16 year old girl that her mother treats her as. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother beautifully. The dynamic between Hershey and Portman is fantastic.The film hints at a very demented and destructive side to not only ballet, but to the pursuit of excellence. Nina is constantly trying to be perfect. Perfect to the point of being self-destructive. This is manifested in a physical way through self-mutilation. Winning the coveted lead role in Swan Lake is equal parts blessing and curse for Nina. In many respects, the curse side is the most predominate. What ensues is a major demented, genius piece of filmmaking. Aronofsky, ever known as a filmmaker that is not afraid to take chances, gives us his most commercially demented work yet. The way he films and presents the art of ballet is breathtaking.Bravo to Portman and Aronofsky, a film which intrigued me prior to seeing it, after viewing, left me equal parts happy and sad. Torn, like Portman's Nina, you have to love it when a film goes as deep into the rabbit hole as this one does, and leaves you breathless at the end.",9,1,4,26 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Welcome back Cap'n Jack
","I am a fan of the Pirates movies. Since 2003, I have enjoyed watching Capt. Jack and Co. stumble their way through adventures. Like many, I thought the last two sequels had a bit of bloat, none the less, they still entertained me immensely, thus I looked forward with fondness to sitting in a theater again to watch a Pirates adventure. I put on my Capt. Jack jersey, as I have for the last two films, and headed off to have fun.Stranger Tides finds our good friend Capt. Jack continuing his quest for the Fountain of Youth that he set sail for at the end of At World's End. This time, there are two Jacks at the beginning. There seems to be someone going about England rounding up a crew under the guise of Capt. Jack. It isn't long before we learn who said impostor is, thus the quest ensues.What I enjoyed most about the film was the return in Capt. Jack as a formidable Pirate. We had lost a little of that in the last two films, but here, Jack is in fine form verbally and physically. Depp pretty much wears Capt. Jack as a second skin and continues to throw layers on him. Rush is once again back as Capt. Barbossa, though this time, more of a 'company man' in the beginning. Penelope Cruz is a fine addition as Black Beards daughter Angelica. Then you have Black Beard himself, Ian McShane, who turns in a wonderfully vile performance.We get some zombies and mermaids this go around and enough action to keep you entertained. I thought Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was the best since the first film, it was continually rousing and fun throughout the film. And I think that is the best thing I can say about the film. It was a rousing fun time, exactly what I expected and like out of my Pirates movies. Yo ho, drink up and enjoy.",7,0,0,20 May 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Much improved over the Ang Lee film
","I enjoyed the Ang Lee directed 'The Hulk', but I was not entertained by it. I am not sure if that makes sense, but that is the easiest way I can explain the first film and my like/dislike of it. In the end I think Lee went away from the basics of the character and of the fan expectations and it was not what a film called 'The Hulk' should have been.Flash forward to 2008 and 'The Incredible Hulk'. This go around, with Marvel studios having a heavier hand in the production, most everything is done right. Instead of taking up loads of time exploring the 'why' of Banner's transformation, Zak Penn's script handles the genesis of Banner's Gama radiation exposure during the opening credits. That sets up the story perfectly. Another aspect done right is Banner being portrayed as a man on the run. This is what most fans enjoyed and loved about the original series and lets face it, the movie version has to address the comic and TV version if it is going to succeed.Louis Leterrier brings a welcomed action sense to the film. Let's face it, we want to see Hulk smash things. We want to see Banner on the run for his life. All of this is brought together nicely by Leterrier.My one nitpick of the film is the transition from some scenes to the next. There has been a lot of rumors circulating of chunks being removed from the final cut and in places it shows.I was not keen on Edward Norton playing the role, yet 10mins into the film I was sold on him. He brings to the Banner role the same emotional struggle that Bill Bixby did with the TV character of David Banner. Liv Tyler is fantastic. Her scenes with the computer generated Hulk are light years ahead in emotion compared to those from the first film. Speaking of the CGI, all in all it is much improved from the first film. Tim Roth as Abomination is perfectly cast, he brings an absolute evil glee to the table. William Hurt does some of his best work of late as the 'General'.There are ample cameos from the creator of The Hulk to the members of the TV series as well as a nod to another character in the Marvel universe.Much improved over the first movie, there was a lot of nay-sayers out there when this project was announced. But they proved them wrong and now the Hulk train has been righted and it looks like we will be seeing a lot more of him in the future.",7,2,4,22 June 2008
Sucker Punch," There is no middle ground here....
","You are either going to love this film or hate it. There will be no middle ground with it. I absolutely loved it.The story is simple; a young girl, Babydoll, is sent to a sanitarium by her uncle to keep her locked away. See, Babydoll and her sister were to inherit their mother's estate. But their uncle ceases control after Babydoll tragically kills her sister trying to defend them from her uncle. Baby doll creates a world within the sanitarium, a bordello, which she and the other girls live. Within that world she has another place she can go, a world for fighting. Each time she goes to the world, the backdrop is different; ancient China, WWII, Medieval and other worldly. Through these worlds, Babydoll and Co. fight their way to freedom.Warning right up front, the film is chocked full of symbolism. The more you catch, the further into the film you will be. The imagery is absolutely fantastic. Another thing to get out of the way right off, yes, the girls are great looking. But all honesty, you get over that within a few minutes. There is so much going on, you get sucked into the story and their plight so hard, you forget about how they are dressed. For those critics who have spent time admonishing the seeming fetish fantasy overload, totally missed the point. I will let you experience the film and figure out for yourself what the outfits symbolize.Scott Glenn enters the story at the beginning of each fight. He is there to instruct the girls and impart wisdom. Again, his presence is there for a reason, it is up to you to figure out the intent of his presence. Glenn is fantastic and is far more important to the film than I thought he would be. The continual symbolism makes this film fun because each person can bring something away that others might not have. Snyder obviously has his intentions, but ultimately he gives you just enough so that you can create the world a long with Babydoll.All of the cast is great, not one person can you say doesn't bring their A-game to the proceedings. Emily Browning shoulders the lion share of time on screen and she is up to the task. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung, and Carla Gugino are wonderful. It is a shame many will dismiss their characters because of the clothes and setting. I can't for the life of me understand the criticism I have read from reviewers who say the film lacks soul. These ladies, to each one, bring you into the story and make you care beyond the guns and mayhem. There is a lot of music that accompanies each scene. A mix of score and soundtrack music really sets the scenes. Snyder does an excellent job picking songs which have lyrical content in step with the scene, many times serving as the narrator.I can't say enough good things about this film. It was right in my wheel house. It hit all the right beats and surpassed my expectations, which were raised through the trailers. It will not be for everyone, it will be a film that divides friends. That is the best kind of film that can create reactions on both sides. The worse thing that can be said about a film that it elicits no kind of reaction, this is not that kind of film.",9,12,26,25 March 2011
The Hangover," A romp
","For the first time in quite a while, the expectation built by a film's promotion equaled my final opinion of a film. In this case, I expected a romp and it is exactly what I got.The principle actors here shine brightly. There has been quite a bit of singling out of Bradley Cooper, but all three of the principle characters; 'Phil', played by the aforementioned Cooper, relationship oppressed dentist 'Stu', played by The Office alum Ed Helms, and eccentric soon-to-be brother in-law 'Doug', played by the always spot on Zach Galifianakis, take us on a great romp. Each plays off the other wonderfully and if any of them were not up to the task the film would have been the lessor for it. What makes this film work when it could easily be dismissed for the way over the top scenarios that happen is that we, the audience, learn about the previous night of debauchery along with the guys as they learn about it (or more accurately 'refreshed' about it). This makes the events a lot more fun because the audience shares in the emotions experienced with the guys. The plot is simple; 4 guys head to Vegas for one last party to celebrate/mourn the upcoming marriage of one of their own. But when our boys can't remember what happened when they awake the next morning, not to mention can't find the groom, things kick into high gear.There are supporting players sprinkled through the film like Heather Graham, Mike Tyson, Ken Jeong (another scene stealing spin), Mike Epps. None of these removes you from the fun, even when Tyson enters the scene. His presence just seems to fit and makes sense given the previous night's party. Be sure and watch the ending credits for photos taken during the night that shed even more light on what went down.The only complaint that could be leveled at the film is the anti-climatic ending. They do a great job of teetering the line of way over the top and plausible through the film. But the ending plays it safe, perhaps a bit too safe. The other complain is the waste of Justin Bartha. He plays the groom to be 'Doug'. His character is pretty much the straight man and is lost for most of the film with his character being lost. Bartha has shown great comic timing in previous supporting roles that it would have been nice to utilize his talents a bit more.This is one of those films you have to go and see again because you inevitably miss something from everyone in the theater laughing. I will be seeing it again myself.",9,2,4,12 June 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Almost perfect
","Raiders of the Lost Ark will always be, along with the first Rambo film First Blood, the beginning of a new era of action film. With its constant forward motion of action/story/action/story, the film gives you very little in character, yet you never need it. It feels exactly like the serial film that it is intended to be. Harrison Ford is Indy through and through. The use of mostly physical stunts and actual locations set the standard that Hollywood all too soon forgot about, but has returned to through the Bourne films and the recent reboot of James Bond.There really isn't much to nitpick here. Performances across the board are fantastic. Karen Allen is the perfect woman for Indy. She is strong yet not star struck like his many female students. Yes, she was at one time, but the Marion we meet in Raiders is wiser and stronger. As mentioned before, there isn't a lot of character study done in this film, but through the fantastic performances of Ford and Allen we know all we need to know. Supporting cast assembled is some of the best ever, persons, who at the time, were not household names in America, but fill out all the roles as if they were born to play them.There will never be another Raiders.",9,0,0,26 May 2008
United 93," Powerful
","We are beings that no matter the tragedy, we like to revisit and chew on it for as long as we can. September 11th and all the events that unfolded is no exception.For this to be the first studio film to tackle the subject, it is a great start. Shot more as a documentary, the film doesn't try to create false sentiment or make one group out as victim or hero. It just tries to set the course of events, as best we know them.Using no big name actors and using a large portion of persons who worked that day, the film stays grounded.All the naysayers and detractors of this film can claim conspiracies and the like. This film probably set the bar at a level no other 9/11 based film will reach.",9,4,8,1 May 2006
Star Trek," Makes you appreciate the original series again
","The best thing that can be said about the new Star Trek movie is that finally, after several Star Trek series inceptions and, in later years, sub-par movies, we are finally given a Trek which makes us appreciate the original series again. The film takes us through a 'what if' scenario, much like something the original series would have done. Back in force is the humanity of the franchise that I feel had long been forgotten in the later movies and the varying new series.All of the cast are fantastic here. Nobody does any mimicking, instead, they take the characters we all know and love and they stay true to how they were portrayed. Pine never resorts to Shatner's delivery (though he does do a bit at the end as a homage no doubt) as is the case with all of the other cast members. Urban is probably the closest of anyone to channeling the characterization created by the original 'Bones', Deforest Kelly. Urban is every bit the cantankerous doctor we all love and remember. Again, this can be said of everyone. Zoe Saldana actually rises above the previous incarnation of 'Uhura' and brings to life a full on character that Nichelle Nichols would be proud of.Simon Pegg's 'Scotty' makes his appearance midway into the film and if there is any negative I can throw at the film is his late appearance, though his introduction is a fun one. Cho and Yeltin bring new appreciation for our old friends 'Sulu' and 'Chekov' respectively. Eric Bana's 'Nero' is totally unrecognizable. This helps keep us in this universe, as does the fact that the majority of the main players are known, but not so well known actors that their real life persona overshadows the character they play. Quinto's 'Spock' is every bit of the logical thinker, yet fused with an emotional element, that Nimoy created originally. There is a new relationship 'Spock' is involved in that I am sure will have Trek fans talking about for many months to come. All of the characterization asides, this film works or fails based on the relationship being built between Pine's 'Kirk' and Quinto's 'Spock. This is the beginning of their relationship and it must plant the seed for what will be a lifetime of adventures that culminate with the famous line 'you have been and always shall be, my friend.' The film and the actors succeed in spades. My only major complaint about the film would be the music. I felt it lacked a true 'theme' and was pretty underwhelming throughout the film. We are given an update to the original series' theme, but even that seems to be less than effective when compared to the original. J.J. Abrams should be applauded for taking a beloved set of characters and breathing new life into them and the franchise which had sadly seemed to of ran its course. All of the characters have been written and performed with a renewed life and enthusiasm. Each character is imbued with more power in their respective positions within the ship. Abrams has pulled off the almost impossible; giving us hope that once again our beloved crew of the U.S.S Enterprise can 'boldly go where no man has gone before.'",9,3,12,9 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Uneven first half is made up for with a rousing second half
","I have given Iron Man 2 the same 8 rating I gave the original. Mainly because both are flawed films, but in the end, are rousing, fun summer movies that do not cater to the lowest common mind level, yet don't take themselves too seriously.Iron Man 2 starts out, much like Spiderman 3, with Tony Stark seemingly basking in the glow of Iron Man's accomplishments (it is set 6 months after the first film). However we learn quickly that Tony is hiding a pain within; the reactor is slowly killing him. A long with that, we learn Tony and his father were not very close, more angst to throw into the pot. Thus we have Tony Stark slowly going out of control and his friends; Pepper, Happy and Rhodie must pull him in.The first half comes off a bit uneven to me, not sure why, it just never seemed to find a steady groove. It is not the pace, as with the first, there is never any moments of watch checking, it just had an uneven flow of one scene to the next for me, like they were trying to find the groove but not quite getting it. It isn't until an hour into the film that it finally found a rhythm for me. Once it did find that rhythm it brought the film home, with an excellent 3rd act.Performances across the board are excellent. I have to say I missed Howard as Rhodie. Cheadle is by no means a slouch actor, but he doesn't have the same presence in uniform that Howard had. Johanson brings everything you would expert to the siren role she is cast in. Definitely look forward to seeing more of her in further adventures. Rourke is his usual method self, totally absorbed in the role of Whiplash and eating up every scene he is in.One of the things I enjoyed most about the film is the continual interweaving of the whole Marvel universe, especially the hints of other characters involved with the Avengers. We are actually introduced to the Avenger concept in the film, which, for the comic geeks out there, will be a glorious thing to witness. Another is the expanded role of Tony's father, which is done through old news and company reel, but helps to give us more of a full view of the Stark patriarch and more importantly, his feelings toward his song Tony, who has felt he never quite measured up to his father's expectations.My two main complaints with the film are minor ones, but still kept it from being a 9. The first I have already mentioned, the first hour was herky jerky, never seeming to find a steady groove. This was resolved by the last hour and it gave us a much improved upon 3rd act, one of the flaws that the first film had in that the 3rd act was entertaining, but lacked a grand finale feel. My other complaint is the score. I absolutely loved the score for the first film. The mix of guitar and drum interwoven with string and horns made for a score that felt at home with a move titled Iron Man. This go around, no such guitar or drum woven score. The 'theme' from the first film isn't even used again, a minor complaint, but one that took me out of the film a little as the first score really worked well and is sorely missed here. Composer Ryeland Allison and original music by Ramin Djawadi gave us an excellent score in the first. This go around they are replaced by John Debney who gives us a lackluster score.Lastly on the music front, don't believe the hype about the Iron Man 2 soundtrack, which purports to be nothing but AC/DC. There are only 2 songs by AC/DC in the entire film. So not sure why the soundtrack CD, which has 15 songs by AC/DC, is being purported as being the soundtrack, which it is not. Again, a slight critique, but something fans should know going in.My complaints are minimal, the film delivers on exactly what it should and it brings forth a start, of what looks to be a very fun and exciting summer full of theater entertainment. Oh yeah, one final thing, DO NOT GET UP AND LEAVE BEFORE THE END CREDITS. Wait them out, you will be pleasantly surprised, especially if you are a Marvel/Avengers fan.",7,3,4,10 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A solid second outing
","This film does for the Pirates franchise what Empire Strikes Back did for the original SW trilogy. It sets in motion perils and obstacles for our heroes. It further embellishes upon the characters that were introduced in the first film. It amps up the action and brings in new characters with flair. All of this equals to a really good follow-up to one of the biggest surprise hits of 2003.Jack is back and he has never been better. Depp brings him full on and you love every minute of it. Knightly and Bloom are given much more dramatic meat this time and they feast aplenty. Both are in fine form. Majority of the main supporting cast from the first film are here and they again deliver. There are some new baddies introduced, the best of those being Davy Jones. Through the great character work of Bill Nighy and the fantastic craftsmanship of the ILM folks, Davy Jones is a wonder to watch.If there is anything that could be complained about is that there is so much more of everything, it leaves you feeling a bit like Jack after a night with his beloved Rum. But that is a minor complaint.The ending leaves us with perfect surprise and peril that we MUST see the third film to see how it all turns out.",8,1,2,7 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A perfect blend of story and characters
","The summer of 2003 had this film which came out of nowhere it seemed and took the box office by storm. Nobody gave a film about a Disney ride much of a chance. But through the force of a great story and even better performances, we got a very pleasant surprise.Nothing more to say about Depp that hasn't already been said. He is the force of the film. His 'Jack' pushes the film from being a really nice ride to being a great adventure of a film. But praise doesn't end there, Rush, Bloom, Knightly, Davenport and the rest of the supporting cast are absolutely great. The other performances can be lost in the tour-DE-force that Johnny gives with 'Jack', but the other players brought their 'A' game as well.The effects are fantastic here as is the score. Every element of this film belied the perception that came from the industry and fans waiting on it alike. Who would have known that a film based on a ride would be this good? Verbenski deserves a lot of credit for taking this film serious and not giving audiences what the protractors and doom sayers said would be delivered. Instead he brought back the pirate movie in a huge way. One of the best surprises in a long time.",10,0,3,16 July 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Good stuff
","Not knowing much about the story, went in with relatively no expectations. I was a little hesitant about all of the talking animals, but you know, it plays perfectly legit.The special effects, though not groundbreaking, work very well for a story that relies on a huge amount of the characters being animated. I thought all of them were nicely done and voiced well by everyone involved.The 4 kids were perfectly cast. I really enjoyed the youngest. She brought a great sense of wonder and heart to the film.Look forward to further adventures.",8,0,1,26 December 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," Impressed
","The Other Boleyn Girl is normally not a film that I would see in the theater. I took my mother to see this for her birthday. She wanted to see this so off to the theater we went. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The performances are fantastic, but I have to say Johansen surprised me a bit as I didn't think this was her kind of fare. She doesn't come off as being a period piece kind of actress. However she and Portman turn in the film's best performances, as well they should since they are playing the titled characters.Bana gives us a tortured and VERY faulty Henry VIII. Everyone of the cast, all BBC regulars, are stellar.The histrionics of the film aside, I was never bored and was kept completely pulled into the story mainly by the performances of Johansen and Portman. The locations are beautiful and you get a real sense of history from the production design and costume design, though the film's and the book it is based on, are not entirely factual in the account shown.I would recommend this one even at full price admission.",8,2,5,7 March 2008
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first!
","I for one was not totally blown away by the first Spider-Man film. Yes, it is a good comic to film, but somehow I just didn't get caught up in all the hoopla. That was changed with Spider-Man 2. This film took the successful elements from the first (character and acting) and pushed it up another notch.We were given again only 1 new villain, this saved much needed time to flesh out Peter Parker/Spider-Man as well as further the other story lines going on with those surrounding Peter. The struggle that Peter goes through; should he or shouldn't he sacrifice his life for others, is handled beautifully here. You feel that struggle. He may be a 'superhero', but he is still just a kid trying to sort out his life. A life that seems to sucker punch him every single day. I thought this was the most logical step to take the franchise after the introduction in the first. The special effects this time were much improved over the first. Many times I was taken out of the moment in the first film because the effects looked to much like effects and were not natural. That is still a problem from time to time here again, but by in large a much better outing.Story, performances, effects, all were improved in the 2nd installment, something we just don't see happen a lot. One of the best comic to film productions ever in my opinion.",9,7,10,16 July 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A fitting origin
","I have read many reviews that have blasted this origin film from the X-men franchise. Frankly, I don't see all the fuss. Jackman once again owns the character and he is surrounded by other folks having a blast. What more do you want? I am not an X-men expert. I have never read any of the comics. I grew up on the 1980's cartoon series. So I don't bring any fan-boy expectations to these film. In all honesty, I felt this film was better than the first X-men movie. X-men 2 still stands as the best of the franchise, but Wolverine and Last Stand are equal 2nd's in my book followed by the first film.There are many new characters thrown at us in the film. I think that is what folks have an issue with that have seen fit to moan and groan about this film. I need only point out the fact that this is called 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. My favorite X-men is finally introduced here, Gambit. He has little screen time, yet as much as I would have loved to see more of him (what we get is great), I came to see Wolverine's origin, not anyone else's. To that, we are actually given the origins of Sabertooth, though one that differs from the classic mythos (he is Logan's brother). The opening credits sequence quickly and efficiently catches us up on the brothers as they go through time taking part in all of the large wars fought this side of the equator.The effects are, in some places, marginal, yet in others blow you away (Gambit's card and stick effects are fantastic). Acting across the board is spot on. Ryan Reynolds makes you wish for more from his Dead Pool character (which I hear is pretty close to happening as a stand-alone film). All others bring their A-game and help make this an enjoyable film. The complaints are small; all in all, a worthy addition to the franchise. Enough with this Magneto origins talk, give us a Gambit origin!",7,3,7,7 July 2009
Hot Fuzz," Bring on the Fuzz!
","I absolutely loved this film. I can not wait until the DVD comes out so I can watch this over and over! I am not familiar with the guys that wrote, directed and starred in this, but man, they absolutely hit the nail on the head in their send up of American bad-arse cop movies. They hit the perfect note with the cop that can do no wrong surrounded by inept cops.Simon Pegg is picture perfect in this film. I have yet to see Sean of the Dead, but this film has me wanting to pick that title up sight unseen.I love the quick cuts and the mix of British sensibility with American hotshot cop flicks. You wouldn't think the two would fit, but Pegg and company do so effortlessly.",9,1,3,14 May 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Good, not the 'Best Picture' some would have us believe
","This film is a good film, no question about it. However, I think because of the subject matter, it is elevated to a level it never really attains on its own.The performances are really good. Maybe too good. I'm not sure how the Jack character is portrayed in the book, but I found the character to be selfish and sniffling. I really had a hard time feeling any sort of empathy for the relationship as a whole. I did have empathy toward Ennis. His struggle to remain loyal to both of his relationships was far more compelling than Jack's constant moaning and groaning. The total disregard for his own family and Ennis' hurt the overall relationship in my opinion.The film does tread the line I feared it would. There is a sense that the story wants you to believe that all cowboys have closeted homosexual feelings. Though it borders on this, Lee knows better than to try and push that and pulls back just enough to save it. My biggest fear was the relationship would be presented as common place just so as to validate it. It came close, but as I said, stopped just short of that.Overall, a good film with very good performances and beautiful shots of America's grasslands.",8,11,35,14 April 2006
Terminator Salvation," Solid entry
","Across the board, this film left me with a lot more of a satisfied feeling at the end than T3 did. Where T3 seemed to be pointless, this actually carried the franchise to the next level.Performances across the board are excellent. Probably the biggest surprise was Anton Yelchin as 'Reese'. I had reservation about his being able to pull off the classic character created by Michael Biehn. My fears were unfounded, Yelchin gives even more layer's to this familiar character. Howard, Bale, Wrothington, Bloodgood are all excellent. I thought Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal of 'Kate Connor' was a far more mature and grounded performance than Clair Danes from T3. Not to say Dane was bad, I just never believed her to be the wife of the future hope of mankind. Howard just seems to come off with more gravitas.The story takes us into the first stages of the war, to the beginning of the T800's. The effects are the best of the franchise. A10's are used by the resistance and it is a very cool sight seeing them up against the HK's. The apocalyptic feel of the movie is great, it feels like I have always imagined it to be. What is very nice is how the resistance is basically pockets of humans who are brought together through Connor's radio messages. Most have never met him, yet they are ready to follow his every command.There are check point items throughout the film that help to explain and setup the Terminator lore that we have come to know, like how Connor receives the scar on his face. We are even given the famous 'I'll be back', now given from a different character you wouldn't expect, yet it comes off a lot more natural than the jokey way it was forced in T3.Brad Friedl is still missed on the score front. Danny Elfman does a better job than Beltrami did in T3, but still, Friedl's scores stand as the benchmark of the series. On that note, Elfman has woven into the score the main themes from Friedl's score. This is a welcome addition compared to the pedestrian Beltrami score of T3. The major flaw to me is not the film itself, but that they reveal too much in the trailers, especially about the Marcus character. It would have been nice if his big revelation was more of a surprise. If you have seen the promos then you pretty much know his big reveal.I do not understand the complaints levied by critics who say the film is without a human/emotional element. I thought the film was right on par with the first two films in the emotion department. Yes, we meet several characters and don't have a lot of back-story, but the emotional context of what is going on is never lost and the end hits an emotional plateau that easily readies you for more.",7,4,7,21 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At Worlds End avoids the Return of the Jedi syndrome
","Having looked forward to this film for a year, the opportunity for disappointment was high. The last time I waited in this much anticipation I was treated to a Muppet fest in RoTJ. Not this time. I have read some comparisons to the opening of RoTJ and this film and I have to say anyone making that connection is totally daffy! The film is daring in the opening scene before the title and continues forward with a great action packed introduction.The wait was worth it. The film is darker than the previous films and lighter at the same time. It does a great job of throwing you an emotional fastball and then the next minute you get a lighter curve ball. I loved how Jack's sanity or lack of it, is explained and shown. The effects are beyond anything that has come out this year. At times you can't help but wonder if what you are seeing is practical or special effect.There are a few story elements that are not followed through with, such as the calling by the pirate brotherhood of a certain 'beasty' which in the end really never seems to play out just right. But in the end, you don't really care. These characters that we have grown to love are in full on action and it is great to see.Stay around for the final scene that is shown at the end of the credits, unlike the previous two films that had more or less throwaway scenes at the end, this go around we are given a substantial final gift.This is definitely a multiple viewing movie.",9,1,1,24 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Not quite bad, not quite good enough.......
","After the 2nd film broke the chain of sequels always being inferior by in many ways surpassing the original, the 3rd installment shows signs the creative forces are tired.There are many elements that make the film enjoyable. The thread of emotional struggles between love, hate, revenge, jealousy, envy, pride, etc, are fun to watch. But with so much going on and the tidy clean up at the end, you feel cheated somewhat.The bad; too many villains and too many subplots. This was not the time to introduce TWO new villains. I would have been content with just the introduction of either Venom or Sandman rather than throwing them both into the mix. The Sandman story needed much more time to develop, yet ends up taking too much time away from this film which ultimately causes the film to merely brush over the whole Venom storyline. I have to agree with many that the special effects seemed a bit too......well, like special effects. I found myself many times being taken out of the moment by sub-par character effects. The good; Gwen Stacy. I thought Howard was great. She is gorgeous, so much so that Kirsten Dunst looks rather plain compared to her. Jamison and all the supporting cast once again come with their A-game. Tobey is very good as is Dunst, though she by far is saddled with the least appealing character this go around. In the end, Spider-man 3 fell victim to the curse of putting too much into one story in order to accommodate some producers desire to sell more toys.",6,1,2,14 May 2007
Knocked Up," Good stuff
","The latest film in the resurrection of R-rated comedies does what it should, but doesn't do much else. There were many instances that I could identify with what the characters were going through. But in the end, the heart that was present in 40-year old Virgin was in short supply here.All the leads and supporting characters do a very good job, but it is the same thing we have seen from this group previously. I would have liked to seen a little more exploration outside the world of slacker pot smokers. But this seems to be a comfort zone, but one that is running the course quickly. Seth Rogen is very believable as the lumpy pot head slacker who ultimately grows up.....just enough to win the girl. Katherine Heigl is very good as the hottie who makes a mistake, but instead of running the other direction gives our shlump a chance to be a dad and be her mate for life.Apatow seems to have this genre down, I just hope we don't continue to see the same thing being recycled over and over.",7,1,4,19 June 2007
Shutter Island," Wow
","I am one who is hot/cold when it comes to Martin Scorsese. More times than not I am on the cold side. However, with Shutter Island, for me, this is one of Scorsese's best ever. Decaprio was in two of the best films that were put out this year. Inception, and this early year gem. Decaprio is absolutely brilliant, as is everyone in this film.The fun of this film is trying to figure it out as it goes. You think it is going one way and then you are not sure and you start thinking it is going another.The island itself becomes a character in the film. It is almost like it comes alive.I really don't want to give away too much of the story. Read the synopsis, but stay away from spoiler filled discussions and/or reviews. The less you know about the film, the better. My best piece of advice; don't try too hard to figure the film out. It is really easy to start trying to guess what is going to happen next. You are going to have an inclination of what is going on, but don't try and start guessing what is around the next corner. The fun of Shutter Island is figuring it out on the way to an ending that you may or may not have figured out. Either way, a highly enjoyable thriller.",9,1,3,7 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A fine start to the end
","I have only read one book in the series, which is Deathly Hallows. I have been a fan of all 6 previous films solely based on the films themselves. Having read Deathly Hallows I came into this film with a little nagging concern. Would I be like some who are readers of the books and have felt the films removed way too much? Or would I continue to be content with the story and enjoy it the same? The answer is a resounding I loved this! Having read the book previous actually helped me to enjoy this film even more.This is by far my favorite film to date. I was worried how Kloves would handle the tremendous amount of exposition that comes with this book. I need not have worried as there are elements which are downplayed considerably; most notably Harry's growing doubt of Dumbledore (this is only hinted at), his farewell to the Dursley's and the efforts on the home-front, mainly the Lovegood updates from the home-front. The camping scenes, as they have come to be known, are handled expertly and it is these segments that are some of the most enjoyable.There are some embellishments here and there, all work well, especially a dancing segment during the camping montage. There are no surprise deaths, fans will be relived to know the deaths from the book have not been softened or changed.Cinematography,music, SFX's, all are some of the best to date. The acting too is fantastic. I had read many a review previous to seeing the film that highlighted Grint's turn as Ron this go around as being the stand out. I have to agree he is the best he has ever been. But to me, Emma Watson is the diamond here. She has probably matured the most of the three leads, funny that she is the one who really isn't set on continuing to act after all the Potter films have come out.One of the best films I have seen this year, it whets the appetite and has me anxious for the finale in July.",9,1,3,19 November 2010
Knowing," Almost a really good movie.....
","For about three quarters of the film, I was totally engrossed with the story and characters. Then the plot twist enters and the movie went to blazes and a hand basket from there.I normally enjoy Nicholas Cage. He can play some quirky folks, but he is always enjoyable. That is the case here, there is really nothing wrong with his performance, or with anyones performance for that matter. The problem lies within the story and how it plays out.We have this intriguing numbers riddle that Cage is able to work out. All of it is counting down to the end of the world. Can he stop it? Can he save his son? Is there nothing that can be done? The movie asks those questions and you are taken along for the ride wondering what those answers will be. For me, the answers were unsatisfying. I walked out of the theater wondering just what the heck the movie supposedly stood for.",6,0,1,16 April 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Close, but no cigar
","This film played better for me on subsequent viewings, but I never have been able to escape the feeling of 'what is the point'? I mean, we basically end up at the end of this one no further than we were after the second one. Sure, time wise we were carried further and we learned some things about John Conner. But I think they did the character a disservice basically showing how pathetic he becomes after the second film.Performances are good in this and the effects are top notch, best of the series. I think in the end, had this film actually taken us to the events after the rise of the machine and given us the battle ensuing, it would have made for a better film. As I said, as is, the film just kind of leaves you in the same place the other two left you in and I know for myself, I was really hoping for something more.",6,0,1,29 May 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," T2 did the almost impossible
","T2 equaled the first film in the franchise. A hard thing to do in the modern era of sequels. Especially given the amount of years between the two films and how the franchise was basically reinvented with this installment by having Arnie play the good guy.This one was less science fiction and more character and action driven. Though the first film was no slouch on the action, this one doesn't have the same feel as the first. But that is good. Fans always want the same, but different. And we sure got it in large doses with T2.It would be hard pressed to find a second movie in a franchise that is as good as T2. Unfortunately they could not duplicate the same with T3, but at least 2 out of 3 isn't bad.",8,1,2,22 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Darker isn't always better
","I know that many of the readers of the books, those that post on IMDb anyway, and the critical mass hailed this as the first authentic recreation of the universe that Rowling created. Again, I come to these films totally ignorant of the books, however, for me, the criticism of Columbus' first 2 films in the franchise is nitpicking. Further, the praise given to this film I think is overdone.The kids are once again great, but the film to me is disjointed and a mess. Not sure if the book treats the Black character the same as the film, but when we FINALLY get to see him in the flesh, he is gone again. I thought the whole lead up to his reveal was overdone. Oldman plays the character fantastically, but the character is hyped so much in the film and then given very little in the end that I felt almost cheated.As for the darkness of the film, it works in furthering the story, but just because it is darker doesn't make it better. I still think Columbus did an excellent job with the first two films and I don't understand the criticism of his films and the lauding of this one.I was very disappointed that once again Snape, the Malfoy's and Dumbledore are all but absent here. Again, not sure if in the books these characters are thrown to the side, but they are characters I personally would like to see more time given to. Draco is turned into an absolute wimp this go around and I thought that totally discredited his character. Yes, he has the cowards personality shown in the first two films, but he is also seen as a serious threat to Harry. Now he is reduced to the clichéd wimpy bully here. Another major rub this time around is Dumbledore. He is reduced to a dismissive kindly old man. Is he not the headmaster? Yet he seems to have little to do from a leadership stand point. All in all, this was a good movie, but for me, the weakest in the franchise to date. There is a lot of good in it, but there is also a lot of negative, mainly with the characters I mentioned, and in the end made the film a disappointment for me.",8,1,2,16 July 2007
Ratatouille," Computer animation taken up a notch
","It is one thing to take the animation up a notch, as the film does fantastically. But they have also increased the sophistication of the story telling.Right on par with Bird's other films for Disney/Pixar, Ratatouille makes excellent use of characters and story. There is enough to keep the kids entertained (the usual Pratt falls, chases, etc), as well as an ever growing sophisticated humor and story telling that opens up the general audience to enjoy the film, not just the kids.Back in the 2nd golden age of animation (mid-late 80's to late 90's) Disney was able to tap into a wider audience by providing state of the art animation with more complex stories. As the computer age was ushered in, once again Disney rose to the occasion a long with Pixar. Though with their last outing CARS, they took a step back, here with Ratatouille they regain the momentum again.The strange thing about Ratatouille is there is no easily marketable tie-in toy. Of course, that hasn't stopped the Disney folks from trying to peddle stuffed rats. But for the first time a film of theirs has to totally sell itself by story alone and that makes this a very successful movie in my opinion. It does succeed without the tie-in.Voice work across the board is spot on. There are no highly recognizable actors lending voice talent to remove you from the world. Ratatouille creates a world that you stay within. This could bring about similar voice casting in the future where some known voices are used, but the leads, as is the case here, are filled with mostly unknowns.Great job overall!",9,3,5,6 July 2007
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Appreciation depended on Cerra
","This was the year that we saw several little known comics made into films. Kick-Ass was the first out of the gate and in my opinion, the best. We were then given this film, Scott Pilgrim, directed by Edgar Wright. The biggest difference between the two films is your enjoyment of Scott Pilgrim is far more dependent on your tolerance/enjoyment of several elements.Firstly, you must be a fan of Michael Cerra. With Scott Pilgrim he continues the same shtick that he has presented in pretty much all of his roles to date. I personally have grown tired of that shtick. He doesn't ruin the film for me, but my weariness of his seemingly limited range kept me from fully appreciating the film.Second, you need to have a frame of reference when it comes to video games. The film, as is the comic, resides in the world of video game reference. I personally enjoyed the continual video game style of story presentation, however this is not going to be something the general movie audience will appreciate.Third, you need to be a fan of Edgar Wright's direction and story telling skills. Personally, I love Wright's direction and story telling skills. Were this film directed by anyone else, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. Wright's quick cuts that he is known for do overstay their welcome as the film is done almost entirely through quick cuts and that can be jarring.My biggest issue with the film is Cerra. He is still playing the same character that he has played in previous films. Why that is a problem here is that compared to Ramona's previous ex-boyfriends, you have to scratch your head as to what there is about Cerra's Pilgrim that would attract her to him. This believability is a very high hurdle to get past, especially if you are not a Cerra fan. I don't hate the guy, I just think this film would have been better served with a lead who actually looked the part. What hurts the casting of Cerra in the lead role is he pales in comparison to Ramona's, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ex-boyfriends. The boyfriends, played by Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, etc, look like they would be someone Ramona would go after. Cerra's Pilgrim has nothing in comparison to offer. Ultimately, I found myself not pulling for Cerra and Winstead to get together, rather, for Cerra and his dumped girlfriend, Knives Chau played by Ellen Wong, to stay together. This is a major issue with the story as we are supposed to be pulling for Scott and Ramona to be together.All of the supporting characters are wonderfully brought to life. It is the supporting characters, action and Edgar Wrights direction that ultimately pull this up to a 7 for me. It is Cerra's casting that reduces this film's rating. Again, I don't want to come off as a Cerra hater, I just think his continued reliance on the same mannerisms, voice inflection and his overall physical inadequacies, make his Scott Pilgrim not reflective of the Pilgrim from the comic. Or for that matter, a hero lead that is believable.",7,1,6,1 January 2011
Enchanted," Disney Old School
","Enchanted is how Disney used to make live action films. There is enough whimsy and fun in the film to keep the kids involved, but there is also the elements that keep the parents in the seats with their kids. This really could have been a mess given the wrong leads. Amy Adams delivers a fantastic performance, she will be working in many films to come. Her performance is the cornerstone of the film. James Marsden once again shows a penchant for comedy (anyone checking out the 'making of' docs on any movie he has done has seen his wit in action). McDreamy steps back into the big screen with success. Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall are pitch perfect on the villain side of the house. Back on Adams, she is an absolute pleasure to watch, doe-eyed and all. The musical number in the park is worth the price of admission alone. It hearkened back to the heyday of when Disney did live-action musical comedies in grand style. They now have a new entry to go a long side the classics. Movies are all about the story and the actors you have to pull off the story. Disney hit a home run here with a self-parodying effort that could have failed, but with an excellent cast, the film rises to the top of Disney live-action comedies.",8,2,2,3 December 2007
Quantum of Solace," Quality of Bond
","I have read other reviews, both fan and paid critic, that seem to absolutely miss the point of Quantum of Solace. The biggest miss is that this is the very first direct sequel in the franchise. We catch up with Bond literally minutes after the events of Casino Royale, which means he is still 'learning' to be 007. With that, his emotions are very fresh off the loss of Vesper. He is still evolving into the Bond that Connery introduced with Dr No back in 1962. The producers are doing a very smart thing here, in that they are taking Bond back to the beginning and allowing him in these first two films to become Bond. I have no doubt that all the elements fans have learned to love about Bond will be introduced in Craig's subsequent adventures as Bond. But you folks need to let him become Bond, not go from the ending of Casino Royale and all of a sudden be a mature 00 agent. Craig does that at the end of Solace, his leaving behind of the last symbolism connected to Vesper and his subsequent admission to M show he is now ready to become the agent we know.From start to finish, QoS hits us heavy and hard. There is no wasted moment on the screen, each minute is pushing the birth of Bond along. There have been complaints about the shaky action in the first act of the film. In my opinion, this action has to be frantic, it is a direct representation of Bond's mental state. He is not taking time to think much, but react. I think given the penchant for the hand-held action the last 5 years, I have become accustomed to it and I was not bothered by it, as said, it represented for me the visual image of Bond's state of mind.Once we are done with the frantic 1st act, the 2nd act gives us the usual pause for exposition. We learn that a new threat is amongst the world, it is called Quantum. We are given a more details of what this new organization is all about. Greene is the new villain and like Le Chiffre, we learn just enough about him, but in the end, he is yet a clog in the wheel of Quantum. This is much in the same vain as the early Bond films introduced Spectre. I really love how this new criminal organization is being introduced.Finally we get a 3rd act that is all about Bond putting his recent past to rest and becoming a full fledged 00 agent. The ending is both satisfying and emotional. I can't think of a better 3rd act in Bond history. There has been some who have complained about the lack of depth or exploration of character with the two Bond Girls introduced in this film; Camille and Strawberry Fields. First off, anyone that has been a long time fan knows there are always two Bond Girls introduced, one that has a short time on screen (usually meeting an untimely demise) and the main Bond Girl who grabs the bulk of Bond's time. This film is no different; Fields is the quick, but ultimately doomed one and Camille is the main. Any complaints here come from reviewers with absolutely no history with the franchise. I loved how Fields ended up being much like Jill Masterson of 'Goldfinger', both in screen time and demise. On a superficial note, I enjoyed the title song. I'm not much on Jack White, but the song sets a perfect tone and coupled with Key's vocals, it kicks the movie off in the right atmosphere. It was nice to see the return of the T&A opening credits sequence, another nod that Craig's incarnation of Bond is that much closer to the one introduced in 1962.Pish posh on those that can't see this film for what it is. I can not wait for the next installment.",8,2,7,19 November 2008
Twilight," Count me as a Twilighter.....
","I can't remember the last time that I was literally one of 3 or 4 men in an otherwise packed theater. Tonight was just the case when my wife and I took in Twilight. My interest had been peaked by a co-worker who is female and a big Twilight fan. My wife has not read the books (nor I) but did receive the first 2 for Christmas. We wanted to check out the movie and see what all the hoopla was all about. We were not disappointed.I really enjoyed this movie. It does play like an episode straight out of any female focused romance story that is currently playing on TV. But there is a maturity about the film that brings it up a notch. It is full on love story stuff, but being a guy who isn't afraid to embrace the chick-flick side, I was pulled into the story, even though I know basically the outcome of the whole 4 book set. Catherine Hardwicke spun a very nice tale, it is shame she will not be back for New Moon. I thought all of the acting was top notch, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson the obvious standouts. But it was the supporting characters; Edward's family, Bella's friends and family, that really helped with the enjoyment of the film.I had heard reports of laugh inducing dialog, never caught any of that. With any story that has a target audience that is in their teen years, one must expect earnest and often overly dramatic dialog and moments. It never goes into the day-time soap variety. There was a lot of online snipping from mucho-macho fanboys that mocked the film (without having read the books) and called in a Covenant clone. Too bad they won't let their geek cred take a hit and actually go see this film before bashing it. Not anything that will change cinema forever, but a very different and entertaining take on the vampire genre. The thing I enjoyed the most was the return of romance to the vampire tale. Recent films have taken a more action approach to the vampire tale. I can't wait for New Moon.",7,157,308,2 January 2009
Cars," Good, but that isn't the usual reaction to Pixar/Disney
","While this film gets a decent enough score from me, a 6, this film suffers from two things; a lack of distinct style and believability. In all the previous Disney/Pixar creations, each had its own animation style that set it apart. Here, this looks like a hodge podge of Toy Story and Monsters Inc. The believability of the characters is a huge hurdle here. I think the choice of cars as characters hinders the believability of the characters and we the viewer being able to relate to them.There is very little in the way of adult entertainment in the film and with a run time of right at 2hrs, it feels that long, especially for kids. My daughter was bored with the film after an hour, something she hasn't ever been with the previous Disney/Pixar films. I have to say I agree with her. The ending is nice enough and the film does have its moments. But overall, this is a pedestrian effort from all involved.",6,2,5,12 June 2006
Ghost Rider," Better upon further viewing
","The first time I watched this film, I thought it was OK. However, after many viewings I have come to embrace the film a lot more.Everything from the villains, the plot and the sets are over the top, but what should we expect from a film based on a character that has a flaming skull of a head? I mean come on, this is not high art. It is an opportunity to stretch and have some fun. Cage does so in spades and gives us a modern Texas cowboy.As with Dare Devil, Johnson knows the material but is not so much of a fan boy that he doesn't miss the opportunities to take an already absurd story and treat it too serious. Johnson has tackled two of the more dark comics in the Marvel catalog, but he has a touch I appreciate which is respect but not so much that it becomes blind reverence. I know, I know, comics are the modern day lore and myth. But they are not so steeped in lore and myth that their intent should be missed and that is to take reality and stretch it.I absolutely love the settings that Johnson uses, at times this feels like a modern day spaghetti western. Were it me, I would have kept the story strictly in the desert. But that would bely the setting of the comics. As is, we get a really cool story told in two worlds.Sam Elliot is the man plain and simple. His Caretaker is the grounding element of the movie, the anchor. Fonda's take on the devil is both inspired and genius. He gives the 'red one' a much needed makeover and I love watching Fonda chew up the scenery when he is on. He is over the top and under the table, all in the same scene. I love that.Eva Mendes comes off as pretty much window dressing, which is what the comics usually do with their female characters. I don't fault Johnson here, but would have liked a little more substance than boobs from Mendes.All in all, gets better with every viewing.",7,2,3,19 June 2007
Kick-Ass," One of the best from 2010
","I held off placing a review of this film out here, mainly because I was lazy. But also because I wanted this film to fully sink into my consciousness. This is one of the few films that I can honestly say saw major rotation in my Blu-ray player. It is one of the gems from 2010.Many comics are getting the film treatment nowadays. Few however see the transition done this well. Vaughn has taken the comic created by Mark Millar and turned it into a live-action treat.Young Dave Lizewski, as played by the fantastic Aaron Johnson, just wants to make a difference. He has no super powers, no training to speak of, he just has a costume and a desire to do good. Johnson juggles the character of Lizewski/Kick-ass beautifully. From his dead-on American accent (those that don't know, he is English) to the wholehearted earnest desire to do right, Aaron Johnson has announced himself to the movie audience in a grand way. The film follows Lizewski as he sets about battling wrong in his town, while dealing with the same issues other teens are going through. It is this balance that makes the film fun to watch as you see him stumble through both his desire to right wrong, as well as capture the heart of a girl at school whom he has fallen for. The film follows Lizewski through all the par-ells that being a teen encompasses, with the added wrinkle of trying to be a 'hero'. As good as Vaughn's direction is and Johnson's take on Kick-ass, this film is taken to new heights by the team of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hitgirl (Chloe Moretz). Cage and Moretz father/daughter relationship is what makes this film work. Cage goes from playing an eerily mousy father to channeling Adam West when he dons the cape and cowl of Big Daddy. Chloe Moretz, what more can I say that hasn't already been said. She, like Johnson, announces herself to the movie audience with one of the best introductory characters in the last decade. Big Daddy and Hit Girl have a very unorthodox relationship, one that is built on the father raising his daughter to fear nothing and give no quarter to those that would do harm. Her violence is equal parts unsettling and invigorating to watch. You will shake your head as you take joy in watching her in action, yet coming to terms that this is a pre-teen committing major acts of violence.Mark Strong provides a wonderful screen villain for our heroes to battle. He seems to be making a niche in portraying villains, all different. His Frank D'Amico is dangerous, but is able to do this without resorting to camp that many actors go to when portraying comic villains. The person who goes a long way in stepping outside of previous roles is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He plays Chris D'Amico / Red Mist, the son of Strong's Frank D'Amico, and pseudo partner to our heroes, far and away from the McLov'n characterization that he is most identified with. He goes a long way in putting that character behind him with this role.This film was heavily marketed, but in the end did not do extremely well in theaters. I think many people who are not familiar with the comic and not informed of the film itself but only knew it from the trailers saw this as a comedy, when in all honesty the comedy comes organically from the situations that our characters find themselves in. It is not played for chuckles, it is played dead on serious. I think maybe some saw this as a comedy and shied away from it.It is a film which contains many elements that are hard for a general audience to accept and appreciate. The biggest being the violence. To Vaughn's credit, he did not pull back on the violence of the comic. A sequel was green-lit before the film hit theaters, I hope the box-office does not keep them from moving forward as it would be a shame not to see these characters mature in further adventures.",9,10,18,1 January 2011
Gran Torino," Powerful
","Clint Eastwood has once again created a character for the ages. Walt is a man, who at the beginning of the movie is a pretty pathetic person. His wife has just died, he doesn't have much of a relationship with his kids, he is a bigot. Yet some how, the Vietnamese family next door is able to break through the walls Walt has built up.I enjoyed the journey of seeing a man go from not giving a damn, feeling unworthy of love, ending up redeemed and ultimately finally able to lay down the past. The relationship built between Walt and the Lor family is classic. I love Ahney Her as 'Sue'. She ignores Walt's outer defenses of bigotry and gets through to him, all the way to his heart. There has been much debate about Bee Vang's portrayal of 'Thao'. To me, his raw delivery and performance add a reality to his character. He shouldn't be polished in his delivery of words, he shouldn't look comfortable being uncomfortable. Eastwood gets out of him a very honest performance, one that helps to sell their relationship.The relationship between Walt and Thao starts out in the unlikely of circumstances; Thao trying to commit a crime against Walt for a gang initiation. Through that event, a trust and love is built between the two, like father and son. It is great to watch it develop. It is through this relationship and the overall relationship with the Lor family that Walt is able to come to terms with many elements of his life. Ignorance and indifference are replaced with an informed love and appreciation for people, something Walt hasn't felt in a very long time. A powerful and gripping movie.",8,1,4,17 January 2009
Shrek the Third," Shrek brings home the crown
","I am someone who looks at reviews, especially official press reviews as a gage of how a movie is going to be. Good thing I don't let these reviews deter me from seeing a movie, otherwise I would have missed out on the delight that SHREK the THIRD is.Picking right up from where SHREK 2 left off, we find our heroes dealing with the death of the king. Shrek is looked as the heir apparent. But there is another, Arthur, or 'Artie', as he likes to be called, is away at school and Shrek, wanting to retreat back to his swamp, takes out to retrieve Artie so he and Feona can go back to just being themselves.Across the board, the voice work is right on par with the previous entries. Timberlake is very good as the would be king. The pop references and pokes at the world of fairy tales is once again on display. I find it curious all of the press critics who say this film lacks what the other two films had. I was entertained just as much this go around as I was with the first 2. Unlike Spider-Man 3 that tried to throw too much into one movie, SHREK the THIRD is tightly paced and outside of Arthur and a few others, there is no over crowding of characters or storyline.SHREK the THIRD, if anything, reaches for the heart more than the previous 2. I enjoyed that, as the fan base for these films has matured, it is only natural that the films themselves age, and in the case of SHREK the THIRD, they age gracefully.",8,3,6,19 May 2007
Back to the Future Part III," One of the best 3rd acts of any trilogy
","I absolutely love this film. With the hopping between the 50's, 80's and the future in the other two films, it was a perfect time for the franchise to go back even further. The old west is a great place to finish up the trilogy. All of the themes that played out so well in the first film are wrapped up here nicely in the old West.This film I tend to find on TV more so than the others. Not too sure why, but I think the overall finality of it and the setting are contributing factors. This was the first time someone tried to film a franchises 2nd and 3rd acts back to back. I think of the films that have tried this, this trilogy was able to do it the best. I love this third act and it always makes me glassy eyed when 'the end' comes up.The relationship between Doc and Marty is one of the great character building relationships in film. Lloyd and Fox have forever cemented their place in movie history with this trilogy.",8,2,2,29 May 2006
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Enjoyed this, but with a sense of emptiness
","I enjoyed the first film. Never having read the books, I do not have any foreknowledge of events, other than what persons who have read told me, and that is very little. So strictly cinematically the first film was enjoyable. I thought Pattinson and Stewart had great chemistry, the entire Cullen clan was fantastic as well as the other supporting actors.This time around, I didn't come out of the theater with as much of a sense of satisfaction. The 1st act and last half of the 3rd act are strong,but most of the 2nd act and beginning of the 3rd left me looking at my watch and for the most part, made this film a less enjoyable experience. Once Jacob 'changes', the 2nd act drags to a halt and looses momentum. The main reason is the blossoming relationship between he and Bella feels forced. The film jumps around a lot in this section of the film and ultimately it hurts the chemistry between Lautner and Stewart, which doesn't have any kind of the emotional spark that Stewart and Pattison created in Twilight. I understand, from Bella's point of view, the relationship is more brother/sister. Still, there just seemed to be a lack of a focus in creating more of that tension here. Lautner and Stewart acting wise are good, but Weisz fails to create the relationship between the two that Hardwicke built so wonderfully in Twilight. Even the scenes between Stewart and Pattinson are not as intense as in Twilight. I don't want to play the gender card here, but I think this is a movie series that requires a keen sensibility of a young girl/boy relationship and Weisz, a talented director, was not up to the task of focusing on that like Hardwicke did.The music this go around (score) was done by a different person and I have to say also disappointed. I really loved the evocative score from the first film's music by Carter Burwell. But this go around, Desplat, to me, creates a more generic score that just wasn't as emotional.The vampire counsel, which I had looked forward to seeing is all of 7 or 8 minutes of the film. We get a hint of the powers they have, but that is about it. They are so much a part of the trailers yet a tiny part of the film.Most of my complaints I know are not entirely the fault of the movie, it is, from what I understand, a very faithful adaptation of the book. But perhaps a little deviation would have given it more access to those of us that are not informed through the books.I enjoyed the movie, but can find too much I didn't like that it is a minor disappointment. It hasn't lessoned by enjoyment of the series, but as a stand-alone element, it is definitely a far inferior effort, for me, to Twlight. Eclipse looks to be the movie I was hoping for in this film, I am looking forward to seeing it in June of next year.",6,2,7,21 November 2009
Transformers," A solid effort
","I grew up with the Transformers and find the whole 'diehard' nitpicking a bit ridiculous. The original cartoon was meant to be a tie-in to sell more toys, nothing more nothing less. Given that fact, all this pseudo gravitas created by the rabid following is funny to watch and listen to. If you take your Transformers THAT serious, stay home because this movie strives for nothing more than what we got with the early 80's cartoons.Effects are spectacular, explosions and action are top notch. But then again, that is no surprise, this is a Michael Bay movie. People really need to get off the hate Bay band-wagon and just understand and know summer means getting the blazes away from the real world and stepping into a cooled theater and enjoying some fun. Bay knows how to do that in spades and gives it to us here.The story is weak, holes through and through, but so what. The film succeeds in giving us exactly what we want from a Transformer film: robot's in action! If you have created some sort of alternate reality world where Transformers is about something more, again, stay home. There is comedic moment sprinkled all through the action. That does remove a sense of danger from the film, but then again, this wasn't supposed to be a rated R fest.My only disappointment with the film is the score. Normally with a Bay production we get a great anthem of score music. There really isn't much in the way of that in the film. We get some coolly placed rock music, but the score never really reaches out and grabs you. I had hoped for a variation on the Transformer theme, but what we get is a by the numbers score.This is another solid effort from Bay. A good way to get out of the heat of the summer and enjoy some fun.",7,1,4,6 July 2007
World Trade Center," Stone's best sinc Platoon
","I have to say, Oliver Stone surprised me. Politics were left aside. Grand standing was left aside. This is an incredible delicate and inspiring movie.Stone aptly recaptures many of the moments burned into our minds. The paper filled air and streets. Soot and ash covered survivors and rescue workers. Exhausted rescuers. They are all here and handled with class and dignity.I was worried that Stone would use this movie, this event, for his own political ideals. But instead he has respectfully paid homage to but one of the heroic and inspirational stories that came out of the 9/11 tragedy. All actors, across the board, are to be applauded for their performance. This could have easily become a soap opera.When the movie quietly ended, as the final update to the story flashed on the screen and the names of the port authority's finest that didn't make it home that day scrolled, the theater was deathly silent. Just the sound of feet slowly walking and the sound of people choking back tears. It was an experience of terror and of hope. That we once again can be united as we were in those early weeks and months after the tragedy.",8,6,14,12 August 2006
The Dark Knight," As close to perfect as you can get
","Make no mistake about it. The Dark Knight is not a great comic to film movie. The Dark Knight is a great film period. The only time you are reminded this is a comic based movie is when Bale enters frame in the Batsuit. From start to finish this is an emotionally packed roller-coaster ride that takes so many dips and turns you are exhausted at the end but ready to get back in line for another run through.The film is anchored by terrific performances across the board. There is not one single actor or actress that didn't bring their A-game. From the bit part players to the leads, the acting is top notch. Ledger has long been lauded for his performance and earns that. When he is on screen, there is no denying the power of his performance. But everyone, Bale, Oldman, Eckhart, Freeman and Caine all cement their performances as THE standard barrier for the characters they play. Gyllenhaal, though playing a thankless role as did Holmes, brings a more mature strength that was missing with Holmes. Persons like Eric Roberts and Anthony Michael Hall make fantastic returns to the big screen in small, but excellently played supporting roles. The story starts out with a robbery that is one of the most tightly and fantastically shot sequences in the last 10 years. Everything goes off like clock work. We see early on the absolute lunacy and genius in Joker's way of doing business. There is not one of the gang that survives the heist but him; orchestrating internal backstabbing to met the end he has conceived. You see, Joker has no plan per say, just the need to set everything in site on fire and revel in the chaos that follows. The story then twists and turns with our heroes having the upper hand one minute, only to realize they never had it and the ring master of chaos, Joker, has brought them all right where he wants them. It is the story that really sets this film apart from all other comic to films and even from its predecessor. Free of the origin trappings, the Nolan's and Goyer (story credit) expand this film to be a genre breaking affair. The comparisons to other films such as Heat and Godfather 2 are not hype or hyperbole fan-boys spewing unearned praise. These are warranted comparisons. As mentioned before, this is a great FILM and it should be compared directly with other films, not just comic to film projects.The score is absolutely fantastic. It is very aggressive. The Joker music is more of a sound, an eerie one that makes you uncomfortable, as it should. The heroes theme is expanded on, brought to full life that reminds us we are watching a story about someone doing extraordinary things. The action is top notch, with some fantastic chase sequences. The FX for Two Face are great, keeping with the realistic standard set throughout the film, his face is gruesome yet hard to look away from as you marvel at how well it is done. My only complaints about the film are the disposable way Scarecrow is used (not even sure why he was included) and the sound mix. I have seen the film twice, in different theaters, and the score and sound effects in many instances drown out the dialog, to include a very import prologue that Gordon delivers which summarizes the film and sets up the relationship between Batman and the city for the next film.I can only hope that the third film will not fall into the bloat that Spiderman 3 did. I hope that what Nolan and Co. have shown us here is but only a great 2nd act in what will be one of the, if not THE best 3 act trilogies of all time.",10,1,3,21 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Older and even darker
","I thought the last two installments of the Potter films had been dark, but none, to include the fan-favorite 3rd film, has been this dark or this good.I have seen many paid-critic reviews that are negative, asking where the 'magic' had gone. Where the wonder had gone. Hello, but Harry is now in the years when childhood innocence has been replaced by teen angst. Harry is finding Hogwarts, and life in general, darker and more complicated; where friends are harder to find and enemies seemingly around every corner.The character study this time around in regard to Harry is captured beautifully by Ratcliff. His acting talent has grown and matured through the years/films. A lot of the interacting between the three leads can be attributed to director David Yates. There is not as much fantasy this go around. In its place is a lot of drama, drama that comes with getting older and drama from the dangers that exist for Harry. Yates has brought about a reality in all the fantasy and it is exhibited the most (and best) in the relationship between the three leads.Finally we get to see Dumbledore in action and he shows why he is the headmaster at Hogwarts. Also, we get more of Snape this time around, to include more back story on him. Both of these characters have been dismissed in the movies, in my opinion. Luscious Malfoy is more of a presence, again, something I have longed for since he was introduced in the 2nd film. Draco continues to be a throw-a-way character, but more so than any of the films since the 2nd, characters that I actually have been intrigued with are finally being fleshed out and/or given more time. You can't throw praise to the film without mentioning Imedla Staunton's 'Deloris Umbridge'. Her character is fantastic! She makes you want to go through the screen and shake the pink out of her! Ralph Fiennes' Voldermort has about as much time as he had in Goblet of Fire. I can't wait to see him get even more time in the upcoming chapters. I absolutely loved Evanna Lynch's wispy 'Luna Lovegood'. Her character, in my opinion, has more of a spark on screen with Ratcliff's 'Harry Potter' than the one being forced with Katie Leung's 'Cho Chang'. Lynch and Ratcliff, to me, seemed to have far more chemistry than anything shown between he and Katie Leung. I am not familiar with the books, so I am not sure how these relationships are handled, but on film, to me, there is just no chemistry going on with Harry and Cho but overflowing between Harry and Luna. Of all the films, I think this one probably requires a more vested interest in the characters. If you do not care for them, then all the goings on will be a bit boring to you. There isn't as much action or whimsy to entertain. Instead, there is a deeper understanding and reflection on Harry and his struggle with the mantle he was born to ascend to. For those not interested in that, this chapter may not be to your liking.Great job, can't wait for the next chapter.",8,1,1,15 July 2007
Taken," Brute-tastic delight
","It has been a long time since we had a character like Bryan Mills, played surprisingly and convincingly by Liam Neeson in Taken. We have become a movie watching public which has been brain washed by the Bourne movies and to a lessor extent the dialog heavy action films of Tarantino that have come out lately. They give us 2 plus hrs of yakking, extraneous inner turmoil and brooding. Every now and then some action thrown in to keep us from falling asleep. We have been convinced that for us to feel for these men (and women), we must get inside their mind, we must see them hurt and struggle with the monster they are. It has been a long time, perhaps since the days of Segal (younger and thinner)hacking through guys like scissors through paper, that we had a an action hero who kicks ass and shows absolutely no mercy or regret and doesn't spend half the movie trying to reconcile the monster within. There is no time for such frivolity. Bryan has a job to do in Taken and all that brooding and reconciling can be done by others. Bryan only has 96hrs to get his daughter back or loose her forever. So he harnesses the power of the beast he has within him and God help anyone in his way. Bryan Mills is a dad who regrets his time missed with his daughter, but doesn't sit around brooding on it. His ex-wife is now married to a guy with lots of money. She does everything she can to bust his balls. Bryan is pressured by his ex-wife into allowing their daughter to head off to Paris with a friend; this is where the real movie starts. She is kidnapped not long after her arrival and before we have a chance to blink, Bryan is in Paris, cutting a bloody path to find where his daughter is. He is told, most girls taken with the intent to sell them into slavery, are out of the country within 96hrs. There is no time in those 96hrs to worry about what might happen. He uses any and all means at his disposal to hunt down, kill, maim, torture, etc, those responsible for his daughters abduction. The director Pierre Morel, who cut his teeth as the lens man on action films such as the first Transporter turns his star loose and Neeson gives a performance I didn't know he had in him. Written by Luc Beeson, the architect behind The Transporter films, has woven a very tight 93 minute film that doesn't waste time with extraneous brooding but fills every minute with adrenaline pumping action and revenge. Great stuff!!",9,1,4,30 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Misunderstood
","I am not sure the expectations of most people going into a Tim Burton film. It seems there is a certain expectation and when they don't see what they thought they were going to see, they are disappointed or confused. I think that this film is a prime example of that. Burton has become such an iconic director that his celebrity, not what his talent, precedes him and sets an expectation.Of all of Burton's latest films, I feel Alice is the most in line with his earlier work. It is a warped commercial vehicle that does exactly opposite of what you expect, which is the fun of going to see his films.This Alice is a grownup version, as played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She is caught between the young girl who is expected to do as she is told, yet like the younger Alice, walks her own path. Wasikowska's fresh face is welcomed; a more well known actress probably would not have worked as well.Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter is warped, just as one would expect. Everything from an off center eye to breaking into a Scottish accent when remembering the past or in battle, Depp gives the Mad Hatter a sense of uneasiness. This is best exhibited in the scenes between he and Wasikowska. There is an uneasy attraction between Alice and the Hatter, one that has been lost from the books in the other adaptations. Here, Burton goes for showcasing that attraction and it pays off.Bonham Carter devours the Red Queen, relishing every single minute and she is a joy to watch. Crispen Glover is perfectly cast as Stayne, her main man in many ways and himself eating up the scenery. In a surprise, Anne Hathaway's White Queen is purposely too calm and serene, almost to a chilling affect. Hathaway's gestures and manner of delivery give an uneasiness, that is fun to watch.The rest of the cast is voice talent; Matt Lucas as Tweeledee & dumb, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit and Alan Rickman as the Blue caterpillar. All are perfectly voice cast and give weight to the creatures they play.The special effects are wonderful to watch, I only wish I had seen it in 3-D. The effects are wonderfully warped, as usual with a Burton production. If anything, his warped artistic flair is perfect for this kind of story.As with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Sleepy Hollow, Burton is far more faithful to the source than previous incarnations and coupled with his visual style, Alice is a fun film to watch over and over.Alan Rickman ... Blue Caterpillar (voice)",9,3,5,19 June 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Not great, but an entertaining alternate spin on history
","Being one of the 'oppressed', as Christians are referred to in the book, I made sure to go into this movie fully informed of the real history vs. the made up and embellished Dan Brown history. I highly recommend anyone not familiar with the history to explore it and not let the movie and/or book be your sole source of information. It was disappointing that the Catholic church is once again portrayed as oppressive zealots in a story. It is getting a tad boring seeing the same old bad guys. But overall, the story does have an adventure element about it that is intriguing, too bad it takes itself so serious that it forgets to have fun.The film comes across as taking itself a tad too serious. This is an adventure, pure and simple. Yet the conspiracy element is played up way too much. Anyone familiar with the long rumored and talked about supposed relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene will find all of the 'reveals' to be yawn inducing and those not informed are not given enough to really care about it. So much talk is given to the conspiracy that you get a bit bored with the proceedings. I did like how the ending of the book was changed. I just wish they would have explored the sense of adventure inherent in the story rather than try and make it a serious docudrama. The similarly themed 'National Treasure' succeeded far better by not taking the itself too serious and this film needed the same kind of restraint.",7,0,1,28 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great start
","I came to these movies totally oblivious to the books. I have not read a page of any of the novels. With that, my critique of these films is purely on the cinema. I had not previously added my thoughts on the whole series to this point, but with the addition of my thoughts on Order of the Phoenix, I figure it is time I got caught up.I absolutely enjoyed this movie. I had heard all the clam-mering about Potter being a film and all the fans being pumped up, but as aforementioned, I had not read them, just know the basic outline. I thought Columbus captured a great sense of wonder and 'magic' with the film. All of the leads were perfectly cast and Columbus set the stage for the series and no matter your opinion of him, have to give credit where credit is due on those two facts.My only complaint about the movie was the end, which kind of was a little anti-climatic, all in all though, everything with this film from the costumes, set designs and casting were spot on. But the biggest contributor, as is the case with many film he scores, William's score raises this film from being a really good film, to a great one. John Williams is an absolute genius when it comes to finding the right themes for characters. His music adds the perfect touch to all that is going on.This is the lowest rated film of the franchise out here on IMDb, but for someone seeing these oblivious to the books, this was a great start for the franchise and still remains my favorite of the franchise so far.",9,0,1,16 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A redemptive effort after a sub-part 3rd entry
","If you have read my reviews to this point, you know I was disappointed with the 3rd film. My disappointment was replaced with enthusiasm here with Goblet of Fire.Dumbledore is better represented as the headmaster this go around. In my opinion, he was turned into a kindly old man in the 3rd film. This time around we actually are given more inclination that he really is in charge.All of the kids have stepped up their performances once again and that remains the one continual improvement with each film. Again, this goes back to them being cast excellently in the first film and that is paying off in spades with each subsequent film.I still feel the Malfoy's and Snape continue to be lost in the continuing new character carousel, but that was tempered this go around with an excellent story.The score is the only thing lacking in this 4th entry. John Williams is no longer at the helm and it is VERY evident. The score is a competent entries, but it lacks the style, magic and atmosphere that Williams created in the first 3 films. At least the main Potter theme is still there, but the franchise is the lessor without Williams' contribution to the scores.After a disappointing 3rd entry, Goblet of Fire got me excited about the franchise again.",8,0,2,16 July 2007
Thor," Enough gravitas to make it a good film
","Thor was a risk to bring to the summer multiplexes. Lets face it, there is a lot to cram into a 2hr film, especially one that is built for the summer crowd. But Branagh is able to mix equal parts Asgard gravitas and earth levity to make a film that is thoroughly enjoyable.Most of the praise should go to Chris Hemsworth who wields the hammer with all the confidence in the world. He was one of the few actors that was in both 'rhelms' and he was able to give Thor the right amount gravitas and levity when it was required. Sir Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Oden. Tom Hiddleston has garnered considerable attention for Loki, and I agree he is good. But the supporting actor/character I was most surprised by was Natalie Portman's Jan Foster. This is probably the first role I have seen her in where I got the sense she was totally at ease and having a blast. I expected her to just kind of walk through this film, but she brought as much to this as she did in Black Swan. Totally different role and character and totally different chops needed, but none the less she takes a possible throw away character and gave her some life.The film does a lot of jumping from earth, back to Asgard, back to earth, back to Asgard, etc. So the pacing is an important thing. For the most part I thought the pacing was handled well, though I thought the final act did feel a bit rushed. The 2nd act suffers from the origin dead zone that is inherent with these films. But again, Branagh shows why he was the perfect director for this film.I did not see this in 3D. Mainly because it is a post-production 3D converted film. So I can't attest to how good the 3D is. The effects are good, the sound design is perfect, with the sound of the hammer being a major highlight. When Thor wields it with all his might, you feel it.Very good performances and capable directing make this a fun movie to watch. Be sure to stay around until the very end of the credits as we are given a peek at what looks like the villain in The Avengers.",7,8,16,7 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Second film is a really good extension of the first
","Being the 2nd, in what will be a 7 film franchise, Chamber of Secrets was basically more of the same with another year added to the kids. The dark overtones that will dominate the later films was introduced here, as is the growing uneasiness by everyone in regard to Harry's potential power and how he will use it.All the kids raise the bar another notch in their performances. The effects, though sometimes dodgy, adequately convey the magic and wonder that Harry is experiencing. Williams is back for another stab at the score and again delivers in spades.We once again get a new professor against the dark arts, which I gather from the films, is a rotating storyline through the books. It seems to be used to introduce new characters, though it would seem in the case on Kenneth Branaghs character, it is a one-shot deal. Pity, I could see his character being one that could be explored delightfully. I really enjoyed the inclusion of Luscious Malfoy played excellently by Jason Issac's.My one on-going complaint with all the films is the lack of character exploration in regard to Snape and Dumbledore. You know there is a lot more than what we are seeing, yet the films continue to introduce more new characters that take up time that I would love to see spent on Snape and Dumbledore. Not sure if this is how the books are, but it is a disappointing aspect of the films for me.I really enjoyed this film and looked forward with great anticipation to the 3rd.",8,0,2,16 July 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bigger, badder, bawdier
","Right off the bat, let me get something off my chest. Enough with the over analyzing of films like this. These are films based on comics turned to an animated series. The film and it's predecessor were created by a director who is not hired to give in-depth, character driven award season fare. Given all this, anyone going into this film expecting anything more than explosions, robots, glory shots of pretty people, the latest military toy, comedy and bits of drama, need just stay home and watch The Piano or something else. Your opinion is null and void to the masses who are headed to this film for all the glory a film by Michael Bay with robots, military and pretty people delivers.Everything about this film is cliché sequel. The action and comedy are twice the level we got in the first film. The CGI is absolutely incredible to watch. Yes, at times, it is hard to distinguish robots, this is not due to quality, but just the shear numbers of robots involved. The runtime of 150mins has been commented on as being one of the negatives by those choosing to write negative reviews of the film. This is a non-issue. There is so much going on that if you are checking your watch, you shouldn't have purchased a ticket in the first place. This is an all out assault on the senses, and I say that in a good way. Those going into this film for the pure spectacle are delivered the goods and then some.Actors/characters are pretty much ported over from the first film, minus a few supporting characters and addition of a few new ones here and there. Everyone involved gives everything to the action and it is fun to watch them having fun. Shia and Megan would in any other world/reality seem like an unlikely couple. But in this Bay universe, their pairing makes sense and both actors have a chemistry with the other that helps sell their relationship. Sam's parents this go around are even nuttier and they even share a very nice moment late in the last act. There has been much made of two new autobots being cartoonish stereotypical to the point of being offensive. Are we really going to cast stones from a glass house when there are film series like the 'Friday' movies which are far more insulting and stereotypical? Utlimately, this film is about the robots and it can be said without any hesitation that the Autobots and Decepticons are delivered above and beyond. It is a glorious site to see Optimus really show why he is the leader of the Autobots. The first film his character really didn't get a chance to show his muscle, here his strength is maximized and on full display.I have read complaints about the comedy being too much here, whatever, the comedy is what really helps the film stand out. The audience I saw this with was having a great time and that is ultimately what these films are about. The original cartoon series has a lot of funny moments, most unintended. The comedy here is intentional and welcomed. All in all, a great evening at the theater enjoying some absolutely fun and exciting images. Headed to see it again.",8,1,4,24 June 2009
Shooter," Not totally bad.....but not really good
","It always happens. A film comes out and makes it appear that the armed forces have one person that is above all others in skill. Wahlberg plays such a character in Shooter.A wronged, burned out military vet last mission went wrong and sent them into a spiral, only to be recruited some years later since they are the only one that can fill the bill. In the process they fall victim to the same deception they fled from which leads them to get help from a hot female with no other purpose in the movie other than to look great and give our hero some humanity. Hero is also helped out by one of the few honest people on the side of the law/government who end up uncovering a big secret that puts them in harms way that leads to a show down with the burned out vet after previously mentioned female character is kidnapped, which prompts said hero to mount one last ruse which in the end the burned out vet has to take matters into their own hands since the government, though aware of injustice is unable to do anything. Above is pretty much the synopsis for half of the action films ever made. This one follows it to the letter. With some nice performances and action sequences, it still can't rise above being anything more than Sniper 4 in the disguise of a new film starring an A-list acting lineup.In the end, it is harmless entertainment, but when it comes to putting down the hard earned dollars, this is a rental at best.",6,0,2,23 June 2007
Inception," A complex masterpiece that requires multiple viewings
","My summary is not meant to infer this film is so complex that you have to be a genius on some level to understand it. What it means is that Nolan has crafted a film which has so many layers going on that you inevitably miss a piece of detail from one of those layers and it is only through subsequent viewings that you are able to fully appreciate the film.Camereon touted Avatar as a film created for the cinema experience and he successfully did that. It is a film which seen in a smaller format does no justice. So too is Nolan's film created for a specific experience; that of multiple viewings and group discussion. This is a film that you have to discuss with other people. You have to see multiple times as it is a sensory overload. This is a film which truly is a personal and group experience all in one.The story is not that complex in its genesis; it is a heist film. But whereas most heist films are after an object, this one is about taking over someones subconscious and planting something, not taking anything, though it could be said they are taking away free will. You have a group of people led by DeCaprio's character, all specialists in a certain area, working for the common goal. However in this story, ultimately, DeCaprio's character is working for a very singular goal; to get back home, to achieve a certain level of redemption.The film works on many levels in a very literal sense. You must be paying attention to know what level you are in. This is a simple heist movie, but Nolan takes that seed and creates a world of opened and closed levels. In the amongst the goal of the group there are trials and tribulations. Ultimately, all of those trials are a product of what each team member brings to the heist. When you are dealing with dreams, the subconscious plays a huge role. How messed up your subconscious is determines just how deep the rabbit hole is that you are about to go down.That is all I will say about the film's story, you must experience this for yourself with as little upfront info as possible. Suffice to say performances are fantastic. There is no one person to single out, it is a complete ensemble cast. Effects are crazy, would love to see film in an IMAX environment. As good as they are, they only serve the story, not the other way around. Finally the music is some of Zimmerman's best work to date. He tends to create many of the same signature notes but this go around he has created a score that is as complex and on as many levels as the film.Get out and see this film, enjoy it, talk about it with your friends and see it again.",10,3,8,25 July 2010
WALL·E," Another quality film from Disney/Pixar, but not the best
","This film has been hyped out of this world (pun intended). Personally, I found it to be another fantastic Disney/Pixar film, but definitely one that is still aspiring, as all Disney/Pixar films have, to reach the bar that Toy Story 1 and 2 set so very high. The story is a sweet one, Wall-E, alone, wanting nothing more than to have someone in his life, like the images he watches over and over on the VHS tape he views every day. His mundane existence is changed when a probe robot, EVE, comes to earth to search for new life. Wall-E ends up falling for EVE and her with him. EVE ends up finding life and the probe ship comes to pick her up. Wall-E tags along. Once on the mother ship Axiom, prat falls and awakening moments ensue.The way that Pixar artists can make you care for these characters every single film is amazing. They are inching even closer to producing a photo real world. The best evidence of this is on earth. I thought the photo realism was lost once the story moved to the Axiom. My only problem with the film is the rendering of humans, still a problem that the Pixar animation experts have yet to crack. I know that the humans in the story are supposed to represent a physical caricature of what humans looked like prior to leaving earth, but still, there is still a plastic quality about how humans are represented that has been a 'work in progress' for Pixar and continues to be the one area they have yet to create realistically. I would have to agree with some that when the story moves to the Axiom it does loose a bit of its charm. The second act drags a bit more than the rest of the film. I was in a theater filled with kids and the awed quiet of the first act was replaced with a lot of stirring and restlessness in the 2nd act. Masterpiece? Greatest Pixar film ever? In my opinion, it is definitely a very good film, it is what we come to expect from Disney/Pixar, but masterpiece? I would not go that far.",8,2,6,28 June 2008
Back to the Future Part II," Great part two
","The only reason I rate this film a 7 compared to the other 2 films in this franchise is that it does play out a little long. That minor nitpick aside, I thought this was a great entry in the franchise and setup the third act of the franchise much like Empire did for the original Star Wars trilogy.The themes and characters are a lot darker this go around. We seen the consequence of messing with time. Everyone from the first film is back save for Glover and all again give us great performances. This one doesn't seem to get the play on TV like 1 and 3 do, but I think that is because it plays out like a true 2nd act should with the end leaving you hanging. When it is on TV, as with the others, I stop and watch and enjoy it.",7,0,1,29 May 2006
Step Up," Definitely not a step down, but not a huge step up either
","The movie has the cliché's all over it. It is a tried and true formula of a down and out urban kid meeting up with the privileged kid and each learning something from the other. There is awkwardness in the beginning and the story hurdles are conveniently resolved quickly. But, you know, this still is one fun movie. The music is infectious and the leads are both good looking, likable and relate able.The store is one that we have seen before, but there is no real harm done here. It is a movie that can actually be shown to church youth groups without fear of having to edit out swear words or nude scenes. In fact, the film for the most part is free of all that and yet still remains entertaining! Imagine that.As my summary states; this is hardly a step down, it definitely isn't a 'step up', but you know, it does a great side step that will entertain you enough not to mind the cost of a matinée ticket. It isn't an after 6pm movie by no means, but still, worth at least one glance in the theater.",6,9,22,13 August 2006
Iron Man," The truth is.......................
","This is one fun film. The action is limited since this is an origin story. So if you expect action, you will be disappointed. It has enough to get you ready for the next installment. There is plenty of character arc, with hints at more for characters outside of Tony Stark.Across the board, excellent performances. Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark to the maximum. He is everything you would think Tony Stark would be if he were really alive. Jeff Bridges literally hides behind a bald head. Paltrow does a very good job of playing the in the wings smart girl who loves our hero.The special effects are better than I expected. From the shots seen in trailers, I wasn't sure about them. But they are seamless throughout the film.The ending is great, it leaves you satisfied yet wanting more. This is how a smart movie is made. Let's not just call it a comic book movie. It is a smart FILM period.",9,1,2,13 May 2008
Casino Royale," A solid reboot of the franchise
","It would seem that reboots of long standing franchises are the in thing now. James Bond gets the reboot and in the process, saves the series from becoming a joke and sets it up to be relevant for another 20 films.Those that moaned about Daniel Craig; shame on you. Craig brings a flash of Connery, while maintaining his own identity within the famous Bond persona. This bond is someone to fear. With his ice cold eyes, Craig is able to stare down any man and pull in any woman. If that is not a lethal combination, I don't know what is.Gone are the absolutely over the top antics that were becoming a staple of the films. There is very little extravaganza, with more emphasis put on hand to hand combat (which Craig showcases a power than none of his predecessors had, both in his bulked up body and the absolutely rage to his fighting).With the sense of reality being played up, that doesn't mean Bond is without the style, flash and charm which is a trademark. Craig easily slips from casual attire to the famous tux with ease. There are the ladies, the cars and though not a showcase, the gadgets which make Bond, well, Bond. Also, there is no shortage of beautiful locals. Even when Bond is in the hospital, it overlooks a vista that is breath taking. So there is plenty of the flash for the fans that look to this franchise for.The opening walk with shot aimed directly toward the screen is given a great update as well as the final scene in the film lets you know that James Bond has been 'rebourne' (purposely playing on the 'Bourne' titles there).I could go on and on, but rather than keep reading this, go out yourself and experience the film for yourself.",8,0,2,19 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Toy Story saga given a fitting end
","The rule of thumb has been the 3rd film of any franchise ends up bloated and overall, lacking the magic of the first two films. Not this time. As Disney/Pixar have proved time and again, Toy Story 3 doesn't suffer from bloat nor does it lack the magic. It is as fun, magical and heartfelt as the previous films.It would have seemed with Toy Story 2, the saga was completed. However, there was the overriding sense that there was one more story to tell. What happened when Andy eventually moved on. That is the crux of Toy Story 3; moving on.Our favorite toys start out looking like they will end up in the attic, but through the course of events, they end up going to a day-care. All would seem to be great, but as always is the case, looks are deceiving.We end up being introduced to some new characters. One of the biggest voice talent surprises is Michael Keaton as Ken. Keaton is fantastic and a big surprise. Ned Beaty is also wonderful in the role of Lotso. These two add considerably to the goings on. Hanks, Allen, Cusak, Rickles, Ratzenberg and company once again deliver fantastic character work. This film has plenty of what made the first two films some of the most beloved animated stories ever. Toy Story 3 adds a golden feather to the cap of the series and proves once again, Disney/Pixar are fantastic story tellers.",10,2,4,19 June 2010
Beowulf," 'I am naked!!!'
","THE way to see this film is in a digital 3D environment. It is one of those films that is enhanced when seen in the proper environment.Technically speaking, the film, seen in a digital 3D format, is awesome. There are still some work to be done in capturing a realistic gate of a horse running and here and there the movements are jerky. But all in all, this is a technological achievement.Story wise, the film is pretty good. The bravado encompassed in Beowulf's exclamation of 'I am Beowulf' perfectly captures the essence of the character. There is an uncomfortable exhibitionism about Beowolf. He seems intent on meeting his enemies in the 'barest' possible setting. If you can get passed Beowulf fighting ala commando, you will enjoy the story and action. The film does start out a bit shaky, but once Beowulf shows up, it picks up pace and we are transported into a fun story. There has been a lot of advances done with motion capture over the years. At times, you forget this is animated and get pulled into the movie through the character moments where they are thinking, contemplating their next movie. Or reacting to what another character has said. I can not wait to see the technology continue moving forward.",7,3,9,3 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," New Hope 2.0
","The Force Awakens (TFA) returns a major element to the Star Wars franchise; fun. Daisey Ridley and John Boyega own their characters Rey and Finn respectively. Oscar Isaac's X-Wing pilot Poe is all glorious hero. Adam Driver is absolutely pitch perfect in the role of Kylo Ren. Harrison Ford is more engaged than he has been in a decade. BB8 is the new droid star of the franchise, an absolute marvel of performance and special effects. The story is very much A New Hope 2.0, which is not a bad thing, but it has been a source of heated debate among fans. There are character and story seeds planted that we do not get to see to fruition by the end credits, or in some cases, require repeated viewings to catch them. This is yet another source of heated debate among fans. I am not sure why it is a bad thing that a movie require you see it multiple times, isn't that the fun of watching movies? This is the first of a trilogy of films and the expectation is those seeds not bloomed will produce fruit in the other two films. It is admittedly a less individually standing film out of all the films in the franchise. However, I have confidence all will be revealed in the coming episodes. John Williams once again adds to the overall experience, though this is the first film that lacks a core musical theme which makes the score rather by the numbers which is a slight disappointment. A lot of fans have commented there is a sense that the Rey character is a 'Mary Sue' of sorts and Finn's character has a turn of conscious that is too quick and without much back-story. Personally I found there is more than enough there that you don't have to be shown every single little thread to justify a character's arc, you should be able to figure out on your own some aspects given what we do know otherwise you are looking at a 3hr bore fest of exposition just because some fans have to have everything spelled out for them. Specific to the Rey character, I find it hypocritical that this character is singled out as too equipped when the fantasy and action genre is filled with beloved MALE characters who are equipped similarly yet accepted without question. Personally, I really have only two major complaints. The first is that the highly publicized and promoted character Captain Phasma is criminally under utilized in the film, in fact, ultimately reduced to a weak character which is a huge disappointment. My other major issue is how Solo's character arc finale was handled. Solo's arc finale should have been a huge emotional moment, but ends up being rushed through and lacks the emotional gravitas it should have had. The ball was dropped here in a big way. So, to sum it up, TFA does rely heavily on nostalgia/familiar story elements, it plants some seeds that are yet to bloom, while it does give you enough in some areas you just have to utilize that information to form some of the information on your own. We have one highly promoted character criminally underused and another classic character's arc finale rushed. Still, the fantastic cast, performances, chemistry, action and SFX return the franchise to solid footing and I look forward to the coming episodes.",8,5,23,30 December 2015
300," Absolute guy's movie from beginning to end!! Yes!!
","I have seen many reviews that say this is all blood and guts and not substance. So what! This is the first time in a long time that I have come out of a theater absolutely pumped. It is adrenaline, testosterone pumping from beginning to end.Gerrad Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus look like a choir boy in comparison! Butler spits out every single line and you buy it all along with his men. David Wenham's narration gives weight to the already heavy images. This was an absolute joy to watch.Yes, there are a lot of hard-bodies in this. If you didn't show up to work on this gig with a 6-pack, ripped chest and bulging shoulders and biceps, you might as well stayed home. This was a graphic novel brought to life in every sense. There is the blood spattering, the extended fighting, the preening, everything that you read a graphic novel for and enjoy is there, now, with motion. Everything is predictable about the film (of course for those that have read the novel) but the uninformed will not be surprised much by the story, but the absolute joy that is in the violence is what gets you amped up. The music by Tyler Bates leads the charge. It is violent, it is loud, it is bombastic, it is an absolute fitting match to the images.Not much else to say other than get out and see this in the theater, if you can, in DLP, and have a fantastic time watching pure carnage!",9,8,16,11 March 2007
Fast Five," Just keeps getting better
","You know, it is hard to sustain a franchise today through 3 movies, much less 5. But with the FF franchise, not only have the last two films regained the momentum, they have gotten better! The latest entry, FastFive, is unquestionably the best of the franchise to date.FastFive takes the franchise beyond the fast cars and lovely girls genre and has turned itself into a bone-fide action/adventure franchise. There are enough of the fast cars and women elements, but the focus is now on character and story. A far cry from the humble beginnings of the series.We get re-introduced to many friends from the past films and along with that, we get Dewayne Johnson, who comes into the film and chews up the scenery. He and Vin Diesel's confrontation is an action fans dream. And we are not let down.The story follows Dom and Co. directly after he has been sprung from the prison bus that was taking him to jail. We get caught up with where everyone is and are introduced to Johnson's FBI agent character. From there we are with the gang as they come to the realization that only through a big score can they truly get free of their pursuer and get to a country with no extradition. So they call up some old friends who come in and from minute one, the film switches to another gear and never lets up. Oh by the way, a long with the gang being pursued by the FBI, they have run afoul of the local drug cartel leader. Their plan to escape with loads of cash has Dom and Co. scheming to relief the cartel of their millions through a daring heist. The scenes of the whole gang together remind me of the first film in that there was a sense of family. That was lacking in the last 3 entries and it was a welcome return to see everyone together.The action is the best of the series yet with the vault through the streets being the highlight of the final act. Rio was a great place to take the series.Performances are all solid here, Diesel and Walker actually showing some depth to the characters they are all but totally in command of here. Everyone here is just great, the camaraderie is easy to see and feel and you are literally having fun with seeing the gang back together.By all means, see this in the theater. I did not see the IMAX version, so can't attest to how good it looks there. But by all means, get out and see this. Make sure to stay through the initial credits, there is a MAJOR hint at what Fast Six has in store for us.",9,0,2,29 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Eclipses New Moon
","I enjoyed Twilight. New Moon, was not thrilled with and still is not a movie I have seen more than once in the theater and on DVD. I think it was the morose, depressing feel of the movie. That is how the book is, but still, the music, score and soundtrack, and performances/chemistry just seemed off. That is all corrected with Eclipse.Performances are the best of the series. Stewart and Pattinson have a natural ease to their relationship now that was great to see. Stuart in particular has come a long way. Her constant eye fluttering when she tries to emote is all but gone and she has ditched the continual stop and go delivery that even my 9 year old daughter noticed and grew tired of in the previous films. Still on the relationship front, Stewart and Lautner's chemistry is MUCH improved over New Moon. I never bought into their relationship in New Moon, here, I sense more of a bond between them. All of this is can be created to the actor's finally getting into the groove with their characters, as well as being more seasoned. Also, director Slade should be credited. Who knew that the guy who brought us scary as hell vamps could turn around and take a story that is polar opposite and improve upon the previous two entries. Charlie is back with a lot more to say and that is welcome return to the first film.The story is much more gripping this go around, it is not focused on just Bella mourning her relationship with Edward. We get more information about the Cullen family. We get much more time between Bella and Charlie, we also get more with Jacob's family/tribe. It is a more full story than we have had in any of the entries thus far. We still only get a brief glimpse of the Volturi, wish we had more. The most enjoyable is the continual questioning if immortality is a gift or curse. We are given arguments on both side, though mostly on the curse side. This is something that has set this story apart from other vampire incarnations. Immortality is seen as all wonderful, but is it really? That is the question here. One element of the story that is actually expanded on is Edward's virtue of waiting until he and Bella are married to 'consumate' their relationship. There is a scene where this is explained and it is something today's young women should take heed of; if their relationship is true, then it doesn't have to include having sex, but that be kept for the right time and that makes it much more special. Hoaky perhaps in today's world, but a welcome stance for a series to take. A relationship's power/truth is not measured by the physical side, but the actual love and respect between the guy/girl. The Cullen family is a lot more involved and for me that made this film a lot more enjoyable. Jasper in particular, who we hadn't heard much from gets a lot more to do and say here. I have mentioned this before, but the FULL story we get here is what makes Eclipse a lot more enjoyable and really sets up the final book's two-part movie venture.Special effects continue to improve. They are still not up there with some of the best FX I have seen, but compared to the first film, they are light years ahead.There was an element of humor in the script I was surprised by and again, a welcome. These moments came during times of banter between characters that came as very natural. It made them more real to me. In all of our relationships we get to a sense of full ease and can say most anything and that is where these characters are.All in all, Eclipse has made me excited about the movie series again and now I am anxious to see it completed with Breaking Dawn.",7,1,7,4 July 2010
Click," The usual Sandler.....just like we love him
","This is not for the serious thespians out there. It is for the summertime crowd looking for a break from work and the mundane.Loved the concept of your life basically being turned into a DVD, with commentaries and special features. Sandler is putting work before family (the 'lesson' of the film). To get past all the fights and uncomfortable things, he procures this universal remote from Walken so that he can fast forward, pause or slow down his life as he chooses to. The remote allows him to access 'special features' of his life such as a commentary track by James Earl Jones, as well as deleted scenes and such.Walken again puts in a supporting character performance that steals every scene that he is in. The guy has perfected being Walken and it was great to see him in action. The other supporting actors also help to pull this film up. David Hasselof(sp) does his best, well, Hasselof. He is as self indulgent as one would imagine the real guy is. All of his staff is filled out by Bay Watch beauties.It is the supporting characters that help this film rise above the 6 I would normally give a film like this and made it a solid 7.Sandler is Sandler. He isn't stretching the acting muscles here. But that is OK. Those who enjoy Sandler will get his full arsenal.I thought Kate Beckensale was great. She is one of the hottest stay at home moms in recent cinema history. What I thought was smart of the script was to acknowledge the fact that she was/is hot and that Sandler is a lucky schmuck to have her.All in all, a good way to get out of the heat and have some fun.",7,1,3,26 June 2006
Sin City," This is how graphic novels should be done when brought to life
","Sin City is THE example of how today's digital technology can be used perfectly to bring to life a graphic novel.Robert Rodriquez is no dummy. He knew that if this was to work, not only would he need the blessing of Frank Miller, he would need Frank Miller heavily involved. By making Miller a co-director, Rodriquez was able to keep the film true to its core while he infused the cinematic aspect of it. Frank Miller on his own doesn't make this film correctly. Rodriquez on his own doesn't make this film correctly. This is truly a great example of taking the two mediums of comics and film and pulling the elements from each that need to be for a live-action adaptation to work.There isn't much more I can say about this film that the countless other positive reviews haven't said already. I hope that my personal favorite graphic novel, THE CROW, is given this kind of treatment. The first film in THE CROW franchise is a cult classic, but it is still not a true, literal interpretation of the graphic novel. Sin City has proved it can be done and done right. So here is to hoping all our favorite graphic novels can be brought to life as well as Sin City was.",8,0,0,16 February 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Good inspirational story
","By far, the meatiest acting that Will Smith has tackled. He takes down the 'Big Willie' style and is just a plain old average Joe. He is like many people, intelligent yet underachieving. It isn't until he is put out on the street that he stops with the get rich quick schemes and tries to find a 'real' job.Smith's son Jaden is very natural in the film. That can be directly attributed to Will playing his father. Will be interesting to see if Jaden is that good playing opposite someone else. Still, he gives one of the purist performances of a first-timer in quite a while.Specifics of how broke the character really was has been debated, but I don't think that takes away from the film. There is a sense that the film could have gone a lot darker than it did. It always seems to build up to opening that door, but never quit steps through. I think all in all that serves the movie well, though some may have liked to seen more struggle.Great stuff, Will can do anything he wants. Now he just needs to try and tackle the western genre again, this time with a suitable story.",7,1,1,2 January 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Another winner
","As with the previous two Indy films, this one rates a 9 with me. On any given day, this could be my favorite of the series, as with the other two.We had Indy reacquainting himself with a long lost love in the first film, we had his paternal side showcased in Doom, now the story comes back around to his own father-son relationship. The father/son relationship angle was the next logical step in the Indy series and it is brought to life with perfection through another fantastic performance by Ford and a career highlight performance from Sean Connery. There was absolutely no one else who could have been Dr Henry Jones Sr. Ford and Connery are a joy to watch.Davies and Denholm are brought back to reprise their roles as Sala and Brody, respectively, and with the addition of a gorgeous Alison Doody, this film helped to make the Indy trilogy one of the strongest, and in my opinion, best, series of films ever to be done in the modern trilogy format.Everyone was once again on their A-game and it is a joy to watch this film even though almost 20 years has past.",9,0,1,26 May 2008
Back to the Future," The start to one of the best trilogy's
","This movie was THE movie of the summer of 85. To this day, the film plays very well. I love watching the film for all the fantastic performances that are here. Fox is perfect as Marty, Lloyd is excellent as Doc. Glover is fantastically wormy as George, Leah Thompson is equal parts innocent and sexy as Lorain and Thomas Wilson is the epitome of the class bully.This is one of those movies that will continue to play on and on with so many generations because of the timeless themes that are excellent combined in a wonderful ensemble set of actors. Even though I own this movie on DVD, every time it comes on TV I stop and watch it and remember back to the summer of 85 when I first watched it and smile the whole time.",8,0,1,29 May 2006
The Island," Not bad
","This film was not even close to being the train wreck that many critics made it out to be.I think the sins of the past caught up with Michael Ba7y and the film was unfairly judged. I saw where the producers were trying to blame the actors for mediocre work. That is nonsense. Neither McGregor or Johanson were bad, in fact, exact opposite.Sure there are signature Bay camera angles, smoke, chases, etc. But they work well in the film and for the most part, he doesn't go for the full throttle assault, but is quite tempered in his approach when compared to his other films.",7,7,12,26 December 2005
