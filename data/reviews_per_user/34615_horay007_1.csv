Blade Runner 2049," Some good visuals, overall nothing impressive
","I am not much into writing reviews, though I enjoy movies quite a lot. Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to any expectations and except for the good visuals, lacked any substance. I could not find any reasonable logic in what any of the characters were trying to accomplish.",3,6,13,20 October 2017
