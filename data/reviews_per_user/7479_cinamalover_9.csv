The Avengers," Over rated mind numbing boredom
","With most movies I dislike I can see why others might like them. This is a movie that I honest to god can't see why anybody likes it. It's dumb, the characters are bland, the story is in consistent, and to put it bluntly I was board for the entire film. I was tapping my foot waiting for it to just end. Maybe I just don't like this movie for subjective reasons but none the less this movie just feels like it put everything that was kinda cool in other superhero movies into a blender and hit mix.4/10",4,16,30,11 March 2017
Sucker Punch," Overrealized
","More often then not I really like this director. He normally makes creative, and entertaining films that stem from a source material. This is a movie were he attempts to create something completely original and to say the least it doesn't work. The story is convoluted the acting is very mediocre. Even the visuals are pretty overdone. Ultimately I see this as a bit of a black mark on this directors track record.Rating 4 or 5/10",4,0,5,11 March 2017
Life of Pi," Starts slow but gets better over time...
","Life of Pi gets off to a slow, and frankly boring start but as time goes on the film get progressively better. The films greatest achievement is in its visuals. Nothing ever looked fake in the movie. Every shot in this film is a creative spectacle to gaze upon. Unfortunately the story although captivating is often boring and uninteresting. In the end it's a fun movie for its style but not for much more.7/10",7,0,1,15 March 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Well I was satisfied
","The Amazing Spider-Man tells the story we have all seen before but in a significantly darker tone. Although I won't argue that this feature is better then the Sam Rami Spider-Man trilogy, I still stand by that this movie does things better. These things include acting, character development, and effects. Overall I enjoyed it but I see why people don't.6/10",6,1,3,16 March 2017
Drive," Amazing Style Brings this Film Alive
","Drive was fantastic! This is a film that surly works for its slow burning crafty style. This is a film that deserves so much more attention then it received. I can not stress how much you need to experience this movie. If you want to have an idea of what to expect, think Fast and the Furious meets The Place Beyond the Pines.8/10",8,1,1,8 March 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The fact that this movie came out the way it did is ratter astounding
","Now let me get this out of the way now, I like Spider-Man. I have enjoyed every Spider-Man film up until this one, and yes that does include The Amazing Spider-Man 1. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a poorly acted, convenience driven, incoherent mess of a film. Nothing in the plot makes any sense whatsoever, and let me get this out of the way now the soundtrack may be the worst one in decades.3/10 Garbage",3,1,15,16 March 2017
The Lion King," The Best Animated Movie of All Time
","When thinking of animated gems, The Lion King is the first thing to come to mind. Everything in this film is near perfection in execution,and is flawless when hitting beats of emotion. This is a movie that has it all, a great cast, flawless music, as well as fantastic story. I strongly erge everyone to see this in theaters when it plays, if not only to simply support this master piece. No matter what mood you are in I guarantee enjoyment from this picture. 10/10",10,1,1,7 March 2017
Toy Story 3," Overrated Corny Fun!
","Toy Story 3 is not a bad movie by any means, however it is without a shred of a doubt overrated. Although I do not personally love this movie I can certainly see why people do, because we're this movie succeeds is were the other two do. As a matter a fact that's sorta the genus of Toy Story. This is a trilogy that grew up with its viewers. The first one came out when we were blown away with cgi, the second came when we wanted more emotion with our animation, and this one came when we were all grown up. With that said Toy Story 3 is pretty much just good old fashioned corn, with a lot of heart.6/10",6,1,4,7 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not a a Film to Inspire Generations, but still Really Good
","The Force Awakens is without the shred of a doubt a well made entertaining blockbuster. We can go on and on about how its to much like A New Hope (which it was) but in my opinion at least it brought us enough new stuff to chew on for most of that to be excused. In conclusion The Force Awakens is refreshingly entertaining, well developed film that I for one loved.7 Lightsabers/10 Darth Vader Masks.",7,8,42,16 March 2017
