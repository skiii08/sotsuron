The Blair Witch Project," Don't waste your time.
","This 88 minute movie felt three hours long. I found myself waiting for the characters to die so I could go home. It was boring, repetitive, and anything but suspenseful or creepy. I wasn't the least bit scared or entertained by this film. If anything, it demonstrated beautifully the importance of a script. It needed one. A good idea gone terribly wrong. Better luck next time.",1,2,4,24 January 2000
