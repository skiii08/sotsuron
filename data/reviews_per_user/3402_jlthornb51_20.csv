First Man," Incredibly Moving, Visually Stunning, and Simply Breathtaking.
","I was fortunate to see this fantastic movie at a small film festival in Oregon and it was a wonderful cinematic experience. A Visually stunning story of one of the great achievements of humanity. The science is fascinating and the effort behind that science is paid a wonderful tribute. The journey to the moon is as much a spiritual one as a human achievement. The men who made that trip are portrayed in all their humanness and incredible dedication. This is indeed a patriotic film and despite some controversy regarding not depicting the planting of the flag on the moon, flags are everywhere in the movie and the flag is certainly shown at the landing site. There is no doubt this was an American accomplishment and that is clearly celebrated. The inexplicable controversy about the U.S. flag is one of those contrived internet stinks from fringe elements who have never seen the film. It would be a tragedy to allow such nonsense to savage a film that is so inspiring and emotionally satisfying. This is a spectacular, exciting, stunning film and it should be seen by everyone as a reminder of the beauty of what happened in July, 1969.",10,288,549,5 September 2018
The Monuments Men," Magnificent Film Documents Incredible Story
","For anyone who has read the Rape of Europa and is familiar at all with the Monument Men, this is a film not to be missed. Hopefully, others will be interested as well in the incredible story of the heroic mission of these brave men to rescue the heritage of Europe. As the Second World War comes to its bloody end, the Nazi barbarians threaten to destroy the great art of Western Civilization and send humanity back to the Dark Ages. Against all odds, educated, learned men and women from the Allied powers race to risk everything for the sake of saving all that the Nazis wish to savage. Against a backdrop of horrible violence, grasping greed, and unbridled evil, this film breathtakingly relates the saga of these heroes in all their magnificent glory. An outstanding cast gives superb performances as George Clooney writes and directs with the sure hand of an artist himself. A truly epic film, incomparable in scope and unforgettable in scope, it is a drama so fantastic it's difficult to believe it's all true.",10,3,7,24 May 2015
The Longest Yard," An Utter Abomination
","Absolutely terrible film based upon the 1974 masterpiece which perverts the story into a pointless Adam Sandler Movie debacle. In comparison to the original, this is a travesty. As a stand alone motion picture, it is an insult to cinema and to all who have made it an art form. This is simply a vanity piece by someone who expended virtually every ounce of his limited talent on SNL years ago. From the Sony hacking event and the exposed studio e-mails we learned that even the bosses and fellow performers wonder why Sandler is still making movies. He has done well in one (Punch Drunk Love, because of Emily Watson) and fair in another, The Wedding Singer (largely due to Drew Barrymore.) This horrendous stinker is simply another addition to the garbage heap where old Sandler films are discarded after raking in money from a mindless movie going public. All his violations of cinema could be forgiven, however, if this man would keep his hands off classic films and not attempt to further corrupt the legacy of great motion pictures left us by the true artistic masters.",1,0,0,25 April 2015
Passengers," Unforgettable
","There is one reason to see this film: Ms. Jennifer Lawrence. The esteemed and honored actor (actress is too limiting) gives what is nothing less than the performance of a lifetime. Ms. Lawrence's work is always superb but in this film what she does is beyond the capacity for words to express. A simply shattering performance. The set design and direction are fine, so is Pratt, and the story haunting. But it is Jennifer Lawrence the finest actor of our lifetime who makes this film unforgettable.",10,1,2,8 March 2020
Little Boy," Quite Good
","Inspiring film of faith, hope, and love on the home front during the Second World War. Well directed and beautifully written, the film can be a bit too heavy handed at times but it still manages to be very moving. Of course, an excellent cast is highlighted by another superb performance by Emily Watson. As the mother of the child at the center of the film, she lights up the screen with every scene in which she appears. Her eyes speak volumes about who she is and what she feels, more than 50 pages of dialog and exposition. Watson is truly one of the greatest actresses of the last 50 years and continues to prove that fact and stun audiences with her incredible gifts in role after unforgettable role.",8,1,6,26 April 2015
Silent Hill," Stunning Horror of Disturbingly Powerful Dimensions - A Great Film Indeed
","Director Christophe Gans has produced a horror film of such imagination and overwhelmingly shocking imagery that it breaks new cinematic ground. With stylistic vision and nightmarish atmospherics, this is a chilling gaze across the desolate landscape of hell itself. It seems the gates of hell have indeed swung open and the damned have occupied this unholy town. The visuals are nothing less than breathtaking, unique in every possible way and beautifully realized technically. As previously noted, the creatures given life in this movie seem to have escaped from Hades and run rampant in this small forsaken town. Their movements are amazing and repellent concurrently, their tormented visages unlike anything ever before captured on film. A film of such innovative artistic choices is a welcome but disturbing cinematic accomplishment. There is no doubt that it will mark a turning point in horror cinema if for no other reason that the trend toward torture porn is defeated by such a motion picture. Without abundant gore or excessive violence, a terror filled mystery can unfold with incredibly frightening ways if imagination is invested in the project. No one who sees this film will ever forget the haunting imagery, dark landscape, and unrelenting horror that is Silent Hill.",10,1,2,18 May 2015
The Book Thief," A Truly Great Performance
","Emily Watson gives a performance for the ages in this beautifully produced film based on the popular novel. Indeed, she is supported by an excellent cast, especially Geoffrey Rush in a wonderful role, but it is Ms. Watson who takes your heart in her hands and melts it with her fantastic eyes. Considered one of the great actors of our time, Watson dominates every scene in which she appears and this is one of her most subtle yet powerful performances. No one who sees her in this film can help but wonder why she was not awarded an Academy Award for her work here. However, that could be said for every one of her motion picture performances.",10,0,0,16 April 2015
Watchmen," It Is What It Is: A Movie Based On A Comic Book
","Since every other film is based on a comic book, there are no longer many choices at the theater. This one is at least somewhat interesting at times. Its convoluted story and scatter-shot plot do engage the mind and keeps it occupied while the special effects and imagery tantalize the senses. However, it is another comic book movie and as such, it honors the source well. It is on that level it entertains. Hardly challenging or intellectually stimulating or emotionally moving. It offers none of the important elements that make for great cinema and avoids such things most vigorously. It looks great, sounds great, and makes sense at times. That's all it takes to fill a theater.",2,4,6,30 July 2015
U-571," Magnificently Rousing & Breathtaking - One of the Truly Great WWII Films
","Academy Award winning motion picture that is an overwhelmingly authentic, incredibly realistic, and simply superb movie that not only is excitingly entertaining but stands as a stunning tribute to those who served the U.S.A. in the WWII Atlantic. What a fabulous film! The director, Jonathan Mastow, is a wonderfully gifted film maker and his script shows magnificently the heroism of the Americans who so selflessly captured the Nazi Enigma machines. In essence, by their brave acts they won the war against the Germans and destroyed the Master Race single handedly. Tremendous special effects and beautiful performances from an all star cast are highlights of this wonderful film but it is the dramatic, tension filled story of the exciting adventures Americans in the North Atlantic that will overwhelm audiences with its power. Certainly in the top ten productions depicting any aspect of the Second World War ever filmed. It is deeply satisfying how recent years have seen this and motion pictures such as Pearl Harbor and Inglorious Basterds pay tribute to true American heroes.",10,2,10,28 April 2015
Ender's Game," If You Loved the Silly Book, Enjoy!
","Bad writing is bad writing and the screenplay has even more flaws than the novel. It's a mystery how that was accomplished. A film based on a very overrated book can sometimes be an improvement on the source material. That's not the case here. This is a pretty pedestrian space opera with juvenile lead Asa Butterfield giving what must be the performance of his lifetime, which is sad when you think about it. Don't let yourself think too much about that or anything else regarding this movie, though. The story doesn't allow for thought. He actually is most likely doing the best he can and it's clearly a monumental effort. The director seems to be trying as hard as he can as well. At least to please the fan boys. Because no one else is going to admire much of what's in this third rate movie. However, no movie is a complete disaster when it offers the chance to see Harrison Ford aging before your very eyes and another opportunity to ask, 'what the heck is Ben Kingsley doing in this mess?'",3,1,2,23 April 2015
Days of Thunder," Quite A Film Indeed
","Spectacular direction by Tony Scott and a script form legendary screen writer Robert Towne bring life to this incredibly exciting race car tale in stunning fashion. Robert Duval is superb as the old time car builder and Nicole Kidman is breathtaking as the doctor. John C. Reilly gives excellent support and the entire cast is uniformly perfect in their roles. The race scenes are absolutely the epitome of magnificence and constitute some of the greatest stock car racing ever filmed. After decades of avoiding this movie because of Tom Cruise, I now realize this is more a Robert Duval film than a Tom Cruise movie and everything is redeemed by the Oscar winning actor's presence. Nice to hear Nicole Kidman's actual accent and a credit to the producers for including it. Overall, a great film, with fiery direction, an excellent script, a superb Robert Duval, and a Nicole Kidman who is truly pleasing.",10,0,4,17 June 2015
Hellboy," Biddy Hodson
","This is indeed Guillermo del Toro's masterwork, far exceeding even Pan's Labyrinth and actually the last good film he has produced. Ron Perlman gives nothing less than the performance of a lifetime, giving the title character true depth and poignancy. John Hurt is superb as usual and all the supporting cast does supremely well in their respective parts. Also featured is Biddy Hodson in a star making turn that is both sensual, eye catching, and unforgettable. This is story telling at its most powerful. When cinema can be so artistically utilized to entertain yet illuminate simultaneously, it is fortuitous in the extreme. This is one of those occasions when everything comes together to make a wondrous cinematic statement. Del Toro has the potential to become one of the great motion picture directors of all time if he could always be as imaginative, artistic, and magnificent as he was with Hellboy, Hellboy II, and we pray, Hellboy III.",Null,0,1,17 May 2015
Mulholland Drive," Mystifying Masterpiece
","Stunning visually and emotionally, this is this auteur's incredible saga of an innocent girl in Hollywood pursuing dreams and finding herself in a nightmare. Filled with fascinating cinematic touches and innumerable stylistically mesmerizing film moments that are simply too many to count. Often its all overwhelming in its twisting of reality and bizarre side trips. It is nothing less than a pure celebration of the personal film maker and illustrates what motion picture art is capable of when an artist is given leave to fulfill his vision. Director Lynch can be self-indulgent at times but that's not the case here. Haunting imagery and individual screen moments will stay with the audience all their lives because they are so powerful. Just to pick one is when the two young women protagonists visit an all night Los Angeles theater and Spanish singer Rebekah Del Rio performs a spine chilling rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying.' It's one of the most strangely moving scenes ever filmed and will bring tears to the eyes of anyone with a soul. A disturbing, beautiful film that is flawed yet sublime, it is what's sometimes called a 'chipped masterpiece.'",9,2,3,2 June 2015
The Great Raid," A Great Film
","An incredibly exciting, true account that will move you to tears at this superb film's conclusion. Pulling no punches and accurately depicting the absolute savagery of the enemy, it is a courageous motion picture that everyone should see. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Benjamin Bratt giving the performance of a lifetime. Director John Dahl does outstanding work in bringing this story to the screen and deserves accolades for showing what kind of butchery our soldiers endured at the hands of their captors. The battle scenes are stunning and the musical score is one of the most beautiful ever composed. When the film nears the end and the actual newsreels of the liberation are shown, I was sobbing. The POW's were heroes who suffered so very, very brutally while held in Japanese camps. This film is a terrific tribute to those Army and Filipino heroes who ended the ordeal as well as the brave, courageous men and women who never cowered before the bloody swords of the beasts who savaged them.",10,0,0,14 March 2015
The Descent," Overwhelming Film of Incredible Intensity
","Be prepared to be scared senseless. This is indeed one of the most frighteningly powerful films of the last twenty years. Filmed on location in England, this motion picture packs a terrifically terrifying punch indeed. A fantastic cast of actors give stunning performances as they fight for their very lives against disgustingly creepy cave dwelling beings who devour flesh. There is overwhelming intensity and suspense so great it's difficult to endure. The horror is unrelenting and the claustrophobic fear in the darkness of the caves is spine chilling. Whatever you do, don't watch this horrifying journey through a hellish environment beyond description alone. It will scare your psyche with some of the most hideous imagery ever conceived in cinema history.",10,2,4,22 May 2015
The Happening," Stunning & Powerfully Forceful Cautionary Tale
","A beautifully made and truly haunting film the cries out to be seen. The message is subtle but powerful and this may be one of the motion pictures from this era that future audiences will look back upon as prophetic. Visually, this film is astonishing and the imagery is at times overwhelming. An exceptional cast gives uniformly fine performances but it is Zooey Deschanel who virtually gives the performance of a life time with a portrayal so real it breaks one's heart. It is a deeply moving portrait of a woman terrified by the unknown and fearful of losing everything of meaning to her. The director, known for his unusual films that manage to consistently leave us breathless has outdone himself with what he presents us with here. As nature turns against humanity, it can only be seen as a just response to the brutality of man towards the environment. A significant film of tremendous impact, no one can deny the disturbing intensity and incredible foresight that is The Happening.",10,3,6,24 May 2015
The Blind Side," Stunning Film
","Sandra Bullock gives the performance of a lifetime in this marvelous film based upon Lee Anne Twohy's fantastic story. Earning an Academy Award for a characterization of power and insight, Bullock shines like a super nova in a role few other actresses could convincingly play. Director John Lee Hancock masterfully brings this tale of redemption and compassion to the screen with incredible skill and beauty. This is cinema at its finest as the full potential of the art form reaches its pinnacle with a simple story that reflects heart warming humanity and self sacrifice. As Bullock's character succeeds in saving a young man from a path to spiritual destruction the audience can not help but be swept up in her mission and each viewer will find themselves with eyes filling with tears as they cheer. Here is a motion picture that proves that obscenities, nudity, sex, and violence are not required in order for a film to achieve acclaim, success, and utter greatness.",9,0,1,30 April 2015
Flight," Incredible Film
","Washington gives what is nothing less than a performance of a lifetime in this tension filled film dealing with a pilot wrestling with inner demons. The aviation sequences are stunning and the crash one of the most breathtaking ever filmed. The director is highly gifted and his skill and passion are clearly evident. The script is superb, with intelligent plotting and sharp dialog that captures reality. It is, once again, Washington who shines here above all else. His power as an actor is what truly gives this movies its fire. His portrayal of a substance abusing addict/alcoholic is painful to watch because of the humanity he brings to the part. It is a tremendous accomplishment and one of the finest studies of addiction ever filmed.",9,52,58,17 April 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Powerfully Visionary Masterpiece
","Director George Miller sets the screen on fire with this visually stunning masterpiece. In what amounts to post-apocalyptic feminist manifesto as well a cautionary statement regarding the code of masculine violence, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron give nothing less than the performances of a lifetime, both sure to receive Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences acting nominations for what they have achieved here. The special effects, stunts, cinematography, and story combine beautifully to create a film that may simply too powerful for the screen to contain. George Miller is undoubtedly set for an Oscar himself for this overwhelming spectacle as well his astonishing career as the finest director of the last fifty years. No one has ever been as imaginative, creative, and technically proficient with his cameras. A motion picture of such magnitude and magnificence demands acclaim and is receiving it in spades as millions flock to their local cinemas to experience the thrills, beauty, and powerful message that is Mad Max: Fury Road.",8,4,11,21 May 2015
The Wedding Singer," Delightful!
","Adam Sandler had made two decent movies. Actually they were exceptional films. Punch Drunk love was one, with Emily Watson elevating him to a new and entirely fresh level. This is the other. Interestingly, just as Emily Watson made such an impact, so does Drew Barrymore in this film. She is nothing less than adorable and as an actress, raises Sandler up out of his usual routine. The opening sequence with the credits is absolutely one of the best starts of a comedy ever filmed. The guest cameos are stunningly hilarious, especially Steve Buscemi. The movie does drag a bit in the middle but overall it is a very good romantic comedy and for Adam Sandler, a true work of art.",7,3,3,23 April 2015
