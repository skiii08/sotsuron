Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I like you...do you like me?
","If you happen to be a fan of the Ali G show well before he crossed the pond, you will be pleased that everything which made the show special then was kept the same in this movie (with a bit of recycled material to acclimate new fans). Sacha Baron Cohen aptly grasps the mentality of a third-worlder with first world intentions in 'Borat.' He creates uncomfortable and unbelievably funny situations by simply keeping his character consistent throughout the film. His cross country travel is marked by precise observations that explain how politically, racially, and culturally diverse (and volatile) the United States is. You will definitely be squirming in your seat for several scenes, but each part is specially crafted to get a laugh, few of which were cheap. More importantly, Cohen deserves credit for restraining his laughs during the filming, since some scenes could never possibly be scripted (though you will see that some most likely were.) For those who can appreciate how much cleverness it takes to elicit ignorant reactions from the general public by playing a fool, this movie is for you.",10,2,15,4 November 2006
