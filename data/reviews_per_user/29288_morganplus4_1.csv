United 93," Outstanding and Gut Wrenching
","What can I say, the film has left me both breathless and speechless.Far from being the sort of emotive Hollywood-esquire film that brings passion and tears, it is a perfectionist's dream in realism and re-enactment, portraying a historical event with pin point accuracy facilitated by First Rate acting.It had me on the edge of my seat and captured 100% of my attention for the whole duration, which is a nigh on impossible thing to do to me. So it must have done something right.With the early scenes out of the way, the latter half of the film becomes more focused and as a viewer you have all the preceding information at your disposal as you watch with open jaw the unbelievable events unfold. Amazing, till its conclusion.One of the best films I've ever seen, and for sheer acting and realism, it is the finest in my book.",10,0,1,16 September 2006
