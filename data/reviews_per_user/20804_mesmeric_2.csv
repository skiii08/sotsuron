Minority Report," Philip K. Dick would be proud!
","This is a great film.  Suspend your disbelief and enjoy it.  And then read the incredible fiction of 'Horse-lover Fat' (Dick), especially 'Valis', 'The Divine Invasion', 'The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch', and any of his short fiction.  You'll see how perfect Minority Report really is.",Null,0,0,18 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," Huh????????
","Now, don't misunderstand.  I like David Lynch's work.  I loved Twin Peaks, adored Wild at Heart & Blue Velvet, and almost named my first-born son Paul MuadD'ib after seeing the director's cut of Dune (actually, my wife nixed that idea before it became legal).  But this film makes no sense whatsoever! Oh, I know...the true Lynchophiles nod and wink at each other knowingly and endlessly discuss this film's hidden meaning and structure.  And I did watch the whole thing and loved the lesbian scenes and the weird Lynchian moments like tiny giggling elderly people crawling out of a paper bag.  But if it had only made more sense, I would have liked it better.  Yes, yes, I know that the Lychophiles are scoffing as they read that last line, but what's wrong with making sense?  Would I recommend the film?  Sure, why not? Just don't expect it to make any sense.  The film is beautiful, the performances are at times brilliant, it's just lacking in any cohesive sense.",Null,0,1,25 May 2002
