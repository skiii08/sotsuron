The Lobster," In the lineage of '1984'
","Some movies are fascinating without being enjoyable--maybe emotionally dissatisfying but intellectually compelling. That's 'The Lobster' for me. I have to add that I did get some emotional satisfaction out of the sheer quality of acting and visuals, the general fabric of the film--or else the casual animal and human deaths would have caused me to leave the theatre. Then watching it again, I realized the humor takes hold of me and I will sit through the very dark joke.
It is definitely science fiction about a future dystopian society. Those who think sci-fi has to come with wild special effects and mind-blowing hardware and latex body suits need to remember that sociology, anthropology and psychology are also sciences. However, as a staunch fan of Rocket the racoon, I have to say piles of space alien carnage are easier to take that the animal deaths in The Lobster. BUT--The Lobster IS STILL A GOOD PIECE OF CINEMATIC SCI FI.",8,0,1,15 January 2018
Fargo," O Hollywood, Hollywood
","I put off seeing this one because my dad went to Fargo High and I knew it would be weird to see this movie. Then i decided it was time--gee, what a good rep the movie has had to this day. However, my early doubts were sound. Hokey accents and 'character bits'---beginning with the waggy headed blonde cashier. So, that dates this movie. Cuz now we know that the Upper Midwest is populated with regular people, who are not painfully cute in their snowsuits. In fact, audiences moved to penguins, who don't even have to wear snowsuits. As time has gone by we have also grasped the range of William (Pleasantville) Macy. He's gone on to better things. But the caricatures and gruesome psychosis juxtaposed with inept human greed and self-centered myopia---ah! it is a diversion. And it is very agreeable to watch Frances McDormand work. The Coens seem to have gone in, done their job and pulled out. A directorial road movie in which the repetitive snowy road goes through mood changes--same road, but the story has altered its meaning. At the end, it's comfortingly familiar. I feel the skeleton of a better movie here. Like Peter Jackson's animated bugs in 'King Kong', the smiling heads of quickly daubed 'local color' wouldn't be missed. There's good stuff, and it's just off the road a bit, that beautiful straight, snowy road.",3,3,9,9 December 2006
