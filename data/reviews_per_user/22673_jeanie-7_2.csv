The Blair Witch Project," This one stays with you!
","I went to see this film in DC this past weekend.  What a great experience! I think I personally overhyped the movie a little bit, but it was still an excellent movie.  During the movie I was not as scared as I had expected to be.  There were times that I gasped, closed my eyes, and felt my heart race, but somehow I expected more.  Word had it that people were running from the theatre screaming and getting sick at the showing before ours.  What I didn't expect though, was the very gradual sense of horror that grew in the hours after I left the movie theatre.  What I saw in the last few moments of screen time stayed with me, in a way I have never experienced before.  All in all, as an experience, this film did not scare me the way I thought it would, but it did creep and freak me out in a way I never imagined possible.As to the film itself, the gritty, amature feel of the camera work was amazing!  The acting bowled me over as well.  This was an incredibly well made film in addition to being an experience unto itself.  Maybe I am being unrealistic, but this little film deserves recognition from the Academy.",9,1,2,19 July 1999
Life Is Beautiful," One of the best movies I have ever seen - and it has subtitles!
","This was an incredible movie.  It had a wonderful balance of humor, romance, sorrow, and love.  I completely fell in love with the movie because I am an eternal optimist.  I wouldn't say that Guido was an eternal optimist though. It seemed as though happiness came to him as naturally as breathing.  And when he was faced with a situation that was beyond his control, where it was not easy to be lighthearted, he found the ability to be so, at the risk of everything, all for his little son.  What the viewer sees is one of the finest and most poignant portrayals of human courage that I have encountered yet on the screen.  I give it the highest recommendation possible.",10,1,2,27 January 1999
