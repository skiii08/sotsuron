Ford v Ferrari," Dont worry ken
","Is not the best sports biographi movie, but this one definitely be on top list of all time. christian bale and matt damon shows us what a perfect Chemistry can impact to a movie. and bale? bale doing an incredible act performance.for you who are a motorhead this movie can speak to you in a way you'll never expect. i mean i come to watch a good movie, and shock by how good they tell 'how does it feel to drive' damn. every scene where that exhaust were roar can give you a goosebumps.And yeah, don't worry ken, the world knows you're the true triple Crown winner",9,3,4,1 December 2019
First Man," it's not focus on how, more like who
","The character was really strong, every single one of them. but for me they serve a different focus than we expect. off course they still gave us the neil and the moon as we want but instead find the right amount of portion the entire story felt like make us leave the neil and moon thing.other than that, the movie was great for making the set at the years that they want. the result was incredeble scene that totally succeed show the aged of the event.if you want to know about neil armstrong him self than this movie was for you. for those who seek the history frame of it, just give it a try but don't expect too muchby the way, i really love the ending.",7,0,1,1 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Is it good? Yes. Is this what I'm expect? Nope.
","Well that struggle rating was cause for a reason. I think its fair to say after all this far it is hard to build another 'great' background story. Especially for another core character. For me the biggest help for carol script was her joke side. Beside that i don't really get her character.At the start Everything seems pretty slow and fill up with a bunch of stories that forcly put and suddenly they make rushing action to cover all the way to end. Smart move.I don't think we need that credit scene. I talk about the first one. I mean, it's kinda break what we waiting for a little bit in the next movie. For me personally.Overall you definitely still can enjoy this movie. With a little bit of patient. It could be 8 tho",7,2,8,11 March 2019
Us," well that kinda good
","Yes it fresh, but at the same time they don't really offered something else. for me, some intense scene feels really slow. it start to feel better in the last 30 minutes.i think gabe can be a really great character if it wasn't because he throw that joke a lot, i mean the jokes can be a good value of his character. everyone has give their great performance tho.good story, its tell the background and the time-set really well. good twist too, although with this concept i kinda know where it goes since half way through",7,1,2,8 July 2019
Aquaman," don't trust any person who said this movie was bad, just don't.
","WATCHED IT !!no matter how much dc movie has disappointed you before, trust me this one was a different story. It's beautiful, i mean the cgi wasn't on perfect scale but yeah it's still beautiful. You got beautiful landscape and ocean, a lot of cool ship, there's a lot of great statue, badas* creature, great action scene and DINOSAUR hhahathe main background story from arthur was told very good with a backward forward way. Jason momoa really fit with arthur character. the comedy scene was enough and not to much so it's complete the movie in a good way.and you still can feel james style in this movie, you got his twist, you can still feel his jump scare sense, and he even still gave you his scene *you'll know what i mean.and i think one things that make this movie really good for me was they really show the message from what actually hapend with our sea right now. god i wish we can still see a group of manta ray like that.",9,4,8,15 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Strong message
","Really strong movie ! really strong stories ! i can't say to much cause i dont really know the real stories that become background of this movie. but from the way this movie tell the message was crystal clear.i wanna put 7 star at first because the detail that they miss. yeah, i noticed the glasses at church scene, how that things come to ron hand after that photo scene? and when he peek from that little window, how can david duke not seeing him.but then again all the ending scene make me put those 8 star back. great movie !!",8,6,11,7 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," need more than 4 times to get enough of this movie i think.
","I've been watch a couple of biography movie before, and i can say you'll be amaze how their take this movie to different level.Rami malek was brilliant, what a performance. i'am amaze by the time he play Freddie with a short hair. man that was really good !!
i don't grow up watching Queen and i'm not really a music kind of guy but trust me, you still gonna enjoy this movie as they do. this movie are doing a really good job for someone who like wathcing movie like me. and surprisingly it teach me a lot of friendship and family mean.it's fun cause i can see a lot of old style cinematography in this movie, they serve it very well.i dont know the precise story of freddie life but the love,family,sad, and every other emotion was delivered very very good. what can i say, i can even feel the wembley experience both as the audience and the one who standing on stage hheheand personally i think Brian May was a really good middle man in their circle .",9,3,7,9 November 2018
Bird Box," a step up game with a litlle miss move.
","I dont know netflix, seems like you guys are having to much comfort because the actor that you have here and you guys forgot about how good you usually execute the story. i mean look at your line up.actually i still enjoy the twist that this movie have, the back and forth flow make it not that easy to predict. it show the background story in a good portion. Sandra Bullock was doing a really good performance, i mean its not easy to yelling to a kid like girl and boy.",6,2,8,21 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Yup, definitely a game changer movie.
","Everyone was talking about the animation and I don't really have enough knowledge about that. But here's the things i can tell you about.Great visual even though I kinda got a little bit dizzy sometimes because the color and the speed of this movie but for me who doesn't know much about animation technical stuff, i still can tell this movie was dope.I love the story. The culture that this movie bring, the little twist that they give, the emotion. It's been a while since we got a movie like this with strong story. The music was good. It's genius, this movie have a lot of little details that make it great.",8,6,12,18 December 2018
Disturbia," You don't even need jump scare stuff
","Once again everyone this is what we need from a movie. It's start with not even feel like a mystery crime movie. And it change part by part until you realize 'now this is a problem' hhahaWhat a movie, if the final scene can be make more you knw 'revengeful' it would be 8. Definitely 8 frm me",7,1,3,15 October 2018
Yesterday," yes i will definitely watch this twice. twice okay?
","It's really fresh movie with old concept. i mean really fresh. i start watching this movie with a thought i know what's gonna happen. And it's happened, but in a lot better way.they didn't sell the beatles first thing first. they came up with story. and thats good. really fun comedy all the way till the end and it's come with a really nice portion in every scene. I'm not sure but i think it is in every scene hahaFor me jack was a strong character somehow, he can manage that akward vibe when si bring the song up consistently till he sang in front of that bunch of children at the end.",7,0,0,11 September 2019

The Lion King," it's not an improve, it's just new
","It's simple foundation if you want truly want enjoy this movie at it's best experience. stop thinking this one was a improve. Start this movie with thought that this is lion king. with that i think you'll be more enjoying this movie.yes with this impressive visual their sacrifice one of the most core values to the movie. The emotion, but i if you play attention enough their still put a detail in 'some' scene that replace that face emotion. you'll get it if you start with much clearers though.just watch dont compared it.",8,1,1,15 October 2019

Pulp Fiction," old but gold

Dont forget Michael Peña is doing a great job too in here.good action movie, really good in fact. Background was tell very well, and their not kidding with the problem that came out. Every phase feels really perfect, not to fast or neither to slow. Execute Perfectlyright now, there's not a lot action movie who brave enough to finish it this way. they instead try to make it sequel, more safe i guess.",8,0,0,18 October 2018
Parasite," buckle up, it fast and pretty dense
","It was a really tight movie, well written. At that phases they barely miss a glimpse of stories. Personally i think there's a really conversation that seems not really needed but the rest was perfect.the scene was good in every aspect that i understand, pay attention to every scene and you may end up surprise with the detail that gave. Tone was really beautiful. scene story portions was easy to understand.my first thought from the poster was it can be really dark, but well you'll see... it will be nice if we got a little picture post event from Ki-woo best-friend to see how he react after all of this.",8,3,14,21 August 2019
Moonrise Kingdom," Kinda late, i know

And they got a really good cast hereand the ending? Beautiful . it really complete the whole of movie. Great to watch !!,8,0,0,1 December 2018
The Truman Show," good old day huh
","For me there's really a lot thing going on here. for a comedy genre this movie for sure bring a lot of thing. speaking about og, man how can you make something that suppose to feel really easy as a comedy movie but yet so full. the story it self was brilliant, the detail how people's around truman need to see convincing for him and an act for us. it was a complex variabel for me. the way audience react to this show can make you feel really itchy. how can they still be watching after all of scene when truman start to noticed all of it.it's masterpiece.and i can't find a word to describe that ending.",9,0,0,17 May 2019
