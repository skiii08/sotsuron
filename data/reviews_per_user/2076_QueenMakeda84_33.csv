The Devil's Advocate," Incredible
","What an insightful film. I can watch this over and over again and not get tired. Al Pacino is the dude of acting! lol It goes a lil something like this: Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a hot shot lawyer who's never lost a case. He's married to a follically challenged woman named Mariann (Theron) and they're happy as clams. John Miller (Pacino) hears about Kevin's streak and decides to recruit him. They go to NYC and are wined, dined, and bribed into accepting a job as a criminal lawyer in a network of top global lawyers. Once they start living the life and Kevin gets all his clients acquitted for their criminal deeds, things start to go haywire. Mariann starts to see demons in their friends and realizes she can't have the baby she desperately wants. She feels alienated and out of place while Kevin works. She eventually goes crazy, but only because she's seen the truth. Kevin is taken under the wing of John Miller and gets caught up in lying for his clients to maintain his perfect record. All is not what it seems as people start dying and Kevin finds out that he's the son of the Devil. As a child of a Bible-thumping mother, this creates a problem. Miller wants him to start a 'family business' with his half sister (whom he secretly lusts) and basically wants to p*** God and all the angels off with the lack of justice in the world. I liked that this movie made people realize that the devil can be real and out there affecting forms of governments and other systems of power. This is obviously a movie, but the message to me is still clear. It was a unique angle to attack an age-old debate from. Satan is in the law? American law? Hmm....pretty interesting stuff. Sure would explain a lot and don't mention O.J. any of you, lol. Point is, the movie is fabulous and decadent and shows how vanity can be a deadly sin and probably Satan's favorite according to Pacino. Theron attacked her part wonderfully and made a fan out of me. She's absolutely stunning. Greed is a serious issue and this movie discusses that. It's a must see and they have it on TBS and TNT all the gosh darn time, so just watch it.",Null,4,5,22 March 2004
The Ring," Absolutely Scary
","This movie was the only movie in a scary movie genre that actually set out to do what it wanted to do: scare the crap out of the audience. I seriously did not want to be alone by myself after this movie and watch tv. I liked the idea of combining electronics/technology we're familiar with to heighten the sense of fear. That little girl was creepy. I saw her at the People's Choice Awards or something like that and she did the 'You're all gonna die part' and it freaked me out again, even with her in normal clothes. Now that mess is freaky. The movie was a little slow at first. I tried to rationalize to the characters that they should just keep watching the tape over and over to extend their time to die. You know, like write it in the schedule: 'Must watch tape so as not to die this week' kinda thing. Then I began to wonder about the plot of the movie. It didn't make sense that a girl from the early 20th century is making videotapes. How is that possible? Could we see that process? It didn't make any sense to me. However, she finally killed someone and then it became scary and I loved it. It's still my fave movie as a scary film and I think it should be a classic. I didn't get the dead horses part and I don't understand how her adopted father looks as old as Harrison Ford when he must have been born like in the late 1890's. Definitely not quite right in terms of plot holes, but still scary, so I forgive them that.",Null,1,1,2 May 2004
Training Day," Not so much
","This movie was hyped up so much cuz Denzel was playing a 'bad' guy now. My problem isnt with that. My issue is with the Oscars for giving him the award for this particular movie. He was great, no doubt, but he's done better movies with more compelling stories. It's like it was a handout for playing something more true to his 'race'. I thought the film was gritty enough and showed that cops can be turned from seeing what they see all the time. The film was good at presenting that side instead of the justice for side. Ethan Hawke kinda took a backseat to Denzel's power in this film. It was necessary however so Hawke could determine for himself if he wanted that life badly enough. It made me wonder how many cops are like that and if there really is any justice left when within the police lie people like Alonzo. Not too bad a film, but you have to have a penchant for films about bad cops, and I don't. Even with Denzel in it.",Null,33,69,15 March 2003
Friday Night Lights," Why this Team?
","I'm at a loss. This entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg film for football. The camera cutting, the pace, all so copied. I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. Yes, we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants. Must we be inundated with it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the film. You didn't get the characters. It was character driven, but you didn't understand anyone's motivations or their actions for the most part. The one kid who's mom is obsessed with him being a football player. Why is he so silent? What's his deal? Did we really need the scene with him 'proving' his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. It just made no sense. And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their 'conceivable' problems, darnit. We got nothing. We got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer (Lee). Why didn't you follow that story? What were we to get out of this one? The movie led you along, but didn't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie. The actor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why make sure we get his issues? And the other team in the play-offs...are we to believe those are high school teens? Those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s. Who were they trying to kid? I know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was showcased. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee.",3,6,12,4 August 2005
Erin Brockovich," Captivating
","This story was truly inspiring. I see the real Erin Brokovich hosting a show on Lifetime about women like herself these days. Anywho, the movie was a tad bit too long, but was a good film in itself. I liked the personal aspects of her family going sour as her aspirations and goals move up. That's often very true when a woman is trying to make something of herself with a family in tow. The story was just amazing. I thought Roberts was good, but all she did was cuss a lot, which doesn't take great acting because we all want to sometime. I think the character just allowed Roberts to speak what she would probably say if she wasn't who she was, if that makes any sense. Finney was marvelous and an engaging character who's scared to take on such a big challenge, but rises to the occasion. He kept it very real to me by not all of a sudden becoming all into the case. He took his time warming up to the idea that it could go somewhere. The cut and paste effect was a little lost on me and slowed down the already lengthy movie, but it was altogether good. A great message about not letting people take advantage of you and that there are some who are willing to fight for others. The fact that it's true makes the movie much stronger in its presentation.",Null,1,2,14 March 2003
Monster," Gritty and Disturbing
","Charlize did an amazing job of transforming herself into this woman. You didn't see Charlize anymore. You saw this ill-treated and disturbed woman trying to make sense of the life that she's led. You can really see how abusing children can lead to traumatized and dangerous adults. You almost understood her deranged logic for killing johns, but you knew she had to go down, because you already knew the story. I felt sorry for her because it seemed like the woman didn't have a chance. Life just dealt her blow after blow, so it's like, who wouldn't make the choices she did? Was she really a monster? She seemed more like a woman without a childhood or a sense of living beyond herself. Yea, she spoke about wanting to be famous and more than her pitiful beginnings, but she never elevated herself to those lofty ideals. She kept thinking that life owed her something, and let's face it, life doesn't work that way. It appeared to me that that was her tragic flaw: her expectations.Ricci's adaptation of Selby irked me to no end. Why was she acting like some meek child throughout the whole film? She's usually praised as the 'Indie Movie Princess', but I found her severely lacking in this film. I was shocked to find that she would continue the entire movie like a 4-yr old child. You never sensed her confusion with defining her sexuality with her Christianity. She was an odd choice to the depth and intensity of Charlize's Aileen. You just felt like Ricci was skipping through her lines waiting to hit the catered food table when the director yelled 'Cut!'. I was really surprised, because I would hate to think that her acting as Wednesday was better than her in this. She was like 11 when she did that. You think she'd have matured in her acting range.The movie was deep and gritty. It was truly a great movie for Charlize that was worthy of the Oscar. I'd hate to think actresses have to play seedier elements of femininity to win Oscars, but it's a small step.",5,2,5,4 August 2005
Amistad," Incredibly moving
","This movie shows you the strength of the human spirit throughout any obstacle. I'm a HUGE fan of Djimon Hounsou and he was truly magnificent in this film. You just felt his presence and resonating strength.  Morgan Freeman was awesome as well and my hat goes off to Matthew's conviction in this film. It's not often that films like this get recognized, but they need to be. It was heartwrenching to see the horrible conditions of the ships and just the sheer cruelty of the slave traders. The intense violence was similar to Passion of the Christ, but not as gruesome. The point still got across though. It was great to see this true story being told. It hurts to see, but it's apart of U.S. history like this stupid movie that's coming out soon called the ALAMO is. I've got issues with that, but that's another commentary. This movie is beautiful cinematically and the actors are to be highly praised. This topic is not easy to portray. These people had to reach deep down inside themselves and their issues with society to tap into the deep resevoir of emotions this film needed. Djimon handled his character's sense of frustration, confusion, and impotence to the situation very well. I felt his emotions and that was necessary to watch the film. You can't help but become angry and happy that justice was attained. We need more movies like this if we're going to show historical movies. There's been a whitewashing of history and it needs to stop. Everyone's side should be told and not what the audience or Hollywood is comfortable seeing. We need the past to assess the future and this film shows that in abundance. It's sad that it wasn't more recognized (gee, what a surprise) and I truly think it was some of Stielberg's best work.",Null,0,2,29 March 2004
The Notebook," Love, Love, Love This Movie
","This movie was beyond beautiful. The entire plot was just magical, sweet, and tender. I own the movie and it has become one of my favorite films. I enjoy the great love the characters have for each other. I work in a nursing home, so seeing that kind of affection from old school folks really does exist. It's warm to see that kind of love outlast some of the turmoil and cruelty life throws your way. It's so hurtful to watch the person you love and adore not remember you little by little. They forget the life you've shared. Alternately, Allie's depression and turmoil that she's forgetting the one thing that's been a constant in her life. The older characters played their parts to a T. You sensed the deep love and loyalty he had to his wife's well-being.Ryan and Rachel were adorable together. I can't imagine anyone else in their parts, but I'm sure it could be doable with other actors. These two just had great chemistry like a real relationship. When I say that, I mean, you could see yourself in a relationship like their's. It reminded me a lot of my own relationship with a significant other. Two people come into each other's lives and profoundly affect the other so that nothing can really break that bond. Not years of separation or misunderstanding. That love really does exist, and this movie visualized it for us.I liked the singularity of Noah's character. He has one parent, one best friend, and one girlfriend. His world is very closed, and Ryan hit upon that well. As Allie, Rachel played her as a likable young girl. Not some spoiled rich chick with no understanding of life. Rachel understood Allie's confusion to play by the rules, but it was different in that she truly loved him. It wasn't some arbitrary set-up by elitist parents. Lon was very deserving of her love. James Marsden has really grown as an actor as well by being in this movie. I look forward to greater things (no more 'Disturbing Behavior' films please :D). Beautiful cinematography. Beautiful acting. Beautiful music. It was a love story that was on par with 'Love Story' and other greats. Truly recommend.",10,0,0,3 August 2005
Troy," Des-Troyed the myth
","We all know QueenMakeda84 loves Greek myth. Big fan. That's why I watched Troy. I wanted to see how they mussed up a great theme and story like the Trojan War. Naturally, they blamed Helen and removed the influence of the gods. The characters might have mentioned them once or twice, but there were no gods to be found. The Greek gods were real to the ancient Greeks, so to remove them is to remove the culture and livelihood of the Greeks. They present a major point in the story of the Trojan War, but no. Hollywood thinks it's more interesting to show the 'human side' of this story. You can't show the humanity without the gods, as ironic as it sounds.Brad did a great job, but seemed a little macho mannish, but then again, Achilles was a single-minded warrior. Ah, I take it back. I can appreciate the way he acted the character, but I think his line delivery was a little to be desired. Orlando really did a great job of showing how much of a coward Paris was. He should the p**** nature of the character dead on. Eric Banas was a wonderful Hector. Hector was a warrior, but definitely had loyalties in other places and you see that conflict. The story's all wrong, because Achilles didn't die that way, Briseis didn't like being his captive, Paris was killed, and Helen was promptly returned to her husband. It was really a moronic and romantic ending for such a war-like story. This story became the catalyst for so many Greek plays, and it ended like the resolution of a TV sitcom. I loved the action scenes and the simple way Brad fought. His fighting style was realistic and impressive. I got goosebumps watching that little leap he did to stab someone, it was great. The sound effects here were also well done as you felt the fight through your ears and how tired someone could get. I mean, all in all, good film, but it definitely didn't measure up as a good Greek revival.",Null,6,15,16 December 2004
Final Destination 2," Things that makes you go: What the F***?
","Throughout the entire movie, I kept thinking: Death comes in all forms. Why must it kill so violently and abnormally? Come on, a sheet of glass crushing someone to death? Electrical wires from a fence slicing you into pieces? The shower cord strangling you to death? You're alcoholic beverage leaving condensation and setting your place on fire and allowing for a butcher knife to kill you? Come on! They could've gotten cancer, heart attacks, sickle-cell anemia. I mean there are plenty of ways to die. Death is not this psycho that has to kill you violently in order to maintain its 'grand' design. Now, someone might say, QueenMakeda84, there's no point to the movie if they all died like that. Exactly my point! There shouldn't have even been a movie because the way Death is presented is super-de-duper whack.And what was with the eerie black mortician? Who really gets into it like that? I like Tony Todd too, but this is not the way to go after being on Hercules and Xena. I mean, the guy was like a Shakespearean actor in a kindergarten play. Take it down a notch. And furthermore, his character was severely unnecessary. They could've googled for all that information. He seemed more like someone from Conan than of the 20th century along with the rest of the cast. And A.J. Cook, I loved you in 'Higher Ground', but you're slipping with this movie. Don't get me wrong, you played the insecure girl with freaky death premonitions well, but you're better than this. I guess times are hard. Ali didn't even seem to wanna be there and I don't blame her. I think she was just waiting to be blown to pieces at the end of the movie and was hurrying it along as much as possible to get out of this disaster of an idea.The movie honestly tried, but it couldn't bite the cheese. Maybe it was supposed to be stupid, but for my money, I better get a moral to the story or some laughs along the way. I got neither. What I did get was the impression that I'm smarter than everyone else in the film. And that, I didn't need to pay $9 for.",1,3,7,27 December 2004
Malcolm X," Brilliant
","This film was absolutely brilliant. Spike Lee is a genius. We're studying him in my film class and a lot of his works are controversial, but I think they're necessary. Malcolm X was beautifully acted by Denzel. He took Malcolm's mannerisms and passion into himself and carved this wonderful character. The film traced him from a young kid to his Nat'list days to his death. His beliefs were different, but he never compromised himself. Considering where he came from and the time he grew up in, no one can really yell and scream about why he was the way he was. So many want to glorify King as the only leader of the time, but X was a leader in his own right. His ideas weren't that different from King's. His approach was honest and a response to the times. Denzel shows every emotion in his face that seemed to formulate in his mind. I seriously thought of him as Malcolm. He really had to earn people's respect from the background he came from and I liked that. Nothing was glossed over and no stone left unturned. Malcolm X is a great film and worth the watch!",Null,57,83,15 March 2003
Glory," Extraordinary
","This film could have shown more in the sense of racial prejudice during the Civil War, but it was still good. I got the impression that Hollywood wanted to make this a happy ending type thing when the Civil War wasn't that type of situation. That Blacks were gonna go fight on with the people that hate them for their freedom. It wasn't that kind of situation. Blacks were often forced to go instead of their masters and they were made promises that weren't kept. The saving grace of this film was that it was more or less told from the Black soldier's perspective. I liked Denzel's character's cynicalness. It was true to form and real in a situation as I just described. He knows better than people think he does. Still, a good movie to watch and learn from about someone else's experience.",Null,0,0,15 March 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bad Bad Bad
","All that just to put her with the dumb, stodgy guy? He practically cussed her out in the beginning of the film and then he comes around for some unknown reason to like her. I didn't find Bridget likeable really. She has a bad accent (and not cuz she's American. It took her till the end to cuss like a Brit) and is too dependent on men for happiness. She's an alcoholic, smoking mass of irritation and stink. Hugh Grant wasn't all too bad for hurting her feelings, and he was good at it. I didn't like this film at all, but at least Reneé gained some weight.",Null,0,0,15 March 2003
Notting Hill," Hugh Grant's movie
","Many tried to tout this off as another Roberts' movie, but I found it to be more of Grant's. It's mostly told from his point of view and we sympathize with him more. He's was a babbling buffoon most of the movie, but that's his charm. Julia was able to be detached as the world-renowned actress who falls for a Joe-Schmoe type character with a Brit accent. It seemed as if the part was very simple to slip into because she had to behave as if she was herself, afraid to trust anyone outside her readily known circle. The humor of this movie lies within Grant's roommate. He was absolutely adorable and silly which made the movie softer. A lot of these British acted movies have the main person being surrounded by a large friend circle that's very close. Seems like a cultural thing because I've picked up on it with Brit tv shows. The chemistry was lacking with Julia and Hugh, but the movie was ok. A little slow at times, but not too shabby. *SPOILER* I liked the one part where they were in bed together and she tells William that men like to sleep witht he fantasy and not the real thing. They can't handle it. I would imagine that's true. These actresses are normal women like you and I that were once like us and then have to deal with the 'sex symbol' status when no man would have looked twice at them on the street. I thought it was well said.",Null,0,0,14 March 2003
The Italian Job," Great Stuff Right Here
","How great was this movie? I loved it. The ensemble cast was the right choice. You felt as if you were watching an old group of friends, they vibed so well. I thought Norton was a badly cast choice for his role, but qué sera. There 'mos def' was some other talent that coulda been used for that role. Seth Green's obsession with being called 'Napster' was highly amusing. He lucked out. The fake one got shut down, lol. Charlize still felt like an outsider and her ending up with Mark just seemed like a last minute choice or an obvious choice, because they're the pretty people of the film. They had no chemistry whatsoever and them getting together was like, 'Ok...I guess...'. I like movies like this because it feeds into certain sociological theories like functionalism: everybody has a role. Movies like this are usually good, unless badly cast, because everyone gets a good amount of screen time because they're needed for the overall result. Jason Statham, hot as ever, was charming and smooth as Handsome Rob. Gotta love this cat. Mos Def really held it down as Left Ear. You could buy that he knew his way around explosives. Humans fascination with fire...lol. The action was a good pace. Made you want to be in the film and apart of the gang. The cinematography was rather lush for an action film, especially in Italy. Venice is a gorgeous city. It was a lot of clean shots that I really liked. Great film because of the energy and chemistry of the actors, save some minor mishaps. Great watch!",8,0,4,4 August 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Disappointing
","Like Lord of the Rings, I'll sum up the movie in part 3. The first 2 were great with the 2nd one being the best part. The 3rd was disappointing cuz humans lost and Neo dies and it's not your basic Hollywood ending. I can appreciate that, but it still sucked. I'm a techno-pessimist, so I can relate to the movie. I hate all things computer animated and electronic for the most part. Technology can be good, but as usual, humans only know how to use things for evil and wonder why we're biting our arses. There's still some things I don't understand about Smith and Neo's connection, but it has something to do with an equation balancing itself. Yin and yang, matter and anti-matter, Heaven and Hell, etc. These movies were cool for all kinds of reasons. It touched on philosophy, religion, ethics, science, social and political issues, economics, ecology, martial arts, and everything in between and missing. I liked that Zion reflected a name from Judeo texts. I liked that most of the people in Zion were people of color, reflecting that Earth itself started that way. (Yea, read evolutionary anthropology essays people) And Zion represented a new Earth so to speak. It opened up everyday issues that people couldn't talk about in a creative and unqiue way. The fight scenes were dramatic and innovative and visually stunning. Nothing will top this for awhile. I seriously thought they should've won an Oscar for this movie because it was simply inspiring and ingenious to put together. Of course, the Oscar panel sucks and only picks mostly retarded movies to nominate. They shy away from popular movies most of the time. There are exceptions and this should have been one of them. The movie makes you think if this is a world we wanna live in the way we're going. Awesome job and kudos to everyone in the film. I was proud of Keanu, but he still can't shake that Bill and Ted accent. Carrie was great and Laurence is just THE man. Awesome actor. Stil, it's a movie for our generation and it was great.",Null,0,0,22 March 2004
Pitch Black," Could Work
","I liked this film. You knew most of the people were gonna die, so you went with it wanting to find out how. It was your typical strangers encounter strange planet and find out that they've arrived at exactly at the celestial time that the planet's insane night time creatures come to attack for a spell. How predictable. Riddick is only helpful to the storyline, as he can see in the dark, as the creatures can. The most amusing point is finding out the boy was really a girl based on her menstrual cycle as a target.The acting was really good, but you were faced with the typical range of interstellar crew mates. The indecisive, yet resilient captain. The religious dude. The cop who's carrying a psycho, but doesn't do a good job as said psycho becomes loosed. The idiot who thinks everywhere in Paris in the springtime. Etc, etc. The same inane characters exist within all films of this genre. Pitch Black emerges in a different sense because it utilizes a murdering ex-convict as it's antihero and savior of the film. He has loyalties to no one and would like to help the creatures if he could, but manages to yell a monotone 'Keep up' as his way of helping. Naturally, he doesn't help at all, but offers some strange sense of comfort for leading the way.The creatures weren't all that scary. They even bled blue blood. How's that going really raise hair on our arms? It was like watching Nickolodeon's Double Dare with all the blue goo from dead creatures, not a serious 'I gotta get the heck off this planet cuz these things will kill me' feel. The movie's saving grace is Riddick, because you want everyone to die anyway, as you're thoroughly annoyed with them in the first 1/2 hour of the film. He feels the same way you do and isn't afraid to show it. His questioning of God is warranted, but the holy man is merely a plot device for Riddick to tell God that he's not altogether pleased with him in truck driver language. It's watchable because Riddick is watchable. The movie fails in itself without hm and that's why he got a sequel. Maybe that's why they killed off the other characters in 'Chronicles'. We just want Riddick and more of him.",6,1,1,5 August 2005
American Psycho," Haha!
","How great is this movie? It's so quotable, I love it! Bale is awesome ever since you saw him in 'Newsies'. He didn't look too bad all ripped out either. Nice bod. Anywho, I liked that all the psychosis was in his mind. Everyone just fit into this crazy movie about the excess of the 80's and how everyone came crashing down. Not too many people get this movie, but you do with more viewing. The 80's were all about money, greed, excess, everything. These people live in a superficial world where someone can basically go crazy from the monotony of it all. It's base, superficial, and stressful and Patrick tries to escape by becoming other people and killing some. All the while, still engaging in the hedonistic behaviors of this decade which only fuels his killing. It's crazy and I love it. I love his anal retention and his obsessive compulsiveness. People like that are always highly amusing. The movie was clean in terms of camera work and the cutting. Can be fast-paced then allows for catch-up time. Very good film.",Null,0,1,25 March 2004
American Beauty," Funny as anything
","This movie cracked me the hell up! I never knew people could be so dysfunctional, lol. The 'bag' guy and his tapes was a little weird, but made me laugh just the same. Mena is a twit and you realize it eventually in the film. The daughter was naturally messed up cuz the parents were. You could basically draw the psychological dots. It tackles homosexuality and the real suburbia and everything else in between. Great film.",Null,0,1,23 February 2004
Save the Last Dance," Great movie
","I liked the fact that the movie explored social issues like interracial dating and teen pregnancy. The movie didn't sugarcoat the fact that everyone would be happy to see them together. They recognized that in the real world, love doesn't overcome all and people get mad. The hip-hop slant was awesome and this movie made me wanna go clubbing. Stiles is a great actress and Thomas really connected with his character. He was a recognizable character on many fronts and I liked that. Washington was great as Chenille and certainly made the part hers. Fredro Star tends to play these characters alot and it's getting tedious because I know he's not really like that. Play something else. His acting seems forced and it messes with Thomas' acting when they're together. The plot was awesome as was the choreography. A+ to the writers for opening up the dialogue in a major movie.",Null,0,2,8 March 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Likeable
","This movie was extremely likeable. It was cute and funny and it was meant to be. A modern version of the Rat Pack's and it lives up to it's end of the bargain. I saw this awhile ago, but I do remember some of the highjinks these guys played just to get inside the casino. Their plans were ingenious. I loved how every member had a part in the plan. Julia's character could've been done without, but I guess the director wanted a love interest in the mix. I found her distracting and it distracted from the fun of the movie. Andy Garcia was a treat, as well as the over-nerved Don Cheadle. Everyone did a great job in their respective parts. The ending was great too. I didn't find anything too wrong with it. It was a fun movie and that's all it was.",Null,0,1,11 March 2003
Legends of the Fall," Richly Absorbing
","I saw this movie many years ago like most of the movies I review here. I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it. Like I said, I'm a fan of epic dramas in a sense, so this movie went down on my list. The texture of the landscape was breathtaking. I've never been a mountain girl, but this movie made me wanna at least drive by some. The acting was superb. It was drenched in a sense of melancholy and isolation much like their home was. It was in the middle of nowhere in the Montana mountains and they survived a lot of death and loss, so the acting reflected that. It was happy at first when all of them were together and there was no talk of war, but after people started dying, that's when the true nature of people came out and it was enthralling. Nothing seemed forced or out of place, except the changing of the years in the beginning. After that, the director seemed to notice that he needed to notify the audience. Tristan is still a bit of an enigma to me. The whole symbolism of the 'bear' inside him was a bit over my head, yet I understood. However, his nature pulled him through the entire film. He couldn't be blamed for his mistakes because of his 'bear-like' personality. That was a bit too much. I didn't understand why Sussanah cut her hair at the end. I never understand that in movies. Still, the story itself was good. Hopkins wore the part as his own and it shows. The mixing of cultures was beautiful as well. I like to see that in movies. Great film!",Null,4,5,11 March 2003
Remember the Titans," Love this movie!
","How great was this movie? I fell in love with it from being made to watch it in Health class in 11th grade. I love films about adversity within races, and this movie was a classic. Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Of course, it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap, yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue, Rev, Sunshine, Petey, and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well, because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better, was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great, great film. The Titans really were greater than the gods of Greek myth, and these guys were greater than any stereotype.",Null,120,138,15 March 2003
The Transporter," Hot Film
","This film had such a crazy energy. I loved it! Statham has a wonderful and clean fighting style that I've come to admire. Yes, I actually check out fighting styles in action/martial arts films. I like to see that the actor is making up an individual fighting style that suits their character. His fighting was as clean, smooth, and edgy as his driving. I wanted to be in the car with him. A movie's good when you wanna be in it. I was a little put off by the ending being about the Asian slave trade. It was resolved rather blandly and haphazardly. All of a sudden, there's a mass of Asian slaves coming out at the end. You didn't find out anything til the end, and you were still kinda confused. They should have explained things a little earlier and a lot more clearly. As an action film, however, it pumps you up. The music they used was really hot and had you bumping and feeling like he'd be a cool dude to chill with. As a storyline issue, you weren't sure if he was French or from somewhere else and living in France. You just wanted to know more about him so you'd have a stronger basis for rooting for him. All you know is that he can fight, drive, and catch the ladies. He's a French Bond? He's clearly more than that, so they should've fleshed Frank out a little more. I know it's an action film, but Jason's worth the effort :). Truly a good film to get into. Statham better keep up the good work.",7,0,1,4 August 2005
Pretty Woman," Sweet
","It's a bad message to send to young girls that if you become an prostitute and meet a nice rich man to call for your services, he'll fall in love with you despite you disease-potential background. Sweet, huh? Other than that underlying message, the movie was cute. They allowed Viv to be a real person. She had to be to carry the movie and for you to fee bad for her when people told her what she was. It was funny and charming and all of that mushy stuff. Some nice choice of music as well. Still, as hardened as she was, Viv seemed to know very little about being a prostitute. I know she was new, but come on. I imagine they catch on quick, if not something quick. Edward was just lost when he met her and remained that way for most of the movie until he decides that 6 days with her is enough to love her and sweep her off her feet. I don't buy movies like that, but hey, it's Hollywood. And the guy in the beginning and end does point out, 'What's your dream?' Jason Alexander was a sleaze and a good one. He would have made my skin crawl. That's pretty good acting when someone can make you feel as if you were a prostitute from tv. A charming movie at best. It makes you watch, and you can't deny that.",Null,1,2,15 March 2003
Titanic," Memorable Film
","This film will go down in history as just a groundbreaking film, aside from anything else. When it came out, you wanted to see it. The way they advertised it, how could you not? We're all guilty of morbid curiosity and love the irony of a ship so grand in scale and deemed 'Unsinkable' to so many could actually do the unthinkable and pretty much capsize. It fascinates all of us. James Cameron did an excellent job of pulling this together. They wasted a lot of water that some 3rd world countries could have used, but still a good job. I liked the flashback idea, but it's pretty obvious the chick woulda been dead in most real life circumstances and Kate Winslet doesn't play a convincing 17 year old girl.I liked the true ending of the ship. It actually went down in 2 pieces rather than in all one form as other versions have implied. It kinda makes this movie the definitive version in a way, because it broke the standard. The climax was for the men. To this day, all my boyfriend talks about is the guy hitting the propeller and spinning madly to his icy death. But, the love story was definitely for the women. It was a little pretentious to think that she would have followed this man in the 4 days that she knew him, but hey, that's Hollywood. Rose was a nice insert as a person in history, but it seems fairly fantastic today that this story would ever happen. Jack was a stupid twit of a man that had no prospects and we're supposed to believe that she would run away with this cat? Oooh, rich bastard who's hot or poor twit whose only appeal is that he lives under a bridge? Oh, the choices. His nomadic existence was suppose to charm us, but all I saw was a bum. And look what happened to him. He was supposed to be so used to cold water and whatnot and the boy froze like a fishstick. If I were her, I woulda went back to Cal and said, 'My bad about that spitting thing'.I loved the character of Mr. Andrews. A little stupid for wanting to die with his creation, but to each his own. I can't believe that people actually wanted to go down with the ship and kept playing music and whatnot. Absolutely saddening that they were missing the big picture. Ship sinking. Need to get off. I found the music inspiring and we'll always have Celine Dion's song to drag us back to 1997: the year it wouldn't stop playing. I never really felt the terror of being on this ship though. I found that people had plenty of opportunities to get off, but they were just too damn stuck up to try anything. Only the 3rd class folks you felt sorry for. They actually tried to keep them on the boat. You felt bad for them, because they were the ones that were gonna die, because of their low station. However, I didn't have sympathy for first class folks. And where were the 2nd class people? It was like they didn't exist. I guess they weren't instrumental to the plot, but I wouldn't have minded seeing them at times.And of course, we're all a little mad at the old lady dropping the necklace in the water. I know it's supposed to be poignant, but give it to the granddaughter or somebody. Brock should have gotten it. I felt bad for him because he was like the rabbit from the 'Trix' commercials. Just let him have it for goodness sakes! He's only devoted his entire adult life to it. No, little old crackpot decides to toss it overboard. I woulda made her go in after it...anywho, good film over all. We'll all remember it when we're old as 'that' film.",9,1,5,6 January 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Sexy and Surprisingly Good
","I really liked this movie. Their chemistry reminds you of old Hollywood couples who did a certain amount of movies together: Hepburn and Tracy, Bacall and Bogart...they were sexy together. It looks like they had fun as well, and that's an important element to any film. To look like you enjoyed doing it, because it breaks down the 4th wall for the audience. Granted, there were a lot of rumors swirling around these two, they managed to keep professional and make a kick-a$$ movie.The premise immediately took me, and when you found out who was in it, you were excited. That's how movies should operate. I could not see Nicole playing this part. She's just not sexy enough and you wouldn't buy that she and Brad were married. I can see how Will Smith could play John, but he'd really need an actress to bring on that crazy energy and chemistry the roles require. The chemistry was important, because you had to buy that despite how much they want to follow orders, part of their attraction was real, as was their love. Jolie and Pitt played that well.Ange could've been more strong and forceful in her role. I thought she played Jane waaaay too subdued. I understand she was playing the part of a controlled suburban housewife, but let's face it, they're more nagging and annoying than that! :) (Smile please!) I get that Jane was the cautious and controlled character, but she could have put more behind her. Really pumped her up and fleshed out her character so that she was believable as an assassin who's killed 312 people. I guess the whole point was that you shouldn't believe it, but we as the audience already knew, so just go with it. She could've let herself go more with the role other than just the sex scene. Pitt was charming as John, but his comedic delivery was a little off at certain points. He needs more practice. It's like he expects you to think he's funny because he's saying it. It's not enough. It wasn't a major emphasis of the film to be funny I think, but it warranted doing it properly. For the most part, he was amusing because he didn't seem to get that he was being amusing.I did notice some of the technical mistakes, but it goes with the territory. Fire the script editor or something. We don't care that much. *SPOILER* When they were in the elevator waiting to shoot off the enemy in the Home Made store and the Muzak was playing, it was hilarious. Them just bopping their heads as they're about to blow some tails. Utterly amusing. Supporting actors were wonderful. Who doesn't love Vince Vaugh? Typecasting could be a wonderful thing with Vince in the driver's seat. Had some great deliveries. The action was great, the acting, the humor, and the romantic moments (if you could deign to call them that, lol). I really liked this film. Worthy of becoming apart of my collection :).",10,1,4,3 August 2005
Wedding Crashers," Really Well-Planned
","This movie really hid a lot of its good points. They really didn't advertise Will Ferrell in this film, and he was hilarious in a sad pathetic way. You wondered what dumb girl fell for him, but you just went with it and whispered to yourself, the heffa deserved it if she could fall that loser. More to the point, the film just didn't seem that funny from the trailers. I was begged to see it and walked out laughing and more determined to create a site with memorable lines from films I've seen. Wilson and Vaughn have a great chemistry that can't be denied. You just didn't see a lot of the humorous moments coming, which is important in a funny film. Everyone played their parts extremely well, but I'm confused about Jane Seymour's 'Touch them and see if they're real' moment. I thought that was going to be explained, but it never was. It never even came up again and you just wondered, why did we just see that? Awkward...The guy who played the 'homo' brother, according to granny, was just weird, lol. He had his face and posture in a perpetual seizure as if epilepsy was a part of his life. I didn't think it was necessary for him to stand out, but you noticed him a little more. The over-competitiveness of that reject boyfriend and the rest of the psycho-Brady Bunch was another humorous note. It was like watching an illegal American Eagle commercial with the light colored plaids and solid stripes. I felt lost and wondering what the hell was going on? Rachel just didn't sell me. The hair color was just wrong for her first off. It looked like a wig, but you knew it was her hair. I would recommend a black hairstylist. We know how to blend baby girl. However, beyond that, I felt that she was playing a character very much similar to the one she played in 'The Notebook' as Allison Hamilton. It was just a more modern time. You don't get the appeal about her for Owen and she's not doing anything different than she did in that movie. She's the rich girl who doesn't quite like her lifestyle, so is amused by us lesser mortals. And why the over-exaggerated sense of her community involvement? Come on. Who in college still knows non-profit organizations like Greek-letter ones? Her character just didn't make any sense, but you could tell they just had to make her 'different'. No, she was as eccentric as that mad-cap family.The period where Owen plunges into utter despair at the loss of Claire (and the alliterative/rhyming last name was a bit over the top, just a bit!) was like, huh? I thought this film was supposed to be funny. It was unneeded and unsightly. We could've gotten the point with him walking around looking longingly at other couples. It made the film longer and took it on an awkward turn toward melodrama and sincerity. All in all, the film was funny. It's really sad if people do this. I kept wondering throughout the initial segments of the film where it showed their wedding crashing montages if they'd try a black wedding. I didn't think their ruse would play out too well there. But, I wanted them to try just for the amusement factor of them being disassembled before being thrown out. Oh, we don't play with that kinda wedding crasher nonsense, lol. Do take a gander at the film. It was surprisingly funny and charming.",8,0,3,3 August 2005
Ray," Kudos to Jaime Foxx
","I like to see when actors who have been in the background and scraping it to make it finally get their break. This was it for Jaime Foxx. What a performance! I doubt he'll get the Oscar, because dumb and never-watched movies except by Academy elite will win as they usually do. I see a 'Finding Neverland' upset at the Oscars, but I digress. I found it very difficult to not see Ray Charles in Jaime. He was so into the part: the facial expressions, the laugh, the voice...it was all pleasantly reminiscent of the wonderful and talented musician. To this day, I'm a little confused as to how a blind man can have a heroin addiction, but hey, he wouldn't let his disability stop him from tasting any form of life I see. I just think someone had to be helping him aim the needle. I wouldn't want a nurse giving me an injection blindfolded without some guidance, you feel me? Anyways, the movie was a little long, but you got to know about someone who spent most of their life in the public eye, but never truly knowing much about them because you're too young to appreciate them or because you won't find out until they die. He was a phenomenal talent that didn't let anything stop him, and that's the miracle of life and the human spirit. I liked the angle of his mother being a guiding force in his life and the lifelong guilt he felt for his brother's death. It tied in everything he was dealing with and how he handled life, the decisions he made.The character of his mother being so tough was heart wrenchingly realistic. She was a poor sharecropper and a single mother. She didn't have the time to beg for handouts and have 'crippled' children. Her tough love really resonated to me the spirit of the black women throughout history. What some might call emasculating, I call realistic and wise. I loved the scene where he was learning to see with his ears and she just watched him as he screamed and cried for her help. He finally stood up and learned to see with his ears and could hear her proud weeping as she watched him catch a cricket and simply said, 'I hear you mama. You're right here.' That brought me to tears! Every actor was fit for their role in this film. The children, the musicians, the producers, the women in his life, all slipped cleanly into their parts. This is an exceptional film.",8,3,7,6 January 2005
The Lion King," Another stereotype
","I first saw this movie when I was 10 and cried when Mustafa died. I loved it. However, I watch it as an adult and see some sad stuff. Disney has sought to create movies about various cultures. That's admirable, however, in this particular film about Africa, everyone is an animal. This links to the stereotype of Black beastiality. Also, the voices have only 2 black actors behind them and there's an English voice for Scar. Are they saying that Blacks can't even play themselves? This movie could have worked just as well with humans in Africa. Why wasn't that an option? Whites have all their numerous films, Native Americans got Pochahontas, People of Mideastern descent got Aladdin, Asians got Mulan, blacks get The Lion King. I see something quite wrong with that. I know that it's a beloved movie, but also think about what it's saying to little kids about Africa.",Null,1,3,23 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Final Say
","Ok, I'm not commenting on all 3 movies one by one, so what I have to say will just be in this one. Great movie and all that. Cinematography was lush and the music was awesome. Great acting and application of a novel to film. Yadda yadda yadda. For the 3rd one, it was pretty obvious that the only reason they had the chick was because 'no man' could kill that evil dude. Duh! We all know people were obsessively literal in ancient times. I never felt the pull of the ring. It's a damn evil ring. Throw it away. I can't understand why everyone's going after a freaking evil ring. Maybe the acting wasn't all that good to explain that, but really. Get over it. You people built an entire movie based on a damn ring? OK...Frodo, chill out. Gollum was the best thing in the entire movie. He was so ugly, he was cute. I loved the character and the fact he kept calling Sam the fat one. Plus, I like anyone who speaks in the 3rd person. Makes you wanna psychoanalyze them. The acting was too serious for something they made into a video game, but I guess they were trying to get that Oscar. New Zealand's a beautiful place and I saw half of Xena/Hercules' cast and extras in the film, lol. Good call with that one. This film takes way too long to get to the point. You can skip Part 2 and still get the movie. It tied up all the loose ends and that's good, but why did Frodo leave? The problem with movies like this is that when they're cut up into 3 parts, you forget things that they showed before and you get lost. At least that was my problem. They'd wrap everything up and think they were introducing new things. It's lovely and I'm sure America enjoyed it, but I as usual always have my issues. Good movie.",Null,1,2,22 March 2004
Braveheart," Good show
","I rented this over the weekend and had always wanted to see it. I'm a big history buff, so I wanted a little culture. The scenery is awesome and so was the acting. It was the basic good vs. evil, but one step further. I find movies like this about freedom for some people who went around and took it away from others to be a bit ironic. Part of my ancestry is Scottish and they were the slaveholding kind. Hollywood loves to make movies that glorify people (namely themselves) and then ignore the other part of their history. It was still a good film, but it makes you think about history.",Null,0,1,23 February 2004
The Breakfast Club," Great flick
","I love this movie. The idea that all of us are messed up is great. Suburbia has this pretty picture of normal and functional lives. I've watched this many times, but I'm taking a Youth Deviance class and we watched it in there. Makes you look at this movie a little more analytically. Parents treat their kids like mini-adults and pressure them into being something at all costs just to realize the 'American Dream'. Whatever that is. These kids represent those pressures and isolation. Claire, the popular prom princess who's used as leverage between rivalling parents; John, the punk bad boy with a foul mouth and abusive family; Andrew, the jock with no mind of his own; Allison, the emotionally unstable psycho with no friends and a bit of a compulsive/pathological liar. She's unsatisfied with her home life and wants to run away. And Brian, the geek who would rather commit suicide than face his parents about failing shop class. Each one feel pressure from parents, friends, and themselves to be or act a certain way. We can all relate to that. Yet, I can see why they're called the brat pack. You find it a little annoying that all it takes is some middle class kids to have some problems for people to be aware. What about urban kids who face these issues? Nobody doing a movie about their issues till Dangerous Minds or unknown films. It's sad that this country doesn't care about anything til it hits a certain class. Still, good movie to get some perspective about growing up in the 'burbs.",Null,3,5,23 March 2004
