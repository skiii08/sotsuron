Casablanca," Simply wonderful
","I absolutely loved every minute of this film. So many iconic moments in this film, so many famous quotes, it's hard to believe its all in the same film. This film tells a wonderful story of a place where nobody wants to be, and everyone is trying to escape from the grip of Nazi Germany. This film does a wonderful job of portraying a place that is habitable, but hellish, where everyone settles with whatever they can get, trying desperately to get enough to get out. It also tells a beautiful love story, and helps to back up the phrase 'If you love something, set it free'. Rick must let the woman he loves leave for America with another man, so that she may escape from the hellhole that is Casablanca, and be with the man to whom her heart now truly belongs. One scene in particular that I absolutely loved was the scene in the bar, where Victor starts everyone up singing the French national anthem in order to drown out the Germans singing. There is so much symbolism in that scene alone, it is simply amazing. I could watch this movie over and over again.",10,3,4,6 March 2012
Zulu," Full of almost constant action
","This movie is chock full of action, and tells a wonderful tale of woefully outnumbered British soldiers fighting for their lives against a horde of Zulu warriors. While the movie does take a while to pick up, once the action does start, it remains constant up until the very end of the film. The arguments between the reverend and the British commanders regarding whether the sick are to stay and fight or be evacuated. The sheer hopelessness of the situation is built upon when the reverend gets himself drunk upon realizing that there is nothing he can do to convince the soldiers to abandon the upcoming battle. I would definitely watch this movie again.",9,4,5,10 March 2012
Annie Hall," Funny
","I enjoyed this movie, it was able to get a few good laughs out of me. While the plot of this film was a little difficult to follow at some points, I was able to figure out what was going on most of the time. The character Woody Allen portrays is absolutely wonderful, and captures the stereotype of the paranoid person wonderfully. I did find this movie to be rather slow moving in some places, but the sheer amount of comedy in this film was able to make up for it quite nicely. The characters within the film also break the 4th wall several times in the film, talking to the viewers and breaking their reality, pausing the events around them and starting a whole new 'reality', as if they are embodying their thoughts. This is not something you see very often in movies, and it was executed brilliantly.",8,0,0,26 April 2012
The Graduate," Not sure what to think of this
","Quite honestly, I'm not sure what to think about this movie. I liked it very much, yes, and the way Ben reacted to Mrs. Robinson's seduction was quite funny. In fact, there were several parts of the movie that I found quite entertaining. But, there were other parts where I just found it to be a little hard to follow or just boring. I'm really not sure if I love this movie, or just think its okay. It was very entertaining, and I would certainly watch it again, but for some reason, it just felt to me like it was missing something, though I can't quite put my finger on what that something might be. I would still recommend this movie, though.",8,2,2,12 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Quite possibly one of my favorite musicals
","Although I admittedly am not too big a fan of musicals, I was able to find plenty of entertainment in 'Singin' In The Rain'. The dancing was skillful and impressive to watch, and there were plenty of funny moments that kept me laughing and tied to the film. One of my favorite moments from the film is when Don Lockwood is talking about his past in show business, and he always says something that directly contradicts whatever comes up on the screen. There were plenty of other funny moments in the film that I enjoyed as well. The only complaint I would have about this film is that I thought that one of the musical bits was a little too long (The bit where Don describes his character's entrance to Broadway), but again, I usually end up walking away when ANY musical bits come on in other movies.",9,0,2,1 April 2012
Psycho," One of my favorite Hitchcock movies
","I am personally a big fan of horror films, and I love a good mystery or two to go along with it. Psycho did an absolutely wonderful job of keeping me entertained, and the element of insanity or mental illness playing a role in the murders was a great key point of the film. The fact that even the killer doesn't know who he is adds a bigger feeling of mystery, and makes it more difficult for the viewer to find out who the killer is. I love trying to slowly piece together all the information that the movie gives you in order to try and figure out who the killer is, and Psycho did not dissappoint one bit. I would definitely watch this again.",10,0,0,28 March 2012
Jaws," Thrilling and suspenseful
","A unique kind of horror movie, in that the danger it portrays is very real. Unlike most horror films that rely on fantasy creatures, monsters, or otherwise unrealistic events occurring, Jaws brings the horror in the form of a creature that does indeed roam the depths of the oceans - the great white shark. Because sharks actually exist, this movie has a unique kind of scare factor to it, one that lingers long after the movie is over. There are several people I know of who were afraid to swim in the ocean after watching this movie, and I myself have thoughts of sharks lingering in the back of my head anytime I go swimming. The fact that it is in an area so large (the ocean) it can be almost untraceable until it attacks adds even more horror to the film. I love this film, and would definitely recommend it.",9,1,4,2 May 2012
The Godfather," An excellent crime film
","I absolutely loved this movie. It offers a unique view of the mafia and its workings from within the organization. It shows them as real people, not the heartless, emotionless criminals everyone makes them out to be. They aren't petty thugs like most criminals you see running around today. The Godfather is unique because it shows these criminals as having a sense of honor and dignity. Everything done is strictly business, nothing more. It has plenty of action and drama to keep me wanting more. Something about the way this movie is done, the way the actions are done out, the way the mafia is portrayed as operating, keeps me coming back to this movie, keeps me wanting to see more. I absolutely love this movie and will watch it again and again.",9,0,1,25 April 2012
