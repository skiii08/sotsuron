Requiem for a Dream," Left speechless
","I was at a loss of words when the credits began rolling. I was so drained of emotion because it knocked the breath of out me with its blunt, rawness. The performances were amazing and I was very intrigued throughout the entire film. At some points I got really emotional, which is rare for me when watching films like these. There's just something very special about this movie, that separates it from many films in the 'drug-addiction drama' department. I'm also glad I saw it at this age, because it's a big wake up call and director Darren Aronofsky isn't letting up with his message, and how he wants it portrayed. I will never forget this film.",9,0,0,11 August 2010
