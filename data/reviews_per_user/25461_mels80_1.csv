Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat's hilarious adventure in America
","Borat travels across the US to make a cultural documentary for his home nation, Kazakhstan. I spent quite a bit of this film watching it from behind my hands cringing. I found it so funny and would recommend it for sheer unbelievableness. My sides hurt for hours afterwards!Seeing the film in a packed cinema added to the atmosphere; there would frequently be a collective whisper of 'surely not...?', 'oh no!' or just lots of very loud laughing and groaning.It's horrendously politically incorrect but that just adds to the comedic value.",8,0,5,10 December 2006
