The Blair Witch Project," Not really worth it
","I voted 5 in this case because it's neither good nor bad for me. I think the three actors did a good job and I guess the audience does get the impression this really is a documentary. So I have to give the directors credits for this as well.  But I believe the main credit they should get is for hyping this film up so much. I tend to be an easily frightened person, but I wasn't frightened by this although I can well imagine I would be if I were one of those characters. The characters got on my nerves after a while and you just waited for them to be dead (which is clear from the beginning) so you can leave. I also had the impression that many people in the audience were disappointed by the ending. Probably the expectations were too high. I don't think many of the people liked it that evening when I saw it.",4,0,2,4 January 2000
Walk the Line," Good acting, well sung, but badly written screenplay
","I have the same problem with this film as with 'Ray'. Some writers seem to think it's enough to tell a few episodes out of the life of a fascinating person but that's simply not true. Just like in Ray, the audience is presented with a string of seemingly 'significant' episodes out of a musician's life, which are supposed to make us understand his life. And again it's an all-American story: poor boy rises high, falls deep and then returns into the light. But if I'm interested in the facts, then I prefer watching a documentary. And if I watch a film, there should be more to a story, there should be some depth. There should be some coherent idea behind the whole film. This is not the case at all here. The way this story is told is a total failure. I was appalled by some of the messages that underlie certain scenes. Just take the Folsom prison scene. First he looks at some fan mail and it is suggested that he might be a light that guides them in the right direction. Later in prison he basically tells them what great guys they are. Can something like this really be conveyed uncritically (and with a close-up on the admiring eyes of June Carter)? My impression is that the story of Cash was told by someone who has no idea what he conveys with his words. The good acting mostly carries the viewer over those gaps but frequently I felt there were emotions without any motivation in the story itself. The movie is like very thin ice over a nothingness. As I said above, the only reason why the ice never breaks is that Witherspoone and Phoenix carry the audience along so well.",8,0,1,17 February 2006
Madagascar," Some cute animals, few good jokes, but not really impressive on the whole!
",I have to admit that I expected more after having read some reviews. There are a few good jokes and I liked a few of the animals but I wasn't impressed with the film. I have to add though that I saw the German version and so with the original voices it might have been a totally different experience. For my taste there was too much talking and much of it was fairly repetitive. Much of it is also quite (superficially) focused on the US and the rest of the world may be getting fed up with this after a while. I didn't find the zebra's cheer-leading act in the background too funny. I wished more thoughts would have gone into the story.,6,0,1,2 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode I
","I actually saw this film a couple of weeks ago but watching Spider Man yesterday I thought I might as well review this one as well as there are similarities in what I disliked. Both films have really bad dialogues but while Star Wars was blasted for it (and I actually felt they weren't as bad) no one ever mentioned this fact with Spider Man and most of the dialogues were terribly corny there.Both films are well made when it comes to visual effects. You get what you expect, but both directors seem to think that effects can replace suspense.When it comes to acting and characters, I think that the Spider Man cast does a better job but it's impossible to be really good when the dialogues are so bad. The young darth Vader is so predictably unbalanced emotionally - the acting is so over the top that it's boring. Even Ewan McGregor who I normally like is a very weak Obi Wan.In general I think that the original 3 Star Wars films were so good because of the depth that they had to the characters. All this is lacking in the new episodes. I wanted to buy the whole series on DVD but now I think it's quite enough to have seen it in the cinema. I don't regret seeing the film as I wanted to know how the story continues but I don't want to see it a second time.",6,0,0,26 June 2002
"I, Robot"," Only worthwhile seeing for special effects
","I'm a fan of science fiction films, which is why I went to see it. From the point of view of special effects I quite liked the film. I also liked the robots, which can appear human despite their obvious robot look.Apart from that, the film has little to recommend itself. The story is simple like a comic book. Smith plays a fairly unlikable cliché of a detective (the kind we know from hundreds of films by now) among loads of other cliché characters. They add depth to Smith's character by referring to a contrived past incident. We know this from Batman and the lot. We get the odd joke (that doesn't really make you laugh). There is really nothing that would recommend the film apart from the visual aspects.So for that reason, you might want to see it. Apart from that, forget it.",7,0,0,10 August 2004
American Beauty," 'If you don't understand this, in a few years you will'
","This sentence might have been addressed to the two girls next to me and many others in the cinema. I get the impression that you either like this film or you're just puzzled by it. I was really impressed as for me it's a totally unique mixture of many things: there's a pinch of 'The Ice Storm' (Ang Lee), a bit of Lnych (Blue Velvet), 'Sex, Lies and the Videotape', ... It's realistic and surreal. It's funny and sad at the same time. As it said, a totally unique mixture. I loved the music and the acting. Esp. Spacey's performance is excellent, but all the other characters are great as well. The theme is supposed to be American but I feel it's valid of many other places (definitely here where I live and probably Switzerland too) as well. I hope it'll do well at the Oscars as well.",10,0,0,24 January 2000
The Patriot," On the whole: exciting
","Having seen 'The Perfect Storm' last week, 'The Patriot' was really a pleasure to see. There are weak moments but in general the film is really exciting to watch. The one scene where a cannonball seems to smash into the audience's face might have pleased the director but it doesn't really go with the rest of the film. What really surprises me, though, is that the rest of the world is always dished up this typical American stuff while the European stuff has to be Americanized first (like Somersby/The Return of Martin Guerre) to be digestible resp. of interest for them. Now what does this tell us about Americans I wonder!",8,0,0,19 July 2000
The Patriot," I'd like to add ...
","Having watched 'The Perfect Storm' and 'The Patriot', I couldn't but notice that the directors and screenplay writers seem to follow recipe books on how to make a film. It's less obvious with 'The Patriot' but nevertheless - probably because the plot is a bit thin - the mechanics shine through.",8,0,2,19 July 2000
Spider-Man," A hype!
","This is one of the films that make you wonder whether news reporting is just another way of advertising. The film was mentioned in the news so often until you just had to see it. So I did. First the good of it: brilliant special effects that I enjoyed and some good jokes, which were partly given away by the trailers however. And when you watch the 'famous' kissing scene you only think of the water that allegedly drips into his nose. And now to the bad: The film is very slow-moving and even boring at times. The dialogues are tremendously bad - as if they'd been taken from the comic without any change. The acting is not bad, but with such dialogues even a good actor looks stupid. And I bet like many other Europeans we're getting a bit fed up with all those expressions of American patriotism and those pathetic 'big' heroes that Americans seem to love so much. There is no way around the American flag in American films it seems. I liked the X-Men but definitely didn't Spiderman (apart from the good actors and the special effects).",6,0,0,25 June 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Excellent in my opinion
","I personally enjoyed this film greatly but the audience's and my friend's reaction showed that there are many ways to see it. I tend to like Asian martial arts films but can't bear the humour that usually goes with them (with the exception of A Chinese Ghost Story). And so this film - for me - is an ideal combination of rounded characters and a magical firework of fights that is close to dancing in many ways. I was also deeply moved by the ending.Many of the people in the cinema measured what they saw by the laws of gravity and of course most of the fights are impossible then and they couldn't overcome this obstacle. That's like someone who can't get over the fact that the Christmas presents weren't brought by Santa Clause (or the angelic christ child here in Europe). So as it was unreal to them they couldn't accept that the emotions can be real.And I suppose my friend's reaction lies somewhere in between those extremes.What I also like about this film is that Ang Lee took up a genre and turned it into something new and yet retained the essence.I'm amazed by the variety of his films but somehow they all seem to be connected by the common theme of the tension between the individual's hopes, feelings and aspirations and society's demands.",10,0,0,25 February 2001
Blow," Not a bad film!
","I'm surprised at some of the negative comments. I've frequently got the impression that people judge books, films, ... by what they expect rather than by what is presented to them. So the more you don't meet their expectations the more they dislike it. Why should we want to know what happens to the fat guy? He disappears. That's normal in life. It's perfectly clear to me why the daughter doesn't want to see him. I actually felt it was a distraction to mention she never visited him in jail.This is the type of film that I definitely wouldn't have gone to see if it hadn't been shown in a sneak preview. And I'm glad I did see it now.I think many of the complaints others made are due to the fact that this is based on a true story and it does come across as fairly 'true' in some ways. In real life diaglogues are frequently flat and in real life characters are frequently one-dimensional. Also the structure is partly influenced by the fact that you have to cram a life time into roughly 2 hours. I think they do a fairly good job here.The film is quite funny at the beginning but - predictably - George Jung's life turns sour. There's almost a classical tragedy about his fall as it is partly based on character faults. I really liked the ending - normally one of the more difficult parts in a film - because the dialogue with his daughter really pointed to one of those faults.",8,0,0,12 July 2001
The Sixth Sense," An excellent film!
",This is one of the films that make you happy to go to the cinema. It has a good story and tells it well without all the gimmicks that are so much part of contemporary films nowadays. And the acting in the film is excellent as well. None of the actors is bad but the boy is brilliant. Go and see it!!,10,0,0,4 January 2000
