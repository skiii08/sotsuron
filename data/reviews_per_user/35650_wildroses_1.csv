Minority Report," One of Spielberg's Greatest...
","Spielberg has a winner with Minority Report. Everything about the film is brilliant, from the directing to the acting, from the editing to the script, from the make-up to lighting. Minority Report is a thrilling ride through the future of homicide which will leave you thinking long after you leave the theatre.Cruise plays John Anderton, a Pre-Crime detective who loves his job. Until the tables are turned and John himself is now the one being hunted by his own Pre-Crime crew. His performance is nothing short of brilliant.This is one film that will go straight into my top ten. If you haven't seen it already, go see it... NOW! You won't be disappointed.
