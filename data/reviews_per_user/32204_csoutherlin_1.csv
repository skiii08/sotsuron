First Man," A L--o--n--g movie
","The ending wasn't quite what was expected. It's not a bad movie, but does not excel. The biggest problem was the photography. The extreme zooms on people's faces got annoying. The audience was just not 'brought in' to be a part of the film. Too much was told and not shown. A real shame, since this was our first man on the moon. The progression of the space program was not covered well, either. The 'John Glen' could have been closer in looks. Just a real shame, given all the work Neal Armstrong did in his life, and the story just didn't work.",2,62,111,14 October 2018
