The Avengers," It was a typical good versus evil movie
","The 'Avengers' was an action packed movie from start to finish. It was fun and entertaining to watch. To be honest, I didn't know the background of each of the superheroes, because I rarely get a chance to sit down and watch an entire movie. But, the plot was kept pretty simple. So, it was pretty easy to follow (even for someone like me).I thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious! There was a steady amount of humor throughout the entire movie that just keeps you rolling and makes it just about impossible not to laugh. The scene where the Hulk grabbed a hold of Loki and was pounding him into the floor mid sentence was just the hilarious. I was rolling out of my seat. The Iron Man really had quite a few good lines too that gave the movie just enough seasoning to entice you.In my opinion though, I thought this movie was just OK. I felt like there were too many scenes that were impossible and not clearly laid out, and it dragged down the movie's quality. For example, when Captain America was waiting on Iron Man to queue him to pull the lever when they were fixing the engine, an enemy came and started shooting at him continually. Captain America had no protection or safe haven for quite some time, but he still was never injured. Or another example was at the end when Iron Man fell from the sky after taking the atom bomb up into space. To be honest, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that he walked away from that unharmed. I guess I'm too realistic for fairy tales.There were some parts that I couldn't understand either. Such as, how things ended up with Loki's brother. It seemed to me at first, that he was not on the superheroes side, and then, he ended up being a good guy? And also while in the plane after Loki was captured, he said he's worried about what will happen after his brother shows up, and then later he turns completely cocky and is not intimidated by his brother at all. Maybe it's just me, but I thought because of these things, this movie's quality wasn't that great. So in my opinion, this movie was pretty predictable and lacked any kind of twists in it. It was a typical good versus evil movie, and I've seen lots of them.",5,5,11,12 November 2012
