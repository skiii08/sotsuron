Despicable Me 2," Worth watching if you liked the previous one!
","I liked El Macho character but still the first movie was about stealing the moon while here its just cliche spy, romance, super hero stuff and those were the parts which just werent that good for me while still this movie is good due to all the minion antics and a little bit of family drama sweetness thrown in for good measure but do not expect it to be better than the first film. I hope in the third one they will show some huge stealing or some awesome super villain stuff.",7,0,0,9 June 2018
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Kung Fu Hustle type movie with comic and games references!
",If you have no idea what this movie is about then for the first 30 minutes you might get bored a little like I did but then a strange twist occurs and the movie turns into Kung Fu Hustle over the topness with comic book and video game references and I loved every single second of it. Edgar Wright just do not know how to disappoint so far.,10,0,2,30 June 2018
Kick-Ass," This movie kicks ass! Not just in the title!
",I wasn't expecting much but once I started watching and got hooked then I realized that this is the kind of movie which could be fun and still differentiate itself from all that superhero crowd. This is a very different kind of superhero movie because this world has superheroes only in the comics {Just like real life} but our protagonist wants to change the world and make it one where superheroes do exist. The only problem I had was with some fight scenes which were way to shaky to understand whats going on {This is not that bad of a problem} but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and totally recommend this to anyone who wants to see a different kind of superhero movie.,9,0,1,2 December 2017
Reservoir Dogs," Still its a joy to watch!
",This is one of those classic movies that have aged very well. I watched an anime named Baccano which I really liked and I wanted more things like that then I read about how Baccano was inspired by Tarantino's style so I decided to go ahead and watch this movie and I gotta say its excellent. Its each and every dialogue is just there to entertain you and it does its job pretty well. I never found myself getting bored and always eager to see whats next. The non linear style also adds to the fun and I really like this type of movies which are like a puzzle which we can solve as we go along the joy filled ride!,10,2,3,12 November 2017
Inception," Masterpiece inside Masterpiece!
","This is the kind of movie which keeps cinema alive and keep going. No matter how many bad films will be made, a movie like this will keep the cinema awesome. This movie is a masterpiece. It holds your attention right from the beginning and slowly slowly builds its logic and world around you that you will question yourself that is this real, is it really possible to make such an amazing movie out of such an idea. Well Nolan have done it and I trust him to keep doing this again and again in the future!",10,0,0,4 November 2017
Toy Story 3," PIXAR MADE ME CRY FOR SOME MEAGER TOYS!
",I cant say how much I loved this one. I thought 3rd one will not be that good but hell its the best in the trilogy. Especially the amazing emotional sequences in the end. The animation work is phenomenal and this one deserves all the praise it gets because this the series which defines generations and it will be always there as long as you live in your heart.,10,1,2,12 August 2018
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 7...8 Gonna Stay Awake!
","OK so I know this is classic but still I was not expecting it to be good. But I was wrong and this one just rocks. Freddy is a terrifying psycho whom you wont want anywhere near you ever, especially not in your dreams. Ladies were hot and acting was good enough and Freddy was the best. So if you still haven't watched this one yet and wanna watch a nice horror movie then just watch it.",8,1,2,23 June 2018
The Social Network," ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BORING! BUT ITS A MASTERPIECE!
",The moment I heard what this movie is about I was like. I won't like it since I am more of an action adventure type of guy. But boy was I wrong. The fantastical story of the making of Facebook is just as intriguing as it is to browse the website itself. Or maybe not so much nowadays. But in any case this does not require you to like facebook to like this movie. The movie is about friends and betrayals which center around a Billion Dollar Company. I loved this masterpiece.,10,1,2,3 April 2018
Furious 7," Not an action movie but a magical one!
",Once the action starts it never lets go! This is what a perfect action movie looks like! You have to cherish every amazing moment. Especially in the end you will feel like you are watching a magical moment. Well all this awesomeness comes together there is no way to not love it with all your heart!,10,0,0,9 June 2018
