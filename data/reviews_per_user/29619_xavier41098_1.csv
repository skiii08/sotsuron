Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," same stupid crap
","In this movie Cohen rips off.....himself. Yes there are a few funny things, but the film is simply a rehash of his HBO show. The same type of set ups and jokes. Nothing new here. And the hotel joke is there simply to get young stupid kids to tell there friends how goose the scene was, and get them in the theater as well. Because they are the types that laugh when a fat kid eats a sh#t sandwich. Seriously, picture a movie doc, that simply goes around daring kids do do stupid things. And lets say a guy poops in a bun. Lets say there is a scene where a fat kid for five bucks eats it. People would laugh at that. And people that would laugh at that aren't the type of people that would go see a borat movie...until that is they find out about the 'Hotel' scene. It's a ploy and it is shameful, not to mention since every joke in that film had been told on TV, I hated the movie.",1,20,42,11 November 2006
