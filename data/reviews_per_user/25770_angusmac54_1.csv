United 93," An unobtrusive and genuinely moving account of the events of 9/11
","Where to begin. Well maybe i should start by saying that this is one of the best films i've seen recently- the type where you feel paralysed in your seat for a few minutes afterwards.What makes the entire film such a masterpiece is its continual understatement from start to finish, and its belief that the audience will notice its subtleties and nuances without being fed them on a plate. Why? I can only conclude that it is down to British writer/director Paul Greengrass. There is no Hollywood finesse, misplaced patriotism, or need for a dollar generating superstar to play the the lead role.The film is no more than a snapshot of time, and viewers aren't ever manipulated into an opinion. Those that call this film a piece of 'propaganda' are quite simply wrong. 'http://www.dictionary.com' defines propaganda as 'information, ideas, or rumours deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, group, movement, institution, nation, etc'. I'm unable to see how this manages to apply to United 93. The film never passes judgement on Islam, America, the characters in the film or anybody else for that matter. As far as i can see, those on this website who have written negative reviews of this film are unable to face up to the fact that America did make a few blunders on 9/11. The film does justice to the good that the nation did do, but it is unashamed of presenting the facts.For those desperately searching for a reason as to why this film was made, it is not supposed to show us a new version of events. It is supposed to be a story that can be applied to all aspects of life. It is supposed to reiterate morals, and, to an extent, try to explain to many the reasons that the attacks happened in the first place.There are some truly beautiful moments in the film. When the plane first takes off, and we just catch a glimse of the very tops of the twin towers, or when both the hijackers and the passengers are praying, both to God but in two different languages, for example. These moments leave you thinking afterwards, and give the film depth and longevity.From a theatrical point of view- the film could be described as Brectian in style. The audience are always watching from a distance, and do not become emotionally connected to the characters. By doing this, they are left with the facts, and forced to make their own conclusions.There is so much more to say about this film- the informal but atmospheric style, or the excellent writing that makes the film feel like a piece of live action. But there is only so much that one can say, and i can only firmly encourage you to see this unobtrusive, understated, but truly remarkable piece of film.",10,2,4,30 December 2006
