Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Had me laughing hard for most of the movie
",I'm sure this movie offended some people but if you take it for what it's worth and consider it is all done in good hearted nature you should be alright.I have watched it 3 times now and still laugh every time.There is one part of the movie with him and his 'Producer' which made me sick and now i just skip through it but the rest of it i loved.I'm only 29 and when i watched it with my surrogate dad he said that it almost embarrassed him.I'm not sure what he meant by that but i guess some older people won't like this as much as people in there late teens through 30.I will probably watch this one more time and then i will be done with it for good.Definitely don't watch this with any kids under 17 and even 17 may be too young depends on your beliefs i guess.,10,5,14,30 June 2007
