Skyfall," Awesome but with little flaws
","I love this movie, I didn't see the old James Bond movie, though, but I can tell it followed the old fashion ways of the old franchises.However, just a little question, those bad guys, they are trained troopers, and well-organized. What on earth makes them think of spending tons of money on bullets but one bloody missile? I mean, you can get a chopper...I don't see why can't you buy a freaking missile to just blow the house away and kill 'three old pieces'. I mean two of them could barely run, and the last one can't hold the gun firmly( even though somehow he can make the good shots at the last gun fight). So just saying, you should make the movie more logical.",10,1,6,21 June 2014
The Hateful Eight," The movie cracked me up with classic Tarantino style, but the length and the eccentricity of Channing Tatum kills it.
","As many Tarantino's films, I love how there is no actual protagonists but just great actors stealing thunders from one another. However, I do have to complain that Tatum fails in many ways. First off, he looks like a guy who's trying to act tough but who is really soft. Who the hell made him the leader of that gang? Besides, the other actors successfully creates that kinds of mysterious atmosphere in the first half of the movie, but Tatum just ruins it the moment he shows up. What is up with that pretty-boy, refreshing look? And please work on your speaking tone and accent, would you? How come your 'beloved' sister is speaking in a strong southern accent and you're not? Enough with Tatum's acting, now it's time for the good part. Samuel L. Jackson pulls out that relentless yet willy impression of an African American in Civil War time, and it is something different from Django. I love how he describes the scene of a white boy sucking his black Jackson as if it really did happen to him, or he really wishes that to happen. It is something you can't steal.",8,3,6,15 May 2016
