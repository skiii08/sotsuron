Mission: Impossible III," Shanghaied off to China
","It's been a decade since the first Mission: Impossible film, so by now any resemblance to the TV series, theme music and opening sequence aside, is purely coincidental. Mr Cruise and his team have managed to create, successfully, a new world with very little resemblance to the original idea from Bruce Geller.In fact, the story is told in reverse: it opens with an event that does not take place till much later in the film, before cutting to the story's true beginning after the match-lighting credits.This time out, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is at his engagement party when he receives a telephone call from his immediate superior at the Impossible Mission Force, Musgrave. He's urged to get out of training agents and into the field for a rescue mission, an event that leads Hunt and his team (Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, while Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers join the cast) into the usual double-crosses and red herrings.The rescue scene near the opening is indicative of the new Mission: Impossibles: Hunt et al have to use weaponry and gadgetry to rescue an agent, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell), rather than trickery and intelligence. From that point on, this is an action spectacular that will wow mainstream audiences.Only thing is, even die-hard Mission: Impossible TV fans like myself come in expecting the sort of action set down by the first Brian de Palma film now. In fact, M:I III resembles the first actioner more than the John Woo-directed second outing, with a question mark eventually over whom within the IMF agency is a mole.J. J. Abrams' touch as a co-writer and director is felt. Any fans of Alias will not be disappointed: the movie comes off with more of that flavour, but with far more explosions and cameras encircling walking actors than one might expect. Michael Giacchino's music works well with the action for the most part and the re-arrangement of the Lalo Schifrin themes sound spectacular with a full orchestra. The musical surprise is an updated version of 'It's Impossible' over the end credits.The mask-making process is shown more clearly this time aroundthe use of electronic gadgetry once againas is the learning of an enemy's voice (no more Rollin Hand here; this is high-tech voodoo, too).The script holds up reasonably well; certainly it is infinitely superior to the previous outing. For an action spectacular, there is sufficient plot, though it is used to hold action sequences together. The mole's motive is not that clearly explained, while the main villain, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), also disappoints as a baddie who prefers using guns and fists to brains.Mission: Impossible III has taken over from the James Bonds in certain respects. The spy actioner theme is the most obvious. Secondly, the films go to more exotic locations, with Shanghai being the setting in the second half. The film-makers have used the Chinese city to good effect, showing it as a futuristic metropolis hanging on to some traditiona 1,000-year-old fishing village and some of Shanghai's back streets are also shown. Some Ford Motor Company (Land Rover, Lincoln) and DHL product placement is evidentanother cue taken from the Bonds.If audiences seek a 'bigger' Mission: Impossible, then Cruise and co. have delivered. It's quite a ride, enough to set it apart from other Hollywood action flicks, but not quite enough to make it a supremely satisfying movie. Still, it is worth parting with your money to get the action on the big screen, particularly those Shanghai sequences.",8,4,8,4 May 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Not clever
","We all know how sequels in Hollywood usually go, but I had high hopes for another Soderbergh-directed outing of George Clooney et al in Ocean's Twelve. It was shot in the same documentary style, but gone is the clever plot of the original in favour of dialogue and in-jokes. The central heist is not clever when compared to the original's, while most plot surprises fell flat. An attempt to revive the 1960s with fashion and simple typography failed to impressit lacked the polish of that era. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a saving grace, for her acting ability and seemingly more screen presence than the returning actors, and it was a pity we saw Carl Reiner so little, given he did give the team more gravitas. It gets some marks for the presence of major actors in minor rolesBruce Willis, Robbie Coltrane and Jeroen Krabbé (with no lines) among themand the audience I was with certainly enjoyed the film's main in-joke, but otherwise this was a plot less movie. Wasted potential.",5,0,0,22 January 2005
The Italian Job," Surprise! It's not pants
","Being a fan of the original Italian Job, I feared the worst. What friends and I got tonight, on its first night down here, was a well-paced Hollywood film that's a nice throwback to actioners that aren't disgustingly violent, with lighter moments and a distinctive flavour. For once I agree with Mark Wahlberg when he described this third classic-remake starring him as a 'reimagining'. While it's clearly based on the original 1969 film, director F. Gary Gray (to whom I take off my hat) moves the proceedings along at such a pace that during its viewing, you aren't thinking of Michael Caine's Charlie Croker and Noël Coward's Mr Bridger. In fact, you like, but not sympathize with, the new characters of Handsome Rob, Left Ear and Lyle  a.k.a. Napster.To show how different, there are very brief flashback sequences to the childhoods of Left Ear and Charlie Croker, appropriately accompanied by period pop music  and fortunately these aren't as bad as they sound.Gray allows his performers room to move. Therefore, their own characters emerge, in particular Seth Green's unscripted imitation of Jason Statham's voice and accent in one scene. Gray places the camera inside the cars with the actors to get some great shots of Charlize Theron (in particular), Wahlberg and Statham driving. It's apparent to the audience that they enjoyed making this film, with the exception of Norton, whose real-life lack of interest probably suited his role of double-crosser quite well.But these aren't substantial characters. They are caricatures. You root for them because it's part of going to a movie for entertainment value and enjoying yourself. There is no additional reason: Wahlberg pales in scenes with Donald Sutherland because there is a too-evident comparison against a great actor. And thank God he drives so much because he sure as heck cannot walk like a man.But Wahlberg, while lacking presence, is acceptable at all other times, as are the others. While we know she can act and act well from her earlier movies, Theron has her great beauty on her side, but largely goes through the motions.Green is the only exception, turning in an excellent performance as a frustrated hacker who claims to be the inventor of Napster.The entertainment value continues with far less blood than modern actioners and the ending  which I won't reveal  is less controversial than Troy Kennedy Martin's original.In fact, don't expect any of the layers of meaning of the Kennedy Martin script, the commentary on a declining British national pride and economy and the idealism of 'Britain with her back to the wall'. Don't expect the interplay of the soccer game between England and Italy and its parallel against the Croker gang and the Mafia in the 'job'. There is a single track here, no extra meaning.And don't expect memorable Quincy Jones melodies such as 'On Days Like These' or 'Self-preservation Society'. John Powell's score is standard, early-2000s Hollywood fare that will seem very period in five years' time.Despite some moments, this film is largely predictable. The trailer lets most things out of the bag and the involvement of a separate Mafia  this time Ukrainian  is minimal. Still, it's a mainstream audience-pleaser that can stand strongly on its own merits. It's a 9 on the entertainment scale (a point off for a naff ending)  so let that be your motive when seeing this film.",7,1,2,14 August 2003
Mission: Impossible II," More John Woo claptrap
","It's about time John Woo got back to making movies, rather than two-hour-long self-tributes. I used to be a fan when he put the moviegoing audience first and he gave us some great actioners when he first arrived in Hollywood (e.g. Broken Arrow, Hard Target). And for the first 20 minutes, in the initial scenes and those in Seville, it seemed like Mr Woo was back on form. Not for long.This, like Face/Off, seems a demonstration of Mr Woo believing the reason he was hired was to showcase his style. Either that or he is afraid we might miss his style, so we're force-fed it. It's not that I don't appreciate his genius, but I can only take so much of slow-motions, close-ups and two-gun Tommy getting in the way of the story's flow. Call me old-fashioned.With the greatest respect to a fellow southerner, Mr Woo's best recent work was his BMW commercial, The Hire: Hostage, starring Clive Owen. Watch that about 13 times back to back and it's a better way of getting the same quantity of John Woo style than trying to make head or tail of this Hollywood-moneyed insult to Bruce Geller's memory. The only sign of this film being distinguished was Tony Hopkins's brief presence as the IMF boss.Oh, it's nothing to do with the TV series. But you knew that.",4,0,1,18 May 2003
Mission: Impossible," Not for fans of the original
","This is little more than a formulaic Hollywood thriller, and if that's what you expect, then it delivers as a visually striking and well-paced movie.However, if you're a fan of the original, be prepared to be strongly disappointed. The idea behind M:I is that the IMF team and the audience know what's going on, but the villains don't. Here, the script turns this basic principle on its head.There is another major problem with the Jim Phelps character here. It might have been safer to have called him Dan Briggs and explained the change in team leader in 1967.These elements combine to make the M:I movie one of the most disappointing and frustrating movie experiences - but only if you have seen the 1960s originals. I can only recommend it to those who haven't seen them, or are unfamiliar with M:I on TV.",5,8,17,29 May 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Quite brilliant, but clearly the second in a trilogy
","You'd need to have seen the first Matrix to make head or tail of The Matrix Reloaded, but it doesn't detract from the Wachowski brothers' genius. There are engrossing themes but not all are sewn up in the same way the first one's were. But some questions you may encounter this time are: how deep is the Matrix?; are Neo's powers part of his fate, or one that he chooses with his free will?; does civilization end to begin again with a new v. 2·0 of the program or can we, indeed, steer us away from destruction?; and what is reality outside the Matrix (I won't elaborate on this, but it's an issue I was left with in the closing moments)? Maybe these are appropriate things to be thinking in 2003.That, and how beautiful Monica Bellucci is.But this sequel does not appeal to the (remaining) senses as deeply as the first film had done. I didn't walk away from The Matrix Reloaded with the same, 'What if that were our reality?'  the same immersion  as the first one gave me. Instead, it was a few hours' worth of stunning set pieces that had me marvelling at the movie's special visual effects, a great score, and General Motors' product placement in the car chase scene. But I was not immersed. So often you come out of a film bringing a bit of its world out with you. Not here.Maybe it's the absence of surprise that comes with a sequel. I don't blame anyone for that: it's perfectly natural. In fact, I applaud the Wachowskis for not detracting from the movie's original style, tying it in to the spirit of the Matrix and understanding fans' demands. I applaud them for giving us more of their world. And that may be the aim, for with this bridge (do not think of The Matrix Reloaded as a film that can stand alone), they have sufficiently whetted my appetite for the finalé. In some ways, while the first one could even be seen spiritually, the second reverses some of the ideas to generate doubt within the illusion of the Matrix  and the third may bring clarification.",7,0,0,18 May 2003
