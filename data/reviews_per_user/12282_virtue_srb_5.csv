Lucky Number Slevin," Wrong man,wrong time,wrong movie
","Im never judging the movie based on IMDb rating again. Its just shameful how people visiting the site have low expectations for movies (or just have zero taste),if they rate this 7.8. For comparison,American Psycho has 7.6,Glengarry Glen Ross is just +0.1 away from Slevin,The Rock is 7.4,Face off is 7.3... Its just ridiculous...It seems that the cheesier they make them,the better they are liked,this movie tries to be funny,smart,mysterious,but it fails in everything. Its just a pointless revenge story which is supposed to blow us away with 'unexpected' ending. Not at any time of the movie did I feel any sympathy for any of the characters,from the protagonists father,to the corrupt cop getting shot at the end,this movie evoked zero emotions. Dialogs are just flat,unimaginative,trying to be funny and witty,but actually clich√©,fueling God awful plot. Sure, a mob boss would let you interfere within his chess game. People who let you do that cannot make criminal empire, its that simple, I cant stand the movies that don't do their homework on psychological profiling and as a result make their characters into oxymoron's.Rating for this one should be say 3.5,but I just have to abolish these unrealistically high ratings with 1/10.",1,2,8,15 November 2014
The Hateful Eight," Boycott Tarantino
","There is no way I'm ever and I mean ever again paying another cent to watch Tarantinos movies. I'm a big fan of his early work, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction are incredible movies, but since he started playing on a race card from 2009. he absolutely lost it.So lets sum three of his last works.<ul><li>Inglorious Bastards - Whites genocidal, jews killing whites, we all (suposedly) laugh at bunch of people burning, getting shot, beat to death with baseball bat and getting their heads carved with a knife.</li></ul><ul><li>Djangos revenge - Whites genocidal, slavers, killing torturing blacks, black guy comes, literally kills all white people from movie, blacks are free, whites peoples brains are splattered, its (supposedly) a happy ending, because all those mean and evil whites people have been obliterated.</li></ul>Well, you see where I'm going with this so prepare yourself for another round of white hating piece of crap movie this time with oral rape scene of white person.I urge all self respecting white people not to pay for Tarantinos movies ever again, this **** isn't worth paying a dime.",1,61,123,17 January 2016
Nightcrawler," Appalled not entertained
","I'll keep it short, because there's not much to say about this movie really, at least from where I'm standing. It starts off as something that could really be an interesting movie, young man trying to make a living in a big city without many options. First 40 minutes I found promising, but after that Nightcrawler turns into a disaster when it just tries to endlessly exploit its mentally disturbed main character by leeching out every sick and twisted idea out for a viewer to see. Everything JG says in the movie, no matter how hard it tries to make him seem sophisticated or smart, is all actually basic logic with a lot of excess words mixed with total lack of moral boundaries. Psychopaths are charming, which is a quality Louis doesn't posses, he is just being a blatant douche throughout the movie.. One more thing, Jake's acting is really something I'm not a fan of, it just seems so forced and fake, I never get the opportunity to empathize with his character(s), especially here where he plays a major anti hero..I can't say it's a total waste of 2 hours, the only half redeeming quality of Nightcrawler is its unique story. If you can put your emotions aside, then maybe you will like this more than I did, but for me, the disgust for main character was just overwhelming.By my standards,this movie should not have a rating of more than 6, but since it has an unrealistically high rating, I give it a 3.",3,7,18,12 January 2015
The Italian Job," Solid
","Well,I got what I was hoping for. First the good stuff about movie. Story was quite satisfying to me.. I really like the section of movie up to part where Steve betrays his comrades (maybe even to the point where Charlie presents his crew to Stella),it was really promising,it was dead serious,and thats how I like my thrillers and action movies,there was no too much silliness about it,which was great. Movie kept my attention,plot was constant,there were no points in movie where I was asking myself why these scenes exist.. First robbery was interesting,quite original. I was kind of sad that it was Norton who played the bad guy,I was hoping he'd stay in the crew as one of good guys because I wanted to see more of him,but ironically,I did see more of him because he was the villain. Liked the dialog between Steve and Charlie when they meet for first time after sell out.And now,for bad stuff. The movie didn't keep its seriousness.. The scene where Mark talks to Stella on how his crew member got their nicks I understood what is the top reach of this movie. Some scenes were accompanied with music that also gave them a cheesy tone,one of them when Stella is trying out the mini,there were more.. Also,one blunder plot-wise.. Robbing your fathers murderer for revenge,seriously ? Thats kind of weak.. Whatever happened to characters like Neil from Heat,who chooses to kill the snitch instead of going to airport with his sweetheart and starting new life in New Zealand.. Did we lose edge compare to 90s ? I think so. Oh yeah,almost forgot,the Napster anecdote gets old after a third time.. Also,the ending is also cheesy.. Botom line is,if you want to make a good action movie,don't try to be too funny and silly about it,if people are looking the movie for laughs,they'll watch comedy instead,be serious,thats what most of new movies are missing.Anyway,movie deserves 7.5,it was interesting,it was a bit better than average but not for 8 thats for sure,entertaining,actors did their thing,none of them failed,even the Mark Wahlberg who I cant stand was quite bearable,its a cool flick,but nothing thats gonna mark a cinema history.",7,1,2,20 January 2014
Alien: Covenant," Hands down best Alien movie
","So, of course its not the best Alien movie (not the worst either, Prometheus was a total disasted), but I'm so sick of the fact that supposed Alien fans are bashing this movie so ruthlessly, to the point where I'm beginning to be afraid if the franchise will survive.Indeed, this movie has some major flaws, it has conflicts within the logic compartment, as well as plot-wise, but what bothers me the most is that a lot of people dwell on these shortcomings, instead of trying to see whats actually good about this movie, and there's a lot of interesting things shown to us.Movie is absolutely eerie, but in a totally different way from previous alien movies, or at least that's the effect it had on me. Planet itself was immensely foreboding, especially taking into account the events prior to events of the movie. I just loved the feel of that place, it really did creep me out, and that's not the feeling I get often.Also, even more than before, movie deals with some very interesting topics regarding creation. Dialogues are very well written and acted. Michael Fassbender performance for me was mind blowing.Soundtrack was superb, it reminisced of the original score from the first Alien movie.Basically, I'd probably rate this movie somewhere around 7,5-8, but just because I see so many supposed Alien fans bashing it, I give it 10 stars to compensate for the hate it gets.If you're a real Alien fan, you will enjoy this, unless you're watching the movie and waiting for the slightest mistake/mishap in plot/action, so you can go into a full nerd rage mode, and bash this pretty movie on IMDb.",10,7,18,24 June 2017
