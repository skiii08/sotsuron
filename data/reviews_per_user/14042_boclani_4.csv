Your Name.," why YOUR NAME is the best animated movie of the last five years
","Your Name is a journey about growth and having the ability to bounce back when thrown against overpowering hardships. It's a journey that focuses on human emotion that are larger than time and space. It's a journey of where we watch our protagonists struggle again and again against destiny. And it's one of the greatest animated journeys you will ever experience.Watch the review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7v32c900F4 and / or read along hereYour Name follows a girl from the country and a boy from the city who have never met that switch bodies when they dream. This movie may seem like your romantic-comedy body-swap situation. But it will surprise you how in depth the gets. The storytelling here is top notch, because you understand everything, but when you think about it, the concept gets quite confusing, but because of the brilliant direction my Shinkai, he somehow makes it understandable. The two protagonists are the driving force of the film instead of Shinkai's normal eye candy visual sell outs. Within the great writing are actually some very funny and memorable conversations. The comedy works well to add another layer to the great chemistry between the protagonists. Props to the actors.It was just so fun watching the dynamic feelings of these two and I loved how the two genders figured each other out while inhabiting the others' body. I was a little confused when a lot of the first act is dedicated to the girl, without really seeing the movie from the boy she's swapping with, his view. But the movie surprised me when something happened to the girl and we see the boy for most of the rest of the movie. So actually the screen time for both protagonists were quite similar. That blew me away.If you delve deep into his work Shinkai tends to break the forth wall often in the way he portrays emotions. He, in a way, makes you reflect upon your own life, and all his movies are really, really relatable. He makes you look back on dark times, times you don't really want to think about again and he says a different messages every movie. A big part of the film was it's editing and sound design. This all helped with the immersion. Every scene is dripping with hidden details covered in immense beauty sugar coated with an outstanding soundtrack played by Radwimps.And although the end is predictable, it did what 5 Centimetres Per Second didn't do. It left me satisfied. What seemed like a stupid idea turned into Your Name. And it's not just another Japanese animation. There are so many scenes where it feels like the Shinkai just pulls the rug from underneath you, like the movie doesn't always follow the normal routine. I felt so many emotions in this movie.It grips you in that way and shows that every second in the movie and in life is important.This movie takes every awesome element that Shinkai has ever used in his films and are all constrained into this movie. This film has jaw dropping photo-realistic visuals with beautiful Japanese voice work, great cinematography, laugh out loud comedy, gripping story, insane twists, looming soundtrack, heart racing action, unforgettable quotes.But the best part about this movie is that it has very few mistakes. Everything is in the film for a reason. Still, I don't feel like I've covered most of the points of why this movie was so good without spoiling anything. But I can say that when I watched it, it was something special. Looking around at other reviews and forums, I have a feeling, that this will be regarded as one of the best animated movies ever made.A+10 / 10Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA",10,44,69,8 December 2016
It's a Wonderful Life," The perfect Christmas movie
","It's not hard to rip this movie apart because of its technical flaws and the fact that it's shown on IMDb as the twenty forth best movie ever made, when it isn't a perfect film. But this experience will have a huge impact on your character and how you perceive life again. That is something magic. This Christmas find this movie, It's a Wonderful Life is not to be ignored. Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AANow I love this movie, a lot. In fact it's my dad's favourite movie. I'll get into why I like it after I quickly get rid of the stuff I don't like. I don't usually review like this very often, but I feel that I need to get the obvious things out the way.I recently watched To kill a Mockingbird and it was alright I gave it a B+. Now, To kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest achievements depicted on television, but I didn't have the connection like I thought I would have had with it. Even though its one of the best selling novels ever and a highly successful film, I believe that the impact to the viewer because of the issues they were tackling. It had a huge impact to the people at the time of its release, but then slightly loses its magic. It's a Wonderful Life doesn't suffer to its relay level like To kill a Mockingbird, though some things are outdated. To be honest I've never seen editing this bad before, there are immediate cuts when characters haven't fully completed their sentence and makes the scene all disconjointed. The cinematography is nothing too special either, doing just a decent job. And some scenes near the end could have been shortened. But for the most part, this is a really, really great movie and I loved it because its my favourite type of movie, it is simple, yet effective. This movie sustained my attention from start to finish due to its simple and riveting storytelling. The sets aren't big, the story is quite small and the film is in black and white. To put it simply, the film is about a once hopeful teen who becomes a compassionate and very likable yet frustrated businessman, George Bailey. There's more to the story to that but it will spoil if I explain the best part.I found it very cool that the director, Frank Capra made business interesting, because after about thirty minutes, for almost the rest of the movie, it's all about business. Which was actually very engaging.And the reason this film is better than lots of Hollywood's big blockbuster cash grabs out now, is that the dialog between the characters that solely moulds around the story the film has given and doesn't say anything off topic. This here is the main reason it kept my eyes glued to the screen.Some scenes that don't lack from bad editing, are simply masterful. And to make a terrific scene you need terrific acting which is certainly shown here. The acting is superb from everyone, but James Stewart and how he showed this man who tries to do everything to his best ability but is always being let down by something, the way Stewart constructed this man, is on a whole 'nother level.Frank Capra creates an quite the unforgettable experience. It does have some very noticeable technical flaws, but I can't really degrade the movie much on that alone given the time it was made. I recently watched Zootopia for the sixth time and I stills believe its an A+ movie, though I did enjoy this more. Zootopia I assessed on how everything worked. The story, characters, tone, messages, acting, editing, sound design, and every box was checked. I can't say the same about Its a Wonderful Life but if you see me on the street this Christmas, and ask me what movie you should watch, you bet I'll say 'Wonderful Life'.A-6.12.16, 9.12.16Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA",8,0,2,9 December 2016
The Sixth Sense," Sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and see dead people
","Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AAThe Sixth Sense is about Malcolm (played by Bruce Willis) who is a child psychologist. He is assigned to help Cole (Haley Joel Osment), a child who can 'see dead people.' The surprise ending to 'The Sixth Sense' has got a lot of attention and it has overshadowed the rest of the film. I'll talk about the twist, but it is only a part of what makes up the film. The twist in 'The Sixth Sense' is particularly clever, it's not fun if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist makes sense. And surprising. I've seen a few movie twists and some are surprising, but don't make any sense, because the director didn't provide enough hints. It is incredible that these scenes can be seen in many different ways after the twist is revealed. The movie is effective because it works on this basic level. What makes 'The Sixth Sense' moving is that it never cheats. Everything we see is real, and feels real, real meetings, conversations, and its our assumptions that fool us. Illusions are scattered throughout the film and that is what Shyamalan is when he directed this movie, an illusionist.Real horror is The Sixth Sense, events that could happen. Instead of excessive violence, nudity, lazy jump scares, boo, ah. The Sixth Sense looks at, separation, depression, bullying. Sad things, scary things to happen to you in real life. A scene when they attend a funeral with a disturbing video tape was frightening. Now when you hear that, you may think, some gory old woman will give us a fake jumpscare, no. No gore, no jumpscares. Movies are missing out on this in recent years, yes the jumpscare will startle you because its unexpected, but it's a scary face and / or a loud noise. This is a touching moment when a father realises a terrifying secret of why his daughter died. Because this is a non spoiler review I will just say that it is brilliantly directed and pure terrifying.You could just watch this movie if you love the craft of acting because Osment puts on one of the greatest acting performances by a child that cinema has ever seen. Malcolm, his wife and Cole's mother are all brilliant in this and believable. A scene near the end of the movie, between mother and son, finally understanding each other, it was so beautiful.Now when I think of a horror film, I think of R rating movies, jumpscares, monsters and gore. I was really surprised that a movie as upsetting as 'The Sixth Sense' wasn't given a restricted rating.It was great watching this movie when I did, I just watched The Visit, another film of Shyamalan.I have never seen a moving picture that has had this much attention to detail. The director removed certain colours from scenes to create different effects so it made sense in the long term. This movie shows that when you make a great horror movie you will be rewarded with the money you so desperately want. It is great to see people come together and create something incredible and do their job. The ending adds more interest after the movie concluded, and I was searching up all the easter eggs straight after. But that isn't the only way you can enjoy this film. This is one of my favourite horror films. Like all good horror films, 'The Sixth Sense' lets suspense build. I said it before and I'll say it again. It doesn't rely on excessive violence, blood and gore, or cheap jump scares. It has terrific acting, story, pace, messages, hidden messages! This is a movie that will not be taken from its rightful place as the best horror film of all time and if you were like me and pondering on the idea of see it. Go see it, anyway you can, it's a movie you need to see before you die, and before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!

Sully," Could have been something
","SULLY, directed by Clint Eastwood is a true story made into a film surrounding Captain Chelsey Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer (Aaron Eckhart) who save 155 passengers by landing their plane on the Hudson River, and also focuses on the aftermath they debate whether the plane could fly a little further and land safely on land without putting anyone in danger. I don't remember a thing from 15th of January 2009. And with all the great reviews of this retelling I was hoping to learn and be entertained while doing so. Which I was, kinda?When they were doing the hearings at the end of the film to see if it was possible to land safely on land as I briefly mentioned before, was where I had the most fun. And has a lot of suspense. Including the music playing, and all of these aspects made me really excited and worried at the same time for these people, the message at the end was really nice as well.Eastwood's movies are very colourless as shown in J.Edgar. It made that movie very un interesting and boring and kind of hurt my eyes after watching it for a while, and I have never finished watching the movie. Sully isn't half as bad in colour choices as J. Edgar and actually helps the movie to give it more realism with the darker shades and tones.The film is spoken all in a quiet tone, sometimes hard to understand, and doesn't give the movie much personality. But makes the film calming at times, which I liked. There are no scenes of people changing emphasis in speech, like yelling, having different speech types, (I guess), I find these breaking moments really important and makes the characters more fascinating.Eckhart was an interesting character, and looked like he had more fun making this movie.The wife was there to give us another reason to love Sully and shows us he has a family, but she just tags along. She makes some really stupid decisions.Tom Hanks plays a suppressed everyday hero, and it was comforting being around him and Hanks gives the character a little bit more of a personal element to Sully, but not really an emotional side, or really a heroic side. He doesn't believe in himself and never takes a second to realise he did such a great thing. Because the media is everywhere he goes assessing him, recording his every move. He never wanted this life, so he thinks he made a bad decision in a way, there are bigger reasons he thought it was a bad decision but I won't spoil anything. And by this character he plays, Hanks feels very contained in this movie, I just wanted him to change his tone, spit out his words faster. Something. But never does.There are scenes in the movie where Sully dreams up scenarios because he is, in a way, going crazy.The same dream is shown at least twice in the movie that I can remember, the exact same crashing dream and landing scene. The scene in the second act of the movie where the plane is landed on the water is shown randomly after Sully falls into a dream at a pub. Not 100% sure, but it was something like that. All I remember is that it felt really out of place, when in the third act of the movie when he listens to the audio file of the event in a court hearing, the audio recorded in the plane shows us the exact same visual scene and in a better context, it made sense for it to be there!There is really too many cuts from the past to the present to even more in the past. Once you get invested in one time period it jumps to a different one, and then when you like that time period, it jumps again. It would be a lot more convincing if it told it in a chronological order, except for the land itself. It was smart having it at the end. So the mixture of flashbacks and flash forwards in this movie didn't really work and was kind of jumbled throughout the movie. The movie lacks from the placing choices and ultimately made the rest of the flashbacks a little useless and annoying as it took us away from the personal story of Sully we were following.Although at times was entertained, mostly in the third act, the entertainment value wasn't all there. And even though I enjoyed the movie, I'm not too sure if it should have been made into a movie in the first place. It was a little hard to make a story around the material Eastwood picked, because as it said in the real life and the synopsis of the film that all passengers survived, so it's not really a heart pounding when a person starts drifting away from the plane, when Sully said at the start of the movie that everyone is living. So unless you have amnesia these scenes won't be as frightening and thrilling as it could've been.I enjoyed Sully and it had my whole family awed by the ending still days later after coming back from the cinema, in a positive way. This is a quiet movie, with good performances, with some great scenes that goes well with the soundtrack. The movie brings up questions that were intended to be unanswered. So is this movie good? Definitely. Is this movie great? Kinda. Is it a masterpiece? Not in my eyes. Too many faults and missed opportunities for me to really call it a great movie, but I enjoyed it, and I think you will too.Overall : B-",1,3,6,23 November 2016
