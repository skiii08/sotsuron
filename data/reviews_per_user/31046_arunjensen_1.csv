It," OK movie but seems a bit watered out
","Start of it is a good cast and the crew and actor makes also a nice work.However I did miss the scary part, which in my opinion could have been made a lot more effective and stunning to the audience.If the could add some of the tense from other great titles as the conjuring(s) Insidious and Sinister, then this would become an epic masterpiece.bottom line the reason for the 5 is that the movie has a lot of promise but unfortunately can't deliver all of the suspense and tense",5,0,1,12 October 2017
