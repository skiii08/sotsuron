Mission: Impossible III," Tense and exciting entry!
","Forget about all of the media's character assassination of Tom Cruise and just go see this film. My wife and I were extremely entertained and, compared to most contemporary films which assault the senses with little substance, this was a breath of fresh air. And it offered much more than stunts and explosions ad nauseum; i.e. it had some real plot twists and even a measure of drama and romance, something usually lacking in most action/adventure films. Tom Cruise' acting was at it's best, and he breathed life into a script somewhat superseded by action sequences. And he gave vitality to Ethan's character by exacting a sort of believable urgency and a true to life or death human response to 'impossible' odds. This was especially in the case of......well.....don't want to give any spoilers. :>) We were equally impressed with the supporting cast and thought Ving Rhames' Luther character and his interaction with Ethan added some comedy relief and lightheartedness to help ease some of the tension, something I always appreciate in this kind of film. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Davian was about as cold blooded and diabolical as one could conjure up; certainly a formidable adversary.And, needless to say, it is obvious that much imagination and thought went into the conception and shooting of the action sequences (big bucks notwithstanding). I also appreciated the fact that the whole movie was not shot with the 'shakey' camera concept; only those parts where that effect helped to lure the viewer into the pandemonium and tension of certain scenes.I won't waste the reader's time giving a synopsis or analytical/academic plot review as I am probably not 'qualified' in any case (whatever that criteria is). Suffice it to say, if you enjoy a real adrenalin rush, some 'edge of your seat' suspense and action, along with a few great surprises, don't hesitate to see this in the theater rather than waiting for the DVD release (which is the ONLY way to view/hear/experience a movie of this caliber anyway). P.S. A message to the 'Newz' media & 'critics' of Tom Cruise: QUIT WASTING THE PUBLIC'S TIME AND INSULTING THEIR INTELLIGENCE WITH YOUR MINDLESS HARPING ON TOM CRUISE LIKE A BUNCH OF YAPPING CUR DOGS BARKING AT THE POSTMAN!!",10,2,5,11 May 2006
