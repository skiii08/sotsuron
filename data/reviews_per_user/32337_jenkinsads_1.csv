The Avengers," A slow beginning but builds nicely.
","I took the whole family and the consensus was, 'Great movie!' The first 30 minutes or so seemed a bit slow to me. And dark (as in, pass me the remote, I want to adjust the brightness). I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Downey/Ironman fan so the other characters left me a bit cold but the excellent one-liners and SFX kept me interested. Scarlett Johanssen was impressive eye candy and her Black Widow persona grew on me. Neat little things: The brief appearances of the new Honda NSX and Stan Lee, who I thought showed up at the end of the movie and said something like, 'Super heroes in New York City - ridiculous!'. Can anyone confirm it was him?",Null,1,5,2 May 2012
