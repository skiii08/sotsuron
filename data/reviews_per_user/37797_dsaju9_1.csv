10 Cloverfield Lane," Unbelievably stupid !!
","Its a bit rare that you come across a movie which is so highly acclaimed and you find it totally trash. So, I decided to write a review on the things which bothered me. I found the whole movie completely unbelievable. The characters are not convincing in there actions and things are left unexplained. The only saving grace is the acting and the humorous part of the movie which made the characters adorable, hence the 4 stars. But this was not expected from a thriller. Actually even some serious parts of the movie sounded funny to me !<ul><li>The characters played by Mary Winstead and John Gallegher plotting against the John Goodman seems unreasonable and quite frankly unverified throughout the whole movie. Is Goodman a sexual predator or simply nuts ? The viewer will never found out. </li></ul>-John Gallegner's character is so easily convinced by some cock and bull story by Mary without doing any additional verification even though he knows Goodman far better than the new girl .<ul><li>The aliens killed by a bottle of scotch took the crown . This looks like a completely unbelievable aspect of the story where the aliens are shown as so stupid to fall for a fragile attempt to screw their sophisticated attack.</li></ul><ul><li>The girl 'escaping' without any remorse or realization that Goodman was only trying to protect her . She is not only responsible for destroying their sophisticated hideout but also has a hand in getting both the guys killed with her stupid and cruel actions. </li></ul><ul><li>The final shot scene where she is shown heading to Houston was another funny scene. What does she think ? That she is a super hero who will be able to save the rest of humanity. </li></ul>I am just amazed by how this movie has managed such a hype. I am totally disappointed .",4,1,2,13 January 2017
