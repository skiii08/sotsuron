Blade Runner 2049," They Are Wrong If The Director And Producer Thought The Cute Girls And Threesome Will Distract us..
",".. to come to think this is a good movie.The pretty women and fantasy are welcome and certainly a pleasant rarity in these anti-human body times, but this sequel (yup the problem right there) is boring and should not exist.It is forced, too long and the contrast to its prequel damning.",3,74,119,26 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," What a joke
","It was a joke and the joke was lame.In its Quarterly accounting department meeting where all projects are assigned and revenue projections are made the treasury department decided this Thor is not going to be a Thor at all.
He is a moron who even forgets which god he is. He doesn't even know that he is the god of thunder. Seriously!
Then he cracks some jokes and does a stand-up routine and so the pre-teen crew is satisfied with the movie mommy and daddy took them to see.

Murder on the Orient Express," Hollywood has reached peak remake season
","I am not sure why Hollywood keeps remaking and remaking (hello Lion King) films. Well, I suppose it has to do with taking cash from simple folks and a lack of ideas but how about a minor nod to integrity and art, folks? Get some of the latter and stop making and remaking please.
Murder On The Orient Express is as needed in a new film as yet another trashy tattoo on a footballer or another Miley Cyrus affair, er marriage...
Specifically the acting is bad.. the girl from Star Wars should just throw in the towel and the director has forgone colors in favor of grey all over.
