Ford v Ferrari," crap story
","The real story is well documented
yet they had to invent and show things that never happened.Ken Miles raced Le Mans in 65
films says he didn'twhy , it's unnecessary, it adds nothing to the story but incredibility
The movie is full with such nonsense and it sucks",2,5,13,3 January 2020
The Irishman," It's ok, but it's way to long and the characters are just not likeable
","Pacino actually was pretty decent this time.
Not his stereotypical Pacino Blast, he did allright.De Niro's acting range has somehow been limited to a stupid grin and questioning eyes. Suspect that made it easier for the rejuvenation CGI algorythm..Pesci was low key but did well. Defo not the Pesci power we love so much.Movie could have been a bit shorter, a bit, well, at least 1 hour ... It dragged on quite a bit.
The cinematics are great, Up to Scorcese's usual standards, very high.
USA of the 70ies is great to see, I bet it didn't look as good back when it was real.The main problem with this movie, is that none of the characters are likable.. It's not like Casino or Goodfellas where you can somehow root for the guy despite being a gangster..Not this time, Anybody in this movie, could have gotten randomly blown up at any time during the movie and you just wouldn't care one bit. Except for one, who didn't really matter or do anythng, Penny.It's a ok-good movie, but it is definately not Scorceses best, not by far.
Only a Scorcese fanboy would call this a great movie
The rewatchability is not there.",5,1,3,28 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another dud by Tarantino.
","No tempo
no drive
Just a story that isn't going anywhere cause we already know Manson is a nutjob that sends his hippie assassins to kill Sharon Tate and everybody in the house.
And it's not a documentary either.. so it's a dud.
turned it off halfway because it's that boringJust like The Hateful Eight was boring, and Death Proof was boring.
This movie does not deserve to be titled 'once upon a time in...' , it's not worthy of that title because it puts itself in line with Once upon a time in the West... a legendary movie, which clearly this isn't.",4,2,2,23 November 2019
1917," story line makes NO sense
","Walking in just 2 minutes from an unscaved green scenery to a frontline trench?
There wasn't any such scenery within 10 miles of the front.
It would take a full day on foot to get that kind of difference in scenery, in 1917!Generals in a frontline trench?
Generals that knew who's brother was where at the front line?
Generals that get regular privates pulled for a message running duty, when they had dedicated message runners in WW1?It's absolute nonsense.",2,15,35,25 January 2020
Midway," action scenes are just to over the top
","The CGI is not used subtly at all
There's just so much tracer fire that it looks like they had star wars storm troopers shooting at the sky..It's just to much macho BS front to backThe script , its written like people would talk today, people in that generation didn't talk like that. Low tanks cslling out, shouting at an admiral that drives by? just plain stupid.ack ack gunners not knowing thry have to lead thr target? as if they didnt get trained?Why is it so hard for Hollywood to make a movie that isn't exaggerated? or to have CGI used in a way it doesnt look like a cartoon?",1,3,9,25 January 2020
