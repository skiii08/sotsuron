Requiem for a Dream," Life Changing
","This was the greatest movie I've ever seen. It has been 2 weeks since I saw it and I still can't stop thinking about it. I turned 16 one week before I saw it. I will never be able to forget the images burned into my mind. Everyone involved gave tremendous performances. Marlon Wayans in particular made me proud. What an actor, he has definitely outshined his brothers and shown his true acting ability. I don't know if I'll ever be able to laugh at Marlon's stuff again. And then there was Jennifer Connelly... I can say that her particular story upset me the most. A situation that is often glamourized to men... is made so ugly and painful, it genuinely hurt me inside to watch.Also, the score to this film was brilliant, I went out and bought it on the way home. It makes me think of the movie and gorgeously compliments the story. Even if you don't think you will like this movie, see it, just for the experience.",10,0,0,9 December 2000
