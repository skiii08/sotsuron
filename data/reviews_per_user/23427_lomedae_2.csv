Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The biggest movie disappointment of the 20th century
","Okay, let's face it. Judging with any cinematographic criteria, this movie should never have been put on the screens. Frankly, I personally feel insulted by George Lucas.What bugs me it this movie will be a huge massive success only because of the name. The plot, acting and editing are abysmal. The characters are pathetic. The one-liners are laughable. The only thing that would justify this movie is the special effects, but even those I found lacking. Yoda, for instance, is less life-like than in the early 80s.(!)And even if the effects were up to par, JarJar's annoying presence and the childish story and lines would still make this a very bad cinema experience. The rating for this movie are inflated high, I have the suspicion people have voted before they saw the movie, or just to het Star wars movies in the top 100. sigh If I never see this movie again, it will be too soon.",3,0,1,18 June 1999
Signs," What a stonker.
","Once again I am surprised by people's reactions to one this director's movies. My review: Bland acting, rambling plot, cheesiest ending this decade. The one thing I liked in this movie is the superb camera directing.Apart from that, I wish there was a way to reclaim those two hours stolen from my life. Absolutely the last time ever I paid money to see a movie by this guy.",2,2,3,30 September 2002
