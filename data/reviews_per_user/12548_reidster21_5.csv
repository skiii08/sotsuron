Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good Comedy outweighed by disturbing presentation
","This movie had the potential to be a ten. I can completely understand how in some people's minds it was a smash, but I think the average person would come away with the perspective I did--complete confusion.I love Da Ali G show and I am a fan of this type of humor, but this movie really crossed some lines. Portions of it should not have been allowed into theaters. I am surprised at how leftist a lot of the reviews of this movie have been. This movie contains a lot of hilarious moments, but the average viewer should keep some things in mind: The film making process was deceptive and contained a lot of exploitation of certain people in it. Some of it legitimately pointed out problems with American Society, but a lot of it was just crude.The graphic nature of certain scenes was unnecessarily excessive. It could be very offensive to a lot of people, and that has been ignored in the rating process.The racial comedy smashed walls that people died to build. On a day that marked the ground breaking of the MLK Jr Memorial on the National Mall, it is important to recognize that.Taking those things into consideration, it was not the intention (in my opinion) of the film maker to be overly offensive. However, the finished product definitely can be seen as offensive. A lot of this movie was just not needed; that takes away from so much of the comedic genius. This movie gets a soft 6 for good comedy--not great comedy--and the sense of confusion it will leave you with when you walk out of the theater. It doesn't raise the question of what is wrong with our society like it should have, but rather the question of how did this film get onto a big screen?",6,2,6,13 November 2006
Troy," Good Movie that ignored the mythology
","I was very disappointed in the way that this movie tried to rewrite the mythology. The movie itself was entertaining and the battle scenes and acting were good, but it didn't adapt very well from myth into screenplay (whereas movie like LOTR did). I do think that the movie was legitimately well made.Do not see this movie if you are like me and interested in the mythology and interested in seeing it come to life.However, if you really don't care very much about the classics, this movie could end up being right up your alley. Its a fairly normal Hollywood attempt to recreate someone else's work. It does a decent job of documenting the fall of Troy and you might come out enjoying it. The differences between the movie and the myth are pretty extreme though for the educated viewer.",6,0,4,4 December 2006
The Da Vinci Code," An extremely well made film
","The task that Ron Howard was given--to explode the truth onto the world--goes off without a hitch in this movie.I have seen many critics of the book and the movie bashing it for its long run time and because of the fact that in certain parts it feels boring. All I can say is blame the author, not the director.This movie follows along with the book in a very accurate fashion--the changes that were made were mostly made out of necessity. The many twists and turns will leave a former reader or virgin viewer on their toes. Hanks proves to be an excellent casting choice for Langdon, Tatou plays a very convincing Neveu, but the two best actors in this movie by far are the gentlemen playing Leigh Teabing and Silas. Ian Mckellan cements himself into the cast of one of the greatest actors (in my opinion) ever to hit the screen in his extremely convincing performance.Don't let the controversy or critics mislead you--this movie is excellent. I am Christian and found nothing about it to be offensive. The historical references were accurate, the fictional parts were clearly fiction, and the whole movie combined together to be one of the most entertaining pieces of pop historical fiction I have ever seen.That being said, this is not something that a closed minded viewer would enjoy. If you are easily offended (I am not) or overly manipulatable, this probably isn't for you. However the overall rating people have been leaving for this movie does not accurately reflect the brilliance of this movie's creation.In order to accurately assess the quality of this movie, I rated it based upon the idea that it was its own individual artistic creation completely separate from the book.This is like Indiana Jones 'The Last Crusade,' only a lot more real, a lot more intellectually stimulating, and with a hint of mystery. Go forth!",10,4,8,21 May 2006
The Departed," Worth seeing twice
","I really liked this movie. A lot.Frequently when a movie with this much talent is put together, it seems like a lot of it gets drowned out by some other element of cinematography, but here, the film making process actually did what it was supposed to do--it acted as a supporting mechanism for the brilliant actors.I have to admit that the casting was superb. Leonardo did a great job... he really came through in the clutch with one of the most difficult acting jobs he could have been assigned. Likewise, Nicholson was AMAZING. He was the absolute perfect man for the role and he will leave you wanting to like him, but the whole time knowing he is the bad guy. Damon again does what he can with his rather bland personality, which happens to be perfect for this role... he was the right casting choice and fits into the movie perfectly.The two big surprise actors in this movie are Wahlberg and Baldwin. Both have minor roles, but are hilarious. Wahlberg especially. He provides the necessary comedic relief to make this movie feel like a dark comedy at some points rather than a drama. Also the Boston element really comes forth within this movie... there is a heavy emphasis on the Irishness of the town not seen since Boondock Saints.The character development that we see is really a major plus to this movie. Watching the characters change and suspicions arise does just as much for this movie as the action does.The reason that I didn't give it a ten is because the ending leaves a few questions that give the viewer a solid amount of confusion, and in a movie like this I feel like it would be best to answer those questions. However the ending is great--its shocking and brilliant and leaves the viewer with a deep satisfaction that most movies these days do not.This is the epitome of a good film, don't let this one pass you by.",10,2,4,19 November 2006
300," A great action flick that is comparable in entertainment level to Gladiator
","This movie was very entertaining to watch because it was visually stunning. It is rare to find a movie that makes so much out of color schemes and can take suspension of disbelief to a new level by fantastically expanding on a real story.First of all though, lets clear up some misunderstandings-this movie is not political. This is a fantasy flick-a movie that creates its own mythological tale around real historical events. I will not view this as political because there isn't anything political there unless you dig for it and try to make it be there.The story in this movie really isn't anything that was too deep, and the secondary character development was relatively poor overall. A lot of the characters seemed soul-less in parts of the movie, which is good in a way because it painted a good view of Spartan culture. The distinguishing aspect of this movie was the cinematography. The battle scenes (most of the movie) are astoundingly well done. I was on the edge of my seat with every sword swing, and the slow-motion usage emphasized the fantastic aspects of the characters in the movie. Leonidas seems like Russell Crowe in Gladiator, and since most of the movie is about men on a Greek battlefield, I felt it wasn't much of a stretch to draw a comparison between this and Gladiator (I know that movie is Roman, don't write me emails).This movie is a work of art. When you analyze a painting you look at the texture of the artwork primarily and then search for the deeper meaning. Thats how you have to analyze this movie-and nothing has been made like this before. This movie creates a myth-a fantastic, amazing myth-and because of that it is revolutionary.",8,1,5,14 March 2007
