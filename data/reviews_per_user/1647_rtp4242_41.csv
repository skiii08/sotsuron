Million Dollar Arm," Million Dollar Arm. Making a pitch for a new audience.
","JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) is a sports agent, venturing out on his own to start his own sports management agency, with his partner Aash (Aasif Mandvi). He has represented stars like Emmitt Smith and Barry Sanders, but they have long since retired. JB is looking to sign a lineman named Popo (Ray Maualuga) but Popo signs with another agent, so JB is left with no clients, and no prospects. While watching a cricket match and Britain's Got Talent, JB hatches an idea to sign an Indian baseball player, and turn it into a reality contest, called Million Dollar Arm. After finding a crotchety, old, retired baseball scout named Ray, (Alan Arkin) JB heads to India to find his prospects. He and Ray find 20 prospects, and whittle it down to two, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Maddhur Mittal) and a translator named Amit (Pitobash) who dreams of being a baseball coach. Together, the four go back to Los Angeles, where pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton agrees to work with Rinku and Dinesh, and they have a year to get a tryout, or the deal with their financier, Chang (Tzi Ma) falls through. Do Rinku and Dinesh succeed? Is JB more interested in the deal or in Rinku or Dinesh as people?Disney is marketing this movie as a cross between Slumdog Millionaire and Jerry Maguire. It is very much like Jerry Maguire, but it's more like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, because the Brits are openly contemptuous of India and Indians much like JB is, but gradually a transformation occurs and the Brits in Marigold Hotel learn to love the country and its customs. Does the same transformation happen here? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. But let me say this Marigold Hotel is a much better movie, a much more deep and profound movie. Maybe Million Dollar Arm is neither deep nor profound, but it is entertaining. There are laughs to be had here, and it's a different kind of baseball movie. It's fun to see two people who've never thrown a baseball before pick up a vital aspect of the game in such a short time. If you don't like baseball, this movie won't hold much entertainment for you, and while it's not Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, it is fun.There's a lot of culture clash/fish out of water humor, both with Hamm's character and the Indian boys. I don't particularly enjoy fish out of water humor, and it doesn't particularly work here, but the movie works because of the acting, and not so much the script. Is it an entertaining movie? Yes it is. Is it worth going to the movies to see? No it's not. But it is worth the price of a rental.Jon Hamm is good, he doesn't stray too far from his Don Draper character, believe it or not. He plays JB as a superficial womanizer who only dates models. He plays a 'Grade A Jerk' in the words of this movie, and if I was JB Bernstein, I wouldn't be too flattered by this portrayal. Lake Bell plays a woman who rents a room from Hamm's character and serves as some comedy relief and eventually a love interest, but the love story is clunky. Lake Bell reminds me of Amanda Peet, a pretty girl who's trying too hard to be funny. Alan Arkin plays a crusty old curmudgeon again. He seems to have found a niche. Asif Mandvi is less funny than I thought he'd be, and therefore disappointing. The best actors in the film are the Indian actors, Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal and Pitobash as the translator. Their natural performances add a lot of depth and emotional weight to the film. The boys are away from home, they miss their families, but they have a once in a lifetime chance. Their performances are complex in ways I didn't expect. And Pitobash shows sincerity in this performance, he really wants to learn about baseball. He has a dream too, and he's realizing it through his countrymen. Bill Paxton does an excellent job as pitching coach Tom House. He doesn't want this to be a publicity stunt, he wants this to work for everyone involved. Paxton plays House with a no-nonsense intensity, which is refreshing.Finally here's a non-animated film that you can watch with your family, and it's worth seeing. Was Disney doing a little marketing themselves? Selling this movie to the growing Indian community in the US and a huge international audience in India? I didn't see many Indian people in the audience at my theater, but it made 10 million dollars in it's first week, not bad for a film going up against Godzilla.For more hardball reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",6,9,10,19 May 2014
The Monuments Men," The Monuments Men. Not Monumental.
","Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is a Harvard art conservationist, who sees the great art of the world being stolen by the Nazis in World War II. Germany wants to build a museum if the Fuhrer, filled with the stolen artwork from the Louvre. He brings the story of the art theft to FDR, (Michael Dalton) who in turn asks Stokes to go into Europe, and recover the stolen art. Stokes puts together a team of older art experts, James Granger (Matt Damon) Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) Walter Garfield (John Goodman) Preston Savitz, (Bob Balaban) a Frenchman, Jean Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and an Englishman, Donald Jeffries. (Hugh Bonneville) The group must join the army and follow patrols into German cities as they fall. Granger has to find Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who probably knows more about the stolen art than anyone in France, but Claire is not talking, because she has been jailed by the French for being a collaborator and doesn't trust anyone. The mission takes place with the Nazis in retreat in 1944, but the mission is still fraught with danger. Jeffries loses his life guarding the Bruges Madonna in Belgium, and what starts as a mission to save the greatest artwork in history, becomes a mission of life and death. Stokes think he knows where the art is kept, but when he gets to the first city in Germany where he thinks the art is kept, there are no art pieces to be found. Where in Germany is the art being kept? Can James Granger get any information from Claire Simone? I have mixed feelings about The Monuments Men, it is an interesting story, one that I knew nothing about, but there doesn't seem to be enough of a story to sustain two hours of filmmaking, so there are points where the movie drags. The cast tries to fill the slow spots with comedy, but World War II is still a very serious topic, so there is a limit to how much comedy they can put in a movie like this. There doesn't seem to be a lot of conflict in the film, the Monuments Men seemingly cruised through Germany to find this art with seemingly little resistance or hardship of any kind. With no conflict, there's no real emotional hook to this movie,it's a hybrid, it tries to be a movie about art and culture, but it also tries to be a war movie. But it's not Schindler's List, or Saving Private Ryan, or the Great Escape or Stalag 17, it's not even Inglorious Basterds.The story is not cohesive, that is both the writer and director's fault, and since both are George Clooney, he has to shoulder the blame for it. The story skips from the hunt for the art to the subplot between Claire and James, which features a clumsy attempt at romance, which detracts from the main plot, which is not that strong in the first place.The cast is excellent, they make the material better than it is. I don't like Clooney's dull monotone delivery, but even he has a good scene interrogating a Nazi officer about the lost art, and the officer's participation in concentration camps. Matt Damon is very good as Granger, the man trying to cajole information from Claire. Cate Blanchett is good, as Claire, a sweet, librarian type, who has lost her ability to trust. John Goodman, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, and Jean Dujardin all add comedic flourishes, and make the movie more enjoyable than the material.I would say this is a good movie to rent, but not great for the theaters.For more monumental reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",Null,2,2,23 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips: A Commanding performance by Hanks.
","Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the cargo ship the Maersk Alabama. In early 2009, the Maersk Alabama is scheduled to sail around the cape of Africa. Phillips is well-aware of the threat of kidnapping by pirates. He is made more aware of this threat when he gets an e-mail saying that the Maersk Alabama is headed toward a highly dangerous kidnapping area. Before the Maersk Alabama ever sets sail, Somaili pirates Muse (Barkhad Abdi) Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) Najee (Faisal Ahmad) and Elmi (Mahat Ali) are planning the kidnapping with the aid of Somali warlord. Hufan (Issak Farah Samatar)The Somalis try to board the Maersk Alabama once, and are repelled by Phillips and the crew, but on the second attempt, they are successful and board the ship. Muse emerges as the leader of the pirates, and quickly he finds Captain Phillips and begins to search for the rest of the crew of 20. The crew for their part, does everything it can to sabotage the pirates' efforts. They turn off the power on the ship, they break glass on the floor of the ship so that one of the barefooted pirates cuts his foot, and two or three of the Maersk crew even capture Muse, and they work out a trade for Captain Phillips for Muse, but the trade goes wrong, and the pirates escape with Captain Phillips, on-board a lifeboat. Now, it's up to the Navy and a Navy Seal Team to rescue Phillips. Do they do it?One of the reasons I like this movie is because it is an intelligent story and not just a shoot-em-up action movie. The captain and crew of the Maersk Alabama do not have guns , or weapons of any kind so they have to use their wits and stall until the Navy sends a ship to pressure the pirates. This is an intelligent script, because it makes the Captain sympathetic, even when he is under extreme pressure of injury or death, Captain Phillips actually tends to the injuries of the pirates that are trying to injure him. The film points out that the Alabama is delivering food and supplies to Africans. Phillips even gives the pirates a way out of the crisis. This is an intelligent movie because it makes the pirates sympathetic. Kidnapping should never be condoned, but one can realize that abject poverty can lead to irrational behavior. These pirates have nothing to lose, and so they are willing to lose everything. Phillips and Muse gain a grudging respect for each other, because even while they are working at cross-purposes, they both realize that no one can get hurt or they both lose. The direction also helps this movie set a tone. The atmosphere in this movie can only be called claustrophobic, you can feel the the closeness in the ship, the tightness of space, the overall cramped feeling. This is achieved by filming on an actual ship and not a soundstage. Director Paul Greenngrass is to be applauded for deciding to film this on a ship, this adds to the suspense. Greengrass knows his way around an intelligent action movie, he's directed both the Bourne Supremacy and the Bourne Ultimatum.The acting is superb as well, many watching this film will say that this is a pedestrian effort by Tom Hanks, but those who say that miss one of the strengths of Hanks' career, making the common man do extraordinary things. In movies like Catch Me If You Can, The Green Mile, Larry Crowne, even Toy Story, he plays seemingly ordinary men who bring people together with his leadership. And in the last 10 minutes of Captain Phillips he gives such a virtuoso performance, so emotionally powerful that it is spellbinding. He does try to affect a New England accent in this movie, it's not very good, but that's a minor glitch in a great performance. Another standout performance was given by Barkhad Abdi, who played Muse, he was menacing, he had to be, and he conveyed that very well. He also played the role with, charm, guile, humor and intelligence. He humanized a reprehensible character, Muse wasn't taken in by most of what Phillips told him, and that made the movie even more interesting to watch.This movie has everything, a great story, supplemented by superb acting and excellent directing; all make for a taught thriller that is a must-see.For more commanding reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,2,5,18 October 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perks of Being A Wallflower: Plant yourself in a chair and watch it.
","Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a shy, bookish, high-school freshman. He is so shy that he doesn't say a word in his first day of English class. Charlie is so shy that his English teacher, Mr. Anderson, (Paul Rudd) befriends him. Charlie finds another friend in high school senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) in shop class. Patrick introduces Charlie to his half-sister, Sam, (Emma Watson) at a football game. Charlie immediately falls in love with Sam, even though Sam is in love with Craig (Reece Thompson) who is in college. At a party, Charlie eats funny brownies and makes more friends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) is a bossy girl, who wants Charlie to go to a Sadie Hawkins day dance with her. Charlie and Mary Elizabeth go out for two weeks, but then Charlie kisses Sam during a game of truth or dare, and that one act puts their group of friends in danger. But then Charlie gets into a fight with Brad (Johnny Simmons) and his bully friends, they are bullying Patrick. During the fight Charlie blacks out. When he wakes up, the bullies are knocked out, and Charlie is still standing. Why is a football player and his goons bullying Patrick? Why is Charlie blacking out? One word for this movie is overwrought. A lot of the experiences in this movie don't exactly ring true to the high school experience I remember. First Charlie is so shy, he can barely talk, but soon he has a bunch of high school senior friends, albeit outcast friends. Seniors never hang out with freshman, that just doesn't happen, seniors don't have intense feelings for freshmen, no matter how many funny brownies they eat. Everything in this movie is so intense and condensed that 4 years' worth of angst packed into one year. But then all of a sudden, the movie redeems itself through a reveal, I won't say what the reveal is, but it ties the movie together nicely. The romance between Charlie and Sam is still unrealistic, but the story makes more sense and it's grounded in something besides the everyday high school angst. There's a lot of drug use portrayed in this film, not the usual pot smoking, but there's a scene where Charlie takes LSD, and so I don't think tweens should watch it, even though the movie is rated PG 13, older teens can watch it, and talk about it with your parents or an older sibling, because there are a lot of issues in this movie, and you will want to discuss these issues with someone older, if you are a teen. I don't necessarily agree with their point of view on peer pressure and drugs, but I will leave that to you, gentle reader.The acting is quite good. Emma Watson struggles a bit with her American accent, but it holds up well enough and she gives a good, heartfelt performance. The real stars are the supporting cast. Logan Lerman plays Charlie with a sincerity and earnestness that is rare in these coming of age films. Ezra Miller is wonderful as Patrick, playing the serious and comedic scenes with equal aplomb. Mae Whitman is also very good as Mary Elizabeth, she handles the complexity of her role well. And it's nice to see Paul Rudd in a serious, contemplative, role, he acquits himself quite nicely. It's a refreshing change from his comedic roles. The actors that play the teens look a lot older than teens, but that's a minor detail.It's a long movie, an hour and 45 minutes, but it's paced well, and there's a good story to be told, so watch it.Find out about the perks of reading my blog.

Gravity," Gravity: Falls apart, after an promising start.
","Russian space debris strikes the space shuttle and strands an astronaut named Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and a medical engineer, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) stranded in space. The shuttle is destroyed, and both Kowalski and Stone are running out of oxygen and must get to the International Space station before they run out of oxygen, but what awaits them in the Space Station and beyond? Does the pair make it back to Earth safely?Gravity is a technical marvel, the question that arises is, how did director Alfonso Cuaron simulate the space sequences so spectacularly? Movies are certainly a visual medium, and this movie has some eye- popping visuals, the view of earth from outer space, the debris hitting the Space Shuttle, the scenes in space on the whole are incredible. But as visually arresting as Gravity is, the story is not credible, and worst of all predictable. The characters, specifically Stone, goes from disaster to disaster, one step ahead of being blown to smithereens. There is some thin backstory about Stone losing a child, and questioning her own desire to live, but overall, there is very little character development and plot development, and the question that occurred to me about the story was, doesn't anybody maintain their space stations? I'm not going to get into the space flight errors that were made in the story, because I don't know enough about space vehicles to know better, but I read that there were errors. In a movie as visual as this, those kind of errors should be kept to a minimum. But I don't need to be an astrophysicist to know when a movie is boring.The acting is fair, but the actors aren't given a lot to do, Bullock alternates between gasping for air, or screaming helplessly, or just floating there in space, doing somersaults. Clooney regales Bullock with a series of stories, meant to be amusing but when delivered with Clooney's trademark monotone, deadpan delivery, the stories turn boring. The script tries to make light of Clooney's pretty boy image, but fails. This movie stretches to get to its 90 minute running time, and the story is used as filler for the stunning visuals, and it's not very entertaining filler.When I think about the fact that there was a lot of buzz about Gravity winning a Best Picture Oscar that is galling. Gravity is one-third of a good movie, it's Cuaron's visual playground, but the effects are not able to sustain a movie, with no story, and actors with very little to say. 12 Years A Slave on the other hand was based on a true story, had outstanding acting and its share of visual resonance. 12 Years a Slave was a complete film.For more astronomical movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",3,1,4,14 July 2014
Fury," Fury Infuriatingly bad film-making.
","Tank Commander Don Collier (Brad Pitt) leads a group of soldiers on a mission to hold a crossroads from a Nazi SS division in 1945. His loyal subordinates have fought with him from Africa to France on D- Day and now into Germany. The veterans, Boyd Swan, (Shia La Bouf) Trini Garcia, (Michael Pena) and Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) try to break in a new assistant tank driver, Norman Ellison (Logan Lehrman) who used to be a clerk typist before entering combat. Can the tank soldiers hold the crossroads until reinforcements arrive?I have heard that Fury is based on a number of true stories from World War II. If that is the case, the collection of stories seem awfully disjointed, and lacking in continuity. Every movie about WWII had a mission to complete. In Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers try to recover a missing soldier, in the Great Escape, a group of allied POW's try to escape a Nazi POW camp, In Stalag 17, the allies try to uncover a Nazi spy in their midst, and probably the best of these is Band of Brothers, which follows the exploits of Easy Company the first parachute infantry regiment during World War II. There is no mission here, no cohesive story, the soldiers just hop from mission to mission, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. It's supposed to be a character study, but the characters are paper thin. Pitt is the leader of the group, but why do these soldiers follow him around through the whole war, and why are they willing to lay their lives on the line for him. The rest of the characters are little more than stereotypes, Swan spouts scripture at every turn, which is an insult to a true Christian. Garcia is a loutish Hispanic character, Grady Travis is the stereotypical Hollywood redneck, which is an insult to Southern people. And Lehrman is the new guy being put through the requisite amount of hazing before being accepted by the group. To top it off, the ending is shockingly unrealistic. If it wanted to concentrate on how muddy, and filthy and bloody war is they succeeded, but again, what kind of story do they want to tell, a heroic war story or a gritty anti-war war movie? The length of the movie, is far too long, and one scene, where the soldiers hold two women prisoner, encapsulates the problem. The scene goes on and on, and doesn't provide any insight to these men, or why they behave they way they do. 2 hours and 14 minutes is horrendously long for a movie with seemingly no point.The acting is underwhelming. Pitt gives a dull, listless performance, and expects the audience to follow him regardless. It's like he's saying, 'I'm a star, that's why you should spend 2+ hours watching me.' Sorry, that's not good enough. After two lackluster performances in 12 Years A Slave, and World War Z, I'm beginning to have serious doubts about Pitt's acting ability. He is capable of giving a good performance, he did give a great performance in Inglorious Basterds, ironically a World War II movie. Logan Lehrman gives the best performance, but the character is so hackneyed and clichéd, that it's hard to appreciate his performance. Shia La Bouf easily gives the most insincere performance of his life as a Bible thumping evangelical, and Michael Pena should be ashamed of the lines he has to say. If I want a sermon, I'll go to church, if I want a negative Latino stereotype, I'll watch John Leguizamo.There is one scene with outstanding cinematography, unfortunately it's the first scene, and then the rest of the movie is filled with a dull sepia imbued film. This is undoubtedly done for effect, but instead of illustrating an uplifting tone, it adds to a depressing tone. The pacing is slow and ponderous, much like a tank ride though Germany. The story meanders for a long time, before trying to build to an exciting ending. It doesn't.For more Pitt-thy reviews visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",1,163,269,25 October 2014
World War Z," World War Z. Not-big on brains.
","Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) used to work for the United Nations. He now lives quietly in Philadelphia with his wife Karin (Mirielle Enos) and their daughters. Gerry hears about an infection and moves the family to NY from Philadelphia. In New York, the rioting begins, the infection is causing people to turn into zombies. Gerry escapes New York, one step ahead of a conflagration, and gets on a ship, with the help of his U.N. friend, Thierry. (Fana Makoena) To stay on the ship, Gerry has to go to South Korea to work with immunologist, Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel) but Fassbach shoots himself dead during a zombie attack. Gerry finds out that Israel has stayed relatively safe during the zombie attacks by building a wall, so he flies out of South Korea, and into Israel, but hey, zombies can climb walls, so Gerry has to hot-foot it out of Israel, with a female soldier named Segan (Daniella Kertesz), and a planeload of other survivors. Gerry thinks he's figured out a chink in the virus, but he has to figure out how to get the plane to a World Health Organization center in Cardiff, England with a zombie on the plane. Does he make it to England? Does his idea work?World War Z is a ludicrous movie. This movie consists of Brad Pitt jet-setting around the world, staying one step ahead of the law, as it were. But as soon as the immunologist shot himself, I knew this was a Brad Pitt vanity project, he wasn't going to share the screen with anyone. How he makes it to the end of this movie strains credulity, more than once. It suffers from what every monster flick suffers from, thousands or millions may die, but the hero will never die. Any veteran horror movie watcher knows that going in, so I'm hardly giving anything away. Oddly enough, if the viewer suspends reality until the end, the denouement is actually pretty inventive. Pitt does a good job playing sensitive action-hero, (he calls his wife regularly) and the sensitive action hero is about the limit of Brad's acting ability. There really is no other acting to speak of other than Daniella Kertesz, who dies a credible job as action hero sidekick. The length is nearly two hours and drags at certain points, despite trying to be a non-stop action movie.For more dead-on movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,7 April 2014
The Impossible," The Impossible: Great acting and incredible visuals make the impossible possible.
","Henry (Ewan McGregor) works for a Japanese company, and takes his wife, Maria (Naomi Watts) and three kids, Lucas (Tom Holland)Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oakley Pendergast to Thailand on vacation. No sooner do they get settled in their hotel, and start swimming in the pool, when a monster tsunami hits Thailand, Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka, and devastates everything in its path. The tsunami splits up Henry and the family, Lucas and Maria end up together. Maria is gravely hurt, somehow they climb a tree with another young toddler in tow and wait an agonizingly long time for help to arrive.Maria and Lucas are finally taken to a hospital, but Maria is too badly injured to be taken to surgery. In the interim, Lucas takes down names of strangers who are missing family members, and even re-unites a man with his son. One day, Lucas arrives where his mother was resting only to find his mother gone. A friendly caretaker (Ploy Jindachote) helps Lucas find his mother but she is still too weak for surgery. Can the doctors stabilize her enough to operate on her? Where are Henry, Thomas and Simon? Are their lives taken by the devastating tsunami?I wanted to watch The Impossible because I wanted to remember what I felt like almost ten years ago when that tsunami devastated Indonesia, India, Thailand and Sri Lanka. I was in shock that one natural disaster could take such a heavy toll. This movie does an excellent job of physically recreating the damage done by the tsunami, and I give the filmmakers credit for tackling a story that's extremely difficult to tell, but this is a movie with surprisingly many shortcomings. It's based on a true story, but the real family was Spanish, the movie family is British, so again, like The Butler, how many liberties did the writers take with the actual story? I didn't like the ethnocentric focus of this movie, if viewers knew nothing about the tsunami of 2004, they would think that all the victims were European, because Europeans are the only victims shown in this movie. The reality is that hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of the 2004 tsunami, most of whom were Asian. Other than the caretaker, and a nurse, none of the characters in the movie were Asian, that's not right. This is a movie that almost demands a tragic ending, to reflect the tragic circumstances of the storm, I won't tell you the ending, you have to watch it yourself to see if it's fitting. The writers even write in some product placement involving a can of Coke, hardly appropriate for a tragedy of this magnitude.One big reason to watch this movie, despite whatever shortcomings the script may have, are the performances. Naomi Watts has a physically grueling and emotionally taxing performance. She gives her all in this performance, there is nothing left behind, no physical or emotional pain unmined. She is the soul of this movie. Ewan McGregor gives a similarly strong and emotional performance. He is such a versatile actor, and is so good in so many different roles, Big Fish, Salmon Fishing in The Yemen, Attack of the Clones Revenge of the Sith, he brings an incredible vitality and humanity to all his roles. The kids are all very good also, they are very mature at times, yet very vulnerable at others.The story is long, but the pacing is good, so the movie doesn't drag. The visuals speak for themselves. The scenes of devastation speak in ways that words cannot express. Those scenes by themselves make the movie worth watching.Impossible to find a good movie?

Don Jon," Don Jon. Dawn of a new kind of comedy.
","Jon (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a 20 something, single bartender, he likes to work out, he likes to go clubbing with his pals, Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke) He drives a 1972 Chevy Chavelle, and works out regularly. Jon lives with his parents Jon Sr. (Tony Danza) Angela (Glenne Headly) and his sister, Monica.(Brie Larson) Jon goes to church regularly, he sleeps around nightly, and is obsessed with pornography. He doesn't think he's going to settle down , but then he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) and she is a 10 on his scale, and is everything he wants in a woman.Barbara wants to meet his parents, she wants Jon to go to school to be better than a bartender, and he wants Jon to be exclusive to her. He dutifully does all this, but can't give up his porn addiction. Barbara catches him one day, he gets out of it by saying one of his friends sent it to him one day, and swears to give it up, but doesn't. At his night class, Jon meets a quirky older woman, named Esther (Julianne Moore) and they strike up an unlikely friendship. What does his porn addition do to his relationship with Barbara? Does he confide his obsession to his new friend Esther?I love this movie. To most, it would seem like Joseph Gordon Levitt plays a stereotype. He plays a Guido, if you don't know what that is Google it. He's a musclehead, he drives a fast car, he has a hot girlfriend. Jon should be happy, but he isn't. He doesn't realize it, but he's being used by Barbara, who just wants someone to manipulate. He has a rationale for his addiction, so he doesn't see it as a problem, but it increasingly takes over his life.What I like about this movie is the complexity of the Jon character. His life is a walking dichotomy; he is part altar boy and part playboy. Jon sleeps around, but he goes to church, he moves on to have a steady girlfriend, which to him means respectability, but he watches porn every day, which even he realizes is getting out of hand. This movie contains a lot of truths, about sex, love relationships and the destructiveness of pornography, namely the objectification of women. Mainly, what this movie has going for it is, it's damn funny. Jon says the Lord's Prayer while working out, his sister always has her face stuck in front of the phone, texting, and Jon's Catholic Church confessions are laugh out loud funny. There is a scene where Jon and Barbara are also having an argument about Swiffer pads that is classic comedic dialogue. There's also a fake movie with Ann Hathaway and Channing Tatum which is also hilarious. There is also a subtle commentary about the prevalence of scantily clad women in everyday mainstream culture, from fashion magazines to TV commercials. The relationship with Esther is a little far-fetched, but it works in the larger scheme of things.Joseph Gordon Levitt plays this character perfectly, the muscles the hair gel, the car, the women, the porn, all leads you to believe that he's a jerk, but he's really not. He lives with his parents, he is a person of faith (however superficial that faith is) and he wants to settle down, he's just not sure if Barbara is the right woman to settle down with. He brings the perfect mixture of party boy player and sensitive guy looking for a deeper relationship to this role, with a perfect New Jersey accent, and perfect comedic timing. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as a woman who knows what she wants, and knows how to get it. She lays on the accent a little thick but gets the tone of the role down perfectly, she coos to Jon sweetly but she seeks to be a puppet master. Julianne Moore has gotten into a rut of playing these flighty older women , but in this movie, it works. Great supporting performances by Tony Danza, Glenn Headly, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke. Congratulations to Levitt for writing and directing such a complex movie, including so many disparate topics, and making it funny to boot. He's got a bright career ahead of him. The length was a perfect 90 minutes. It's not for kids, because of the preponderance of sex and pornography as a theme, but if you are an adult and don't have an issue with those things, watch this movie.For more addicting movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,0,1,11 May 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Classic Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb (1964) A Blast
","General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated.In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack.Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest.Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, 'You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!' But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me.There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing.Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like 'Try A Little Tenderness' while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while 'We'll Meet Again' is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece.For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",10,1,2,14 September 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Pan's Labyrinth: A-Maze-ing.
","A little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) imagines a world filled with faeries, a labyrinth and a faun, a half-man, half-goat. (Doug Jones) Ofelia desperately wants to escape her painful life, with a sadistic stepfather, named Vidal (Sergi Lopez) and a bed-ridden mother named Carmen (Adrianna Gill) The faun makes this escape possible by telling Ofelia that she is a great princess named Moanna, whose soul has been reincarnated in this body at this time. To return to her father a great king, she must complete three tasks. While Ofelia imagines this splendid world, the brutality of the Spanish civil war continues in the real world. Vidal, a captain in Franco's army kills the remaining resistance at will, not knowing that his personal cook, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) and wife's doctor (Alex Angulo) are spies for the resistance, plotting against him and the rest of Franco's army. Does Ofelia complete the tasks given to her by the faun? Does Vidal crush the resistance? I love this movie. The viewer can take it any number of ways, a simple child's fable, a brutal war movie, or a spiritual allegory that explains the joys of the next world. Part of Pan's Labyrinth is definitely reminiscent of Alice In Wonderland, but there is also something deeper conveyed in the story. Is the faun a demon, tempting Ofelia with food when she is hungry? Or is he an angel guiding her from this world to a world without hatred or pain? How do we gain admittance to that perfect world, through deeds (her tasks) or through the blood of someone who dies for us? The juxtaposition of a brutal world, and the promise of a spiritual world of bliss is sheer genius, and deserves praise. This is a war movie though, and therefore not meant for kids, the violence is abrasive, and meant to be so, as if to shock the viewer back to reality. The ending is fitting for a movie like this, I would have been disappointed if it ended any other way.The acting is spellbinding, especially by Ivana Baquero, who portrays Ofelia with a childlike innocence, but also an adult's courage. It's an amazingly complex performance for a 12 year old. Sergi Lopez is just evil personified, but he is also smooth and confident, so one can see why a woman would fall for him, a well-rounded performance. Maribel Verdu is also impressive as the cook, who's a spy, she also becomes a surrogate mother for Ofelia as her mother gets sicker. Verdu shows an edge in her interactions with Vidal, but also shows tenderness with Ofelia.Finally, the direction and writing bring all these disparate elements together. Writer and director Guillermo Del Toro combines the stunning visual beauty of a child's fable with the ugliness and brutality of the Spanish Civil War, and the effect is breathtaking. This movie is both a visual feast, splashed with bright colors, and deep spiritual ideas done in a thoughtful, persuasive way. If your only experience with Del Toro is Pacific Rim, give this one a try, it's a much better film.For more amazing book and movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,2,4,12 October 2013
The Book Thief," Classic Movie Review: The Book Thief (2013)‏
","Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nelisse) is a German girl who has been given up for adoption by her mother (Heike Makatsch) who can no longer afford to take care of her. Her adoptive father, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) is a kindly old accordion player, who loves Liesel at first sight. Her adoptive mother. Rosa (Emily Watson) is a strict taskmaster, who demands obedience and not love. Liesel develops a friendship with the boy next door, named Rudy (Nico Liersch) but is bullied by the rest of the kids in school, especially Franz (Levin Liam) an ardent member of the Nazi youth . Liesel learns to read with the help of Hans, who starts a dictionary for Liesel on the walls of his basement. Liesel attends a book burning, but she would much rather read books than burn the, also there are hints that her mother is a Communist, so she is already feeling like an outsider to the Nazi regime.After Kristallnacht, a young Jewish man named Max (Ben Schnetzer) runs away from his mother's house fearing for his life. He asks for refuge at Hans' house. Hans feels obligated to Max's father, because Max's father saved Hans' life during WWI and gave him his accordion for safe keeping. Hans takes Max in and hides him in the basement, where he and Liesel strike up a friendship based on their mutual disdain for Hitler. Max also teaches Liesel to read and write in descriptive language. Max gives her a book as a present. Rudy throws the book into the river during a fight with Franz rather than hand the book to Franz. Franz informs the Nazis about the book and they are soon at Hans' door to search his basement. Do the Nazis find Max or do Hans, Rosa and Liesel continue to hide him?This is a great movie, because it not only shows the Nazi atrocities, book burning, Kristallnacht and the segregation of Jews by forcing them to wear what is called the Jewish badge, it shows the absolute change in German attitudes towards the war as the war dragged on. At first, the German kids are running through the streets excited to fight, as the fighting continues, there is a palpable sense of war weariness, and futility about the war. Of course the filmmakers take the anti-Nazi sentiment too far, It's doubtful that there were kids yelling 'I hate Hitler!' as the film portrays, but the underlying anti-war theme is a powerful one, underscored by the voice of death narrating the film. Liesel learning to read is a metaphor for her learning about the ugliness of life in the Nazi regime, but there's also a sense that learning is the only way that people can bring down oppressive regimes, that is a very subtle point made by the movie. The ending is emotional, with a mix of emotions, nothing more needs to be said.The acting is superb. Geoffrey Rush is lyrical almost poetic as Hans, he wants to be an oasis of sanity for Liesel n the insane world around him. Emily Watson is excellent, as the stern matriarch, who has layers of depth beneath that stern exterior. Sophie Nelisse s exceptional in an intricate role that demands her to play the role with the simplicity of a child but the emotional complexity of an adult. There are many great supporting performances to go along with the strong lead performances, just an outstanding ensemble cast.The direction is great, the cinematography is clear and picturesque the viewer really does feel like he is spending a winter in Germany. The scenes of Nazi atrocities come in short, sharp bursts, as if to increase the shock value of Kristallnacht or wearing the Jewish badge. These scenes are a sudden jolt to remind viewers, that yes this is Nazi Germany and yes people are being killed for their religious beliefs.Movies like The Book Thief need to continue to be made, we must never forget the horror that is the Holocaust.Fro more riveting reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,0,2,10 November 2014
Interstellar," Interstellar: Shoots for the stars.
","Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is an engineer by training, relegated to being a farmer because a blight has ravaged the country and the world and farmers are a necessity. Cooper and his daughter Murph (McKenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain, Ellen Burstyn) is led by gravitational anomalies, to a secret NASA installation, where a professor named Brand (Michael Caine) is working on a formula that makes interstellar travel possible. The same gravitational anomalies that brought Cooper and Murph to the NASA installation has opened up a wormhole and revealed three habitable planets in a galaxy that is suddenly within reach to a human population who desperately needs it. Are the gravitational anomalies naturally occurring, or is humankind being led by a heretofore undiscovered intelligence? Does Cooper accept the challenge of finding these new worlds and finding one habitable enough to colonize?There are so many themes explored in Interstellar, that it's difficult to encapsulate them all here. First and foremost, it's a character study, about what motivates man. Is it self-preservation, animated by dark motives, or is it selflessness motivated by love of self and others? The choice is up to mankind. The movie also infers environmental issues by visually recalling the Dust Bowl, there are parts of this movie that seem to use snippets of the Ken Burns documentary The Dust Bowl. There are issues of the government conscripting people, limiting their intellectual mobility, and whitewashing scientific accomplishments of the past. Why does NASA have to operate in secret in this society? That fact in itself speaks volumes. Overlaying all of this is the interplay of father and daughter, the sense of betrayal she feels. Betrayal is a huge theme in this movie explored through many characters in many situations. The story unfolds so beautifully and the science fiction elements are so interestingly intertwined in the film, and so thoughtfully explained that it enhances the movie greatly. The robots are humorous and one resembles and ambulatory monolith a tip of the cap to 2001: A Space Odyssey. I did have a problem with the ending, Chris Nolan does try to tie up some loose ends with the ending, but it strains credulity.The acting is top drawer. McConaughey continues a wonderful string of roles starting with Mud. He gives a nice understated urgency to his role. He leads by example and people are drawn to his leadership. Anne Hathaway turns in another powerhouse performance, with a complex character portrayal of Professor Brand's daughter, Amelia. She has issues of guilt, that her character has to deal with, not only is she not a damsel in distress, she acts heroically at points in the movie. Jessica Chastain plays another complex character, building on her strong roles in Zero Dark Thirty, Mama and The Debt. In this movie, her character has to overcome abandonment issues and pursue her natural love of science. Matt Damon has a small but interesting role, that is integral to the movie. I love his performance.The cinematography is amazing, even before the viewer gets to space. The space scenes are really reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, there are lot of silent scenes, in space and that reminded me of 2001, It's as visually astonishing as Gravity, and all done without green screen or CGI. The movie is nearly 3 hours, but the pacing is exquisite, I never looked at my watch, I just watched the multi- generational space epic unfold before me.For more out of this world reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,1,8,8 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim. Brimming with fun.
","For 10 years, the earth has been under attack by Kaiju, dinosaur like creatures that lived under the plates in the Pacific Rim, and came to the surface through what's called the beach, a portal between our two worlds. Mankind put their differences past them, and built jaegars, huge robots to fight the kaiju. The world got really good at fighting the kaiju, until the monsters evolved and started destroying the jaegars. Two of the best jaegar piliots are Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff) and his brother, Raleigh. (Charlie Hunnam) One day, during another wave of kaiju attacks, Yancy is killed, the public is starting to lose faith in the jaegars, and the latest idea is to build a wall to stop the kaiju, decommission the jaegers, send them to Hong Kong and send the commander of the jaegar program, Stacker Pentecost, (Idris Elba) into early retirement.But Pentecost has other ideas, it is months before they can finish the wall, and the kaiju seem to be penetrating the wall like a hot knife through butter, so Pentecost relies on what he knows best, the jaegar program. He wants Raleigh to control the jaegar, but Raleigh needs a co-pilot because the drift or melding of minds is too much for one brain. The best candidate is Mako Mori (Rinko Kakuchi) a girl Pentecost saved from a kaiju attack years before. Mako is traumatized by the attack she witnessed as a child, but can she bury those memories long enough to work with Raleigh? Will Pentecost stop being protective about Mako long enough to let her pilot the jaegar with Raleigh? Will Pentecost's plan work?I like Pacific Rim. I know, I know it's a cross between Godzilla and the Transformers, but there are lots of influences that shape this movie, it's part Godzilla, part Transformers, but I also see elements of movies like Avatar, Independence Day, the Matrix, and yes even Star Wars in this movie. So what makes this movie better than just a cheap rip off of other sci fi movies? It's the characters. Mako has to fight Raleigh in a martial arts duel before she can co-pilot the jaegar, Pentecost has fatherly feelings for Mako, there's a rivalry between two scientists, one who specializes in predicting the attacks, and the other who wants to learn about the keiju biology. There's also a smarmy guy who deals in selling parts of the dead keiju for profit. These are fun characters, and I enjoyed seeing them interact. If there is a drawback to the story it is that the movie is too long and indulges in too many special effects. It's also easy as a Star Trek episode to tell who the extras are, but that's a minor quibble.The acting makes this movie even better. Charlie Hunnam is good as the action hero Raleigh, brave yet sensitive because of the death of his brother. Rinko Kakuchi is also good as Mako, part sidekick, part love interest, though thankfully, the writers don't delve too deeply into the love interest portion of their characters but it's definitely hinted at. Idris Elba is good as part action hero being put out to pasture part father figure. Elba injects this character with a 'my way or the highway' attitude that definitely adds some dimension to the character. But it is Charlie Day and Ron Perlman who absolutely steal this movie and make it a pleasure to watch. Day revels in playing the fast- talking, combative biologist whose scientific curiosity is only superseded by his survival instinct. Ron Perlman happily wades into the swamp to find his character, complete with gold shoes that make him look like the neighborhood pimp.This is not writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's best film, that would be Pan's Labyrinth, but it may be his most entertaining film. I only wish he had cut the length and the special effects. Other than that, it's a damn good summer popcorn action flick.",7,1,2,11 May 2014
American Hustle," America Hustle: Bale et al. do the hustle in the 1970's.
","Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) runs a dry cleaner's store in the Bronx. Irving then branches out into making loans, where he doesn't loan any money but is guaranteed a non-refundable payment of 5,000 dollars. Irving also dabbles in selling forged art. Irving is basically a con man. He meets a woman named Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and the two all in love with each other. Sidney adopts an English accent and becomes Lady Edith, and they con more local businessmen of their money. One day, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) walks in to Irving's establishment and asks for a loan. Richie is really an FBI agent, looking to root out local corruption. He will let Irving and Lady Edith walk if they give him four corruption convictions. Irving gets Carl Elway (Shea Whigham) convicted, but DiMaso has his eyes on a much bigger target, the mayor of Camden New Jersey, Carmine Polito. (Jeremy Renner) Richie is planning on a scam to trap Polito using a fake Arab Sheik, Sheik Abdullah (Michael Pena) to provide one million dollars in funding to renovate Atlantic City, using Polito as an intermediary. Richie has a suitcase of money waiting to give Polito as a kickback, but Polito gets squeamish, and it's up to Irving to close the deal. Does he succeed? I like American Hustle, but it's largely because it does a good job approximating the 1970's and because of strong performances by Bale, Cooper, and Renner. For all the good in this movie, I've noticed a troubling trend. Movies are taking scandalous behavior and making it seem frivolous and lighthearted. ABSCAM was a serious scandal in the late 70's, many politicians went to jail for bribery, ABSCAM was another example of the dysfunction between government and the governed in the wake of Watergate. But writer/director David O. Russell chooses to fictionalize ABSCAM, and make it seem like the FBI is running amok and it portrays Polto as a hero. Russell uses the word entrapment several times in his script. Frankly, that is editorializing and that is something a fictional movie should never do. Russell trivialized mental illness in Silver Linings Playbook and that bothered me, now he trivializes political corruption,and that is too much, because now he is dealing with reality and not just a fictional story. Russell is not the only one who is guilty of this, Martin Scorsese does much the same in the Wolf of Wall Street.The acting by the male leads is superb. There are three aspects of the characterization of Irving that made it stand out. The first is the comb-over, Irving's comb over becomes a metaphor for the character. Irving goes to great lengths to hide that he's bald, just like Irving goes to great lengths to hide the fact that he's a con-man. In the end both the fact that he's bald and a con-man become glaringly obvious. Second is Bale's weight gain, call it method acting or whatever you want to call it, the weight gain was effective, it helped the viewer forget that this was Christian Bale, and put the focus back on the character. Third, Bale's Bronx accent was impeccable, it's a very easy accent to get wrong, and he nailed it, further adding to the believability of the character.Bradley Cooper continues his strong string of performances going back to Silver Linings Playbook. Cooper plays Richie as a megalomaniac, who puts his hair up in curlers to maintain a certain look. Richie's hair is also a key to understanding that character. He's vain and self-important and has delusions that he can root out corruption on a large scale. Jeremy Renner plays Carmine sympathetically, a little too sympathetically, the viewer actually believes that Carmine is working for the best interests of his town and his state. The female leads don't fare as well. Amy Adams has trouble switching between an American and British accents, and Jennifer Lawrence is too young to play such a mature and worldly character. Lawrence also has trouble with the New York accent.The direction is nothing outstanding, there are no iconic scenes or quick edits, but the pacing is good, the two hours and 18 minutes goes by quickly.For more movie reviews, hustle over to my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",6,0,2,12 January 2014
Man of Steel," Man of Steel (2013) Heavy Metal
","Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is a leading citizen on the planet of Krypton, and he is warning the political council in Krypton that they have depleted all the planet's natural resources, and that their continued mining of Kryton's core will lead to continued instability on the planet and probable implosion of the planet. Jor-El has had a son Kal-El (Henry Cavill) through natural childbirth, a long discredited means of birth on Krypton, and he wants to get his son off the doomed planet before it implodes.As the planet deteriorates, a power struggle ensues between himself and General Zod (Michael Shannon) Zod was bred to be a warrior, and he wants to dissolve the council and run Krypton as a quasi-emperor. Zod is also convinced that Jor-El is hiding a codex, that is, the genetic material of the babies of Krypton, Zod is convinced that Jor-El has the codex and is hiding the codex somewhere on the planet. Zod loses his power struggle and is sentenced to live his life in another dimension. Kal-El is sent safely to Earth as Krypton implodes.Kal-El's spaceship crashes into a farm in Kansas where the baby is raised by Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) and his wife Martha. (Diane Lane) Kal-El, renamed Clark Kent by his adoptive parents, has a rough time adjusting to life on earth. His powers are so acute, that he sees people as skeletons and hears people's thoughts. Only his mother's soothing voice calms him. Clark is bullied as a boy and as much as he wants to retaliate, his father urges restraint, telling his son that his powers are meant for far greater things.The young Clark drifts from job to job, one day working on an oil rig, the next day working as a waiter, but his first instinct is always to do good for the people of Earth. But still, he does not know who he is and where he came from. A young reporter from the Daily Planet named Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is tracking the elusive and mysterious Clark Kent around the country, and even writes a story about Clark that hints at his extraterrestrial origins. This story does not go over too well with Lois' editor, Perry White,(Lawrence Fishburne) who suspends her for 3 weeks. But Clark has bigger problems to worry about, a threat so large that it threatens not only him, but the entire planet. Can Kal El, fight his demons and save a planet whose people are at best dubious of his motives and at worst antagonistic towards him? Simply stated, Man of Steel is an outstanding movie. It is an outstanding movie, because it enhances the mythology around Superman. There is an entire backstory about Krypton, its political makeup, its social strata, the fact that they abolished natural childbirth intrigues me to no end, and the movie is filled with interesting factoids like this. The power struggle between Zod and Jor-El and the long running rivalry is also interesting.Then there's the sense of inner turmoil going on within Clark Kent, he struggles with his superpowers as a child, he is bullied but can't fight back, he needs to control and focus his superpowers, his mom helps him do that. This is amazing storytelling. Finally, there is the confused public reaction to Superman. Who is he? Where did he come from? Is he really here to help us? All of these story lines layered together, sometimes told with superb use of flashback, are worth the price of a ticket alone.But on top of the fantastic story, there is wonderful acting. Newcomer Henry Cavill gets off to a rocky start, and lets his British accent show early in the film, but then he literally finds his voice, and really finds the character, and does as superb job from that point forward. Cavil understands the angst of the character being an outcast, having one foot in one planet and one foot in another, and plays up the loner aspect of Clark with excellent results. Diane Lane is also excellent as Martha Kent, so gives a heartwarming and heart wrenching performance as Martha Kent. She is his emotional lifeline and she knows it. Michael Shannon gives a really complex performance as Zod. He's a bad guy, but his motives are not evil, in fact they might even be credible. And that's what makes his performance so well-rounded. Shannon plays Zod with a Caesar like zeal, which makes him charismatic and easy to see why he has followers.Russell Crowe gives his best performance since Gladiator or A Beautiful Mind. Jor-El is another complex character, his motives with the codex might not be completely selfless. Amy Adams gives another strong performance, an independent woman, who is also part damsel in distress, I would have preferred more of an independent woman, than damsel in distress, but that is a minor quibble Even Lawrence Fishburne in a relatively minor role is very good. Only Kevin Costner can't be saved by this movie, he is just a bad actor, wooden as the day is long.The direction is good, Zack Snyder has a tendency to over-indulge in special effects and that hurts some scenes, but he keeps the movie going at a good pace, and gets the most out of his actors. Kudus to Christopher Nolan, he is credited as a co-writer in this movie, but I can recognize his style throughout the movie, the attention to detail, the dark almost sinister backdrops, the overarching theme of the role of a superhero in society at large, and society's reaction to the superhero in their midst. These are all themes he expounded on in the Batman trilogy, and revisits here.For hundreds more movie reviews, check out my blog, reviewswithatude@wordpress.com",9,9,18,15 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Movie Review: Trouble With The Curve (2012) Don't Fall For This Pitch
","Gus (Clint Eastwood) is an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves, who is losing his eyesight from macular degeneration. Gus' daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams) is a lawyer, whose workaholic personality has her in line for a partnership at her law firm. Mickey tries to maintain a relationship with gruff old Gus, but he keeps his distance, just as she keeps her distance from perspective suitors. Gus has two months left on his contract as a scout, and the Braves ask him to go to North Carolina to scout a can't-miss prospect named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingil). The Red Sox have sent a scout, Johnny,(Justin Timberlake) to scout Bo. Johnny was a big-league pitcher until he ruined his arm. Now his last shot at glory is being a good scout which may lead to a job as an announcer. Mickey comes to North Carolina a few days later to help scout Bo with her ailing father. Johnny approaches the emotionally distant Mickey socially, but she seems disinterested. What does Gus think of the hot prospect? Does he resolve his issues with his estranged daughter?I found Trouble With The Curve disingenuous and insincere. When I think of my favorite baseball movies, Bull Durham and The Natural to name two, they seem to revel in baseball lore. Bull Durham contrasts the dreams of minor leaguers to make it to 'The Show' to the vision with a grizzled veteran, who's been to the big leagues and wants to go back, and does so with a lot of laughs. The Natural evokes an almost mystical vision of the mythic skills of a an aging veteran, just the histrionics of Roy Hobbs hitting a home run into the light tower and watching those lights exploding, the music, the magic bat, it all plays into the mythology of baseball, from farm boy to legend. Trouble With The Curve is just a series of clichés about baseball that are so obvious and so ham-handedly delivered, that it is obvious how the plot will unwind and how it will resolve itself.I like Clint Eastwood a lot as an actor and director, and have for a long time, but he's gone to the grumpy curmudgeon well once too often. I compare this movie unfavorably to Gran Torino, Eastwood plays the same grumpy old man character, but that character is a lot more unpredictable and the resolution of that plot is a lot more satisfying. One more thing, the idea that the short, overweight Bo Gentry would be on any scouting list is an insult to even a casual baseball fan.Amy Adams plays tough girl again, but this time the acting seems staged she is clearly uncomfortable with the baseball lingo, and she even seems uncomfortable with Eastwood. The romance with Timberlake does not work, and she has no chemistry at all with Timberlake. Timberlake is an awful actor, who has no natural cadence when he tries to act. The guy has a look on his face that says,' Look at me, I'm cool.' Trust me, his acting is not cool. The pacing is slow and the movie is long, and in the end, this movie is not worth the effort it takes to watch it.Trouble With The Curve.

The Intouchables," The Intouchables: Don't touch it with a ten foot pole
","Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a millionaire, who's also a paraplegic, paralyzed from the neck down from a parasailing accident. He interviews many qualified individuals to be his new caretaker, but then interviews Driss (Omar Sy) who is an ex-con, who is only interested in having Philippe sign a paper so he can receive public assistance. Philippe challenges Driss to work for him for a month, and then he will sign his assistance papers. Driss has never seen such opulence, he lives in a slum with his mother and many brothers and sisters. Driss decides to take the job, and performs admirably, he finds out that Philippe has a pen pal and encourages him to call her. Philippe in turn introduces Driss to fine art and classical music, everything is going along fine until Philippe notices that one of his prized Faberge eggs is missing, he accuses Driss of stealing it. Driss sets out to find the egg, does he find it? Does Philippe meet his mystery pen pal? I really enjoyed the first few scenes of the Intouchables, they were intelligent and funny. Unfortunately, things go straight downhill after that. This movie engages in some of the most pernicious stereotyping of any recent movie I've seen, black people are lazy, they steal, they only want public assistance, they smoke dope, they live in ghettos, and so on. I don't accept those stereotypes from American movies, why should I accept them from a French art-house movie? I find the whole attitude of this movie condescending and patronizing towards Driss, as if he can only learn about the finer things in life through the aid of a wealthy white benefactor. Driss is in literary terms a 'noble savage' a 19th century term to describe a man from another culture who can only be inculcated into 'civilized' society by someone else.This movie doesn't seem to realize that it's the 21st century. In the movie, Driss can't learn about the finer things in society by himself, that's too tall an order for this movie. Social mobility, don't even think about it. This movie manages to be chauvinistic as well, women are prostitutes and subservient playthings for both men. There is only one scene where Driss mother stands up to his aimless attitude, the other women are around simply for both men to seek pleasure. The writers take a subtle shot at gays too, and this is supposed to be a feel good movie? Are you feeling good yet? The movie is also very slow and has a syrupy sweet ending. The actors do what they can, but the writers sabotage this movie almost from the beginning. Francois Cluzet is OK, as the stodgy, cultured Philippe, Omar Sy Is funny and charming at times, but can't save a bad script.The Intouchables: Don't touch it with a ten foot pole.For hundreds more movie reviews, check out my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",3,15,42,5 August 2013

An average construction worker named Emmitt Brickowski (Chris Pratt) is so good at fitting in, and following all the rules, that he doesn't leave an impression on anyone.Emmitt is happy listening to his favorite song, 'Everything Is Awesome' and watching his favorite show, 'Where Are My Pants' both produced by the Octan corporation, whose CEO is President Business. He follows the blueprints to build everything, and is perfectly content to go on living the way he lives. Emmitt is at the construction site after hours, telling someone to leave because it's against the rules. All of a sudden, he realizes that the intruder is the most beautiful girl he's ever seen. Her name is Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and she's after the Piece of Resistance. While Emmitt is transfixed by Wildstyle the Piece of Resistance becomes permanently affixed to Emmitt, and he can't take it off. Now that Emmitt has the Piece of Resistance he becomes a target of President Business and his loyal foot soldier Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) President Business is planning to use the Kragle to immobilize the citizens of his realm on Taco Tuesday, because he is a rigid dictator. Can Emmitt evade Bad Cop and get the Piece of Resistance to the top of the Octan Tower before President Business uses the Kragle on his populace? Is Emmitt the Special? Does he fulfill the prophesy?This is a wonderful movie. The Everyman has a chance to rise to the occasion, and become the Special. That might be a hackneyed premise, it may even be borrowed from movies like Star Wars and The Matrix, but that's what makes this movie so endearing, it doesn't take itself too seriously at all. It's even subtly subversive, OK obviously subversive, anti-corporate and wackily anti-conformist. The Lego Movie does lose its focus a bit when it becomes solely about product placement when Emmitt zooms around the different playsets, but unlike Transformers (Similar toy, worse movies) The Lego Movie finds its footing, and has a satisfying ending, which is neither cloying nor saccharine, but heartfelt. More important than all the adult themes kids learn the importance of individuality, and also working together when necessary. Those themes may seem contradictory, but they are not in this movie.The voice talent is amazing in this movie. Chris Pratt plays Emmitt as a low key hero. Morgan Freeman is splendid, just hearing his golden voice as the prophet Vitruvius is worth the price of a rental. Will Ferrell redeems himself after a string of lousy movies, as the evil President Business, but there's more to his character than initially appears. Elizabeth Banks has a great voice, she conveys a sense of innocence, and yet her voice sounds sexy. Can I say she has a sexy voice in a movie aimed at kids? Well it's true. Will Arnett is hilarious as Batman, and Liam Neeson makes a nice comedic turn as Bad Cop. There are cameos by a few Star Wars stars, Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams add to the laughs, and professional voice actor Keith Ferguson does a pretty serviceable Harrison Ford impression as Han Solo. Shaquille O' Neal even shows up as himself. All the actors understood how much fun this movie was, and joined in the spirit of making a truly entertaining film.The pacing of this movie is more like an action film than an animated film, so the 1 hour 40 minute length goes by in a flash, rent it and watch it with your kids, or watch it with your friends, it's that funny.Want to build your knowledge of film?

Dallas Buyers Club," Dallas Buyers Club. Buy, buy, buy.
","Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) is a Dallas electrician, who gets the HIV virus in 1986, and he's given 30 days to live by the doctors, who treat him in a local clinic. Ron tries to get into an experimental trial for AZT, an experimental drug that treats HIV, but is rejected for the trial. Undaunted, Ron buys all the AZT he can on the black market, but his eyes are opened when he goes to Mexico, and is treated by Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne) who treats Ron with a cocktail of vitamins and drugs that the FDA hasn't approved yet. Ron gets the idea of going into business with a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto) who Ron met at the hospital. The business involved Ron smuggling illegal drugs from Mexico, and opening up the Dallas Buyers Club, which offered members drugs in exchange for a 400 dollar membership fee.The government learns of Ron's activities and soon the FDA, and IRS are trying to shut down the Dallas Buyer Club, but Ron is as tenacious as a man facing a death sentence can be. Ron sues the FDA, for access to these unapproved AIDS drugs. Does Ron win his lawsuit? How long does he live after only being given 30 days to live? This is a wonderful movie,not because everybody holds hands and sings Kum Bayah, but because it perfectly encapsulates the mood of people in the 1980's about AIDS. The mood in one word was a mood of fear. People were dying of an unknown disease, most commonly linked with gays, and everyone was afraid. The people who had AIDS didn't want to die, and would do anything to prevent from being a statistic, and the people who didn't have AIDS, didn't want it, and didn't want to associate with people who had AIDS. It also shows how Ron Woodruff, initially in denial, really did his research on HIV medications, and really tried to help others live. Thismovie is not perfect, there is a moment where it spouts statistics and sounds like an after school special, and the movie is a bit long overall. In the final analysis, Dallas Buyers Club rises above cliché because of the remarkable performances of McConaughey and Leto.McConaughey gives a powerhouse performance, he is unapologetically homophobic, and racist, but his pure survival instinct forces him to associate with gays and others that he probably wouldn't associate with in order to live another day. He never quite loses his taste for bad habits, drug use, prostitutes, and that makes his character all the more real. Leto is a perfect counterpoint to McConaughey, kind and gentle, even giving MConaughey's character a leg massage when his calf gets cramps. There is a heartbreaking scene featuring Leto, I will not give it away but it is his best scene in the movie. They both deserved their Oscars. Jennifer Garner was pretty good, I wouldn't say she held her own, but she wasn't bad, and even had a memorable scene of her own.The story is a bit long, the pacing is a bit slow at times, but those are minor flaws, in a very good film.To join an exclusive club, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",9,1,1,13 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-men Days of Future Past. Happy Days, indeed.
","The future is bleak for mutants and the humans who help them. Robots, named sentinels are hunting down mutants to the point of extinction. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) are holed up in a bunker with the last few surviving mutants. They decide to send Logan (Hugh Jackman) back to 1973, with the help of Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) who has the ability to teleport people's consciousness back in time. Logan is chosen because his mind is the only mind strong enough to withstand the process.Logan must go back to 1973 to convince Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) not to shoot the inventor of the sentinels, Dr. Bolivar Trask. (Peter Dinklage) He must also find and reunite the younger Xavier (James McAvoy) and Eric (Michael Fassbender) and convince them to work together to bring Raven back from the precipice of being an assassin. With the help of Peter/Quicksilver, (Even Peters) Logan breaks Eric out of a prison in the Pentagon. Xavier meanwhile has become somewhat of a recluse, living in his school for mutants, which is now in disrepair, with Hank/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Hank has cured Xavier's paralysis, but the serum he uses, robs Xavier of his mental acuity. Moreover, Xavier doesn't want anything to do with his powers anymore, he blames his powers, and Eric for losing Raven, and causing his paralysis. Can Logan convince these former friends, now rivals to bury the hatchet, find Raven, and convince her not to kill Dr. Trask? Or do Xavier and Eric's doubts about themselves and human beings overwhelm them?I love this movie. There are simply not enough superlatives to tell you how good this movie is. It integrates the best of the first series of X-Men movies with the best of the reboot. The sentinels do remind me a bit of the robots from the Terminator movies, and there is the usual time travel caveat about changing the future, but this time they want to change the future. There's also a good bit of historical fiction about the Vietnam War, the Kennedy assassination and the Nixon administration, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Nixon is a villain in this movie, and that will either enrage you or delight you depending on your political views. This kind of historical fiction was tried in the movie The Watchmen, but I found that history muddled and incomprehensible, the flashbacks to the 70's was a loving, nostalgic look at an era I look back on with fondness. Days of Future Past is also disarmingly funny, the script had me laughing out loud at times. Other than Nolan's Dark Knight movies, this is the best superhero film I've seen in a very long time.What can I say about the acting? It is first rate. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan bring the same heft and gravitas to these characters that made me love them in the first place. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are put in a tough position, being in the same movie playing the same characters as these iconic actors, but they not only hold their own, but make the characters their own. Michel Fassbender is becoming a great actor in his own right, it's getting to the point where I could watch him in any movie he makes. Hugh Jackman has played Logan/Wolverine in at least seven movies now, and I can't imagine anyone else playing him, he is Wolverine. Nicholas Hoult is good as Beast, Xavier's right hand man, Ellen Page brings some Inception style earnestness to her role. Evan Peters is very funny as Quicksilver, and Peter Dinklage gives a standout performance as the evil Dr. Trask. The only fly in the ointment was Jenner Lawrence, she actually made me realize how good Rebecca Romiijn was as Raven, she was much more edgy and mature. Jennifer Lawrence seems like she's trying really hard to be edgy, but doesn't quite make it. I think she is too young for this role, not to mention her role in American Hustle.The direction is good, fast paced and action packed, the 2 hours and 10 minutes flew by. The 3D effects, didn't really add much I'm sorry to say. There is violence and nudity, so don't bring the young kids, they won't like seeing Hugh Jackman's bare posterior as much as their mothers might.For more X-cellent movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,1,2,24 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Still draggin' along
","Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is continuing his trek to Lonely Mountain, accompanying Bilbo are the 13 elves, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) the wizard, and Thorin (Richard Armitage) the King of the dwarfs. Once they find the mountain, they have to use the Key of Thorin to open a door carved into the Lonely Mountain. He must also find the Arkenstone, the royal gem of Erebor, and take on Smaug, the dragon. And he must do all this before sunset on Durin's Day. Before he gets to Lonely Mountain, there are many obstacles in Bilbo's way. He seeks refuge with Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) and then has to fight giant spiders in Mirkwood Forest. They escape the spiders only to be arrested by the Elvin King, Thanduil. (Lee Price) Bilbo and company escapes the Elvin prison in barrels only to run into a band of Orcs. The attack is repelled by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly)Meanwhile, Gandalf has split from the group with Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) to find the Necromacer, also known as Sauron. Before getting to Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarfs must go through the burgh of Laketown with the help of Bard, (Luke Evans) to get weapons. Thorin also tries to negotiate the return of Laketown to the dwarfs, Thorin promises to share the gold from Lonely Mountain with the people of Laketown. They accept Thorin's proposal. By the time Bilbo and the dwarfs gets to Lonely Mountain, the sun is setting, and they cannot find the keyhole. Bilbo has the ring which gives him invisibility, but will he get a chance to use it against Smaug? Does Gandalf find Sauron?The last 40 minutes if the Desolation of Smaug is well worth watching. The chemistry between Freeman and Cumberbatch crackles with tension. Getting to that last 40 minutes, however is a long, hard slog. Peter Jackson has again taken a simple story, and made it a bloated, unrecognizable mess. He could have scaled back on Legolas and Tauriel, he could have scaled back on Laketown and skipped the love triangle between Legolas, Tauriel and Kili altogether, but all the minutia was there. I haven't read the Hobbit or any other Tolkien, but all the minutia made for dull watching. The problem is, every sci-fi movie since Star Wars has to be an epic trilogy, the Lord of the Rings was an epic trilogy, so the movie makers, for purely pecuniary reasons, made the Hobbit a trilogy, and it's the audience who suffers. The Hobbit movies also suffer by comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy which was a rich tapestry of story and characters, which built to an incredible climax, the Hobbit will never match the magic of the Lord of the Rings movies.The acting is fine, especially by Cumberbatch, Freeman, and Ian McKellen. The movie is best when the three are on screen. When the movie shifts away from the three characters they play, the movie suffers. Evangeline Lilly and Orlando Bloom do their best, but their storyline just didn't interest me. Richard Armitage is pretty forgettable as Thorin.The pacing is very slow at points, and I noticed that the landscapes, which were pretty spectacular in the first Hobbit movie, were somewhat ordinary, the CGI budget seemed mostly to be poured into the talking spiders, and Smaug, and I must say, Smaug is a special effects marvel, but still not spectacular enough to maintain a 2 hour and 20 minute movie.For more fire-breathing reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",5,4,5,3 September 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel: Check in, and check it out.
","In 1932, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is a concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Gustave takes a young lobby boy named Zero (Tony Revolori) under his wing and trains him to be a more professional lobby boy. Gustave has a proclivity for dating older women. One of the older women he's dating, Madame D (Tilda Swinton) ends up dead. Madame D leaves Gustave a priceless painting, Called Boy With Apple and Madame D's son, Dimitri (Adrien Brody) suspects Gustave of murder. Moreover, Dimitri produces a witness produces a witness named Serge X (Mathieu Amalric) who implicates Gustave in the murder. Gustave is imprisoned by police officer Henkels, (Edward Norton) but breaks out of prison with the help of Zero and his girlfriend, Agatha. (Saoirse Ronan) The fugitive Gustave is hunted not only by Henkels, but also by Joplin (Willem Dafoe) a hit-man hired by Dimitri.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a very intricate movie, the viewer must follow the story very closely to fully appreciate the humor and pathos of the movie. Some of the comedy is broadly absurd, some more subtle. Underneath all the humor this is a story about the relationship between Zero and Gustave which starts out as a mentor mentee relationship, and evolves into a close friendship. The dialogue is typical Wes Anderson, stilted sentences, deadpan delivery, and a new wrinkle a lot of cursing for comedic effect. I've seen a lot Wes Anderson films, some I've liked, others not, but this and Moonrise Kingdom are two of his best.Anderson is a very visual director, every frame of this movie is infused with bright, vibrant colors, which is a hallmark of all his films and make his films stand out in comparison to other films. The animated exteriors add to the whimsical, ethereal nature of the film. Anderson has done animated exteriors before in movies like the Life Aquatic, but not to this extent.The acting is superb, led by Ralph Fiennes, who is hilarious as Gustave the concierge. He often waxes poetic in the movie only to be interrupted by more urgent circumstances. Fiennes shows a lot of range in his relationship with Zero, he is almost a surrogate father to the young immigrant. Adrien Brody is as lively as I've seen him in as Dimitri, Madame D's greedy cutthroat son. Edward Norton is good too, as a Keystone Cop type trying to find the truth of what happened to Madame D. Saoirse Ronan and Tony Revolori are really convincing as young lovers, falling in love in the middle of this madness, and trying to keep their love alive. F Murray Abraham is excellent as the adult Zero, and makes a great narrator. There are also many fine actors in smaller roles, Tilda Swinton as Madame D, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Tom Wilkenson, and more all contribute to a very enjoyable film.For more grand movie reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,5,8,20 July 2014
Gone Girl," Gone Girl: Girl Gone Wild.
","When Nick Dunne (Ben AffflecK) meets Amy Oliver (Rosamund Pike) at a New York City party, the attraction is instantaneous. She is smart, witty, and beautiful. Nick is handsome, and funny in his own right. Amy is the successful writer of the Amazing Amy series of books, and has a trust fund. Nick writes for a men's magazine, the future looks golden for both of them. They get married, it starts out well, but in five years, the magic is gone. Amy is writing quizzes for a women's magazine Nick is unemployed, the trust fund money is gone, and they have moved from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's mom, who later dies of cancer. Nick opens a bar with his sister Margo (Carrie Coon) the bar is losing money. On their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears. Nick is immediately suspected, but did he actually kill Amy?I did not like the book, and I do not like the movie Gone Girl. There is a reveal in both book and movie. After the reveal, both book and movie grind to a slow and painful stop. It's supposed to be an indictment of the reality show, feeding frenzy court TV mentality, every time there is a murder of the century in America or worldwide. But this is more a parody of the American realty TV culture than it is a serious indictment. There are many clichés in this movie, I won't bother to name them, but even the characters fall into cliché territory. The Tanner Bolt character is Johnnie Cochran, the Ellen Abbott character is Nancy Grace. The tone of the story is inconsistent, is it a suspense movie, or is it a dark comedy? What I like least about this story is that it savages both lead characters, if neither character is sympathetic, the viewer stops caring about either of them, and that's exactly what happened here. I will lay all the plot flaws at the feet of author and screenwriter Gillian Flynn, who created a carbon copy of her book with the screenplay. A better, more satirical version of this movie is To Die For, with Nicole Kidman. Watch that instead.The acting is not bad. I don't like Ben Affleck, when Tyler Perry, playing his lawyer, gave him a direction not to be so wooden, it is ironically funny. But Ben uses what I dislike about him most, the glib, smug, pretty boy to good effect here to play a pretty despicable character. Rosamund Pike is very good at maintaining a cool and calm exterior while constantly thinking to stay one step of the collapsing situation around her. She makes her character almost believable, and that is saying something. Tyler Perry also does a pretty good job of playing a cartoonish character. Neil Patrick Harris does not fare as well playing Desi Collings another poorly written character.Part of the responsibility of the profoundly poor quality of this film resides with the director David Fincher. Fincher has directed some really good films, like the Social Network and the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but this is not an epic story, and does not require a 2 ½ hour running time. Fincher could have easily edited the running time by a half hour or 45 minutes and not lost the essence of the story, but he did not, and so the story drags.Fincher also gave the film a dark look trying to make it feel more sinister, but maybe because of the gallows humor or because I knew the story from the book, the movie never felt sinister to me.Before your movie ticket money is Gone girl (or guy) check out my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",3,38,74,15 October 2014
Frozen," Frozen: It will melt your heart.
","Elsa (Eva Bella, Idina Menzel) is the future queen of Arendelle, a fictional Scandinavian kingdom. Elsa has the power to turn everything into ice. She freezes her sister Anna's (Libby Steubenrauch) head as a child, and almost kills her. Anna is saved by a troll, who also removes all memories of Elsa's special power. Elsa's parents lock Elsa in her room for reasons Anna no longer understands, and Elsa becomes afraid of her powers and feels like she has to hide them, and hide herself, which causes Elsa a lot of stress. At her coronation, all the doors of the castle are thrown open and Elsa has been made queen, but Anna has news over her own, she is going to marry Prince Hans. (Santino Fortana) This announcement is too much for Elsa, doesn't want anyone else to find out her secret, Elsa also feels that Anna is rushing into a marriage, when she doesn't really understand. Under duress, Elsa can't control her powers and turns Arendelle into a place with a perpetual winter. Unable to cope with the results of her unfettered powers, Elsa runs off to North Mountain and builds a castle from ice. Anna is convinced that she can bring Elsa back from the North Mountain and stop the perpetual winter plaguing Arendelle. With the help of a mountaineer named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and a magical snowman named Olaf, (Josh Gad) who Elsa created as a child, Anna tries to convince Elsa that she belongs in Arendelle. But when Anna gets to the castle, Elsa freezes her heart, and only an act of true love can save Anna.Sure, Frozen is a kids movie, there are adorable characters like the trolls (reminiscent of the seven dwarfs) and a snowman called Olaf, but behind the cuteness is a complex story about the meaning of true love, and a pair of self-sufficient princesses, one who uses her powers to defend herself, and one who saves Kristoff from falling down the mountain. The question of what is true love resolves itself in an unexpected way, which reflects the increased sensitivity of Disney writers to the roles of women in today's society. That's a lot of ground for a kids' movie to cover, but Frozen deftly adds touches of humor and music to make it entertaining for both kids and adults alike. The music is outstanding and sets the mood for many scenes as well as propelling the story forward. The animation is amazing, which is the Disney standard, the animation is filled with beauty, the Aurora Borealis is a series of dreamy streaks in the sky, the ice castle is a palace of shimmering beauty.The acting is superb, Idina Menzel, previously only known as a Broadway star, rocketed to fame as the singer of the Academy Award winning song, 'Let It Go.' She has become a household name because of this movie (to everyone except John Travolta) and her fame is well deserved. Her voice soars in 'Let it Go' and the song is the standout of a very good soundtrack. Menzel also handles a very tough role adroitly, she is the Ice Princess literally and figuratively, she is emotionally detached from her sister, because she thinks that will protect her. Kristen Bell deserves a lot of credit for her under-appreciated role of Anna, she is carefree and loving, and the emotional center of this movie. Bell plays her perfectly, and she also has a superb voice. Jonathan Groff beautifully underplays Kristoff, Josh Gad is full of joy as Olaf, the snowman who ironically loves summer.The movie is a long one, but the pacing is handled so well that the movie never drags. Stunning animation makes the movie visually appealing, and a captivating story will leave everyone happy.For more heartwarming reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",10,8,14,12 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of The Galaxy: Spoiled Milk-y Way.
","Soon after losing his mother to cancer, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is transported from Earth by Yondu Udonta. (Michael Rocker) Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Peter steals an orb which is valued at 4 billion units and intends to sell it on the planet Xandar. Ronan (Lee Price) wants the orbs to threaten extinction to the planet Xandar. Ronan sends an assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to Xandar to retrieve the orb. Two bounty hunters named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) are sent by Yondu to capture Peter, and take the orb for himself. Drax (Dave Buatista) a prisoner on Xandar wants to kill Gamora, because Ronan killed his wife and daughter. Peter proposes to take the orb to the collector (Benicio Del Toro) and split the proceeds five ways. Does Peter keep the orb away from Yondu and Ronan? Do the others team up with Peter? Does Ronan get the orb and destroy Xandar?This could have been a really good movie but the story is too muddled, there are too many characters, too many worlds and outposts, which further adds to the confusion. Also, the movie can't decide if it wants to make the audience laugh or shed a tear. The opening scenes depict young Peter losing his mother to cancer, and then he's abducted for a laugh filled space adventure. This movie is trying to have it both ways, be a light-hearted action adventure, and a sentimental drama, but it can't do both, and it doesn't do both well. The characters are paper thin, and instead of using the 2 plus hours of the movie to develop the characters, Hollywood uses its favorite filler, fight scenes and explosions to fill in any slow spots in the movie. Ultimately the movie makes no sense , in 1988 humanoids are supposed to have mastered the extraordinary skills to achieve intergalactic space travel. In 26 years, space flight becomes as easy as taking a bus. Ludicrous. Somewhere Stan Lee is smiling, because even the comics that no one has heard of are making him tons of money.The acting and chemistry between the cast is just good enough to make some of this movie enjoyable, although if you're looking for great acting from the likes of Vin Diesel and ex-wrestler Dave Bautista, you're probably hoping for too much. Chris Pratt is good enough as an unlikely hero, he won't make anyone forget Harrison Ford, he was better in the Lego Movie. Bradley Cooper overdoes the non-distinct New York City mobster accent. He may not be as good an actor as I thought. Vin Diesel's one line of dialogue is both a godsend and a running gag that goes on too long. Dave Bautista is a good actor for a wrestler, or is he a good wrestler for an actor? It matters not. Zoe Saldana is funny as both foil and romantic interest for Pratt's character, and she handles the action scenes well. It's somewhat disconcerting to see a beautiful woman like Saldana covered in face and body paint, from the looks of the box office, she'll be making two more of these movies and two more Avatar movies where she's covered in blue paint for a change. If the Avatar movies ever come out, that is. Between this movie, Avatar and Star Trek, she risks being the poster girl for nerds worldwide. I just hope Saldana doesn't get typecast. This movie suffers from too much hype, both from fans and critics, it is not the funniest movie in the world, it is certainly not profound even when it tries a serious tone. It is an ordinary movie that somehow got great reviews and word of mouth. Take my word for it, don't believe the hype, if you must watch it, rent it. The 3D is not worth it, for the most part.If you want to guard against over-hyped fluff, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",5,4,10,30 August 2014
Mama," Mama: Not the mother of all horror movies, but pretty good.
","Lucas (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) is the uncle of two nieces, the older one, Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and the younger, Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) have been abandoned in a cabin for five years. The girls get psychological help from Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) and a battle for custody begins, between Lucas and the girls aunt Jean. (Jane Moffat) Lucas is unmarried, and his girlfriend, Anabel (Jessica Chastain) plays bass. Remarkably, Lucas and Anabel gain custody of the girls, and Dr. Dreyfuss continues his treatment of the girls. The doctor finds out from Victoria that a woman named Mama helped the girls survive during their five year ordeal, but the psychologist thinks that Mama was a coping mechanism.Meanwhile Lucas is hospitalized after falling down the stairs, and that leaves Anabel alone in the house with the girls. Then Anabel starts hearing noises in the house. Is Mama a coping mechanism for two abandoned children? Or something else entirely? The premise of this movie starts out a little shaky, young children abandoned in a cabin for five years. Kids abandoned for five years would be dead, and there are standard horror conventions, spooky cabin, suburban house, strange noises, and the movie seems to telegraph its punches, I knew when the horror was coming and that made it less scary. But the story held my interest, at least until the reveal, partially because children telling a scary story is always more scary than adults telling a scary story.The ending is somewhat corny, but overall, it was a pretty good movie.What made me like this movie so much? Jessica Chastain was excellent in in a really different role for her, she was a rock n' roll chick in this film, complete with tats, very different from Zero Dark Thirty or The Debt. Yet, gradually when she meets these girls, she becomes incredibly materialistic, and seeks to protect these girls from whatever is bothering them. The transformation was very believable. The little girls are incredibly creepy, especially the younger one, and that adds to the suspense. Daniel Kash kept me guessing as the psychologist, it was a really interesting performance. So here is a case where strong performances overcome a somewhat weak and predictable story.Mama didn't raise no fool.

Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher: A big reach for Cruise.
","Six people are shot in the Pittsburgh area. Police Officer Emerson (David Oyelowo) finds incriminating evidence and arrests a man named Barr. (Joseph Sikora) Barr asks for a man named Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) to investigate the crime, even though he has a defense attorney, Helen Rodin. (Rosamund Pike) Reacher is an ex-military police officer, who knows all about Barr. Barr was a sniper in Iraq, who shot three contractors, and got off on a technicality. Reacher thinks Barr is a nut, and wants to make sure that there's enough evidence to put Barr away for life this time, but when he's done investigating, does the evidence still point to Barr? This movie has a good premise, but it's executed badly. Five minutes into the movie, the viewer knows exactly who the murderer is, and then there are a lot of unnecessary scenes, Tom Cruise acting cool with a girl much too young to be flirting with him, a fight scene where Cruise demolishes five people by himself in no time. Tom Cruise shirtless, showing his overly sculpted six-pack, Tom Cruise driving a souped-up car a la Steve McQueen in Bulitt complete with roaring engines, Tom Cruise putting three bullets in the innermost circle while target shooting, and finally Cruise's weird soliloquy about freedom, all designed to illustrate that Tom Cruise is the perfect action hero in a movie produced by Tom Cruise. At least he doesn't run in this movie, like he does in most of his action movies, Cruise is trying to reproduce A Few Good Men, but A Few Good Men is much more cerebral than this testosterone filled fare. There is a twist and a conspiracy in this movie, but that makes the movie worse,not better.The acting is disappointing. Cruise starts the movie mildly interesting as the anti-hero Jack Reacher, but gets more wooden as the movie gets more predictable. Rosamund Pike looks like she's had multiple Botox injection. She has a surprised look frozen on her face, maybe she's shocked to be in an increasingly poorly made film, with a fading box office star. Robert Duvall is completely wasted as a gun-toting NRA poster of a character. It's sad to see a great actor take roles like this role.The direction is unremarkable, and the writing is standard action hero drivel.For reviews to get jacked up on, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",2,0,4,19 January 2014

Always wary of the omnipresent Javert, Valjean pays off the owners of the inn where Fantine leaves Cosette, Thenardier (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Madame Thenardier (Helena Bonham Carter) and takes care of Cosette while still on the run from Javert. Years later, Cosette meets Marius (Eddie Redmayne) who after an argument with his grandfather takes up the Revolutionary cause. Marius and Cosette fall in love immediately, but Eponine (Samantha Barks) also loves Marius, and is jealous of Cosette. Further complicating matters, Javert is still pursuing Valjean. Does Valjean ever escape Javert? How does the love triangle between Marius, Cosette and Eponine resolve itself? How does the French Revolution affect these people's lives? When I first sat down to watch Les Miserables, I didn't think I'd like it much less deem it a classic. It's a musical and I'm not too keen on musicals from Broadway. In addition, the movie is set in French Revolutionary times, I thought I was in for a snoozefest. I was entirely mistaken, this is an enthralling, engrossing, captivating film, that draws viewers in from the first minute and keeps them engaged throughout. The songs, which I thought would be a weakness, turned out to be the strongest part of the movie and even aided in the exposition of the story. The movie dealt with the poor, hungry masses of France in a compassionate tender way, and blended their fates with the fate of the French Revolution in a beautiful, seamless way. Les Miserables doesn't try to force tears, it just tells a story and lets the emotion come naturally.This is the role Hugh Jackman was born to play, and all this time, I thought it was Wolverine. Jackman's acting was as good as his singing. Russell Crowe was also very good acting and singing his lines. Anne Hathaway was wonderful in a small role as Fantine, and yes she can really sing.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add some much needed comedy relief, and Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks are actors who I've barely heard of. I saw Redmayne in My Week With Marilyn, a very good film, but had no idea he could sing. I didn't know Barks at all, and she had a heartbreaking, scene stealing performance. The writing is superb, I'm sure it's difficult to take a 2000 page book by Victor Hugo and turn it into something that translates to the screen, but the story was told simply and effectively. The direction was superb, sometimes, there is nothing that catches my eye about the direction in movies but, this movie was different, there were all kind of crazy angles and shots, and France looked like a picture postcard, although I suspect some of that was CGI. I hope it was not most. Watch this movie, with someone who means a lot to you, you will both enjoy it.Les Miserables.

In Time," In Time: Time's up on Timberlake's acting career.
","In the future, time is the new currency. People live to the age of 25, and then get to live one more year. The rich keep decades and centuries in time banks, while the poor pay more time for less goods and have to scramble to live longer than 25. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a poor young man from Dayton, who has struggled, to live to age 28. His mother, Rachel (Olivia Wilde) has somehow lived to 50, but she is running out of time. Will, down to his last day, meets a rich man named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who doesn't want to live anymore. Henry gives Will a century of time, and timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) immediately suspects Will of robbing Henry and killing him. At the same time, Rachel gives all her time to Weis Time Lending to pay her debts. She doesn't have enough time to buy a bus ride home and dies on the street.Will escapes to New Greenwich , bastion of the rich, to seek revenge from Philippe Weiss (Vincent Kartheiser )for his mother's death. Will kidnaps Philippe's daughter, Sylvia, (Amanda Seyfried) in hopes to get more time from Philippe, but the two fall in love. Will is now being followed by Philippe's goons and Timekeeper Leon. Does he live long enough to find happiness with Sylvia? Sometimes it's fun to review a bad movie, a movie so bad it's good. This is not one of those times. I like dystopian movies and books, but not this one. The plot is unintelligible for the first fifteen minutes, it's as if the plot didn't matter, the producers had what they thought was a cool sci-fi concept and hip young stars, who needs a plot? Here's how dumb this movie is, Olivia Wilde plays Justin Timberlake's MOTHER. Are you kidding me? And they rob from other movies relentlessly. They borrow the star-crossed lovers bit from Romeo and Juliet, they steal several scenes from James Bond movies, and they rehash the one percent versus 99 percent theme that has already become overused.The acting is horrid. Justin Timberlake as an actor, is a good singer. Maybe he should sing his lines. When Timberlake starts to cry, I start to cry, not because it's sincere and heartfelt, but because I want him to stop trying to act. It's like he's reading his lines off a cue card, dry, emotionless, monotone delivery. Why does he keep getting offered these roles? And frankly, Amanda Seyfried was worse, after what I thought was a promising start to her career in Mamma Mia, she's made some real stinkers, like Chloe, Jennifer's Body, Letters to Juliet, Red Riding Hood, and now In Time. She was underwhelming in a great film, Les Miserables, so my opinion of her has slipped mightily. What is Cillian Murphy doing in this movie, after making the really good Red Eye, appearing in two Batman movies and Inception, he should know better. The smartest actor in this movie is Olivia Wilde, she dies about 20 minutes in, not that her acting could have helped this movie be any better.Andrew Niccol wrote this movie, he's written such great movies like The Truman Show and Gattica, but this movie is insipid and strains credulity. He also wrote The Host, so his talent seems to be escaping him.For more timely reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",1,0,2,13 September 2013
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years A Slave. A movie for the ages.
","Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man living in upstate New York with his wife and two kids in 1841. Solomon is tricked by two slave catchers, named Brown (Scoot McNairy) and Hamilton, (Teran Killam) who tell Solomon they are with the circus, but really ply him with liquor and sell him into slavery to the plantation of Ford, (Benedict Cumberbatch) who also buys a slave woman named Eliza (Adepero Oduye), but Ford cannot buy Eliza's kids. Ford is a relatively good hearted person, but that does not spare Solomon from cruel treatment from one of the field bosses named Tibeats (Paul Dano) who tries to hang Solomon and leaves him hanging there until Ford cuts him down. If things are not bad enough with Ford, Solomon, now given the name Platt, is sent to the cruel and sadistic slave owner Edwin Epps. (Michael Fassbender) Epps thinks of his slaves as his property, and will do anything to bend their actions to his will; Epps literally wants them to dance when he plays a tune. Epps does not like Platt, and makes it his job to break him. Epps does have a fondness for Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) and Mrs. Epps (Sarah Paulson) sees how much attention Patsey is getting from her husband, she shows her displeasure by throwing a whiskey decanter at her head. When Mr. Epps sees Solomon talking to Patsey, he whips Solomon and tells Patsey to stay away from him. When Patsey goes to another plantation for a bar of soap, Epps orders Solomon to whip her, and then viciously whips Patsey himself. Patsey is also repeatedly raped by Mr. Epps, and she can take no more.Patsey begs Solomon to kill her, he steadfastly refuses. Instead Solomon a man named Armsby (Garrett Dillhunt) a man on Epps plantation, who seems to be sympathetic to Solomon's plight, to deliver a letter to some abolitionists up North, who know that Solomon is a free man. Instead Armsby tells Epps of Solomon's plan, and Epps burns the letter. Later, a Canadian named Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) shows up to Epps' plantation and Solomon asks Bass to deliver a similar letter to the one that he asked Armsby to deliver. Does Bass do it? Or does he doublecross Solomon, as Armsby had done? This is a brutally violent movie, but it is also brutally honest. I usually don't care for historical dramas about slavery or segregation from Hollywood, because they tend to change the history to fit whatever end they're trying to put forth, or they try to sugarcoat the experience of slavery or segregation in some kind of revisionist feel- good way. If you don't know what I mean, please see The Help. I know the character of Solomon Northup existed because he published a biography contemporaneously to his kidnapping, and this movie does not sugarcoat his life.The writing by John Ridley is poignant and heartbreaking. Even when Solomon is not being whipped or beaten, the fear of slavery and its attendant pain follows him around like a constant shadow. He bears the pain of Eliza, who weeps constantly at the loss of her children, he is asked by Patsey to kill her, she prefers death to being even a favored slave. Solomon sees hangings of runaway slaves all too routinely. The stories of Solomon, Eliza and Patsey are intertwined and so the viewer,not only cares about Solomon, but the ladies as well.The direction by Steve McQueen is truly noteworthy. Almost from the first scene the film envelops the viewer. In that first scene the camera is at eye level and wading through the sugar cane fields of Louisiana. To illustrate the voyage down South McQueen focuses on the paddle wheel of the riverboat, and when the wheel fills the whole screen, the scene is over. That is captivating camera work. There is one scene that stood out in the movie, however. When Solomon is hanging on the tree, put there by Tibbeats, the other slaves go on with their business, seemingly oblivious to the man literally hanging in their midst, until one slave woman gives him a glass of water and meekly scurries away. They are so afraid of the master's retribution that they dare not cut Solomon down. And McQueen lets that scene play out for an excruciatingly long time. That is great filmmaking. If you don't know this Steve McQueen, watch Hunger, about the hunger strike initiated by Bobby Sands in Northern Ireland.The acting is top notch. Fassbender is a raving dog one minute, and calmly ordering everyone to dance the next, he knows he can make these slaves do anything, they are toys to him, puppets. It is that controlled rage that makes his performance so interesting to watch, he will be nominated for Best Actor, Chiwetel Egiofor gives a stunning performance as Solomon, he can hardly believe what happened to him, and now he's got to outwit his masters and stay alive, at a time when his life was worth nothing more than the amount of cotton he can pick. He should be nominated for Best Actor as well. The women in this film are phenomenal as well Adepero Oduye is outstanding as Eliza, she conveys the pain of separation from her two children about as well as anyone I've seen. Lupita Nyong'o gives a heart-stopping performance as Patsey, this is her debut film. And Sarah Paulson is also outstanding as the stern, domineering Mistress Epps. All three of them deserve nominations. Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti are also very good, the only laggard in the bunch is Brad Pitt, who plays a boring character in a predictable way. Mr. Pitt, I appreciate the money you put forth and the skill you used to get this movie made, but please resist the temptation of casting yourself in the movies you produce.For more epic reviews, visit my blog: reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",10,10,21,2 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf Of Wall Street. A great movie, a bit long in the tooth.
","At age 22, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DeCaprio) gets a plum job with a prestigious brokerage. He is taught the ropes of being a successful broker by Mark Hanna. (Matthew McConaughey) Hanna's advice to Jordan, take a lot of drugs, pleasure yourself twice a day and separate your client's cash from your client. As soon as Jordan gets his series 7 license, black Monday occurs on October 19th 1987, and Jordan finds himself out of a job. He works for a while in a small brokerage on Long Island, where he sells penny stocks to unsuspecting clients , making 50% commission. A friend, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) is so impressed with Jordan's take home pay that he quits his job to become a broker. It is then that Jordan starts Stratton Oakmont in an abandoned auto garage. He staffs Stratton with old friends from the neighborhood, most of them small time drug dealers. Nicky Koskof (PJ Byrne) nicknamed Rugrat, because of his bad hairpiece, Chester Ming, (Kenneth Choi) Robbie Feinberg,(Brian Sacca) and Alden Kupferberg (Henry Zebrowski) join Jordan and Donnie at Stratton, and by promising to sell blue chip stocks and really selling lousy penny stocks, Jordan and his cohorts rake in lots of money.Jordan agrees to speak to Forbes magazine for what he thinks is a puff piece, the Forbes reporter nicknames him the Wolf Of Wall Street. Not only doesn't this hurt his reputation, lots of newly minted brokers want to work for Stratton. Jordan realizes that the next big step for the brokerage is to sell an IPO, initial public offering of a newly formed company. Donnie is friends with Steve Madden, (Jake Hoffman) woman's shoe designer who wants to take his company public. Stratton Oakmont takes the company public, and Jordan puts 85% of Steve Madden stock under his control, which is illegal. By this time both the SEC and FBI are investigating Stratton Oakmont for shady securities practices. As Jordan's professional life deteriorates, his personal life is in similar disarray. Jordan has already divorced his first wife, and is having difficulties with his second wife, Naomi (Margot Robbie) because of Jordan's predilection for hookers. Jordan and Donnie also snort massive amounts of cocaine and take Quaaludes to come off the high. To say the least, these vices mess with Jordan's judgment, but he still can get out of serious jail time if he pleads guilty to a few minor SEC violations and steps down from Stratton, will he do it?I like The Wolf Of Wall Street a great deal. I expected to see Oliver Stone's Wall Street, and instead I saw a much funnier take on the Wall Street culture, some of it was laugh out loud funny. Sometimes, I think it was too funny for its own good. Jordan Belfort is a real person, he did swindle lots of people out of their money, and at times, I felt like the movie treated his transgressions much too lightheartedly. By the time the movie switches to a more serious tone, the pacing also slows down quite a bit. Martin Scorsese, who directed this movie, didn't need so much detail in telling the story, and could have done a good bit of editing to help with the pacing. Because it's directed by Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street reminded me of Goodfellas. Henry Hill and Jordan Belfort are very similar, they both put on the facade of being pillars of the community, while in reality they craved debauchery. Scorsese is extremely good at showing the dichotomy between the public and private lives of both men.The acting is good. Leonardo DeCaprio is very good as a man whose moral compass is broken, and who only cares about fulfilling his hedonistic needs. DeCaprio turns from good time Charlie to raving lunatic in a flash, and that's not easy to do, a lesser actor could have blown that role very easily. He also does the New York accent very well. Margot Robbie does a really good job in a tough role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, she plays Naomi as a very manipulative woman using sex as a weapon, but and she also stands up for herself when she needs to. She also handles the accent well, even though she's from Australia. I cannot for the life of me understand the casting of Jonah Hill in this movie, he plays Donnie Azoff as a complete moron, a goofball looking for his next score of money or drugs. Hill has never failed to annoy me with his frat boy antics in any movie he's in. The streak continues. I'm similarly puzzled by the casting of Rob Reiner as Jordan's father. Reiner plays the role strictly for laughs, which adds to the confused tone of the film. Overall, a very good film, a bit long, and sometimes confused tonally, but still very good.For more howlingly good reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",8,1,5,28 December 2013
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger Than Fiction. It's a fact, this is a great film.
","Harold Crick (Will Farrell) is an I.R.S. agent with a very regimented life. He brushes his teeth with a certain amount of brush strokes, he walks the same distance to the bus stop every day, he takes the same amount of time for lunch every day. He eats alone, he sleeps alone and the next day the regimen starts all over again. Except now he hears a voice in his head, narrating the day. The narrator (Emma Thompson) narrates his whole day, from morning to night.While hearing the voice in his head, Harold is also auditing a quirky bakery shop owner, named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who despises Harold, because he represents the establishment. But from the moment Harold sees Ana's tattooed body, he knows he wants her, lust soon turns to love, and Harold decides not to live such a regimented life. He takes up the guitar, and starts wearing sweaters instead of a suit and tie with a single Windsor knot. Just then, the narrator tells Harold of his impending death. Harold decides to ask a literary professor, Jules Hibbert (Dustin Hoffman) not a psychiatrist to help identify the voice in his head. Who is this narrator? How does she know Harold is going to die? Can Professor Hibbert help Harold identify the voice of the narrator? I love Stranger Than Fiction. It's got such an interesting concept and the concept is almost fully realized. All the comedy, all the sadness of a everyman facing his own mortality is wrung out of this beautifully written script. It's an acerbic satire of writers, most people think of writers as detached, genteel, well-educated, omnipotent people. This movie turns that impression on its head, according to this movie, writers are chain-smoking neurotic, verbose, egomaniacs with a God complex. This movie is more than a scathing satire of writers, it's an existential comedy, if there is such a thing. The questions brought to mind are, who created us and why. What if that creator decided to snuff out our lives, just as we were starting to enjoy ourselves? Could we talk to our creator, as Job did in the Bible? What would happen after such an intervention? I'm sure the writer wasn't thinking of Job, but that's what this movie made me think of. I said the concept was almost fully realized because the writer, Zack Helm, wrote an ending that I hated for this movie, and that made an otherwise flawless movie have a big flaw.This is a beautifully acted movie. Will Ferrell gives up his usual oafish buffoonery, for a quiet understated, performance. Not that I don't enjoy his occasional buffoonery like Frank the Tank or Ron Burgundy, but this movie and Elf show he's capable of so much more. He's capable of playing, sweet, gentle, vulnerable characters, and this movie shows that side of him. Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely irresistible as a perky, sassy, sensual, goddess of the counterculture. Emma Thompson absolutely steals the movie as the narrator, yes there is voice over narration, but it's used to hilarious effect. Dustin Hoffman is wonderful, trying to figure out the ridiculous situation he's presented with, his humor is at its driest. And Queen Latifah, when given a good script shines, with superb comic timing, even with the rapid-fire dialog she is given. Everybody is at their best here.For more fact-based reviews of great and not-so great movies, visit my blog, reviewswithatude@wordpress.com.",9,2,3,25 September 2013
The Wolverine," The Wolverine (2013) A cat with no claws
","It is August 9th 1945, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is in Nagasaki, Japan, as the U.S. drops the bomb on Nagasaki, as most of the soldiers commit hara kiri, Logan saves one soldier, named Yashida (Ken Yamamoura) and Yashida is eternally grateful.Years later, a girl named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) invites Logan to Japan to visit Yashida. Yukio is a mutant as well, with the power to see the future. Logan accepts the visit, and visits Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) who by now is an aging tech giant, worth billions, but also dying from the radiation he was exposed to during the war. Yashida is being treated by a shady doctor,(Svetlana Khodchenkova) who he calls his oncologist, but is mixing up chemicals much more complex to keep Yashida alive. Yashida makes a promise to Logan, he will give Logan what he desires most a mortal life, if Logan promises to protect his granddaughter, Mariko, (Tao Okamoto) from the Yakuza, the Japanese mob. Does Logan agree to protect Mariko? Who is Yashida's mysterious doctor? Does Logan get his mortality back from Yashida's mysterious doctor?I have very mixed feelings about The Woverine. I wanted to like it a lot, because I really love the X-Men trilogy and even the first Wolverine movie. But it is precisely because of the X-Men movies that I feel like the Wolverine falls short. The X-Men movies were about large issues, the discovery of mutants, their impact on the world, and the human reaction to the mutants. This story feels smaller in scope and impact. And the substitute for story is gratuitous violence, and I'm not talking about comic book violence, people get shot and stabbed and right and that is disturbing. The story feels almost provincial, being shot mostly in Japan, and the cynical side of me says that was done to draw on the large Asian audience both in the U.S. and worldwide. There is a romance between Logan and Mariko, that seems forced, maybe because Jackman s 44, and Tao Okamoto is 28. A lot of the script is not worth the paper it's written on.There are strong points to the story though. Jackman does a wonderful job reprising Logan, as a haunted soul, disturbed by nightmares and yearning for a 'normal' life. Famke Janssen is superb reprising her role as Jean Grey, she is a siren, a specter, calling to Logan to join her in eternal rest. Rilla Fukushima, brings some fun and action to the movie as Logan's 'bodyguard.' The rest of the cast pretty much falls flat. The character played by Svetlana Khodchenkova could have been an interesting one, with a little more development, but they didn't do that.There is one action scene that deserves mention, it is when Logan is fighting one of the Yakuza on top of a speeding bullet train, the rest of the action scenes are pretty violent, and largely unnecessary. The Wolverine clocks in at 126 minutes and could have used a lot of editing, but there is a tease for the third Wolverine movie, after the credits, and that looks worth watching, so stay until after the credits.The Wolverine: A cat with no claws.for more movie reviews, check out my blog reviewswithatude@wordpress.com",6,22,45,27 July 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Saving Mr. Banks. Bank on it.
","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) continues his 20 year negotiation with P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) author of the Mary Poppins children's books. Disney flies Travers to the Beverly Hills hotel, because he made a promise to his little girls that he would turn the books into a movie. Travers hates the songs, she hates the first draft of the script, and she refuses to animate any of her characters. While negotiations drag on, Travers recalls her not-so-idyllic childhood with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) and mother Margaret Goff. (Ruth Wilson) Does Disney ever get the book rights to the Mary Poppins books?The answer to the question is pretty obvious, so that's not where the drama lies in this movie. The drama in Saving Mr. Banks emerges from P.L. Travers backstory, which contains a lot more pathos and pain than I expected, I thought this movie would be light, jaunty, family fare, but it's more than that. Saving Mr. Banks is a real emotional powerhouse, and it comes to that emotion honestly, not through tried and true tearjerker shortcuts. There are also funny and sweet moments like seeing how the songs were constructed, and hearing the vast emotional range of the songs in Mary Poppins.The acting is superb. Tom Hanks is at the top of his game playing the amiable, happy-go-lucky Walt Disney. The world is Disney's oyster, and he's sure he can charm Travers into turning over the book rights to Disney. Hanks turns on the charm full tilt, but what makes his role special, is that when the role demands seriousness, Hanks delivers. Emma Thompson has the hardest role in this movie, she is the one rejecting all the script modifications and turning down the money, but Thompson plays Travers expertly, not as a harpy or shrew, but as a loving human being who wants to stay true to the characters she created. Thompson's matronly manner also adds a comedic edge to the role. Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak, add some excellent comedy relief, and Paul Giamatti adds a touching note in a smaller role. Young Annie Rose Buckley does an excellent job in a pivotal role as Ginty.The writing is excellent, the director moves the pace along, and I don't think the professional actors in this movie need a lot of help from the director in terms of line readings.This is a wonderful movie, not just for kids, but it has a lot of emotional heft for adults. Saving Mr. Banks is a true family film.For more reviews that are money in the bank, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",8,0,1,21 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Thor: The Dark World. The writers must have been hammered.
","Maleikith (Christopher Eccleston) leader of the Dark Elves possesses the Aether, a weapon with which he intends to destroy Asgard. Thor, (Chris Hemsworth) prince of the Nine Realms, doesn't want to be King of the Nine Realms, but neither does he trust his evil brother Loki (Tom Huddleston) to be King of the Nine Realms either. When trying to slip through a wormhole to try to meet Thor, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is infused with the Aether, and given supernatural powers. Malekith wants to retrieve the Aether from Jane to destroy Asgard and the Nine Realms. Thor can't kill Malekith by himself, he needs the help of his brother Loki. Does Loki help Thor or join forces with Malekith? What happens to the Aether?Thor is when the Marvel cannon of characters hits the bottom of the barrel. Thor is the weakest of all the Marvel superheroes in my opinion, a Norse god with a hammer as a weapon. What's so super about that? The mythology around him is weak, Asgard is not exactly Krypton, Thor is hardly Batman, or even Spiderman, there is nothing compelling about the character, and unlike Iron Man, neither the story nor the character draw the viewer in. I don't care about Thor, or his rivalry with Loki, so what is left is a story with no plot development, no character development, and a movie that jumps form action sequence to action sequence, from special effect to special effect, with no rhyme or reason. And the terminology just sounds like so much gobbledygook. What the heck is Aether, the convergence, the Dark Elves, the Nine Realms? What do the Dark Elves do? Bake evil cookies? This movie suffers from the same problem as the Avengers, a scant plot, underdeveloped characters, and a rush to get to the action scenes and special effects. Again, it took six people to write this dreck, did they take turns writing in crayon?Chris Helmworth is a wooden actor, he brings no dimension to this character. Hemsworth seems only interested in creating a larger than life character, but he brings nothing else to the role. Tom Huddleston is not a menacing presence, neither is Christopher Eccleston. Natalie Portman can be a good actress when given a good script, but she's back in Queen Amidalla mode here, she has very little to say, trying to sound important but is only used as a love interest and damsel in distress. Anthony Hopkins is brought in once again to try to class up the proceedings, it doesn't work. For more Thor-ough reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",2,3,4,6 July 2014
Flight," Flight. Never takes off.
","Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an airline pilot with a complicated life. He is divorced from his wife estranged from his son, and is in a sexual relationship with one of the stewardesses who he works with, Katerina Marquez. (Nadine Velasquez) In addition, he drinks to excess and snorts cocaine, which he does on the morning of a particular flight. He pulls the flight out of some tough weather, and then drinks while the plane is on autopilot. The plane then starts to dive for some unknown reason and Whip Whitaker miraculously lands the plane, saving 96 of 102 people on board. But the NTSB is doing an investigation and, and despite airline lawyer Hugh Lang's (Don Cheadle) success in killing the toxicology report from the NTSB hearing, they still find out that there were two empty vodka bottles on the plane. Will the NTSB find out the truth about Whip's drinking, or will a heroic act by a flawed pilot obscure the truth of his alcoholism and drug use? I did not like Flight. This is an example of a very good premise that goes awry, a hero pilot with very big personal flaws, must face his addictions or possibly face jail time. This is an excellent starting point, but the movie gets so weighed down with its overwrought melodrama that it forgets to answer one of the basic questions posed in the film. Why does Whip Whitaker drink? In over two hours of what becomes a tedious morality play, the central question is never even addressed. Many of the movies subplots are simply unnecessary, and add nothing to the central idea in the film. Once again Hollywood has a strange take on religion, and the way down the plane clips a Pentecostal church, and the crash was somehow God's will. Instead the movie should be saying that all of us despite our many flaws are capable of heroic things, and that is through God's grace. The movie of course makes the co-pilot a fundamentalist Christian, whose wife's every utterance ends with the phrase, 'Praise Jesus.' It's sad that Hollywood wants to pigeonhole an entire religion as judgmental Bible thumpers, but they do. If that's not bad enough, the 'evidence' that the movie hinges on is silly. The plane is destroyed, people died, but two vodka bottles are unscathed. Really? Finally, this movie has an interesting take on alcohol detox, take drugs. Not a good idea.The acting is not great. Denzel Washington, who I like, and think is an excellent actor, has gotten into something of a rut lately, playing a grizzled anti-hero a tough talking guy with all the answers. This take no-prisoners attitude was first and display in the movie Training Day, and it was eye-opening. Denzel could really play a bad guy with the face of a movie idol, but he played a similar role in American Gangster, Unstoppable and now Flight. It's time to put this character away for a while. Don Cheadle plays a lawyer in the dullest, most uninteresting way, I'm really tired of seeing Cheadle give another lifeless, bland performance. John Goodman was at the very least funny, but totally unnecessary . Goodman essentially serves as Washington's drug supplier.Flight is very slowly paced and inexplicably long. The director Robert Zemeckis, who made the very successful Back To the Future films and writer John Gaitains are responsible for the pacing and length of this film, a lot of editing was required to get to the essence of the film, but that was not done. The movie has nudity and numerous scenes of drug taking. This is absolutely not a movie to watch with kids.For more high-flying reviews,visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",4,2,4,8 December 2013

In 2012, Timothy Cavendish (Broadbent) is a book publisher,trying to sell the latest book of author Dermot Hoggins (Hanks) Hoggins is a brutish type who threatens a reviewer who wrote a bad review of his book. The book becomes a best-seller, but Hoggins wants more money from Cavendish. Cavendish needs to escape because Cavendish doesn't have money. Timothy turns to his brother Denhome, but Denhome traps Timothy in a nursing home, run by a sadistic nurse, named Nokes (Weaving) In the year 2144, in Neo Seoul, a fabricant, a clone bred for servitude named Sonmi. (Doona Bae) Soonmi is tired of conforming to a consumer based society. Sonmi finds Hae Joo Chang (Sturgess) a human born in a womb, they fall in love but can they escape this authoritarian society? In 2346, humans living on a planet that is not earth, live in a very primitive fashion. Zachary (Hanks) is trying to protect his family from an intra-tribal war. The other chief is called the Kona Chief, (Grant) and he is a bloodthirsty cannibal. Suddenly a stranger named Meronym (Berry) appears from a different part of the planet. She is technologically advanced, and tells Zachary to follow her, but there is a voice in Zachary's head (Weaving) that tells Zachary to kill Meronym, does he listen to that voice? I did not like Cloud Atlas. The basic themes were alright, freedom from an autocratic society, and non-conformity in the face of intense pressure to conform. But then it strays into past lives, and new age doctrine, and I'm sorry, but that turns me off. The stories are all supposed to be interconnected , but the connections are tenuous at best.The vignettes borrow heavily from other movies First off the interconnectedness of the story lines reminded me of Babel, the journey on the slave ship is reminiscent of Amistad, the Halle Berry investigating a nuclear accident was like Coffey meets China Syndrome, the nursing home story feels like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the futuristic Korean story is Blade Runner meets 2046 meets Soylent Green, and the thing is all the original movies that this movie borrows from are better than this movie. The fourth and fifth stories are my favorites, because the fourth one is good comedy relief and the fifth one is good science fiction, but 2/6th of a good movie is a pretty bad movie.The movie is written by the Wachowski siblings, and has all the strengths and weaknesses of their Matrix movies, some good science fiction and a lot of mushy sentimentality that boils down to the phrase 'Why can't we all get along?' Cloud Atlas was a book, so I will blame some of the shortcomings of the movie on the book, but since I never read the book, I don't know where the book goes off the rails. And three hours is too damn long for any movie.The acting is good, but not by the big stars, Hanks and Berry just embarrass themselves trying different accents and hiding behind prosthetic make-up. Broadbent, Ben Wishaw, and James D'Arcy are very good. Doona Bae is a revelation, until she tries to play a Mexican woman in the 70's, then she embarrasses herself. Similarly, Wishaw and Darcy embarrass themselves playing Koreans, it is cringewothy. Hugo Weaving is great, but he is always great.There is nudity and violence, so keep the kids away, and maybe Cloud Atlas will put the adults to sleep.",2,1,5,8 November 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Inside Llewyn Davis: Skip to my Llew!
","Llewyn Davis, (Oscar Issac) a struggling folk singer, travels from New York to Chicago in the 1960's to try to establish a solo singing career, amid many obstacles.This is a very complex movie. It is a funny movie, at first I thought it was a straight out comedy, but then it tackles serious issues, love, but not in the way a typical movie deals with it, loss in a more traditional sense and even symbolism. I was actually ruminating on the symbolism of a cat. This movie handles comedy and drama so adeptly, that it feels like real life. Life is sometimes funny, sometimes tragic and this movie echoes both extremes really well. The scenes are punctuated by hauntingly beautiful music, that adds to the overall mood of the film. The ending is appropriate to the overall film, and that's all that needs to be said. I did not go into detail on the plot, because any details would ruin your enjoyment of the film.The acting is superb. The cast is led by Oscar Isaac, who plays the darkly comic, sometimes morose Llewyn Davis with an innate sense of self. He knows this character inside and out. Carey Mulligan is also outstanding as the vituperative, venomous Jean, although her American accent slips every once in a while. Mulligan also has a great singing voice, as does Isaac. Justin Timberlake has a terrific singing voice, but he's still a wooden actor, and yet he gets these plum roles, inexplicable.The Coen Brothers are especially visual in this film, underscoring the claustrophobic feeling of living in New York City, filming down stairways, and between narrow hallways. The pacing is perfect, and the music is interspersed beautifully within the film. The brothers get beautiful, heart wrenching performances from a largely unknown cast. It reminded me somewhat of another Coen brothers film, O Brother Where Art Thou, with its comedic touches and music, but Inside LLewyn Davis is a much darker film.This is a must-see.For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",9,0,2,28 March 2015
The Wedding Singer," The Wedding Singer (1998) Sing Its Praises!
","It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter. His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving.When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings 'Love Stinks' at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie?An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride.Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful '50 First Dates' but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings 'Ladies Night.' 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity.The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's.For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com",9,1,2,28 September 2013
Warm Bodies," Warm Bodies (2013) Romance for the Brain Dead Teen
","R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie on a food run, and for zombies, that means brains. R kills one of the young leaders of the zombie resistance, named Perry, (Dave Franco) but spares Perry's girlfriend Julie, (Teresa Palmer) because he falls in love with her and it's love at first sight. Unfortunately, for R, Julies dad, Grigio, (John Malkovich) is the head honcho of the zombie resistance, to him, the only good zombie is a dead zombie. Despite the fact that R killed her boyfriend and ate his brains to relive his memories, and despite the fact that he is part of the undead, R rescues Julie from his fellow zombies, and in return Julie teaches him to drive a car. But it's not all beer and skittles, R and Julie have more than garden variety zombies to worry about. Hard-core skeleton zombies called Bonies are chasing after R and Julie, as is Julie's father . But a funny thing is happening to R, the longer he is on the run with Julie, the more alive he feels. Can R and Julie dodge her zombie killing dad and the Bonies long enough to save himself and Julie? What is Julie's reaction when he finds out that R killed Perry? Is R really coming back to life? So this is what passes for romance these days? I was going to make some snide remark about Warm Bodies being Romeo and Juliet for the undead, but it really is based on Romeo and Juliet, maybe for the brain-dead slacker. R, and Julie are the names of the main characters, could the writers make it a little more obvious that this movie is sourced from Shakespeare? Maybe someone should tell the writers that Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, obviously the writers read the Cliff Notes version of Romeo and Juliet. OK, forget for a minute that they butchered a classic, who finds a fully gassed up BMW convertible in the middle of a zombie apocalypse? That's just insulting to anyone's intelligence. I guess I'm too old for these angst-ridden teen dramadies, but I was expecting better. There's a clunky internal dialogue for R, because he's a zombie and basically sounds like Tarzan with a lobotomy when trying to form sentences. Wrap that all in a cheesy moral about the power of love, and you've got a real stinker on your hands. The lead actors look like the stepped out of some teen magazine, faces full of pain and angst, and John Malkovich tries to get some ironic laughs, playing a gun toting dad, but it doesn't work , the laughs are few and far between. The only person who gets any laughs at all is Asleigh Tipton, as Nora, Julie's skeptical friend. If you want to see a funny zombie movie, try Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead, both much funnier movies.Warm Bodies: Dead on Arrival.For hundreds more movie reviews check out my blog, reviewswithatude@wordpress.com",1,16,31,24 June 2013
