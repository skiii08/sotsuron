Gravity," Could of been a classic....................but it's not.
","OK so this movie should quite rightly sweep all the awards in the special effects and cinematography categories in the forthcoming awards season. However, it falls flat on its face when it comes to plausibility, but it needn't have. They make a point of letting us know that Sandra Bullock's character is not am astronaut as such and is up there to repair a satellite. She even admits to crashing the shuttle every time whilst doing some brief training in a flight simulator back on earth. Without wishing to give too much away Bullock has to board not one but two foreign space vehicles to get home, one Russian one Chinese. Considering she was incompetent in piloting a more familiar vehicle in a simulator we are expected to believe that she is capable of doing this under stress. Adding insult to injury she achieved all of this without any help from NASA people on earth due to the communications being down. At one point she actually says 'Eeny meeny miny moe' to select what button to press in a foreign space craft. When she splashes down on earth it has conveniently landed in a small lake allowing her to get to shore relatively easily. If Bullock had been a highly qualified shuttle pilot this would have been more plausible but I guess plausibility is not good box office.Chewing gum for the brain.",6,0,1,10 January 2014
The Revenant," Faster than a speeding bullet, leaping tall buildings in a single bound !!
","Imagine a cross between Jeremiah Johnson, Get Carter and Superman and you have The Revenant (sounds pretty good). This is basically an old fashioned revenge saga. Now I know it's a remake of the superior Man In The Wilderness starring the late great Richard Harris but it really did get a bit carried away with itself.The filming is great and the huge landscapes are the real stars of the show. The problem, as in so many movies these days, is one of plausibility. Without giving too much away our hero (DiCaprio) survives not one, not two, not three but about 7 brushes with CERTAIN death. Colossal loss of blood, wet clothes in a sub zero environment, strangling, smothering, , falling off a cliff, drowning, knives, guns, Indians, baddies, gangrene..................the list goes on and on and all that was really missing was a red cape, a kiss curl and a cameo performance from Stan Lee.Awards should go to the technical folk and it must've been a tough shoot for the cast but when you boil it all down there's a lot more gravy than meat and potatoes.",5,7,12,25 February 2016
Now You See Me," Stop the ride I want to get off
","If you're the kind of person who is entertained by having your intelligence insulted non-stop for 115 minutes, then this is the film for you.Scene after scene after scene adds further insult to injury. You can actually see the fear in the casts eyes as they realise that jumping aboard this clapped out bandwagon has been a colossally bad career move. Michael Caine once famously said 'You get paid the same for a bad film as you do for a good one', and that has always been his professional ethos so for him this is par for the course. But I can't imagine where the normally sound judgement of Mark Ruffalo and Morgan Freeman was when they signed up for this dreck.The implausibilities pile up one on top of the other like the collective product of a faecal incontinent donkey and then, just as you thought you'd suffered enough, the big reveal at the end is the final cock a snook to the demoralised viewer.I won't give the end away. Suffice to say that although it is intended to make the audience gasp in shock, by the time you reach this point you have already had to suspend disbelief to such an extreme you'll think that maybe Donald Trump WOULD make a good President.Yes, the ending is THAT ridiculous.",1,2,5,31 January 2016
Mama," Could of been a great movie
","This movie had a good back story (about as plausible as movies of this genre get) and was handled very well pretty much throughout. There was a genuinely spooky spectre looming in the background in the first three quarters of the movie but when it came to the pay off i.e. when we got a good look at the phantom, it looked liked a cartoon character. If a bit more money had been spent on the CGI (or what ever effect was used) and the spook had looked more 3 dimensional this movie would have got a 9 from me. However, I found it more unsettling than the laughable 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious' and it has that rare quality which leaves you feeling a little sympathy for the ghost.",7,0,1,4 January 2014
Godzilla," By the numbers, tepid tosh
","If only Seth McFarlane or the Zucker brothers would have a go at a movie like this. At least there'd be a giggle or two.So much wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start so I'll make an orderly list.SPOILER ALERT1) The two Muto creatures looked more metallic than flesh and blood. whoever designed the creatures needs to take a course in basic entomology as I assume they were supposed to be insect based. A 5 year old with some plasticine and a crocodile clip could have created a more convincing monster. Godzilla too was farcical, I mean a gigantic dinosaur with the head the size of a pea.2) Towards the end Godzilla was losing the fight against the two Muto's but they were distracted by the burning of their egg chamber (nice steal from Aliens) and they left Godzilla alive. A little later a recovered Godzilla suddenly remembers that he can breathe fire and so quite easily kills his two monstrous enemies in their next encounters. Why not use the fire breathing weapon in the earlier fight?3) People are sat in homes and bars watching 24/7 news coverage of these three enormous monsters rampaging over their cities but then seem shocked and horrified when the roof of their building collapses under the weight of a Mutu. How did they not know that the monster was just down the road? They were watching it all on live TV for god's sake.4) Our hero is left in charge of a little Japanese boy who gets separated from his parents in the panic. Later they arrive at an area full of tens of thousands of displaced people and the little boy wanders off and finds his parents straight away. Yeah right.5) People walk around unprotected in areas that would be so highly radioactive your skin would melt from your skin (and I'm not talking about the earlier scene where Brian Cranstone returned to where his wife had died).I could say so much more. Suffice to say this version of Godzilla was a witless, artless, clueless insult to the intelligence. If it had included any wit at all or adopted a tongue-in-cheek attitude it might have been an OK popcorn movie. However it is so po-faced and earnest in the handling of this preposterous nonsense that you just end up laughing all the way through it anyway.I can only imagine that Brian Cranstone and Juliet Binoche begged to be killed off early so they could escape the stigma of being too closely connected to this dogs breakfast of a movie. The great David Strathhairn too should've known better.",1,0,2,27 July 2015
Spectre," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","OK I'll start with the Pros.Ben Whishaw is in it and he's a great actor who elevates everything he appears in.Now the Cons.Undoubtedly the dullest Bond villain ever.Incredibly lacklustre Bond Girls.A plot that is both transparent and yet somehow ludicrous at the same time.The reveal near the end was as unsurprising as it gets.No thought seems to have been invested in ensuring the gloriously contrived deaths of the baddies. I guess if you want a Bond that's just nuts and bolts and no finesse this is for you, but if you like a bit of humour and razzmatazz steer well clear.",3,4,10,1 January 2016
