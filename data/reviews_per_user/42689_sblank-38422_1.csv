Moneyball," Moneyball
","I highly recommend watching the film Moneyball if you enjoy underdog stories with so much more than the typical sport's movie clichés. Moneyball has everything a great movie needs. It keeps you interested the whole time, as you want (rather, need) to find out if Billy Beane's new method to choosing this baseball team will work. The statistics and mathematical side of it all isn't thrown in the audience's face—everything is explained so that the viewer will understand and follow along with each choice made. Peter Brand is a nice comic relief to the stress that Billy Beane is always under—there are even times when Billy Beane is hilarious, as well. Overall, the story is somewhat sad, yet inspirational and enjoyable at the same time. Billy goes through so much to prove that he is good at what he does, likely due to his first-choice career not going exactly as he planned. To watch this team that was ruled irrelevant at the loss of their major players even attempt such a comeback is inspiring. This is not your typical baseball movie—I don't think you even have to be that into baseball to enjoy it as much as a huge fan of the sport would. If you like movies that tug at your emotions ranging from happy to inspired to sad at times, Moneyball is the movie for you.",8,1,2,2 April 2015
