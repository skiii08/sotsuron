The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It was brilliant!
","Rarely after watching a movie do i take the time out to write about it so that others could know what my opinion about that particular movie was. Because opinions may vary. Some people may agree to what i think or believe while others wont. But with this, i just had to. Because rarely has a movie had such an effect on me. Rarely have i connected with a character as much as i did with Charlie (Played wonderfully by Logan Lerman) or Sam (Emma Watson) or Patrick (Ezra Miller). When I had a look at the promos, i expected it to be a yet another cliché where you're made to feel pity for the protagonist in the beginning, but all ends well with a feel-good theme throughout. I expected the cinematography to be brilliant, music to be good and all other technical aspects of the movie to be top notch, but did not expect too much of a story. But boy was I wrong! The way this movie handles various serious subjects and meshes them all together without having a feeling of the plots squeezed forcefully is brilliant. And the credit for that goes to the writer director Stephen Chbosky! Made from a book penned by himself, I believe no one understood all the characters better than he did. No one could visualize the book better than him. And that shows throughout the film. You know what the characters are thinking or the reason why they are doing the things they do every time. Its like you know the characters instantly after the first time you see them on screen. All of them. And the director never loses hold of the film. Nowhere does it feel like its dragging. You're into the movie the moment it starts, and manage to stay hooked up until the last frame. Especially the last 15 minutes! I watched the movie again immediately just go through those fifteen minutes again. They moved me. And it is not often that a movie manages to move me. Generally I watch them and i forget, almost immediately. But this one I didn't. All the pieces of acting are brilliant. Logan Lerman is to watch out for.The way he portrays his characters with all those developments is good. Some of the scenes, especially towards the end were breath taking. Emma Watson in her all American avatar was good too. So was Ezra Miller. Although Paul Rudd's character could have been explored more, he was good at what he got. All in all, this is not just another high school movie. No! There is so much more too it. And the way every one of the sub-plots are handled, with all its sensitivity, its good. No matter what age you are, you will connect with the characters. Just Watch it! And yes, Be Infinite! :)",10,2,4,8 February 2013
8 Mile," Better Than Expected!
","I was seriously impressed by L.A confidential and wonder Boys.So i came forward to check out all of Curtis Hanson's movies. And then i stumbled onto 8 mile, starring Eminem. At first i was surprised to see a movie with Eminem in the lead. But then i was like can Eminem seriously act? And then i watched it. Although it may not have been the best of the movies ever made by Curtis Hanson, it was definitely better than what i expected it to be! Eminem was quite convincing as a wannabe rapper trying to make his way in Detroit. Quite unexpectedly, Eminem's first song in the movie is a lullaby which he sing to his sister. And he is good for most part in the movie. The direction is good too. Although the story has some minor loopholes, the movie never fails to engage.He does not get into clichés with too many songs or unnecessary dragging, just to woo the fans. All of the songs are appropriate and well placed. Kim Basinger does justice too her role. So does the rest of the cast. Murphy was okay. She did not have too much screen time to do something impressive anyhow. Over all, this movie was satisfactory. Some people might not want to watch this just because it has Eminem in it. But trust me, that guy can act. And with a director like Hanson, you can trust the movie has some good content.8/10 from me!",8,0,0,1 February 2013
