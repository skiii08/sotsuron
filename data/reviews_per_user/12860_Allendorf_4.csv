The New World," I don't get the artistic side of this movie
","I watched this movie with some of my friends yesterday night, as usual, with not much expectation. But indeed, I wasn't at all expecting to watch scenery on a movie theatre that cost me money. I mean, I can see scenery on discovery channel and no need to go to movie theatres.The whole movie, I would say 90% of it does not involve understandable human verbal communication. To clarify that, in this movie - we have 2 civilization that is Britons and Native Indians. While britons so little , the native Indian speak in their own language (Only 5% of it were translated). Its rude for me to put it this way, but it seems that I felt like I was really observing a zoo.I don't understand why there is so little verbal communication in this movie, while as we can see - even ScobbyDoo can talk.There is no real set of problem defined in this movie. The conflict and confrontation of European Colony and Native Indian is poorly unfold. In one scene the European fight with Indian, while in few next scenes - they seems to be friend again. While the war contribute to little part of the movie, much of the movie is spent on observing scenery, human activities, lake, mountain, sun or inaudible conversation which further deviate and deter the movie quality.This movie is my first and biggest disappointment on movie. A total waste of time and money.",1,7,13,29 January 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I did not laugh the entire film.
","First and foremost - I would stand to death (of course this is a exaggeration) to argue with whoever people out there that say Borat is funny. It is not.Simply put - Borat is just a collection of amateur videos filled with some 'Just for laugh' video shot in various location that has an appalling sense of humour. All the jokes are typical racist, stereotypes and other insults of which most rational people found it to be offensive rather than funny. Of course, the intention and the objective of Borat is to make people laugh. If this were to be a late night comedy show - I would have at least give 6/10 for its effort. However, as for a cinematic experience, I cant but to give Borat 1/10 for its lacking in plot, amateur shots, offensive jokes, and irritating Sacha Cohen",1,25,50,28 May 2007
Saw III," Experience were not as memorable as SAW II
","In my mind the title 'SAW' itself used to suggest the most astounding horrorific cinematic experience you could imagine from a horror and gory movie. SAW II lived up this expectation, but SAW II has failed terribly.Any real SAW fan would be somewhat disappointed by SAW III. The pace of the story itself has deteoriates; where in SAW II the story progressed really fast and many things happened with multitude characters - SAW III is rather slow, unconvincing and sometimes offer chessy and lacking of solid story line and suspense.Some gory scenes and tortures may moved my butt to the edge of my seat - but other than that, the story itself and the movie did not move me at all.",5,1,2,27 October 2006
The Incredibles," Limitted plot but great in overall
","All aspects of the movie are totally great, but...But the thing that was unacceptable for me is the plot or the storyline, it was very ambiguous and unclear, i.e the origin of the incredible man. all of sudden those superheroes started to appear.Well, I know that this film are meant for children, but hardly makes sense for adult.The suspense also loosen too fast, if we recall the intense that been built, its not comparable to the ending. It ends to quickly.Asides those weaknesses of this film, this film really provoke my interest in this film, honestly, this is the first film that made me want to watch another animation movie, even finding nemo doesn't make me to do so.Don;t miss this incredible movie !!!RATE- 10/10",10,0,1,7 November 2004
