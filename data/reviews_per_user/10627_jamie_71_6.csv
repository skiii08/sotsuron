Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I liked it ALOT!!!
","First of all, I was never a die-hard Star Wars fan. That is my older brother. But I went to my grandma's house for about a week on vacation and my mum and I HAD to get away from her, so we went and saw this movie. I must say, I really liked it. It has some major flaws, but I believe the effects make up for it. I really didnt much like Jar-Jar..he's cute and all, but I really wish I knew what he was saying. He shouldnt have had such a dumb accent. The aliens that spoke english gave me a headache. Their lips werent moving in anyway what-so-ever to what I ours might. I had to look away when they talked to understand. I think Mr. Neeson is a MAJOR BABE...who cares if he's 47? He's definetly hot! ANd Mr McGregor...well what can I say, he's a major hottie, too. Maybe they didnt have the perfect roles, but I think the movie is so awesome. I would recommend all SW fans to see it, and even those who arent. It has the best effects I have ever seen. You'll see past Mr Jar jar and the weird-o aliens.",Null,0,0,3 September 1999
The 13th Warrior," Hey, I really loved this movie
","I saw this movie expecting it to be really good. To my surprise, it turned out BETTER than I thought. My mum thought it would be dumb, but she loved it, too. I think the actors were good, maybe not 'saving private ryan' good, but I liked it. I really like Banderas, and he was exceptionally good, to me, in this. not a movie for everyone, though. I am going to see it again this weekend. :) And dont listen to anyone's opinions...everyone likes different things. But I'd give it 10/10!!!",10,0,0,2 September 1999
Edward Scissorhands," Truly touching.
","I rented this movie tonight because I hadnt seen it since like 1995 and I still cried. This movie is one that will last forever. I think it's a Masterpiece. I has many characteristics of real life and how cruel we can be towards those who are different from us. Edward is one of the few characters you love and love even more after 100 times of watching it. I think this is Tim Burton's best film. It is heart-wrenching and pain-staking. It's definetly one movie that will never get old in my eyes. There are no special effects that will wear off or look fake (okay, besides the mountain scene) with age. The sadest part to me was when his creator gave him the hands and died, and the hands were ruined. Breaks me all up inside to watch that part. One of the best love stories I have ever seen, and I watch a ton of movies. This movie carries every emotion and makes you feel them everytime. And it isnt like most love stories, end all perfect. It has a better twist to it, even if it makes me cry everytime. I would suggest this movie to anyone. It's just totally wonderful. I dont know what else to say.",Null,0,0,3 September 1999
Event Horizon," I loved it!
","Okay. I've read almost everyone's comments, and I hate that people keep bringing up the copying part of it. Everyone copies someone else. And Sphere can AFTER Event Horizon. I think everything about the movie was great. First movie I have ever covered my face b/c something was so gross. And the fact the plot was something impossible is why they call it science-fiction. But the concept that they can travel faster than light to me is just awesome. The effects in it are awesome. I dont complain about the gory-ness b/c THAT is what HORROR is suppose to be. 'Scream' and 'I Know What You DId Last Summer' were really stupid in my opinion. Scream, it was okay, but IKWYDLS was just totally and utterly boring to me. Im glad I didnt pay movie theatre prices to see it. I would have payed to see Event Horizon, though, and I wish I would've now. The actors are great, they do a wonderful job. The cast fits perfect. A caring captain (miller), a funny guy who keeps things down to earth (cooper), the paranoid guy (smith), a weird-science freak (weir), the baby (justin), the motherly woman (peters), and the serious woman (stark). I think this movie should get more credit than it has. I own this movie and watch it all the time. And someone said the ship looks like a toture-chamber...Makes it THAT much more better. If the ship was pink and purple and all merry-like, it wouldnt be scarey. But, not everyone likes the same thing, but I loved this movie.",Null,0,0,1 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Well...
","Okay. I went to see this movie b/c I thought it looked VERY spooky and not like BOO! Scared ya type movie, but a mind bender. I, personally, preferred THE HAUNTING (1999) Im not saying this movie wasnt good, but everything about it was predictable...except what happened to Mr Willis in the end. That was the only thing I never caught on to. But, one thing, this movie had no scares. Lots of people in the theater (sold out show) gasped and screamed a lot, but I looked around like 'And what have you people been watching? that was so not scarey' but, we're all different. im sure there was someone in there like me wondering what was so scarey. Of course, I was sitting by this old lady who screamed every 5 minutes, which wasnt pleasurable. But if u want to see a movie for it's twists and confusion...this is one. NOT for anyone who thinks it's scarey, b/c to me, it just wasnt scarey in the least bit way. My toaster oven has more fright. But this was definetly a wonderful movie. I give it a 10/10 for twists and originality. a 1/10 for scariness.",Null,0,0,4 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Am I the only one...?
","This movie was nothing special to me. I heard such great reviews about it, and how it was 'Scary!' 'You'll Be Thinking About It For Days!!'....uh, no! I left the theatre like 'That was not very good.' I mean, I never knew what the end was gonna end like, but I was never scared the whole time. I didn't jump once. I didn't think about it, except how disappointed I was, days after. It doesn't suck, don't get me wrong, but it is not scary at all.
The acting is wonderful, might I say. Haley is such a great actor. I've seen him in movies before and how good he was, but this was a major boost in his career! He had me crying when he explained about 'grandma's pin' in the car after the accident happened. Bruce also has a great role, too. I'm usually expecting him to be a badass/tough guy and it was great to see him caring and more down to earth in this film. Maybe I need to see this film again. Blair Witch was better the second time, maybe this one falls in as well. Blair Witch had me scared for days!! I even had to go camping in Blairville Georgia 3 days later! Anyways, I don't think it was the best film of 1999 by far, but definitely worth watching. I also think I was expecting more than it was, and it led to disappointment. I'm not dyeing to see it again, but I would sit down and watch it if a friend rented it one night at a sleepover.",Null,0,0,7 April 2000
