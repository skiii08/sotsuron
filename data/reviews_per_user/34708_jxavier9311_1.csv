Requiem for a Dream," Really makes you think, not bad, but disturbing.
","The outline of this movie is basically this... A lonely older woman named Sara Goldfarb is trying to lose weight and decides to take weight-loss pills... all the while not knowing her son, Harry, and his friend Ty, are becoming drug dealers.I saw this movie today and it is definitely one of the better substance abuse movies. It also shows the negative effects of drugs more graphicly than any movie I have ever seen. Id say 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'The Basketball Diaries' are the two drug movies that I would actually recommend seeing. There isn't much action in this film, but it is by no means boring. You really feel sorry for Sara. But... IF YOU CANT HANDLE DISTURBING DEPRESSING MOVIES, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Overall, its a movie that might change you and will leave you thinking. Id put it somewhere in between the top 20 and 30 movies I've ever seen.",9,2,4,31 July 2005
