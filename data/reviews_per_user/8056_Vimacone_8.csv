Men in Black 3," One of the Best Sequels
","Sequels are rarely as successful as their originals let alone better. Only a handful of sequels have been critically acclaimed. Most moviegoers of my generation have considered Men In Black to be a classic. And fans were generally underwhelmed by the sequel. Ten years later, a second sequel was made and it blows the first sequel out of the water.The time travel premise was intriguing. We get to learn about Agent K's backstory a little bit as it took place during one of the most significant moments in human history, the moon landing. Josh Brolin did an exceptional performance as a young Agent K. He nailed the personality and mannerisms perfectly. Like the bug in the first movie, the villain here is very entertaining, although he has a more debonair, but equally repulsive character. He is arguably the most interesting villain in the Men In Black films. The supporting character, Griffin, adds heart to the film and is the most endearing characters that has appeared in the trilogy.It would be criminal not to mention Will Smith's performance; Hilarious, witty, and awesome as always. Although the main attraction, in my opinion, is the young Agent K, Will delivers snappy dialogue in just about every scene he's in. Like when he's trying to coach K on delivering a sincere eulogy. The build up to the climax is very exciting and thrilling. More so than the original. All of these elements have made this one of the best sequels of all time.",10,0,3,7 December 2017
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," 101 Thrills
","The Animation Industry saw a decline by the mid 1950s due to increased production costs, change in business practices, and television. However, the artists still had a few tricks up their sleeves.Ub Iwerks saw the invention of xerox technology as a possible way to speed up animation production and bring costs down. After some tinkering, he modified it so that animation drawings could be xeroxed onto cels instead of having them hand traced. However, many scenes looked 'sketchy' as rough outlines of drawings were copied over onto cels. Ken Anderson got around this by stylizing the backgrounds and outlining everything, giving the film a unique look. They really got creative with this sketchy technology. Even the opening credits are the most intriguing of sequences to come from Disney.Despite, the setbacks with the xerox photography, this is actually of one Disney's greatest films all around. Animator Andreas Deja said a while back, that although the characters are stylized and sketchy looking, they still come across as very believable and relatable characters. What also makes the film very strong is the engaging flow of the story, supplemented by creative use of camera angles and perspective shots. There is never a dull moment in the film. The climax is done well timed and suspenseful, keeping the viewers of the edge of their seats.This is one film that I've enjoyed just as much when I was a kid as I do an adult.",10,1,1,22 April 2018
Mulan," Disney's Greatest Heroine
","I've considered Mulan (and Tarzan) to be the last great animated Disney features to be produced. A lot of comparison has been made between Mulan and Pocahontas in that most fans and critics consider Mulan to be a better film. While I do think Pocahontas is a great film, I do agree with that sentiment. Both films feature a strong and admirable heroine that break the mold of what their respective societies expect them to adhere to. Mulan is more successful in portraying the theme of breaking the gender roles. And Disney didn't whitewash the historical realities of how women were treated in Ancient China, which conveyed the theme so much stronger. Another aspect that makes Mulan a much more enjoyable film are the songs. Virtually every song (even the deleted songs) are very catchy and memorable.The supporting characters are also very memorable. Eddie Murphy seems like a curious choice for Mushu, but it works so well. Chein Po, Ling, and Yao bring comic relief to the trials of basic training and also to the dramatic war scenes. Disney had gone back to the appealing cartoony designs, reminiscent of their golden age animated features, at the start of the renaissance. However, like their films of the 1950's, they moved toward realistic designs for the human characters starting with Pocahontas. I believe this was a factor as to why Pocahontas was not as successful as say Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, because the drawing style lacked that Disney charm. In Mulan, only the comic relief characters (i.e Chein Po, Ling, and Yao) are drawn with that exaggerated cartoony look.Speaking of gender roles, this is a Disney film, billed as a 'Princess' film in later years, that can be enjoyed by both genders. In theory girls can appreciate the theme of hardship and pressure she goes through to fit the criteria of becoming an ideal woman and bride, while boys can enjoy the thrilling war scenes that are so brilliantly executed. But, both boys and girls alike can admire Mulan for her feat of twice taking down an entire army (almost single handed) that threatens her country.",8,1,1,12 August 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A Timeless Disney Masterpiece
","There are very few films that I saw as a child that I still enjoy as an adult factoring in both nostalgia and a critical evaluation. Most of Disney's critically acclaimed films fit that description. Beauty And The Beast was the earliest film I recall seeing in the theater. I didn't fully appreciate it at the time, but because it was so popular, I have a lot of memories of seeing it just about everywhere. The opening prologue, the musical numbers, Gaston, and the scene of Maurice getting lost in the woods stick out the strongest from my recollections.I don't recall when my appreciation for the film set in, but I've always enjoyed the Disney films with strong storytelling and great characters. And since it was one of the earliest then contemporary films I recall seeing, I do have a great affection for it. Watching it again as an adult, it holds up perfectly. The songs are catchy and memorable. The characters are very enjoyable. Gaston is a very entertaining yet dastardly villain. The character animation is on par with Disney's classic films, something I wish the studio would return to. Considering that for several years Disney had not had a major hit until The Little Mermaid, this no doubt was a pleasant suprise to critics. This is a prime example that a great animated film can still be enjoyed well into adulthood.",10,0,0,12 September 2018
My Neighbor Totoro," A Captivating Fantasy
","My Neighbor Totoro was the first anime that I saw. It was also the first time I saw writing other than English. I found it so captivating that it fixed my impression on Japanese animation for many years.Two girls and their father move to the country side in rural Japan, while the mother is in the hospital for tuberculosis (Drafts for the film place the setting in 1958).The girls encounter what their father identifies as spirits, which only children can see. The girls call them Totoros. As far is plot and story, there isn't a lot that goes on. Most of the scenes involve the girls interacting with the spirits. On paper that may not sound like an interesting film, but like Disney, Miyazaki really knows how to make sequences like this very engaging and captivating.There isn't any significant plot until towards the end, where the girls are told, through a poorly worded telegram, that their mother is sick. The youngest one attempts to walk to the hospital herself to see her (a two hour walk through dense farmland) and loses her way. Ultimately, Totoro and the other spirits save the day in a thrilling and captivating climactic sequence.My Neighbor Totoro was released on the same bill as another Ghibli film 'Grave of the Fireflys'. No two films can be more opposite. Since the latter was about two orphaned children at the end of WWII, thus making it a depressing film, it was decided to produce a more lighthearted film to release alongside it. But ultimately, Totoro became the mascot of Studio Ghibli and has gained iconic status in popular Japanese culture and later American culture.Totoro is a film that ranks alongside the greatest Disney films. It's a film that can be enjoyed by the entire family.",9,0,0,8 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Part 2 of Disney's Star Wars Trilogy
","Disney's acquisition of Star Wars has led to the production of further pictures, starting with a new trilogy.The first thing I noticed when watching this, was there was a lot more snarky dialogue than there was in the original and prequel trilogy. While both predecessors had mildly comic moments, this somewhat diminished the dramatic narrative. There are many parallels with the original trilogy. For those who haven't seen it yet, I will not mention them. Many of the characters from the original trilogy that were part of the rebel alliance, and a short appearance by Yoda, are also present, but they are depicted differently; likely because Disney probably doesn't have the original puppets. Yoda's guest appearance, in spirit form, to Luke has the best comic dialogue.Although Carrie Fischer died a full year before the picture's release, Princess Leia is still a major character and appears almost from start to finish. She's given a dedication in the end credits. I've wondered how Fischer's death will affect episode IX.As a science fiction picture, it's pretty good. But the advanced special effects technology still doesn't compare to the original trilogy. Although fans should not complain about the bad acting that was prevalent in the prequel trilogy.",6,0,3,13 January 2018
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The One a That Started It All
","Snow White remains the greatest achievement from the Disney Studio. Nowadays it seems hard to believe that there was once a time where many people thought the idea of a full length animated feature was preposterous and that people could have an emotional reaction to a cartoon was never considered. Snow White proved the naysayers wrong. For Disneys first feature, the artists did everything really effectively with timing, character development, storytelling, mood, and atmosphere. For me the elements that really grabbed me were the layouts, the dramatic moods, and of course the dwarfs. An interesting anecdote relating to Snow White's voice is that some of the people who worked on the film, including Disney himself, were irritated by her high pitched voice at times (I wonder how her voice actor felt about that).With over 50 animated films that have been produced from Disney in the decades since, Snow White remains one of greatest.",9,1,2,15 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Saga Unfolds
","Star Wars instantly became en grained in popular culture when it first premiered. I could imagine the anticipation moviegoers had when the first sequel was released. Sequels rarely match or surpass the originals, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered the greatest sequels for good reason. Instead of rehashing the plot elements and formula from the first, it builds upon it, with more suspense and unexpected twists. Granted, in this case it was part of a lengthily saga that called for more than one movie to tell the entire story.Of the films from the original trilogy, RETURN OF THE JEDI has always been my personal favorite, but this one has a more compelling story with danger, excitement, solid character development, and the unexpected twists that would leave audiences anticipating more in the next installment.Luke's introduction to and training under Yoda has many iconic scenes and dialog. I was always amused when a swamp monster attempted to eat R2-D2 and then spit him out ('Luckily you don't taste very good'). Harrison Ford's performance as the cynical Han Solo is excellent as always. The romance that builds between him and Leia was entertaining. The best sequences were at the end, when Lando unwillingly sets up our heroes at the cloud city for Darth Vader. I like how C3PO is the first to become aware of it before the others do as well as the audience. I especially thought Lando's revelation to Leia and Han about Vader setting up a trap for Luke was well delivered. Luke's battle with Vader was epic and terrifying along with an iconic and frequently parodied revelation. His timely rescue by Leia and Landa foreshadowed another revelation for the following film.I can see why this has been a favorite among Star Wars fans. What makes this one especially strong is that it ends in a cliffhanger. I can also imagine audiences anticipating the next film to see what happened next.",8,0,0,9 December 2017
