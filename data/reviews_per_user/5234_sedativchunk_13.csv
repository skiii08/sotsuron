Iron Man 3," Good Marvel film but has a few shortcomings
","Many years ago I was hardly a fan of any of 'The Avenger' movies. I'm a younger guy in my 20's but I always thought of them as kids movies until my friends took me to see 'The Avengers'. I was instantly hooked and watched all the previous Avenger films afterwards. With that being said, I was extremely stoked for the new Iron Man 3 movie and went to see it in the theaters on the day of the release. Without further ado, here is my review. Tony Stark is back as Iron Man. IM3 takes place shortly after the events of 'The Avengers'. The story mostly revolves around Tony Stark's mental well-being. After the events of the Avengers, Stark is dealing with severe anxiety and mental breakdowns that interfere with his work and role as Iron Man. Any mention of the events in New York City and Tony completely loses his cool. Meanwhile, a new villain arises known as 'The Mandarin' who, in a nutshell, is out to overthrow the worlds governments and seek out world domination.First of all, this has all the ingredients of a great Marvel film. State of the art CGI with lots of fun action and adventure in between. The acting by everyone was excellent as usual with some new, welcoming, cast members including Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. As usual there was also the classic Stan Lee cameo as well as a cameo by Linden Ashy as a military commander (Mortal Kombat/Resident Evil fans, anyone?). Lastly as with any Iron Man film, this has plenty of raunchy, comical moments with Tony Stark and his typical adult humor. Overall the typical ingredients of this film were great. But for all the good this film has, there were just a number of shortcomings that prevented this film from being a classic. Now for the downside. In IM3, the storyline is just bad. It's filled with too many inconsistencies, plot holes, and overall the movie just didn't work that well. For most of the film, Tony is coping with his mental issues. Too much of the movie seems to go on with 'Tony Stark' personal problems and not 'Iron Man' goodness. He spent about 90% of the movie out of his suit. Also the story all happens around Christmas time which is fine except it just felt a bit... strange, almost like this was made to be a holiday themed Marvel movie. The villain, as menacing as he was, just doesn't quiet hold up to all the other villains of the Avenger universe. And even though the CGI was good, there was 'budget' areas of it as well. There is a scene where a water tower gets destroyed and you could tell it was a mini model of a town getting dumped on with water. There also seemed to be a lot less CGI scenes in this one like they were trying to save money on it.Beyond the rather 'clunky' story telling, one of the biggest let downs of this film was the ending parts of the film. I'm not going to spoil the ending here but I personally didn't like it. As with any Marvel movie, after the ending credits role there is a brief scene of (usually) what is to come in the next Avengers film. Without spoiling it the scene after the credits I can safely say isn't very revealing and not worth staying through the credits for. Overall a good Marvel/Avenger film but just doesn't quiet hold up the predecessor films. The original Iron Man to me is still the best. The original film is one of those films that I would tell anyone to watch whether they liked the Marvel films or not. IM3 is not one of those films. If you don't know Tony Stark's backstory and your not that interested in the films, you might actually want to pass on this one. Good Marvel movie, not for everyone. And I'm sad to say it but it feels like they are running out of ideas of Iron Man. This felt more like a film milking the 'Iron Man' franchise for big box office money rather than something that was a real story teller. And it shocks me that any parts of it felt budget-y considering how big of money makers these movies are. Overall 7/10 average film, just not quiet what the other movies were. I would still recommend it though, if you remotely like the Avenger films it's still a great, fun movie to watch. Just not quiet where the originals were.",7,0,1,4 May 2013
Star Trek," Star Trek 09 - A Great Movie That Revisits the Classic TV Show Theme
","First off, I would like to say that I am a young but big fan of the original series and movies. I love the entire original cast and anything else just feels wrong to me. I've been very skeptical about this movie but because of all the hype, I decided to go ahead and see it. Amongst this, I wanted to give it a fair shot and not be biased against the new and young actors portraying the original cast. Well I have to say this movie delivers! I actually enjoyed it more than a few of the original six Star Trek films (not everyone of those movies was great if you seen them). One thing that's significantly been improved was the CGI which has sadly always been a burden for the original Star Trek movies. I thought special effect's were going to ruin this film though, by being over dowsed with it. But they don't! The classic negotiating and conversation that the original series had still exist in this movie.Another thing I really loved in this movie was the sound. Being a hobbyist music and sound producer, I think sound and music is a biggie when it comes to movies. The movie uses all the classic sounds from the original series and it throws in the classic, addicting TV show theme in at the end of the movie. Not only this, but visually, the uniforms, the Enterprise, everything was very accurate with the original series. This I like!Now to get on to some of the downsides. The biggest one... this movie was missing the original Captain Kirk! I don't care who you are, if you don't support the fact that William Shatner should have been in this movie, then you are not a true trekkie. I would have gladly rated this movie a 10/10 if Shatner was in it, but beings he was missing from the story, I cannot give it a perfect score. On the other hand, it was very nice to see Leonard Nimoy back one more time and hear his words of wisdom, but he is the only one of the original cast we get to see, although the storyline may have not made sense to throw in anyone else. Another thing that bothers me is the beginning of the movie with Kirk and Spock growing up. I felt that this area of the movie could have used improvements, especially with the very lame car chase scene. In the Star Trek universe, there is no law enforcement. And what's with the old car? This was a part of the movie that made little sense.I was overall happy with this movie but I will never forget the original cast who made the franchise so huge and I will continue to watch the original series. The movie is missing the 60's vibe and feel and it still feels wrong with so many of the original cast members missing. The portrayal of the original cast is almost dead on, especially with Checkov (his voice is a perfect match for the original). Zachary Qunito as Spock was excellent and Chris Pine played a perfect, egotistic Captain Kirk without trying to imitate Shatner. I recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans, young and old. It's still better than Next Generations if you are not a fan of Captain Picard and I think the movie should be given a fair chance. It's a nice flick and I just hope that it doesn't get thrown in the trash like the Lost In Space movie remake did!",7,2,9,9 May 2009
The Hunger Games," Great movie and looking forward to the sequel!
","Last night I decided to watch 'The Hunger Games' on Amazon Prime in my home theater. A couple years ago I was a full time student at a private college I transferred to where we were given 'The Hunger Games' book as an acceptance gift. I hate reading books and sadly never even skimmed through THG. I remember saying to a friend in these exact words, 'I think I'll wait for the movie'. Little did I know were we supposed to read the book and would have a dinner with the dean of the college to discuss it! Anyway, 2012 hit and this movie came out. Unfortunately with the release of so many other good movies (The Avengers, Spiderman, etc.) I passed on seeing this film. I finally sat down last night and decided to see what the hype was about. Despite having the book and so forth, I had absolutely no clue what 'The Hunger Games' was remotely about. Only that is was a very popular best-selling book. I was very hesitant and skeptical at first about watching this movie. But in the end, I'm glad I did and I really enjoyed it!Without going into great detail about the story, I have to say I found THG to be a fantastic film from start to finish. The story is very deep and compelling. The whole concept of this movie is very interesting. We think of children so lightly in our society today; to think of throwing innocent children into a battle arena for entertainment, it's just insane. Albeit the concept is incredible, I have to agree with other reviewers on here whom have read the book. Being a PG-13 movie, it seems that they slightly cherry-coated the death/slaughter of of the children. I think this movie would have been more powerful if they turned up the dial on the violence. But I understand that the movie is PG-13 and aimed towards teenagers, so in other ways it made sense to keep the violence i a certain minimum. Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal in this film. She is a great, dramatic actress who fit the role perfectly. It felt like Hollywood picked someone this time with talent before looks (although she is very cute). She absolutely blows away (in terms of acting) people like Megan Fox and Anne Hathaway who often give a stale performance and are there for eye candy more. Previously I was not a fan of hers from the media/spotlight that surrounds her, but I have to say I really enjoyed her work in this film. She is also the same age as me and for the level her work is at, it's just incredible. (also by the laws of man I have to ask, Jennifer Lawrence will you go on a date with me?)Besides the toned down violence, my only other complaints - I could tell that a lot was crammed into this movie to make it work. It seemed like the contestants/characters each could have had more back story (which from what I read online they did in the novel). Also, the ending was flat-out predictable. Other than that, fantastic film. Excellent camera work mixed with traditional (non-digital) film (which we rarely see anymore) combined with epic IMAX shots. The soundtrack was fantastic and the rest of the cast perfectly complimented Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Hollywood has a bright future with the new ensemble of actors who were in this film. I give 'The Hunger Games' an 8/10. It's not a game changer and young males/elderly viewers in particular maybe turned off from it. I'm a guy but in no way did I find this film negative, bad, or 'pro-feminist'. And although it has kids in in, it no way did it feel like a kids movie. It just felt like a good movie with a solid lead actress, almost reminding me Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise. If you like sci fi and want a good story telling, heart pounding movie, this film has it. and I am already considering seeing the sequels on the big screen!",8,0,4,9 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Wonderful Star Trek movie that any fan, old or new, should watch!
","I felt the need to write an honest (spoiler-free) review for this movie as I see a lot of hate for it. I'm a fan of yesterdays Trek; Shater/Nimoy, Picard, Voyager, DS9, Enterprise I absolutely love the old Star Trek universe. Coming into the first film in 2009 I was very open minded about it as I am a true Star Trek fan (I even went to my first convention this year in Philadelphia) and will watch the films regardless of them replacing the original actors. Although the 2009 film was a pretty good film and I agreed with the new cast, it did not satisfy my liking in rebooting the franchise. I wasn't crazy about the storyline and overall the film just fell a bit short of what I thought it should have been. Despite the negatives, I still enjoyed the 2009 film. With that being said, I absolutely had to see the sequel 'Into Darkness'. Today I went on to the U.S. release of ST:ID. I have to say, the entire movie was extremely engaging from beginning to end! There is not one second where I ever sat back and was disgusted or bored with any part of the movie. J.J. Abrams stepped up his game and delivered a true Star Trek movie this time around that should please fans both old and new!ST:ID takes place in the near future after the events of the 2009 film. Captain Kirk is now commanding the Enterprise and adventuring when a new enemy threatens the entire existence of Starfleet Command. I have to say as a fan there is not enough good things I can say about this film. The storyline, characters, even the sound effects on the bridge, it pays great homage to the Star Trek of yesterday while still being a fresh, new film. From beginning to end, we see plenty of Star Trek goodness. Lot's of starfleet command, meetings with admirals, a scene where a tribble is involved in some medical experiments, and even a very awesome scene where we see models of the first warp-capable ship from 'Star Trek: First Contact' and the NX- 01 Enterprise from 'Star Trek Enterprise' (a wonderful Easter egg/cameo for any real Star Trek fan). Also, not a spoiler, but we get a brief scene with the legendary one and only Leonard Nimoy reprising his role as Spock again! Lastly we see some other nice background stories finally started/told as well, like Carol Marcus, Kirks former lover from 'The Wrath of Khan'. One thing I absolutely loved about this film was the fact that it is going back to the 'story telling' roots of Star Trek. This movie has almost the perfect blend of stunning CGI while still having those classic one on one conversations between characters. J.J. Abrams camera work was also much better. Less moving/wobbling camera effects, less off-centered camera angles, and dare I say... much less lens flares! The villain was also much better this time. Instead of a ridiculous looking, angry, tattooed Romulan (that I have sadly say poorly tied in with the Star Trek universe), we get a very sinister, mysterious, and menacing villain. Without spoiling the movie I will say old school Star Trek fans will be pleased to know who he is! This is easily in the top two best Star Trek films of all time. One of the very few, very minor pet peeves I had with this film which is why I didn't give it a 10 star rating is this. Mr. Scott and Chekov (among others) had relatively awkward/strange roles in the film that I won't spoil. To put it in other words, there was just a very strange balance of on-screen time for characters at times which is why I docked one star from this review. My second main reason is, although the story was good, I think it borrowed just a bit too much from another classic Star Trek movie who's name I will not say. These minor pet peeves of mine, however, are very small and easily tolerated. The rest of the film was excellent and definitely worth the price of admission.Overall this was an excellent Star Trek film. Whether you are a newcomer to Star Trek, an old schooler, or something in between, I think this movie has something to make everyone happy. Without getting into details, many old school fans who claim they are 'true fans' of ST bash this movie greatly. I will say as a fan myself there is absolutely nothing wrong with J.J. Abrams, the new Star Trek universe, or any other parts of it. This is a great film and if you give the new cast a chance and sit back and enjoy the film, I promise you will like it!",9,8,16,17 May 2013
Suicide Squad," Jumbled mess from start to finish
","Let me begin by saying I love DC Universe and despite its hate, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Batman vs. Superman' and thought it was a pretty solid movie. I can't say the same for Suicide Squad. I was really looking forward to this movie but ultimately felt disappointed when I left the theater. This moving lacks in everything from acting, writing, storytelling, emotion, direction, editing, and even the sound mixing. Suicide Squad simply put is a jumbled mess, especially in the writing and editing department. Scenes are thrown together all over the place. There's no pacing and no proper 'arc' to the story. We spend a significant portion of the movie introducing the characters but not enough time actually growing to like any of them. One of the things that really bothered me about the story line and pacing (related to editing as well) is that, there was no real motivation to initially form the Suicide Squad by Viola Davis's character Waller. She just happened to put them together, then immediately following there was a big, terrorist attack by the evil enchantress and her brother. She just then happens to have the Suicide Squad available. Wouldn't have it made more sense for the terrorist attack by the enchantress to motivate wanting to use extremist 'bad guys' to fight her and not just conveniently have them? This is but one of many poor areas in both writing and editing of the film where things didn't make sense.Another thing that didn't make sense was Joker's involvement in the story. His character ultimately felt completely pointless to the storyline of this film. I almost feel as if they just threw him into this movie to make people want to see it because it would have the 'Joker' attached. I firmly believe the writing, story, and editing would have fit better if they weren't trying to give us some silly and pointless side-plots with the Joker. This movie also spends too much time back-tracking on past events about how the characters go to where they are instead of actually letting us learn who they are by dealing with their predicaments and situations in the movie. I have no real comments about Leto's Joker because his character was ultimately wasted and he never really had his proper place in the spotlight. Furthermore Suicide Squad is way too aggressive in throwing in classic-rock soundtrack anywhere where it seemed fit. I can't believe this is something I have to make a point about, but it's so bad that I have to. I don't mind a solid soundtrack to a film, but Suicide Squad thoroughly abused it. Instead of tastefully throwing in classic soundtrack from time-to-time in an effort to tell the story better, the movie just abuses it, throwing in classic soundtracks wherever it seemed fit. Furthermore, they often use the music in at wildly inappropriate times, and also blasts over dialog to the point where you couldn't hear what the characters were saying. How bad does a AAA-budget Hollywood film have to be to not even have a proper audio-mix? I ultimately felt like this movie was trying too hard to piggyback off of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' with the success of their soundtrack instead of trying to be original about it.If you've actually seen this movie, ask yourself the following question; who was the main character of the film? Was it Deadshot? Or Harley Quinn? Or the Mexican guy with fire, or the lizard man? Did you even remember the names of some of these characters if you aren't some die-hard comic book fan? And can you also properly describe some of the characters and why they're important? The point I am making here; the movie is easily forgettable. It failed to tell me a story or make me care about any of these characters. In fact, it made me not care about some of the characters so much, that I either forgot their names overnight or forgot they were even in the movie. Are those the qualities of a good quality, Hollywood film? Now the movie did try in some ways to do this. They gave some backstory to all the characters, especially the big-names like Deadshot played by Will Smith. Will Smith was fighting for his daughter, and wanted to prove he was more than a 'piece of crap' serial killer. But other than his character, who did they make us care about? Ultimately this movie is just a big mess. They tried to put too many characters in one film without us actually caring about any of them. This is easily a forgettable movie, which is a shame. It had a lot going for it. The action was solid, the costumes were solid, I liked most of the cast. But the story-line and character development were severely lacking. Follow by the the poor timeline of events followed by the mediocre editing makes this one film, I have to say you should pass on on this one. 5/10",5,5,8,20 August 2016
Interstellar," The 'Titanic' of sci fi, and the best of it's kind, period.
","I have seen Interstellar twice now. Once in IMAX on the big screen and now at home on blu ray in my home theater. Let me begin by saying I am a huge science fiction fanatic. I've watched everything over the years from the typical Star Trek and Star Wars films to the classics such as 2001, 2010, Forbidden Planet, the Terminator, both versions of the Day the Earth Stood Still, the 'Alien' franchise and many more including old B list movies such as 'The First Spaceship on Venus'. So I know science fiction. Strong above all, I consider Interstellar the best science fiction film ever made, period. If not, one of the top 10 best films made in the history of cinema. Great acting, great storyline, great visuals, captivating soundtrack, and overall just a solid film. Interstellar is the pinnacle of great filmmaking. This movie is truly a masterpiece from beginning to end. It only gets better when you rewatch it a second time, and unlike some films that are just eye candy in the theatre, this film looks and sounds great from the comfort of your home. The space scenes are brilliantly done and the alien landscapes are truly captivating. I simply don't know how to put it into words. Matthew McConaughey blew this one out of the water and then some, as well as the rest of the cast. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job with this film. There is simply nothing I can think of to say badly about this film. Whether you like science fiction movies or not, you should not pass up on watching Interstellar. This film is an epic masterpiece. Anyone bashing the science aspects of the film, plot, or other details are simply hating on this film because it is so good. And that's coming from someone with a college background in science and astronomy outside of my love for science fiction. This movie is not scientifically accurate 100% of the time, but it is easily overlooked at the general quality of the film itself. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Whether you like space flicks or not, this is a fantastic movie inside and out. I would rate it higher than a 10 if I could.",10,4,9,10 April 2015
Oblivion," 21st century sci fi masterpiece with Tom Cruise at his best
","I'm not even sure where to begin. But let me say this; whether you are or are not a fan of Tom Cruise or science fiction films, you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. Oblivion is probably the best science fiction film of the 21st century so far.Oblivion, without spoiling any major parts of the film, is a movie that takes place in roughly 60 years in the future. Earth is a savage wasteland ruined by nuclear war with an alien race. Most of the human race is said to have relocated to another world. Two people whom are a couple (with their past memories and life experiences erased) manage a high-tech station in the sky on Earth. Their daily routine consist of 'cleaning up' Earth by eliminating leftover aliens on the surface after the war using cybernetic killing drones. The main character Jack (played by Tom Cruise) goes out daily to repair drones that have been shot down or damaged.After a series of events unfold, Jack starts to discover the truth about the drones, the aliens, and himself. He learns that his mission is not what it was said to be. That's as far as my explanation can go without spoiling this film. Oblivion is based off of a novel, which I have not read, but after seeing this film I would love to pick it up sometime to see the similarities between each.Go see this film! Whether you are young or old, male or female, a fan of science fiction or not, there is something in this movie for anyone. Intense, action-packed combat scenes, state-of-the-art CGI, a telling and though-provoking storyline, a nice romantic subplot, and a SUPERB cast. Everything in this film was done perfect; music, picture, and the works, and everything was paced just right. Lastly whether you are a fan or not of Tom Cruise and the antics in his personal life, this is probably his best movie. Great acting, believable scenes and the supporting cast nailed it. Olga Kurylenko, Andresa Riseborough, and the legendary Morgan Freeman were the perfect choices for this film. Very few movies I give a perfect review for, this one gets it. 10/10.",10,2,4,11 August 2013
Man of Steel," Superman is back! Superb film!
","This is the Superman film I've been waiting for! I've watched Superman since I was a kid. Even back then, compared to other Superhero films, Superman always seemed to be the 'cheesy' superhero. The tights and cape. The cheesy flying scenes. Back then I was more a fan of Batman. I watched the Superman movie from 2006 and was disappointed like most others. With that being said, I seen the preview for this 'Man of Steel' while seeing a few other new films and had to check it out!Man of Steel rocks! Finally Superman was done right! First off, the GOOD side of this film. An awesome, new uniform (I couldn't stand the red underwear in the old ones!). Great story line, great cast, great villain, great soundtrack/CGI/FX, great everything. Fantastic film from beginning to end. A good twist to Superman while remaining loyal to the original concept. This movie definitely gives Marvel a run for their money this time! I enjoyed this more than the recent 'Iron Man 3'. Unlike the Marvel films this Superman stayed more of a serious superhero film. I don't mind a bit of comedy, but Iron Man gets a bit over top sometimes. The bad. Very minor things. This DID feel a bit 'kid-oriented' more than other superhero films (although that's not that bad a thing, right I mean they are KIDS movies at heart?). The fighting was all over the place and a bit over the top at times. One instance Superman smashes a guy into a familiar IHOP store where a kid from grade school is the manager... this among other scenes felt forced with very obvious 'product placement' scenes. Also the beginning seemed to hop between superman being old and young a bit too much. Lastly I felt the relationship between Superman and Louis Lane was a bit rushed and didn't have time to develop much. Besides the shortcomings this is a fantastic Superman film. I now hope that they continue to roll with it and make some epic sequels. In a perfect world we might even get a 'Justice League' film (and I do hear there is one in the works). It's nice to see another franchise make it big besides Marvel who has had their plentiful time in the spotlight already. I recommend this film to anyone whether you are a fan of Superman films or not. It's not perfect, but it's one massive step in the right direction and I would definitely watch it again (and again and again)! 8/10",8,2,3,23 June 2013
Twilight," Why all the hype?
","In the past few years, I've really gotten into the modern vampire scene on television. From CBS's Moonlight to HBO's awesome True Blood, I thought I would check out Twilight being a fan of vampire TV shows. Not to mention, I am also a big fan of movies and write a lot of reviews for them.Twilight is an interesting vampire movie and it grabs your attention only to let go in the middle of the movie. The movie is about a high school girl that moves to a new town and attends a new school with various mixed social groups. She discovers a group of weird kids who like to keep to themselves. Coincidentally, she takes an ecology class with one of the weird kids, and the story takes off from there. This is where the story and movie was actually good. The build up of the girl finding out about this strange kid she met. He saves her life on multiple occasions and eventually she finds out he is a vampire. Now where the story goes downhill. The build up of finding out the guy was a vampire was good, but then the execution of things afterward, everything starts to slip. The movie gets very silly and the story line has many loop holes. She visits the vampires house and family, and most of them are already willing to accept here as a member of their family. Let me say that again... most of them were willing to accept her as a member of her family! Are you kidding me? Hundred year old vampires and they just are totally cool with this other vampire taking in a girl he met in school a few weeks ago? Okay, but lets roll with it from there. As the movie continues, it just gets worse and worse. Eventually, they meet an enemy group of vampires and it just gets even worse from there.I don't want to spoil the end of the movie, so I will just say this; Twilight Sucks. It seems to me like too many unnecessary things were in the movie and the movie was executed in a way where parts of the movie are executed well and then other parts were rushed. I think the hype over this movie was just from young girls being obsessed with the main vampire in the movie. Overall, Twilight is worth a watch, but don't expect to be blown away. Beyond the story, the camera, lighting, and technical features of the movie were very nice, however, one thing was missing; where are the vampire's fangs?! We see some biting in the movie, but I missed the fangs. Music wise, some parts nice, some parts annoying. Artistically, this is a nice movie, but the story just sucks too much for me.",6,0,2,23 November 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Excellent film and among the best to watch in 3D!
","I'll try to keep this review short and sweet. I'm not a huge LOTR fan like some. I've never read the books and I've seen the first trilogy only one time each (and I did think they were great). But what I am is a movie fanatic/sci fi fan, and movies like The Hobbit are hard to pass up.First and foremost, story, CGI, acting, sound/score, all among the best. Peter Jackson knows how to take the viewer on a journey and make a fantastic looking film. The 3D in the movie is absolutely stunning. I'm not a fan of 3D but this movies special FX and even basic scenes like walking around were very convincingly done. If you get a chance to watch this in 3D, jump on the opportunity, it's worth it!My only complaint about the Hobbit (as well as the other LOTR movies) I think these movies are TOO LONG!!! It's not an entirely bad thing for a film like 'The Hobbit'. But I could go for a sweet flick just under two hours. It seems like these movies drag on for far too long, and to be honest, 'The Hobbit' is the worst of them all. There is a lot of side-track story telling in between and the movie just seems to drag on at some points. If you absolutely love these movies/books for LOTR then you probably like it being long. But as more the typical viewer, it's hard to stay interested for that long. Also, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but the way the movie ends was just kind of weird and obvious that there would be a sequel. All and all, still a great film. Despite the running time this is a great film and definitely worth checking out.",8,5,11,9 January 2013
2012," 2012 - Hits surprisingly high but still has it's cheesy moments
","Being an amateur astronomer with a deep interest in space along with being a fan of sci fi movies, I thought I would go check out 2012, the latest apocalyptic flick released to scare people into thinking the world is going to end.To start off, this movie is actually pretty good! I had very low expectations for it, but the movie has some intense, action oriented cinematic moments from beginning to end. If you a fan of action flicks and heart pounding action, then this movie is for you. Now for the obvious sides of the movie. If you are a scientific person like myself, you will probably hate this movie and bash the crap out of it. First off, most, if not all of the action sequences, are unrealistic. Crazy car driving scenes with the ground crumbling around the vehicle, planes taking off before they fall to their doom, it gets very unrealistic. Top that off with a relatively poor story line and inaccurate scientific facts about how the world is going to end, it can make some movie goers sick!Just to end it, 2012 has some good action sequences, and the average person will most likely enjoy it. But people who like scientifically accurate movies or movies with a well written story line should pass.",7,3,6,16 November 2009
Apollo 13," this is quite possibly my #1 movie
","I write this as Apollo 13 is on TV right now for about the third time this week. I've been a fan of Apollo 13 since this movie came out. This movie came out when I was five years old and was my first exposure to the world of the amazing Tom Hanks. I absolutely adore this movie. I dressed up as one of the astronauts as a kid in elementary school. Ron Howard's Apollo 13, to me, is simply a masterpiece. This is truly captivating film from beginning to end that tells the real-life tale of the Apollo 13 disaster. Everything about it just feels so authentic. Not just the amazing attention to detail with the spacecraft's and mission control. But to the acting and characters. The late Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, and even Clint Howard, everyone was so perfectly cast in this movie. True, grade-A acting from the whole cast. You really feel connected to all the characters on an emotional level. Ron Howard did his best work here. Everything about this movie and the directing and editing is perfectly executed. At no time to things ever feel like they drag on. Scenes are always appropriately cut between the drama of the spacecraft and the drama of Jim Lovell's family. We get a true sense of teamwork between the astronauts and mission control as they desperately work to solve each problem the dying spacecraft is having. I also commend the unforgettable soundtrack. From the uplifting main theme song to the dramatic moments of watching the CO2 meter go down, the soundtrack just perfectly compliments this film. Not just that, but the mix, appropriately hearing the sirens and alarms going off when things go haywire on the spacecraft. I just... I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie. I've watched this movie a thousand times in the past 20~ years and every time I watch it it feels like I'm watching it for the first time. My eyes are just constantly glued to the TV when it's on. I think I can say that this is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time. I own it on blu-ray. I've never not liked it. It's stood the test of time to me. It still looks great today. It's a good run time. It's not bloated with CGI like the films of the 2000's. It's just a telling tale about this real-life scenario of three astronauts nearly losing their lives on a mission to the moon. Whether you are a fan of space films or not, this is a must-watch if you have not seen it.",10,1,3,11 September 2018
Moon," Not My Flavor of Sci Fi but Decent Movie
","I just found out about Moon recently and decided to rent it and check it out. I am a big sci fi fan. I love Star Trek, Star Wars, and pretty much anything fact or fiction that has to do with outer space. Moon definitely looked like a great movie. Sadly I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. First off, the pluses. The acting is great. Sam Rockwell puts on a convincing, solid performance, and I know of him from Galaxy Quest. Kevin Spacey's voice is creepy and spooky for the robot and it fits the movie well. Although some set designs were overused, the set was very nice. Cool space station looking rooms with nice space fonts, computer screens, and slick space uniforms. Lastly, the sound mix for this movie is pretty good, nice deep bass sound effects, Moon is a great home theater movie.Now to the downsides. The CGI. The CGI is budget. Some scenes look great with the moon, space, and the planets, but then other scenes, the giant rovers look like toy plastic cars with too much lighting in some scenes and not enough in others. The storyline and movie in general are very boring at times. Parts of the movie I felt like I wanted to quit watching because they were boring (and some scenes showing blood being vomited were disgusting as well). Other parts of the story don't make sense or are completely uninteresting. The whole movie revolves around similar rooms and sets which gets boring with one actor throughout the whole movie. Also, GERTY was really corny. A futuristic A.I. robot with a smiley face screen? I thought that was really stupid and killed the movie. If GERTY was more serious in design, or even had legs and eyes, maybe I would find him more interesting. Lastly, the piano style music theme in the movie was really overused. There was hardly ever a change in pace or music throughout this movie.Moon is a teeter totter movie. Some parts are very well executed and catchy and then the next scene of the movie will either be boring, silly, or downright confusing. Either way, I think it's worth a watch from any sci fi fans. Many people here found this to be a 10/10 movie, I kind of disagree. I think regular movie goers should pass. Personally, I think the best sci fi movie made in the past few years is the 2008 flick 'Sunshine', about a ship with multiple astronauts trying to save the Sun from burning out. Much better thriller and sci fi movie for me. If anyone needs a good sci fi film, I recommend Sunshine over Moon, but if you think this movie is your style of movie, then check it out!",7,0,11,6 August 2010
