The Devil's Advocate," Dopey, dopey, dopey
","Another waste of time from Hollywood. What an obvious plot! C'mon, were any of you really surprised at any of the revelations (no pun intended) at the end of the movie? If so, rent 'Rosemary's Baby' and see what a good movie in this genre can deliver.Though usually a terrific actor, Al Pacino just hammed it up with an over-the-top performance -- especially when he shares the same film with the wooden performance of Keanu Reeves. No subtlety here. Unless we're supposed to be surprised that a guy named John Milton is the Devil. Ooooh, how deep!There's already enough comments from others on the unnecessary and gratuitous nudity, so I can't add to what's already been stated perfectly. If your idea of a good time at the movies is to turn your brain off and just be 'entertained' (as if you can't be entertained by a smart film!), then by all means check out this dopey flic.",5,2,6,25 January 1999
The Patriot," This is a really stupid movie
","I am aghast that this moronic film made the Top 250 list, faring even better than great films like KING KONG and NETWORK! Not to mention all the rave reviews listed here.I'm not saying it's the worst movie ever made. It's just another mediocre, dumb action movie posing as an important film showing what our forefathers supposedly went through for freedom. Why it's holding everyone's interest is beyond me. I was very bored watching it, because I'd seen it all before in BRAVEHEART and ROB ROY, except it was done better then. But what would you expect from the director of INDEPENDENCE DAY, another stupid film that made lots of money by using every cliche in the book to pander to the lowest common denominator of an audience!(BEWARE: SPOILER) For instance, when the oldest son supposedly killed the sadistic British colonel. C'mon, you knew the colonel wasn't dead because the cliched script dictates that he has to have a final showdown with Mel Gibson's character. For some reason, the director thinks he can surprise us, so he shoots the part where the son goes to make sure the colonel's dead in slooooowwwwww motion (an unimaginative way to convey suspense). And right at the last second, the evil colonel quickly turns around and kills the son with his sword. What nonsense! This son has shown that he is a cunning fighter. Why does he turn stupid all of a sudden and take his time (using a mere dagger yet!) to finish off this skilled opponent? The answer is that the director treats his audience like morons, knowing that they don't want to have to think -- they just want to be entertained. (Today's audience thinks `entertainment' is synonymous with `turning your brains off for a couple hours.')Then there's the cue card factor brilliantly contributed by `vdasher' in an earlier review. He is right on target and I urge you to read and reread his viewpoints from July 10, 2000. I can add nothing more to them.I don't mind the fact that people enjoy vapid crap like THE PATRIOT. I mainly criticize the idea that it belongs in the top 250 films of all time. It's not. And anyone who says it does is obviously very young and has no sense of film history and what riches the truly great films can offer.",3,0,1,11 July 2000
Ocean's Eleven," A movie that's beneath Sodenberg's talents
","I didn't know what to expect since I never saw the original and avoidedwatching the trailers as much as possible. It was hip. It was cool. But that's about it. I get the impression that's all they tried for. The acting was fine. The actors were all obviously having a good time making it. They're all criminals, but we end up liking them.
WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! Julia Roberts was put into the film for obvious reasons. First, she's bankable. With all these popular actors in it, some eye candy was wanted. After all, this takes place in glitzy Las Vegas. Polls have shown she's the most popularactress around. Plus her character serves a purpose where the Andy Garciacharacter can get burned even more than if their romantic subplot didn't exist. Personally, I agree she didn't need to be in it. The subplot of her and Garcia felt calculated to me. It was just there to make me feel better that Garcia lost twice to Clooney. It made no sense to me whatsoever for Julia Roberts to go back to Clooney. I thought she was tired of his days of theft and lying. If she didn't care about those things, she would have stayed with Garcia.
I'm often criticized for my lack of ability to suspend my disbelief and that I think too much about things that seem minor to others. But why are these guys evenbeing made to look cool and heroic anyway? They just ripped off 3 casinos ofmany, MANY millions. Doesn't a lot of this money go to pay wages of lots ofworkers who need the money more? Doesn't a lot of it pay taxes in the statethat serve the citizens of Nevada? Who's going to make up the loss? If thecasinos get reimbursed by insurance, won't that mean higher premiums forthose who can afford it the least? Another thing that bugged me is how can they even get away with it? I assumethat the casinos aren't really run by only Andy Garcia. Wouldn't the mob have a strong hold in it as well? I doubt they would appreciate the loss and would use all their power and influence to find the thieves. How did these guys build an exact replica of the vault? Why did Andy Garciaallow Matt Damon to go the room alone? Why did he release George Clooney tothe police? If he really suspected Clooney and was as heartless as we'resupposed to think he is, why wasn't the truth tortured out of Clooney?
The answer to all these questions is that the movie is just there to pander to the audience and make them think they're cool. We're made to like them fromthe start because they're good-looking, friendly, use hip language, dress well, drink and eat the best liquor and food, hang around with celebrities, and know how to gamble against boring kids. I like Sodenberg's movies otherwise. I'm a fan of SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE;OUT OF SIGHT; ERIN BRONKOVICH; and especially TRAFFIC. And I really have toget around to check out KING OF THE HILL and KAFKA. But this movie wasbeneath him. Take away the slick camera works and the moving subtitles andcredits and you have a very lame story.",5,0,1,14 May 2002
Independence Day," I'm pleased to read so many bad reviews
","I've been reading the comments and am very encouraged to read so many reviews trashing this stupid film. My co-workers loved this movie and think of me as a snob for revealing what a piece of garbage it is. No need for me to reiterate why I think it's so bad. The reviews before me did a much better job than I could.I am disheartened, however, to know that it made a ton of money and will encourage Hollywood to spew out more swill like it, instead of thought-provoking science fiction like 'Contact' and 'Blade Runner' because those type of films don't make as much money.To those of you in power in Hollywood, PLEASE LISTEN! Read these reviews and learn. If you're going to spend a lot of money on terrific special effects and a star-studded cast, spend some money on a terrific science-fiction writer (for a change) and let him/her write what he/she wants with no or little studio interference. A science fiction movie can have great effects, great cast, lots of action, AND smarts. And it can make money too, if you promote it right.",4,5,8,11 March 1999
The Green Mile," Bah! Sentimental hogwash!
","I was very disappointed in THE GREEN MILE. Do all the characters have to be either sooooo squeeky clean good or sooooo horribly evil? And what's with the supernatural element? Who can identify with people like these? I'm not asking for it to be documentary-like realistic, but c'mon. There's no depth of character in this film that's trying to make you think there's an abundance of it by telling the story at a slow pace and making pretty speeches with noble music playing behind it.Tom Hanks is a terrific actor, but he can do these goody-goody roles in his sleep. I wish he would stretch himself more. No, I didn't cry watching it, but I thought about it when I realized I paid full price to see it in the theater.",Null,0,1,10 March 2000
Blade Runner," Still outshines the others 17 years later
","Blade Runner belongs on a list of 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out of the theater in a stupor as though hit by a sledgehammer, the first time I saw it. It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called 'entertainment' we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the 'happy ending' because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. 'I don't know how long we had together. Who does?' But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.After 'Blade Runner', most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an 'oldie' like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.The more I think of it, the more I realize that 'Blade Runner' is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre. I wish Ridley Scott would return to science fiction, but then again today's Hollywood would never release a movie like 'Blade Runner.'",9,348,456,5 August 1999
Contact," Finally! Some intelligent science fiction!
","I love this movie. The special effects seemed to be there to support the plot, rather than to be there just to dazzle. The plot actually dealt with intelligent themes, especially theology which usually scares away screenwriters.True, it's not perfect. I didn't believe that someone as young as Palmer Ross would be appointed to take care of the 'religious' part of the decision committee, especially since he isn't even ordained. I could've done without the Tom Skerrit character and the subplot of him winning and then dying. And it was very distracting and unnecessary to have Clinton in it.These are minor carps. And more than made up for by sequences showing that the first signal returned was Hitler. How chilling. Or the opening sequence which uses the powerful sound of complete silence.Those I've encouraged to see it were disappointed for the most part. There were no big climaxes or explosions or zooming spaceships with overlords in cool imposing costumes. Instead they had to endure emotions, philosophy, theology, and science. The concept of thinking during a movie turned them off. To them the definition of 'entertainment' is to turn the brain off and forget the rest of the world for two hours.If this is your movie philosophy, you may prefer empty-headed but special-effects sci-fi extravaganzas like Independence Day. If you don't mind a science fiction film of a slower pace that offers riches to your mind, you'll enjoy Contact.",7,0,2,25 June 1999
