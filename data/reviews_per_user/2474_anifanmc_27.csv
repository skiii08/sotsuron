The Avengers," A cinematic Marvel in more ways than one
","When the first Iron Man film came out, the studios behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe were embarking on something truly unprecedented in modern cinema. Iron Man was a relatively under-promoted movie with trailers that showed barely the surface of what to expect. I went to the midnight screening of the movie with a number of friends as a social outing, while they were the ones who were truly Marvel comics fanatics. By the end, I was absolutely blown away by the strength of the movie in both its action and gravitas. And after the credits, when Nick Fury arrived played by Samuel L. Jackson to announce 'The Avengers Initiative', I was both excited and skeptical.Although I wasn't an avid comic book fan at the time, most people my age knew who the Avengers were - the 'World's Mightiest Heroes', comprising such characters which would be almost ludicrous to depict on screen. In this day and age, who would take a movie about Captain America seriously? Or Thor, who I knew of primarily as a chief Norse god and not a superhero? And yet, one by one, each of the movies blew away all my preconceptions and expectations.The Avengers, the result of four years of meticulous buildup and hard work, does not disappoint. I am by no means a Joss Whedon fanboy, but you could see his work ingrained in the dialogue, the scripting, and the loving attention paid to a universe that he, as a comic book fan, clearly cares about. I remained skeptical all the way until I was physically sitting in the theater that this could be anything but an action orgy, yet through the most unlikely situations, they gave the film a heart.The premise is surprisingly simple - Loki, Thor's brother from his film, is preparing to invade the Earth with the help of an unknown benefactor and an army called the Chitauri (who are in fact the Ultimate Marvel version of the notorious Skrull - minus the shapeshifting ability) while taking advantage of the artifact known as the Tesseract (which the fans of the comics would recognize as the Cosmic Cube). SHIELD's Nick Fury, recognizing the threat, tries to bring the team together with Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and the out-of-time Captain America, while consulting Dr. Bruce Banner, whose angry side has been kept under control for some time, to help find the Tesseract. The initial interaction between them is, as expected, not a cordial one, though you do see the beginnings of some deep friendships beginning, including one between Stark and Banner - evidently brought together by a penchant for genius. While there are numerous shorter action sequences stringing the film together with character setpieces, the finale of the movie culminates in one of the most brilliantly shot 30-40 minute action sequences I've ever seen. The third Transformers movie attempted something similar, and failed at it, where this truly succeeded.A few things really stand out in the movie. The first is the evolution of Tony Stark's character. In previous movies the main thing that had really been explored were (a) his ego and (b) his quest for redemption; as Rogers puts it, however, he seems to only fight for himself and is 'all about style'. Yet, in this film, he manages to portray not only a semblance of heroism, but participates in one of probably the most heroic acts depicted so far in a superhero film. His relationship with Dr. Banner manages to underscore just how strong his character has become - where the other team see Banner as a ticking 'time bomb', as he aptly puts at one point, Stark believes that not only did the Hulk save Banner's life, it is something of his nature to be embraced and taken control of instead of feared. And ultimately, the faith he shows in him proves to be right.Another strong element of the film, as in most Joss Whedon productions, is the uplifting of a strong female character, namely Black Widow. Natasha Romanoff had a bit part in the second Iron Man film, but wasn't the real focus of the film nor was she fully explored as a character. This film provides a strong focus into her psyche as a master assassin and highlights her relationship with Hawkeye, the master marksman. She's surprisingly one of the film's most inscrutable characters, showing only enough emotion as she needs, but being capable of great loyalty, compassion, and heroism. Despite her and Clint Barton being the two 'non-superheroes' on the team, they provide an absolutely integral part of the team; their role is irreplaceable on the team and they kick as much butt as the rest of the hyper-powered team members. At no point in the movie did I feel like any one super hero was used to prop up the others like a crutch.And finally, without a doubt, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of both Bruce Banner and the Hulk is probably one of the best ever to hit the screen. Previous movies had touched on the strength of the Hulk and his potential for limitless strength while highlighting Banner's genius and compassionate nature, but it has never been done quite so well. He steals the movie, ultimately surpassing all expectations against all the odds. He grows rapidly (both literally and figuratively) throughout the movie, gaining a new sort of confidence. Before the film I wasn't a huge fan of the Hulk, but after-wards, I have infinitely more respect for the character - mixed in with a touch of respectful fear.This movie is definitely worth watching in theaters, on the big screen. The experience is 100% worth it. All I can say is, The Dark Knight Rises has a lot to live up to if it hopes to do anywhere near as well as this monster of a film.",10,7,15,28 May 2012
Mission: Impossible III," What Mission Impossible is all about!
","This was genuinely one of the first movies of the summer that I enjoyed when it came out. I was in India at the time, so I was lucky to see it in a movie cineplex which offered undubbed English versions of films, and it was worth it. I didn't expect much from it initially but it was literally an adrenaline ride all throughout - sheer action, not the stylized nonsense that was MI:2.JJ Abrams' direction and Orci/Kurtzman's writing team is absolute ace in this film. The plot feels like a real return to Mission Impossible - instead of a megalomaniacal Bond-esquire plan as in the second film, we have an arms/bioweapons dealer who wants to acquire a very expensive, very dangerous bioweapon of unknoown power referred to as the 'Rabbit's Foot'. Ethan Hunt is sent from retirement from active duty to rescue his former trainee, who has been captured by the arms dealer. The mission fails at almost literally the last second, but not before she's able to tell Ethan of a traitor inside of IMF (hearkening back to the first film). Ethan's wife is eventually captured by the arms dealer, and, driven by revenge, he goes to heavy lengths to retrieve her and bring the dealer to justice.This film has a slew of strengths. Tom Cruise, for all of his media publicity and stunts, is an amazing actor, and he delivers the familiar Ethan Hunt while adding something new to his role. Ving Rhames comes back as Luthor Stickel, his partner, and he has three more wingmen in his crew, two of them played by Simon Pegg and Maggie Q. All of them, while relatively underdeveloped, play their parts well. My biggest problem with the second Mission Impossible has always been that the movie threw out the essence of the Mission Impossible TV and film franchise - namely, teamwork - to create a movie starring a character from the Mission Impossible series in a James Bond plot playing a James Bond style character. While this is good for James Bond, it is terrible for Ethan Hunt, who plays the pointman but actually has significant backup from the others on his team. This isn't to say Hunt's character isn't memorable - he's still the main hero of the story.The most impressive performance probably comes from the villain, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's not invincible or more powerful than the heroes, but he causes some pain and suffering to them which was quite a shock to me. The only weak point of this film, I believe, is the underdeveloped romance between Ethan Hunt and his nurse fianc√©e/wife who ends up kidnapped later in the film. Although well intentioned as a plot device, you don't really feel anything for her on your own. The emotion and sense of suspense comes from Cruise's acting as Ethan Hunt, not from the actress.Otherwise, the action sequences and character pieces are brilliant. Most of the negative reviews that I've read have been nasty diatribes on Cruise's character in his personal life - which, while admittedly shady, have no bearing on his excellent performance in this film. If they made a fourth one in a similar bearing, I would probably line up to watch it.",9,0,1,17 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two words: Jar Jar
","I'll admit, the first time I saw the ads for this movie, I was hooked. I thought it was going to be off the wall, particularly since I was, well, eleven years old and I liked anything in movies which was flashy. And at that age, I loved the film when I went to watch it. It was fun, fast, and fantastic. Explosions, lasers, spaceships, what else could a kid ask for? Then I grew up. I watched the movie again when I was seventeen, and all I could do was gape in horror. I could have sworn I saw a different movie as a child, but going back through it, I couldn't believe that I had liked it so much. It really reminds me as to how my tastes have changed and how what I look for in a movie has changed. As an addition to the Star Wars saga, I didn't begrudge it at the time simply because it was, well, another chapter in the Star Wars saga. I loved watching one of my favorite film franchises play out on the big screen. But frankly, in retrospect, I think (right now at 20 years old) it should have been avoided entirely.Where to start? The writing of this story was abysmal. The writers were looking for some sort of 'main bad guy', so they concocted the Trade Federation, a corporate conglomerate of evil. A good idea in principle, but terrible in execution. Instead of being composed of a variety of aliens, humans, etc. it's composed of a single type of alien who seem so stereotypically modeled after the 'greedy Asian' model that it would make the person who designed the pathetic Klingon stereotype for Star Trek: The Original Series cringe. The fact that they all had thick Japanese accents didn't really help. So point one was that Lucas apparently didn't know how to write a good story without including some bad stereotypes.The second point was the introduction of the Jedi. Liam Neeson's role as Qui-Gon Jinn was perhaps the high point of the film, since he's already known for his acting prowess; in fact, it's hard to find talent like his. The problem is that everything Liam Neeson brings to the screen is offset by the horrible dialogue scripted by Lucas. As Yoda would perhaps say, stilted one-liners and poorly written expository statements a Jedi does not make. Ewan MacGregor didn't bring much to the role either, although I will admit, his character is far more in keeping with his elderly Alec Guinness counterpart.The third and worst clincher is, of course, Jar Jar Binks. This godawful Caribbean-stereotyped character whose sole purpose is to fall on his face and annoy the characters at every turn seems to try the patience of every person who is sitting in the theater. He not only is unfunny, but all of his scripted lines consist of making stupid noises and funny (not) faces. The reason people connected with Chewbacca even though his entirety of dialogue was in growling was due to his interaction with Han Solo. Jar Jar Binks' interaction with the other characters makes people want to slice his head off.And last but not least, Anakin Skywalker. Seriously. What kind of whiny runt of a kid grows up to become a Dark Lord of the Sith? Granted, the actor was something like 13 years old, but his acting was atrocious. Lucas decided to conceive him as some sort of virgin birth in order to give him some sort of mystical quality and that quickly backfired when we find out that he complains ALL THE TIME. He also manages to end up being the hero because he randomly shot off a couple of torpedoes... what? The reason Luke was able to fire off torpedoes and destroy the Death Star was because of his attunement to the Force. Anakin just fired like a blind idiot. Out of character and out of whack.I can't give this film a lower rating than it already has because, frankly, it's got better writing than the other two prequel trilogy films, which just shows you the abysmal depths to which Lucas has sunk the franchise.",5,2,4,15 January 2009
Star Trek," The greatest Trek film of the new era, and one that is sure to live long and prosper
","I have rarely been able to go to the movie theater and say 'wow, that was a great film. It was completely worth paying 15 dollars to see it in IMAX', since with a rough economy, I find it hard to justify taking out the time to watch films in the first place. Not only that, but many movies are essentially television episodes produced for the big screen, and don't take full advantage of the scope that a film can provide. Star Trek did that, and more, and topped it with icing and whipped cream while providing a relatively coherent narrative with an epic scope combined with special effects that truly blew me out of the water.I had come to the film with high expectations, and was not disappointed. The strength of the film is apparent from the very beginning, when you witness the birth of Kirk and the death of his father thanks to direct meddling with the timeline by a crazed Romulan by the name of Nero, who's been thrown back in time inadvertently by a black hole. You later learn the black hole was created by collapsing a rampaging supernova that was consuming the galaxy, and before it could have been collapsed it destroyed Romulus, his home planet.The film cuts to Spock and Kirk's childhoods, and their struggles growing up. Spock's Vulcan classmates refer to his mother as a 'human whore' and he has trouble controlling his already massively turbulent emotions (which are because of his being half-Vulcan) due to his half-human nature. Despite being trained in the Vulcan art of emotional suppression, the Vulcan high council recognizes his abilities but always holds him on an inferior emotional level because of his dual species parentage, and he leaves them for Starfleet. Kirk, on the other hand, is being raised by his abusive stepfather, and despite being intelligent and intuitive, he's become a drunkard and a bruiser with no sense of direction to take in his life. That all changes when he meets Captain Pike, who tells him of his father's heroics, and he resolves to show his mettle by enlisting in Starfleet and earning his stripes as a starship captain.In this sense, the film gives heavy precedence to the growth and story of Kirk and Spock, who embody the central presence in the film. They aren't friends at first sight, unlike the original series, and come to clashes when Kirk cheats on an infamous test (but if I told you what, I'd be giving too much fun things away!) that Spock designed. The interaction between the characters is far from awkward, and Quinto pulls off Spock's Vulcan stoicism with a passion. You can see his emotions beneath the surface, much like Nimoy, and he still possesses the casual sense of humor. This is perhaps the strongest part of the film, in that the cast members and everyone involved are not only good at their roles, but they bring to it a vitality that hasn't been seen in science fiction cinema for a long time. For all the insane criticism i've seen for them being young, that's *exactly* what we need - a younger, dynamic cast who can really bring energy to these roles. Even the minor roles, like Jennifer Morrison as Kirk's mother, were done so well I was convinced with their acting from the outset.The space battles and SFX were, as I said, amazing, and it really gave dimension to the universe and to the scope of the Federation. My favorite scene is probably the orbital dive. The complete soundless space, no music, nothing except for the breathing in their masks, and then the boom of entering the atmosphere - this shows Star Trek at its best, able to use spectacle in an artistic form. The sound effects were cool and tuned to sound different, but at the same time quite faithful to the original (the beaming noise effect, the warp drives engaging, etc). I was particularly impressed with the soundtrack, which conveyed the urgency portrayed in the film and the fast paced action, while providing somber setpieces and a thematic tune for places like Vulcan.I was most surprised by the vast emotional undercurrent in the film, particularly in choice scenes. The opening scene during Kirk's birth, where his mother is escaping in the shuttlecraft and his parents are trying to decide what to name him - all as his father, George Kirk, sets the Kelvin on a collision course and to his death - was one of the saddest, most poignant scenes in the entire film. I could actually see people crying in the theater. Another scene that stands out in my mind is where Spock meets his older self near the end of the film. The exchange shows the personal chemistry between Quinto and Nimoy, and it's quite believable that Quinto is playing the younger version of Nimoy's Spock.I will warn the hardcore fans however that this movie does take considerable liberties with star trek canon. This didn't really bother me in the slightest, as it was (1) taking place in an alternate universe, and (2) has basically revived a dead franchise, but if you are easily bothered by things or take it too seriously, you're better off not watching the film. If you enjoy good cinema on the other hand, this is the movie to watch/rent when the time comes.This movie is the must-see of the year, if anything else. It's made for the big screen, and you'll feel your money was well spent, at the very least. It's the beginning of a new adventure, and as I said, I hope this new franchise will live long and prosper.",10,7,16,15 May 2009
The Mummy," A thrill-ride!
","This is one of the movies that'll probably be known at some later date as a film classic for the simple fact that it combines the jovial nature of a comic-book-style action adventure with damn good acting. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz at their best.The story is fairly straightforward. An Old Kingdom Egyptian priest, Imhotep, was sentenced to eternal imprisonment and live mummification through a curse after having an affair with a Pharoah's mistress and murdering him. Thousands of years later, a bunch of people wake up the no-doubt very angry mummy, who unleashes his wrath upon the world. Rick O'Connell, an ex-legionary and mercenary for hire, takes it upon himself along with Evelyn to rid the world of Imhotep.A must-see.",9,0,0,27 May 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Do not, for the love of god, see this movie
","This movie insulted my intelligence both as a movie connoisseur and as a scientist. Although it's pretty undeniable that some form of climate change influenced by humanity is occurring, probably for the worse, this movie takes that idea and essentially rapes it through sensationalism and then further destroys any hope of redemption through terrible acting and casting.The movie centers around the idea that human activities are influencing the onset of a new Ice Age, which is arriving far more rapidly than they initially thought and inducing massive hurricane blizzards across the northern hemisphere. The main character's son gets trapped in the blizzard and he has to go and rescue him, blah blah blah, politics politics politics, *SNORE*.No, in all honesty, it's impossible to write a fair review for this movie because it is that god-awful. The plot is stupid and sub-par at best. Jake Gyllenhaal has shown he has some ability to act in some other movies, so I will spare him for the time being, but the girl who was cast alongside him as his love interest (in the middle of a life-threatening blizzard, no less) was possibly the single worst actress I've ever seen on the big screen. Dennis Quaid's acting was probably the worst I've seen of any of his movies.Emmerich has done some good movies, but I don't know what the hell possessed him to do this. Don't even bother renting this or hell, even pirating it.",2,1,3,27 May 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Cap doesn't disappoint
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong, it seems--with nearly every film release closer to their Avengers extravaganza, we get a new style of storytelling which seems to show just how diverse the universe really is. With Iron Man, we get a balls-out action flick with glitz, glam, and some great character. With The Incredible Hulk, we got a taste of a genuine love story. In Thor, we got a fantasy epic which took an old story and made it incredibly new. And finally, Captain America takes classic war movies like Patton, adventure movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark, and superhero films, and puts together an amazing amalgam which works well.The story is one of the oldest in comic book history but they manage to distill it down to its core for the uninitiated: Steve Rogers, a puny kid from Brooklyn, wants so badly to join the army to fight evil and serve his country, but keeps getting turned down because of his laundry list of medical problems and his stature. Eventually he captures the eye of Dr. Abraham Erskine, a German defector who was horrified with Hitler's rise to power, and he becomes the test subject for a super-soldier serum that augments Rogers' strength - not just physically, but emotionally, building upon his inherently good character. This forms the core of the movie, as Erskine repeatedly states that no matter what Rogers becomes, he should 'stay a good man'. And he does. He eventually comes head to head with the Red Skull, the head of the Nazi science division, Hydra, who has ambitions of his own to take over the world using a device he calls the 'Tesseract' (which most comic book fans might recognize as the infamous Cosmic Cube!).The movie itself is written and directed beautifully. It doesn't rely on the superhero clich√©s of the guy who falls from grace or has some sort of personal problems, and then has to work to overcome them or become humbled. Thor in this respect, despite its originality, was very much a typical comic book film. The Cap isn't full of personal problems - sure he's a weakling at first, but what matters most is his convictions and his character, and that's what shines throughout the movie. Repeated scenes in the movie showcase this and really allow us to see what makes the Cap unique. Is he perfect? Well, he has trouble talking to women, sure. But he's not tempted by evil, greed, or selfishness.More than anything, I love how this movie starts to really tie the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe together. We meet Howard Stark, the father of Tony Stark, with his Howard Hughes-esque personality. The Cosmic Cube is a gift to mankind from Odin, and the various references to Yggdrasil, the Nine Realms, etc tie in the cosmic mythos built up in Thor. And at the end... without giving away too much... we finally see SHIELD enter the picture.This movie is worth your money at the theaters. 9/10.",Null,7,13,31 July 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Fantastic ending to a soon-to-become legendary spy trilogy
","As the followup movie to The Bourne Supremacy, Ultimatum thrills, excites, and never fails. As a masterpiece of action, this film rockets from one action scene to the next without dipping into (much) unrealism and retaining the solid grit of real-time espionage, far removed from the rather bubbling optimism and invulnerability of the older Bond movies.The story picks up exactly where Supremacy left off, with Bourne heavily injured in Moscow after tracking down the daughter of Vladimir Neski and apologizing to her for her parents' death. The story jumps ahead a month and a half into the future and the existence of a new black ops program called 'Blackbriar' (alluded to in the first film) is revealed as an upgrade to Treadstone 71. This organization has the illegal authorization to murder anyone that its handlers deem necessary. A reporter stumbles upon the information from an inside source and following publication, is targeted by the same organization. Bourne tracks him down in order to find out who the source is, inadvertently causing the black ops team to believe Bourne is the source. Only director Pamela Landy, having understood Bourne's motives, is aware of the real circumstances surrounding Bourne and believes him innocent, and combined with her heavy disapproval of Blackbriar causes her to aid Bourne in his quest to discover the initial mastermind behind Treadstone.Bourne enlists the help of CIA analyst and psychologist Nicky Parsons, fresh from the previous film, in order to discover the identity of the handlers at Blackbriar while being tracked by assassins across Europe and North Africa. Upon locating the headquarters of Blackbriar in New York City, he returns home to discover the horrible secret involving both his true identity and the brutal process of his induction into Treadstone 71.The film manages to keep the storyline simple, yet enthrall the viewer and allow them to understand what is going on without boring them. A few key elements distinguish Ultimatum from its predecessors, including the presence of multiple car chases with sharp, kinetic action sequences instead of a single, drawn out chase. As the final act in a trilogy, Ultimatum is also chock-full of references to its predecessors and lines are echoed which, in context, finally make sense. Subtle and not-so-subtle elements of suspense are combined in conjunction with good scripting to make one very, very good movie.",10,1,3,22 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Immensely good start to a two-parter
","It's sort of unfair to have to do a review to the Part 1 of a movie since there were a lot of plot threads left hanging (as intended) but for the most part, it stands on its own as a fairly decent film. It's probably one of the most faithful in terms of adaptation to the novel (with a few extra scenes added in for emotional and dramatic effect), which has the dual effect of being very good for the fans but not necessarily the most coherent for people who haven't read the books. That's why I gave it a 9 out of 10 for the most part.The movie starts off on a strong note, more or less where the novel began (with a short, rather shocking prologue where Hermione wipes her parents' memories to protect them) at Malfoy Manor, where Voldemort discusses how he wants to kill Harry Potter, and so on and so forth. For the next thirty minutes or so it follows almost *exactly* from the novel in terms of events progression (though they cut out a few relatively disposable characters like Tonks' parents). There's a fantastic aerial battle over the skies of England (and oddly on the streets as well, apparently us nonmagical people don't notice anything), with the aftershock and the reading of Dumbledore's will, etc, etc.Then this is where the movie REALLY begins - the Ministry is taken over by the Death Eaters, Voldemort's faction, and they start a manhunt for Harry and his friends, and begin to round up 'undesirables' in what is basically a campaign of genocide. This is an eerie depiction for Harry Potter novel fans and a chilling one for those who have read stories of the Nazis, Stalinists, etc. as they realize just how evil Voldemort's plans really are. I was a little amused to see they played the trope straight and installed a cadre of blackshirts in the new Ministry of Magic, ready to carry out their shadow Fuhrer's orders.There's a lot of complaints about the second half of the movie, which slows down considerably, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione getting lost in the woods as they are forced to run and hide in any way they can but without any sort of real plan of action - and this definitely induced some ennui. Even I was forced, at times, to push myself to keep watching the scenes with the understanding that it's going to get crazier and crazier.Unfortunately a few things aren't handled properly; Firstly, the whole subplot about Dumbledore's childhood and past, and his relationship with Grindelwald is sort of rushed and mangled as though they had saved it up for an 'extended version'. I doubt most of the viewers who haven't read the books know who the heck Grindelwald is (basically the magical equivalent of the German Fuhrer during the Second World War) and how he figures so importantly into the plot; I'm HOPING they make that more clear in the second movie. The other thing that wasn't properly explored was the concept of the Deathly Hallows (again something I'm sure they'll give more time to in the second film), since they sort of went from having it explained to them to being bombarded by Death Eater explosives and then going on a chase through the woods and then holycrapthemovieisalmostover.Anyway... remaining cautiously optimistic for the finale, I'm sure it'll be fun, but hopefully it makes clear some of the weaker points of this film.",9,0,1,14 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Brilliantly done
","Prizoner of Azkaban is definitely one of my favorites out of the seven Harry Potter novels, although perhaps not my favorite. However, I can say without reservation that until the next two films come out and I can pass judgment on them, this is my favorite of the film series. Cuaron's genius at direction and writing is easily tangible in this instant classic.Azkaban starts much the same way as the previous two films - at the Dursleys. It sticks to the plot of the books well, modifying it where necessary. He first manifests his latent anger and frustration as an abused orphan by blowing his aunt up into a helium saucer and letting her float out the door. He goes on the run and ends up being picked up by the Ministry of Magic, saying that for his safety, he'd best remain indoors and out of sight. Over the course of the film, he learns that an ex-convict and alleged Death Eater, Sirius Black, has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban - a feat which has never been accomplished before - and he's coming after Harry to kill him. As Harry further unravels the mystery surrounding Black's escape and why he's the target, he learns something about his legacy which changes his life forever and sets him out on a quest for vengeance.As a film, Azkaban doesn't disappoint when it comes to pacing and inclusion. Many fans were disappointed when certain things like the Quidditch matches were taken out of the book - I wasn't. The film did a fantastic job of following the plot essentials, showing us Hogwarts and its students, the everyday student life, while focusing heavily upon Harry's character development from a child into a teenager. His supporting actors are no less influential - Grint as Ron Weasley serves perfectly as a foil for both Harry and Hermione, with some hint of the romantic tension between the latter and himself. He also provides, as usual, a conclusive source of humor and lighthearted comedy.Watson's character takes a turn for the worse, however. The first two films accurately portrayed her as the young schoolgirl whose firsthand passion is studies and bookish knowledge, often at the expense of her social skills. At the time of Azkaban, she's not altogether different in the novels, but the film seems to make her more fashion-conscious and emotionally turbulent, a characteristic we don't really see come to fruition until the next novel. Nevertheless, her partnering with Harry is what fleshes out most of her determination - and that's what truly matters.If you haven't seen the film, I highly recommend it as indicative of the feel of the Harry Potter books. If anything it would serve as a 'gateway' experience for reading the novels.",9,0,1,13 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," A great film - but not memorable
","Having seen Casino Royale and praised it greatly (although I have yet to give it an IMDb seal of approval), I knew that the direction of the franchise would change for the better. Daniel Craig played a different Bond, and Judi Dench played a different M - and overall, the tone and direction of the story was different from the overblown films preceding it (we all pretend not to remember Die Another Day, but hey, it exists).The film picks up literally right where the last film ended - with the capture of Mr. White. Within less than ten seconds we already have an action sequence involving a car chase, and only five minutes or so after that, we have an even faster action sequence with a foot-chase, a cat and mouse thing comparable to the first chase sequence from Casino Royale.The movie starts to trip from the first scene. Although it was probably done with good intention, Marc Forster, being the director, basically turned the movie into a Jason Bourne film - which is in some ways good, some ways bad, often more the latter than the former.First, the good. Bond is vulnerable - we can see that physically as well as emotionally. He gets scratched up, he gets hurt, he winces in pain when he jumps balconies and hits metal. He is much more human than previous Bonds, even though Pierce Brosnan certainly set a precedent by dislocating his arm in the opening sequence of The World Is Not Enough. He also manages to show just how brutal Bond is when he kills. In fact it's almost a throwback to the older Bond movies with Connery and Moore, where they would often fight an assailant one-on-one, and struggle to defeat him.The bad, however, seems to eclipse this. Forster's habit of shaky camera handling as a 'device' tends to get very annoying. It worked out a few times in the first Bourne film, and it inflated his ego into thinking that it would work everywhere. The first chase scene was almost entirely shot on a shaky camera - something which *doesn't work* for car chases. When I can barely tell if Bond is doing the chasing or being chased, there is something wrong with the scene and there is almost definitely something wrong when I can barely tell what car is getting banged up where. When I saw Bond's passenger door fly off, I couldn't tell whether it was his Aston Martin or the pursuing enemies. Forster also makes the nasty mistake of assuming that you can eliminate all semblance of smooth transition from scene to scene from a movie and replace it with hasty wipe-cuts. If the movie had better cut sequences, it would have extended it by what, five minutes? Big deal.Which brings me to my other points of contention. The story and plot are fantastic, once fully comprehended. A megalomaniac organization reminiscent of a shadow corporation like SPECTRE wishes to control the entire water supply of Bolivia. Great, but it's poorly executed. The story progresses too fast for the audience to take it in and simmer. In fact, some of the best scenes, including the one where Mathis and Bond talk upon the plane and where M talks to Bond in the hotel room in La Paz, were good for the simple reason that they gave the audience a chance to take in story details without exposition just thrown at the viewer. It's the difference between sipping champagne and then experiencing it's flavor and downing four shot glasses of vodka to become immediately drunk.This isn't necessarily a bad quality in a movie. It is a bad quality for a Bond movie. There are certain elements that people come to watch a Bond movie for. One is Bond's charm, which Daniel Craig certainly could portray as he did in CR, but in QS he completely eschews it save for a single scene with Agent Strawberry Fields (seriously?), the desk operative in Bolivia tasked with arresting him. Even then, it was barely touched upon. I'm not talking about sexuality - we know he has plenty of that. But even his ability to simply cause someone to melt their barriers was conspicuously absent. Another very obvious element the movie missed out upon was Bond's ability to savor whatever he's in, regardless of his circumstances. We can forgive that in light of the seriousness of the story and his predicament, but we can't know whether the directors intended it to be that way or not.The movie has a few gems. Rene Mathis, the French-Italian agent Bond (as it turns out, falsely) accuses of treachery in CR, is the emotional heart of this film. In some ways, he is what Bond is archetypal - a refined gentleman with special tastes and an uncanny ability to charm others. He brings out the best in Bond and confronts him about the fact that Vesper Lynd died to protect him, and that he needs to forgive her. Judi Dench's M is a much more cold, powerful character than the previous M's and serves as a driving point for part of the plot of the film. The officers seem to cynically refer to her as 'Mom' and she certainly treats them like their children, but with hard love. Daniel Craig brings a lot of depth to Bond, for all his shortcomings, and gives him human failings as well as human strengths. Perhaps most pleasingly of all, Mathieu Amalric as the (main) villain, Dominic Greene, is perfect as a sort of sinister businessman with no ethical sense of entitlement and almost analogous to the villain from Tomorrow Never Dies, but with fewer stealth boats.The film is certainly worth watching (given that you need to have a certain tolerance to an extremely shaky camera) and certainly worth the money and time.",7,2,3,16 November 2008
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight is Back!
","This movie outstripped even my wildest expectations. Having grown up with the slightly campier Joel Schumacher films and the dark, brooding but nevertheless slightly desensitized Tim Burton films, my view of Batman coming into the movie theater was mixed. I saw Batman as the crazy dude with a grappling bat gun and a cool car who fought crime without guns and I also saw him as the serious, traumatized man who fought fire with fire. Now that I've seen this film, I think of Batman as nothing less than the paradigm of legend - indescribable, enigmatic, but one that gives hope.In my case, this film rejuvenated my hope for the superhero franchise. Spiderman so far had been a disappointment to me, I enjoyed the CGI of those films, but it failed to enthrall me or even allow me to take it seriously. Christian Bale's Batman, devised in the shrewdest possible way by Christopher Nolan, is uniquely human and has grown up learning the meaning of justice and truth. It wasn't an epiphany which struck him as a child in the streets of Gotham, crying over the body of his father and mother, but rather a sort of sacred mission that he undertook, traveling the world, learning martial arts and becoming well acquainted with the human psyche and learning what makes a criminal. His alter ego as Bruce Wayne doesn't disappoint either - he manages to balance the stereotypical rich playboy lifestyle with a shrewd business acumen only vaguely alluded to throughout the film but one which is readily apparent by the end.The villains are no less powerful. Ra's al Ghul, the Demon's Head, is played in a striking performance and with no less striking of a twist. Being one of DC's lesser known villains but perhaps one of its most sophisticated, he is recast in a light appropriate for the medium of Nolan's story. The Scarecrow endures a similar fate, going from the rather ridiculous, insane, jack-o-lantern throwing DC version of the Green Goblin to a still insane, but less ridiculously psychopathic murderous doctor who takes pleasure in extracting pain from his victims. Wilkinson's role as mob boss Falcone may set the role for later, more prolific mob bosses, such as the prolific Sal Maroni and later on, Two Face.The story is brilliantly told, and the dialog tends to work its way into the story without slowing it down or plodding along. Michael Caine's Alfred is a perfect expository character and a great foil for both Bruce Wayne and for Batman, as he was intended to be in the comics. His humor brings a human side to the characters in the movie while nevertheless supporting the simple fact that in addition to his father, Bruce's main inspiration for justice was his old butler. Rachel Dawes, the female lead played by Katie Holmes, is no less well done (even if Holmes' acting could have been slightly mediated by control over her facial expressions), and manages to bring out Bruce Wayne's 'third' side - the man behind the mask but the face not seen in public.Any movie which can make a man in a suit turn into a figure of legend is worth watching over and over again. I have no reservations in saying this is possibly the single best superhero movie of all time.",10,1,2,21 December 2007
Twilight," Awful film
","The poor quality of this movie really sets a low bar for the film industry as a whole. Unfortunately, thanks to a severe addiction to novels, I had the (dis)pleasure of reading Twilight several months before the film came out, and basically took the book for what it was - a semi-erotic vampire story in which Stephanie Meyer took her own 'romantic' (I use the word loosely) ideal and put it into words. To further clarify, as if it weren't clear enough from the author herself, the book is her own version of erotic fan-fiction. The plot itself is laughably simple and the romance is creepy, and seems to enjoy creating a vampire lore that makes them look about as fearsome as rabbits.Nevertheless, I decided to give the film a chance. After all, I've seen mediocre books turned into good films - Prince Caspian being my notable favorite. Within ten minutes of the film, I was bored and on the verge of leaving the theater. I decided to get my money's worth and sit it out, which was an unpleasant experience thanks to the fact that I and my brother were surrounded by middle school girls - and I think my brother fell asleep. It was probably the fact that the sun, a vampire's *main* weakness, made Edward's skin 'shimmer and glitter' and the fact that he had no fangs or attributes of a vampire. It probably didn't even help that the basis behind Edward's attraction to Bella was flimsy to the point of being laughable.There's so, so many things wrong with this film that even the novel isn't responsible for. The acting is on a level of horrid that I would expect from far less seasoned actors. Pattinson is a pretty above-average actor, and coming into the film industry as a teen heartthrob, it's probably enough for him to be on screen and for girls to ogle at his face, but for most other people his acting was stilted and his lines delivered with the fakery that only someone relying too much on his looks could possibly pull off. There is a reason why less handsome or beautiful actors are usually better at what they do, and it's because they have to make up for their visual deficiencies. He obviously didn't break the pattern. The actress, Kristin Stewart, was slightly better, but it was offset by the fact that she overacted her way and blundered through the film.The werewolf's role was boring, forgettable, and probably not even worth noticing, as were most of the peripheral characters, like the other vampire gang and the vampire in that gang who Edward battles, whose name I can't be bothered to remember. This film wasn't just a waste of my time, it was a waste of money and I *beg* people not to watch this travesty.",2,6,8,9 March 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," A poorly done finish to the trilogy
","Yes, we know all the obvious arguments to sidestep the issue: Ratner was directing, some of the actors were lost, etc. etc. But all these criticisms seem to miss the point: even with the losses incurred from the transition in directors and actors, this movie feels pointlessly pop-shlock in comparison to its predecessors.X3 details a story that appears to be an amalgam from the House of M, Civil War, and Messiah Complex story lines present in the Marvel universe. The owner of a biotech firm has developed a treatment that suppresses the X-gene, spurred mostly by the horror at finding out that his son is a mutant. Professor Xavier concedes that this cure might help out mutants with powers which have made them social outcasts, but his ex-colleague and friend, Eric Lensherr (Magneto) sees this is as nothing else but an attempt at genocide. The two sides brace for an all-out war that has been vaguely alluded to in the previous films, and one which comes to fruition near the end.The plot isn't that bad. What sucks is the surface level detail granted to the dedication of this plot. The movie is very obviously and linearly divided into a beginning, middle and end, with other subplots involving minor characters clumsily woven in for probably nothing more than fan pleasing. Some characters play little to no active role throughout the movie. Archangel, the son of the biotech firm's CEO, has about two minutes of screen time total. Callisto and Psylocke play little more than eye candy tribute and perhaps a chance for Dania Ramirez to show off (which she has already done considerably on Heroes, playing an equally unimportant role). The Juggernaut is just a hulking brute with no back-story, no real emotional role other than cannon fodder, and essentially useless as a villain.What the film fails miserably in doing is providing a reasonable basis for most of its characters. Ororo Monroe (Storm), who played the wise, removed and beautiful leader of the X-Men under Professor X (as was the case in the comics), becomes a maelstrom. Not because she went through a crisis, but because Halle Berry wanted to get herself some extra money and screen time before being committed to the hell of actresses and actors who've long overstayed their welcome. James Marsden's Scott Summers (Cyclops) was in the movie for about four minutes and acted purely as a plot device to bring back Jean Grey - shunted aside like cannon fodder. Of course the real reason why he was discarded is simple - Marsden wanted to switch to Singer's project on Superman Returns, but they didn't do a good job of finding a good way for the character to go out. There are many, many other examples.The movie nevertheless redeems itself slightly in the storyline and back-story of Jean Grey and a somewhat realistic, non-alien explanation for the Phoenix (although it might have been nice to just leave it the way it was). Her character was powerfully built throughout the movie, but it was at the expense of other characters like Hugh Jackman's Logan (Wolverine). The inclusion of Hank McCoy (Beast) was also a masterstroke, as he was an easily exploitable character who had been altogether left out of the earlier films save for some subtle references.X-Men 3 is a disappointment, but not a terrible one. It provides entertainment, but nothing beyond that. The social commentary replete in the first two movies is eschewed for wanton battles which are all-too predictable (come on, Iceman versus Pyro, who didn't see that coming). It uses new minor and flat characters instead of looking for well-worn ones like Emma Frost or the Red Queen. So while the general audiences looking for kicks may be pleased with the film, it fails to please even the most die-hard of fans, ultimately.",6,4,5,19 December 2007
Transformers," I don't know what everyone's whining about.
","I for one thought this was a fantastic movie.Overall although the scripting was pretty weak, that's hardly the focus of a movie about giant robotic sentient machines that can transform into cars. The whole movie had me enthralled, as a matter of fact, and anyone who thinks I'm a bad movie critic can suck on it. I thought the plot was at least reminiscent of the show, and pretty much summed up the feeling of what Bay and Spielberg were trying to convey - a conflict that puts humans in the crossfire and manages to get them thoroughly involved at the same time.Shia LaBeouf did much better than I expected, acting-wise, and Megan Fox did a decent job as well. If people are going to movies like this to find some sort of higher meaning or truth in the plot, why the hell bother watching it? Go see other popcorn flicks like the Matrix if that's really what you're after. And hey, the movie definitely had it's share of philosophical rambling, mostly on the part of Optimus Prime. But this begs the question - WHO CARES WHEN YOU'VE GOT A GIANT COMBAT SCENE BETWEEN ROBOTS GOING ON IN FRONT OF YOU? What amuses me the most is that Independence Day was far worse as far as plot and dialogue go, and yet the same people whining about Transformers are the ones who go gaga over Independence Day and its 'philosophical truths'. Yeah real philosophical, bunch of aliens out to wipe the planet of all life. You know, Bay creates movies like these to please the audience... not to bloody make people think.People either take movies too seriously or they take themselves too seriously. Sometimes it's a good idea to just sit back and enjoy.",8,1,3,14 July 2007
The Dark Knight," An absolute masterpiece
","I can safely say that this movie is going to set the standards for a long time - not just in the superhero genre, but almost every action, crime, and drama film that comes after it. Beyond simply upping the ante from Batman Begins, The Dark Knight both in film and character managed to surprise me.A short plot summary will suffice. It's been approximately a year since the events of the first movie. Bruce Wayne is still Batman and he now lives in his Wayne Tower penthouse while the manor is still being rebuilt. Most of the city's criminals are running scared and frightened, now that the Gotham PD has been purged of its corrupt elements and that it's backing Batman through the newly formed Major Crimes Unit, headed by Lieutenant Gordon. Another threat to the criminal underworld arises in Harvey Dent, the newly elected District Attorney, an idealist and a fearless prosecutor.However, a new threat arises as a mysterious figure with no apparent origin seems to come out of the darkness and take control of the criminal underworld, a sinister mastermind known as the Joker. Batman is tested to his greatest limits to try and stop the Joker from exacting a reign of terror upon the city.Beyond just the fantastic plot, the film manages to reach a level of acting, cinematography, and action choreography that few if any before it have been able to master. Bale is perfect as Batman, and Heath Ledger was the perfect role for the Joker; despite what the critics say, his untimely demise had nothing to do with the popularity of his role, his acting speaks for itself. Aaron Eckhart deserves a lot of attention for his role as Dent as well, making his transformation into Two-Face plausible. Maggie Gyllenhaal serves as a fantastic replacement to Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, both in acting capability and in role. Although her role in the movie is quite limited, she manages to make the best possible thing out of it.A must-see, possibly the movie of the year. Don't miss it!",10,1,4,27 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not the best, but definitely not the worst
","As a foreword, I'll say that this is definitely one of my least favorite out of the seven books. No question about it. However, as far as film-making goes, Yates managed to put it in at least a somewhat tolerable light.The film concentrates on Harry's isolation as he and his group of friends - and later on, his Army - are ridiculed for even suggesting that the dark lord Voldemort has returned to power from what seems like death. The Ministry of Magic has deemed him nearly a threat to national security and has started running a smear campaign against him and his idol, Albus Dumbledore. However, looming over all of this is the fact that Voldemort *is* still alive and that he is trying to kill Harry, but for a reason that few people know or understand.The movie manages to omit nearly half of the book, but does so in a way that makes it proceed with grace instead of clumsiness. The tone of the movie is considerably darker than most of its predecessors (the notable exception being Alfonso Cuaron's Azkaban) but brings a new dimension to the films. The musical score gives a gentle but powerful feel to the film for the viewer. Harry's character is moderately more three-dimensional than his performances in Goblet, and seems to take the screen time at face value and perform accordingly. A few of the more minor characters are given their due, including Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley. This is all, however, at the cost of the development for Ron, who seems to have been relegated to a humorous sidekick role rather than Harry's most trusted friend and confidante. Emma Watson as Hermione seems to fill the role somewhat but it doesn't bring about the feeling of compatriot-ship that Harry and Ron share.The biggest flaw is Michael Gambon's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore. As a self-professed disliker of Gambon's performance from the start, I will admit that his performance was marginally better than that of Goblet (throwing Harry against the trophy cases killed that one for me) but he eschews the book's serene, majestic Dumbledore for that of a Gandalf in Harry Potter's world - that too, an angry Gandalf. In fact I have no doubt Ian McKellan would have fit into the role with much greater ease. Gambon doesn't deny these allegations - he admits having never read the Potter books - but scenes which would have been pivotal in defining the audience's view of the headmaster, such as his meeting with Harry after Sirius's death, and his explanation of the prophecy, were completely botched. Gambon simply doesn't fit into the mold, and viewers can recognize it.Other than that, Fiennes' Voldemort and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange were fantastic additions. Jason Isaac's Lucius Malfoy was no less well scripted. A must-see for a Potter fan.",8,0,1,19 December 2007
The Mummy Returns," A well thought-out sequel
","The original Mummy was a good movie, and it's immediate sequel deserves no less commendation. The characters, plot, and feel of the movie leave you wishing for more at the end, and most of its flaws are minor and easily overlooked in light of the movie as a whole.The story picks off where the first movie left, only about ten years later. Rick and Evie are married, they have a ten year old son, and they have a manor in England which they share with Evie's brother, Jonathan - but of course, their passion is still Egypt and they're off to explore more tombs with their slightly over-inquisitive son. In this case, Evie has been having visions of the past and it's led her to an ancient bracelet. Alex, being the annoying ten year old, puts on the bracelet and is promptly kidnapped along with Evie by a cult dedicated to the destruction of the Scorpion King, a mythical warlord. Of course, in their efforts, they've decided to resurrect Imhotep, the villain of the first film, and use him to kill the Scorpion King to take control of his army of Anubis warriors.Rick and Evie are, of course, not about to let this happen, especially not at the expense of their son, and they go on a long journey across Egypt and Africa to recover him. They realize that Evie's visions are from a past life and that she was the daughter of the Pharoah Seti, Nefertiti, who was the sparring rival of Anck-su-namun, lover of the Pharoah, and also the witness to the murder of the Pharoah. With the help of Ardeth Bay, the Med'jai warrior from the first film, they discover that Rick is also a reborn Med'jai warrior destined to bring about the demise of the Scorpion King.The film has some very high points. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors and have a deep, almost explosive chemistry with each other, and with their on-screen son. Freddie Boath, as Alex, is hilarious, a great fusion of Rick and Evie, figuratively as well as literally. However the one character that I had my eye fixated on was Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay. Not only is he the first Islamic warrior to be portrayed in a favorable light and leads the first full Islamic army since Lawrence of Arabia that is cast in a good light as well. He's the most emotional (and yet somewhat funny) character, and doesn't cling to the general stereotypes of an Arab that we tend to see in cinema nowadays. Jonathan is hilarious, and we get to see him showcase more than just his humor as he proves his worth in battle. And of course, Arnold Vosloo was fantastic as Imhotep, a villain to (almost) the very end and yet not a one-dimensional monster. His love affair with Anck-su-namun is more completely explored within the film and how it leads his actions is very obviously apparent.Compared to the first film, though, it feels slightly less like it's designed for its time than the first film, which felt distinctly placeable in the 1920s like advertised. The film still feels stuck in that time instead of a decade later during the stirrings of the Second World War. The cult henchmen also felt a bit bloated and disproportionately stupid even for a film where the good guy is near invincible.The references to the first film, far from coming off as cheesy, felt well placed and distinctly funny when it needed to be.Truly a movie worth renting. 8/10",8,1,2,12 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An acceptable enough origin story
","I'll preface this review by saying that I did not treat this as I would the other Harry Potter films due to its nature as (a) a first film foray into the world of Harry Potter and (b) an origin story. It is inevitably going to be exposition-heavy and heavy-handed in its treatment of the characters, and the plot is always going to be as literally adapted as possible. Christopher Columbus, while probably not the best director for this job, nevertheless managed to pull it off without doing a terrible job. Had this been judged as any other Potter film, however, it would probably have received a 4/10 as it was possibly one of the worst in comparison to the others.The story is a straight adaptation of Rowling's first Potter book. Young Harry is rescued from a life of misery, neglect and cruelty at the hands of his aunt, uncle and cousin when he learns that he's a wizard and is destined to attend the famous Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry - the British learning institution for magical folk. Compounded by this is that he discovers he is an involuntary celebrity in the magical world because of the manner in which he was orphaned. An evil wizard, Voldemort, killed his parents when he was a child but was unable to kill him and was robbed of his powers and a body - and nobody understands why.Up to this point, Columbus does his magic. He portrays the world of Hogwarts beautifully (although the following films were able to do a much better job of it) and in a manner that is faithful to the novel, he shows how Harry meets Ron and Hermione, his closest friends, and introduces the main entourage of characters with equal grace (Harry's classmates, Malfoy, Snape, McGonagall and the other teachers, Hagrid, and most importantly, Dumbledore). He discards events and truncates the length of certain scenes but leaves the essential parts.Then, of course, the main plot of the film is discussed. A powerful object known as the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in the oddly named American version) is being hidden at Hogwarts, which grants the user immortality and limitless wealth. Harry is suspicious of a teacher, and does his damndest to try and stop him, and his fears are worsened by the realization that the person trying to steal the stone isn't doing so for personal gain, but to return Voldemort, the killer of his parents, back to power.This bit, Columbus does not handle as well. He did not cast someone significant for Voldemort when he makes his appearance and as such there is a disconnect when Fiennes' Voldemort makes his appearance in the fourth film, and opts instead to CGI Voldemort into existence. He takes creative liberties with the traps that are used to hide the stone, and eliminates a few altogether (although that at least was somewhat acceptable). However, his biggest blunder was leaving out crucial scenes which establish Harry's suspicions. It becomes important in later books (and by extension, later films) and isn't handled properly.That being said, the film gains considerable strength of character from Richard Harris' Albus Dumbledore. He has more or less defined the face of Dumbledore and his acting capability is far superior to that of the farcical, ridiculous Gambon. As for my recommendation, if you're a Potter fan and haven't seen this film for whatever reason, I would give it a try anyway, just to see the strengths in his adaptation. A tentative 'yes' from me does not exempt it from the fact that the film has some serious flaws.",7,0,1,16 February 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A poor adaptation at best
","Prisoner of Azkaban, the previous film, had me quite excited for this movie, not least because it has one of the most significant events in the entire septet of novels. However, as I sat down in the theater and the events of the movie transpired, I closed my eyes for a few seconds following the initial scene at the Riddle Mansion. All of a sudden the film is at the Quidditch World Cup.... what? This is the main shortfall of the film - it is rushed, relies far too much on tacky transition devices, and feels overall like a chick flick, not at all congruent with the darkness of the third film. The film rushes from Harry's dream to the Quidditch World Cup, completely bypassing the Dursleys.... okay that much I suppose I can understand, it's a slightly tedious and unnecessary event... but then the Quidditch World cup is shown within the span of two minutes. What the hell's the point of even introducing it then? All of a sudden the entire camp of wizards is obliterated by people looking like the KKK (uh, those are the Death Eaters, I suppose?) and are only alluded to by a barely mumbled line from Arthur Weasley... the whole subplot of the elf Winky is left completely out, thereby basically ruining the whole point of the twist later on. Oh, not to mention, the Dark Mark is fired up in the air when nobody's around on the camp grounds. Way to forget the bloody point of the Mark, Kloves.At this point my heart sank. I knew the movie was going to be extremely dismal. I watched as the kids are suddenly at Hogwarts and they introduce Mad-Eye Moody, the Triwizard Tournament (by a poorly acted Dumbledore by Gambon) and then it becomes disconnected and patchy. Hell I can't even remember most of the movie now - only that at some point they show Sirius's face in the fire, Harry gets accepted as a competitor (with Dumbledore throwing him against the trophy case?... What?) and then the first task.This is where the movie got incredibly boring and stupid as for half an hour I am treated to tween agonizing about who Harry should go out with. Yes, we know what happens, we don't need the terrible music of whoever the hell composed it (it sounds like a bleeding cartoon) to make it any more obvious. Yay, half an hour of watching kids preen and dance to bad alternative rock. Can we PLEASE get on with the story?Blissfully, it ends and tranistions almost immediately, and we're stuck with Harry trying to figure out what to do for the next task, and voil√†, they decide to completely eliminate Dobby's role. The movie slugs on and then we see a rather comically proportioned Pensieve scene with Dumbledore being the jerk headmaster (paraphrased: 'It's none of your business!') instead of trusting Harry like he does throughout the novels.I was shaking my head in disbelief at this point. Then, the third task comes up, and I perk up for a second. Maybe, just MAYBE this movie can redeem itself through the graveyard scene.My hopes are dashed. The scene is rushed, looks again cartoonish instead of refined and stylized, and the Death Eaters look once again like the Ku Klux Klan. Over in five minutes, what should have been the pivotal scene of the film.I left the movie slightly annoyed and very bored. The only high point was the good acting on the part of Ralph Fiennes, who gave his character a bit of frightening quality. That was moderately undercut by his actions being annoying and comical.Steve Kloves should never have been appointed to make this travesty of a film. I hope that at some point in the far future someone decides to 're-imagine' these films and decide that this one was as campy and boring as the Joel Schumacher Batman films.Frankly I don't care that they took out a lot of scenes; it's the fact that they took out a lot of the scenes that MATTERED and saturated the film with fan pleasing and enough info to make tween girls and fanatic 'shippers' squeal every time they watch the scene between Harry and Cho.Thank god this isn't in movie theaters anymore, otherwise I'd say, don't waste your money on it. 5/10",5,2,3,13 August 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," A poor successor
","As a personal fan of the original Matrix, which I have watched end to end dozens of times and practically memorized the dialogue for, I was expecting the new film to be a blast, both in terms of action and substance. I was right about the former, entirely wrong about the latter, and I'm almost disappointed that I went to see it.The sequel premise is rather straightforward. Approximately one year after the original film, Neo's powers have grown to the point where he is literally a living god within the Matrix. He is married to Trinity and is gathering a huge following as the 'savior' of the last human city of Zion. The Osiris, a ship patrolling the upper levels, detects the presence of a massive machine army coming to destroy Zion. The commanders and ship captains begin bulking up defenses, but Morpheus, with his messianic vision, believes that the key to defeating the machines lies with Neo. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar takes upon themselves a mission to fulfill the prophecies of the Oracle and save Zion.While in plot the film is quite good, the acting was atrocious at times and unworthy of some of the actors. Keanu Reeves could have been literally replaced by a stunt double and he would probably have done better acting on screen. In an attempt to somehow become more 'deep' and 'philosophical', the Wachowski brothers tried to pepper the film with awkward dialogue and pseudo-mysticism. While that material is not necessarily bad or wrong, it could have been delivered more effectively.The action was good but some of the CGI was absolutely horrible, while some of it was fantastic on the other hand. I found that the scene where Neo fights 100 different Agent Smiths was the poorest of the scenes involving CGI, as it seemed a little *too* artificial. It annoys me to no end that fans try to pass this off as the 'artificiality of the Matrix' and the 'deep inherent message' when it really comes down to the ineptitude with which the scene was edited, due to time constraints.Worth seeing for a first shot but really not memorable.",6,0,0,3 April 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An improvement - but still made for small children
","On a purely technical basis, the first Harry Potter movie was horrid. It was awful. But as an origin story, I let it slide with the expectation that it would be somewhat awkward because the first novel isn't all that good either. Working with whatever material they had, they managed to churn *something* out that wasn't completely embarrassing.The second film is, overall, pretty good, but suffers from trying-to-please-every-fan-too-much-itis in a manner similar to the fourth film. There's some reference to every major scene in the book, some things are truncated, and a few of the 'expected' scenes and/or lines are included to make the little kids 'ooh' and 'aah' with happiness. Which I suppose is fine, but looking back at it as an adult, I feel like I was cheated out of my money. Most major events are still included with sufficient emphasis and it seems like a much more faithful adaptation of the book as closely as possible, but with some serious drawbacks.The plot continues Harry's second year at Hogwarts, where he's got to deal initially with some exposure to the Wizarding equivalent of racism, the first real encounter he has with intolerance and bigotry on a harsher level than in the previous novels. Then, a fabled monster is released from the innards of the castle, said to be hiding there for hundreds of years. Turns out, one of the school founders, who subscribed to the bigotry against Muggle-born wizards, placed him there expressly to kill them when it was released. The majority of the story takes a sort of detective mystery theme, where Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to find out who/what is attacking the students.As far as pacing and plot goes, the film succeeds in building up suspense and a story - to some degree. A number of the attacks are cut out to conserve time, and they don't show the castle being locked down as much, etc. but overall they manage the job. What the film suffers from heavily is the literal adaptation of dialogue. Instead of improving where it needed to be improved, they adapted it very literally and it relies too much on awkward exposition. The most striking scene that irritates me is when Fawkes heals Harry's wound, and he goes 'of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers!' I half expected him to give a thumbs up to the camera and grin. There was no damn need to put that dialogue into the film. Another instance was where the trio happen upon the blood written sign in the corridor, and Hermione reads the sign aloud. I realize they're doing this because it's unlikely a little kid is going to remember what Dumbledore said earlier in the movie, or even necessarily be able to read the words on the wall fast enough while it's on the screen, but for the rest of us, it's just annoying.Still, worth watching and I'd recommend it as a much more faithful adaptation, even though it's probably not as good a film as many of the others.",8,0,1,27 April 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Absolutely brilliant!
","I found it strange when I read reviews that people were labeling Guy Ritchie's new film as a travesty of sorts to the canon of Sherlock Holmes. Not only did I find the film delightfully refreshing, it is easily one of the best thrillers of the year. It plays like a classic mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes and injects enough kinetic action into it without sacrificing the integrity of the Holmes canon. In fact I would argue that not only does it not sacrifice the integrity, it ENHANCES it.The vision of Sherlock Holmes with the deerstalker cap and the clogs and the meticulous tidy demeanor is one concocted purely in some fictional alternate universe where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle apparently never existed. The Sherlock Holmes from the book was a fast-living, eccentric, drug-abusing, fairly obnoxious character whose intelligence was not only a gift, but a curse; it managed to alienate everyone he had ever known, save for a few friends in the police force who admired him and his dearest friend, Dr. Watson (played by Jude Law). Not only is he a more energetic Holmes, he's a much more accurate and faithful one too. We get to see more of his physical side (in conjunction with a considerable amount of his mental side, in fact; I can't begin to count the number of times in the film we see Holmes use logical deduction and quick thinking to piece together facts, even at the eleventh hour). This is, again, in keeping with his character from the stories - he does know martial arts and he is a master of disguise.The story itself is immensely entertaining too. The film starts out with him supposedly closing a case involving a Satanic serial killer, who turns out to be a nobleman in the House of Lords, namely, Lord Blackwood (who is yet another cameo character). Blackwood is tried and hanged soon thereafter, and old flame Irene Adler (ANOTHER cameo character - see, how can the Holmes enthusiasts NOT love this film?) comes to him with a case. There is a subplot about her working with another person, which I won't reveal as it's a fantastic revelation near the end of the film, but Holmes quickly discovers that her case is connected to Blackwood's - who apparently is no longer dead and has risen from the grave. The film is largely spent trying to figure out Blackwood's endgame, making logical leaps throughout and culminating in an intensely exciting climax.Dr. Watson is a heavily improved character from the bumbling comic relief he served in the television series - in fact, he is more accurately depicted (though without the limp), as a veteran of the Afghan wars, and a stout, powerful man with some martial arts capabilities of his own. Most importantly, his relationship with Holmes as his closest friend, more than a brother, is given high importance and much more respectful treatment. Holmes is devastated to learn that Watson is not only getting engaged and married, but that he's going to move out of 221B Baker Street. The two prove to be nearly inseparable companions, although of course his irritation with Holmes does occasionally reach a boiling point (as it should).Anyone - including those new to Holmes and Holmes fans/enthusiasts - is going to love this movie. It takes a ton of talent to produce a movie like this and I can't wait for a sequel.",9,0,0,6 February 2010
Iron Man," Worth every dollar and cent you spend on it
","I went to see Iron Man for the midnight opening and I was very, very pleased with what I found. As a fan of the Avengers for many years, the movie was a breath of fresh air and definitely set my heart and mind racing for what was to come. Not only did I come out of the film anticipating a sequel, this did what I thought was impossible and supplanted Batman Begins as the best superhero movie to date.Iron Man follows the story of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a multi-billionaire and genius who personally designs much of the technology his company creates and is known as a weapons manufacturer. He's also inevitably a playboy and arrogant in his own success. However, while doing a demonstration in Afghanistan he is captured by the Ten Rings, an Afghani terrorist group, after his convoy is attacked and destroyed. During his captivity, he realizes that the weapons he built are being used by the enemy to kill American soldiers and resolves to fight a different kind of war. He escapes the terrorist facility by building a suit of armor which makes him a walking machine of destruction. However, when he returns home, he realizes that his work is not over and resolves to make the perfect machine for fighting crime and also attempts to discover who sold the terrorists their weapons from within his own company.A lot of comic book favorites are featured in the film. Pepper Potts, his assistant (and later wife in the comic) is portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and his friend Jim Rhodes also makes an appearance as Terrence Howard. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is no less a powerful character. Perhaps the most powerful 'guest appearance' is that of S.H.I.E.L.D., the spy organization universal to the Marvel Universe, and the idea of trying to bring the entirety of the universe together through the movies.What truly drives the film is how complex and powerful Downey's character is as Tony Stark. He not only manages to convey the typical jingoism and pomp that is associated with the Marvel Universe equivalent of Bruce Wayne, he also ties it into the storyline with incredible finesse. As a character, while watching the film, I literally grew to become fond of Stark, despite his flaws and his shortcomings, and if that happened, I have no doubt that Favreau and his team succeeded in making a fantastic film.I found no faults, and recommend it to anyone.",10,2,5,2 May 2008
Casino Royale," Bond - reimagined!
","Being a Bond fanatic, I was apprehensive when Daniel Craig was picked for the role of the iconic titular spy, particularly when I learned that he'd be portraying the origin story of the famed 007 (or at least his first mission as a double-O agent). Blond hair was bad enough, but the fact that he was neither suave nor charming seemed to work against him. Within the first half an hour of Casino Royale, I was proved wrong on all accounts.The story is an adaptation of Ian Fleming's first novel of the same name, and the plot is essentially the same. Of course, it's updated to the modern day, with the enemies being terrorists and launderers instead of Russians and SMERSH. In this one, an unnamed organization (which arises later on in Quantum of Solace, but of course, I will not spoil that) takes money from a terrorist in Africa, keeps it as a banker, and then uses it behind the banker's back to gamble it (at the cost of lives and legal property). Then, when they are foiled by Bond and lose all of the money, they must win it back in a poker tournament. Le Chiffre, the man behind the money, must play James Bond.The plot is the only real bit of contention I had with the film. It seems far too simple for a true Bond film, and of course, it ends up being such. For that reason the producers added in extra fight scenes, extra twists, and of course, gave Bond a motive beyond just his duty to MI6 to complete the assignment at hand. Along with this is the handy fact that Bond's abilities are almost completely physical - no fancy gadgets, no grappling hooks from watches or hidden laser pens, no knives hidden in the boots, just pure physical ability. He's effectively become the Jason Bourne of spies, but even MORE powerful.His personality has also gone a makeover. Sean Connery's Bond was known for being a womanizing, drinking, smoking and charming man, and women were of no concern to him. In Roger Moore's era, Bond became a much more romantic person, more subtle and clever, and in Dalton's era he became angry, emotional, and vengeful. Brosnan averaged the three predecessors and created a Bond who couldn't always control his emotions, but got the job done; someone who was capable of relying on his charm to get him done, but showing true concern for the women he saved or fought along with. The oft quoted 'It's what keeps me alive' comment from GoldenEye summarizes this quite succinctly.Daniel Craig's Bond breaks with this for a few obvious reasons. He is Bond before he becomes the super-spy. He's just been newly minted a double-O, and thus abuses his power. He falls in love quickly (although he seems to have a preference for married women), and clings to that love with a tenderness that I would not have expected of Craig, one that manifests outwardly as hard and unyielding but gives way to real care and comfort when his barriers melt. I learned with this film not to have any preconceptions with well-established characters. Vesper Lynd is perhaps the real hero of this, giving him a romantic interest and thus a reason to the film's rhyme. She stirs Bond in a way that we haven't seen since Tracy Bond was gunned down by SPECTRE.Le Chiffre is another weak point, but not by much. His character is well developed, but his villainy seems relatively unnoticed since he does not ever encounter Bond in a fair confrontation. He tortures him - that too, brutally (I cringed as did the entire male population of the theater) - but he never quite confronts him as an equal. Still, he provides a good foil for Bond to develop on. Judi Dench as M is much colder, hardliner, and far more willing to take drastic courses of action than her previous incarnation as a separate M with Pierce Brosnan. This gives her character far more room to develop, however, and creates a unique relationship with Bond that we don't necessarily see in most other films.CR is a promising film, and despite the relative mediocrity of its sequel, it provided a completely new paradigm for Bond, both physically and mentally. Aesthetically, it may be the greatest accomplishment yet for an old, classic film series.",9,2,3,19 November 2008
Fantastic Four," This movie sucks
","I'm not going to give it a completely craptastic rating since I've never read the F4 comics as a kid or whenever, but this movie was just bad in so many different ways. In an era of superhero films where we see them taking on a usually childish genre with incredible, mature, and serious finesse (case in point, the X-Men series), we expect there to be some kind of obvious change from the nonsense we've seen before.F4 has no such pretensions. It's blatantly obvious about the transition from 'dude' to 'superhero', even making such pithy statements as 'we need a team vehicle' and 'let's sell our own marketing brand!' *SNORE* Yes, that's exactly what we need to see, a marketing ad in a film that's poorly disguised as self-mockery. Never mind a good story or a good premise for a film, let's turn this into the 'round of laughs' nonsense.As for the premise of the story, well, I'm not really quite sure what it's supposed to be. First we have the origin story... okay... I'll give them that, even though they've royally screwed with Dr. Doom's origin story and source of his powers. Then we have some weird interlude where they figure out how to use their powers, then save a bunch of people from a pointless, random pileup on a bridge. Then, taking the nonsense further, this is where they try to go into the 'marketing scheme', with the characters discussing logos, action figures, etc and a dull side story about The Thing and his quest to get back to his older self. Too bad it's about as well executed as watching a rock sit on a bench.They manage to shoehorn the Thing's classic line ('It's clobberin' time!') without it really making sense, and Johnny Storm's character is about as poorly acted as a plank of wood. The only redeeming thing about this film is watching Jessica Alba for the eye candy, because as far as acting talent goes, she has none. Don't bother renting or watching this movie.",4,0,2,26 January 2009
V for Vendetta," I will Remember the Fifth of November
","There are few times when I ever pronounce a movie so exemplary that I'm willing to see it more than once in a blue moon, and this is one of those times. V for Vendetta was a masterpiece of art, interwoven with symbolism, history, and ideology to create a mesh of cinematic artwork which surpasses anything the Shadow Gallery may have to offer.The movie's premise is relatively simple. Driven out of fear and madness, the populace of Great Britain elects a political party into power known as Norsefire following a series of terrorist attacks which were, unbeknownst to them, orchestrated by their own government. The religious fundamentalist government proceeds to cull 'undesirables', such as homosexuals, Muslims, and cripples, and installs a totalitarian dictatorship in place free of political dissent. A lone man known as V arises out of the ashes of the cullings and plants the seed of revolution in the people, out of revenge.V's character, played by Hugo Weaving, is enigmatic and yet surprisingly eloquent for a man with a mask. As Evey said, 'You cannot kiss an idea', but V in himself exists as an idea - revolution - which inspires an oppressed people out of apathy. Natalie Portman's performance as Evey Hammond is no less brilliant, as she shows her emotions raw and clear.What sets this movie apart from similar predecessors is its complete deference to the style of the Wachowski brothers, both cinematically and lyrically. Not only is it able to tell a good story, despite taking liberties from the comic book (which in my opinion was far less intriguing than the movie), it is able to put it in a cinematic medium which appeals to the eye and holds in itself a hint of surprise. For the average viewer, it dulls down abstruse concepts into a potent form consumable by your average Joe, and still manages to keep the intellectuals engaged by the interplay of ideas within the film. We are never fully endowed with the true workings of the society or V's mind, much as in the Brothers' previous Matrix films we remain semi ignorant of the societal workings of the machines, and this only peaks our curiosity.V for Vendetta is a delight, but I will not say that it is a fleeting one. Watching the movie can be empowering in many ways, and if nothing, it's a treat for the eyes.",10,2,8,21 December 2007
