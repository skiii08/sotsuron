Sucker Punch," Honestly Full of Action But Lacking of Anything else
",This movie was so pointless that I wondered why I was even sitting in the theater watching it half way through the movie and why I sat through the whole thing at the end of the movie. Maybe it was because I paid $15.00 to see it on an IMAX screen or the fact that I was so sickened by the movie and needed time to gather myself to leave.The movie was so incoherent and the majority of the movie had so little to do with the start and ending of the movie that if you left the theater and walked back in at different parts of the movie you would think it was an entirely different movie each time just casting the same actors and actresses. Definitely not worth the time and money of movie goers and may not even be worth watching it if it was to one day be shown on HBO or Starz one day.If you are the type of movie watcher who has a short span of attention then the movie will definitely seem great. If you however watch movies expecting that the scenes and the story of a movie should all tie in together then this is not your type of movie. The movie does a poor job at explaining what really happened to the characters in the movie and what exists only in the mind of cool effects and lots of explosions. The audience never gets a chance to learn anything about the characters' character because the movie never builds up any of the characters fully.If you've yet to waste your money on this movie then use that money to go buy yourself some dinner. If after reading this and you still want to waste your money then I have a few foundations that you can better donate your money to than the pockets of Snyder.,1,66,143,25 March 2011
