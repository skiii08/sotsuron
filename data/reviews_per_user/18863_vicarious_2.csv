3:10 to Yuma," more of a drama than western
","...which is not to say it doesn't have actions and explosions..it does and in plenty. But it delves more into the psyche of an eccentric outlaw(crowe), a one-legged rancher(bale) trying to *man* up for his family and children and the relationship that develops between them. Christian bale delivers good performance, just short of a great one. It reminds me of al pacino in donnie brasco. The normal tough guy playing the weakling. Its difficult for them to pull it off because the audience is used to seeing them in a different shade and they themselves have to let go of their normal selves and natural instincts to put up a character like that. There are times in this movie when Bale lets the normal Bale come to screen and i felt that at odds with how the rancher should have been. But thats only once or twice in otherwise a great performance.The movie has its share of clich√©s, like a bible-reciting,painter,womanizer outlaw and others and heck i wouldn't say there is much novel about the story/screenplay. But it's just well done and there is no dull moment in the movie. The score is also reasonably good. My final word would be: its not an action/western as might seem and if thats all you are going for, this 'might' be a disappointment. But its an entertainer alright and will definitely grab your attention for as long at it lasts.",8,2,4,20 January 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.
","I am not into sci-fi movies at all, and frankly speaking movies like matrix(the 2nd and 3rd part) which show preposterous concepts pi** me off.But I couldn't help admiring this movie.First of all, the very idea of this movie is so great complemented by an equally great direction. Its about 2 lovers who decide to erase each other from their memories since things don't go well between them, but something goes amiss and by the end of the movie you realize what our memories are worth.Those of you who have suddenly realized at the end of a dream, that it cant be real,its a dream and wake up, would find something similar going on here when Joel while trying to erase Clementine from his memory , decides otherwise.The director has shown it in a beautiful way and if not anything else you've got to see the movie for this.Most of the stuff you see in movies have been shown in some way or the other in different movies,but this thing that I am talking about is just marvelous and you gotta watch the movie for it or you'll miss out on some really good and original creations of Hollywood.There are many other things i want to write but if i divulge too much my name will be blacklisted.Its a creative movie and if you are in the mood for something that deserves a piece of your mind,time and money go for it.",10,1,4,26 November 2005
