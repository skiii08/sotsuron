Skyfall," Did you know that this is the highest rated Bond movie yet ??
","Skyfall is out on DVD. Just watched it. I wasn't gonna watch it due to all the negative user reviews on IMDb. But i thought I'd give it a shot because of Daniel Craig. Some people are saying there are plot holes , and Why did this happen , and this and that. They're all wrong. There's that movie of Angelina Jolie with 5.8 rating and in user reviews you will see , that there's a ten star review that many people found useful. That movie SUCKED Big time.Don't go on 1 star reviews down here , just watch this Action-Packed 007 Fun. If you find any plot holes in this movie , tell me and I'll explain them to you but you have to give this movie a chance.",9,2,8,3 January 2013
