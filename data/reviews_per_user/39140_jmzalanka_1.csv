Casablanca," Blaine Makes A Decision Under Duress
","When Rick Blaine decides to put Victor and Ilsa on the Lisbon plane instead of going with Ilsa himself is problematic. That decision is the key piece of the film. Whatever happened before didn't matter and the outcome had not yet been revealed. The decision probably comes sometime after Ilsa confronts Richard with a variety of offers for the letters of transit alone in his apartment. The offers included appeals to patriotism and friendship, and when that failed, sex. Ilsa decided to stay with Rick. Ilsa's decision frees Lazlo to leave Morroco and the threat of German reprisal, capture, and execution. Ilsa is a confused woman and a human being in a hard situation. What would you do? Is Ilsa's decision right or moral? Her heart is a dark forest and I fear her wolves had gotten her down. I do not believe Ilsa could think straight in Blaine's arms which is where she ended up begging for the letters of transit. Just when Rick decided to cut his ties with Ilsa puzzles me. It happened some time during the night. The wonder of the film is how someone can make a smart and doubly painful decision in hurricane of emotions. Rick's decision will cut him off from Ilsa a second time. Rick predicted sorrow when Ilsa would begin regretting her decision to stay with Rick. To Rick's great credit, he could see just a little bit ahead despite the emotions Ilsa brought out in Rick. How and where does Blaine identify and come to such a decisive moment? The answer is in the film somewhere. I keep looking for it. Blaine will think about Ilso every day. He's traded one torture for another. But at least Ilsa will be safe. Blaine is my guy. How did you do it Rick? And I see you are still standing. I bet it hurts like hell. Here's looking at you.I've seen Blaine referred to as a soldier of fortune. That probably referenced the line that Blaine fought in the Spanish Civil War. Those Americans in that war were generally not soldier of fortune types, mercs. They were idealistic volunteers, thrown into the front lines. They died in droves. The Americans fought together in the 15th International Brigade in Spain. Them that got out would have become cynical, defeated, and convinced that they would not stick their necks out for someone.",Null,1,2,28 November 2009
