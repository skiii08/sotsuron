The Ring," Another one ruined by American
","Go figure, another Asian moive ruined by remake. I saw the the original Ringu and it was very well done. Original Ringu was one of the movie that stayed on your mind over a week. And even after couple day, you could still feel the impact of the movie. The Ring, remake was different. I was willing to even accept to quirky plot about the horse but what the complete let down was the ENDING!!! Ringu didn't have to reply on much SFX or jumping right in front of you scare tactics to get you scared. Whole atomosphere was what made the movie. For the most part, The Ring (2002) was okay, maybe even on the par with the original except the ending. Especially when the Samara come out the tv. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?????? Remake is a complete let down....Go figure...once again... Since American producers can't come up any decent plot, they have to reply on import movie and add some lame sfx and make some quick bucks. I think I'll just watch the original Ringu. If you seen Ringu, don't bother with The Ring. LAME!LAME!LAME!!Ringu 8/10 star The Ring (2002) 2/10 stars",Null,0,1,15 March 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," If you cant laugh at this movie, then you're taking LIFE WAY TOO SERIOUSLY
","What can you say about this, this movie is a classic. I saw this movie when I was a freshmen at college. I was run by some school association. So myself and some dorm buddies went to the campus common and saw this movie outside on the big screen. Also there was free pizza and drinks. PERFECT COMBO. I laughed so hard, I seriously puked up all the pizza I ate. People who just didn't think this movie was funny, need to loosen up. Sometime you just need to relax, don't worry about the plot making sense and let your funny bone get the best of you. Everybody need to watch this movie at least once in their life. 10 out of 10",Null,1,1,31 August 2002
