Stop-Loss," Review: Stop-Loss
","The word 'Stop-Loss' comes from US Military policy that concerning an involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service date (thanks again, Wiki!).Imagine what if you have one real good material on your hands, but you don't have any idea how to tell it properly. 'Stop-Loss' is the movie with such a great potential. But all they've accomplished was spending times on far less intriguing plot that building around the story. In the end, this is just one big frustrating motion picture that should have no, must have been excellence.Brandon (Ryan Phillippe), Steve (Channing Tatum) and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are three childhood friends and decorated war heroes who just got back from Iraq. Each of them has a goal in life to fulfill. For Brandon, he thinks he had it enough with the whole war things. But soon he realized that he have been stoplossed that required him to go back duty to Iraq. Against his will, Brandon and Steve's soon-to-be wife, Michelle (Abbie Cornish) decided to go to Washington DC and seeking help from senator. Since leader of the gang like Brandon was AWOL, it's only Steve to take a full responsibility for their group instead. And it's a bad time indeed, since in the most troubled friend like Tommy is about going to lose his grip.From the sound of this, it should be an important film since this 'Stop-Loss' policy obviously has a big loophole. And it's going to be interesting, if they decided to do an expose piece to point out that what went wrong with that policy. But somehow the director, Kimberly Peirce (her second directorial gig since disturbingly masterpiece 'Boy Don't Cry') interested in brotherhood and post-war traumatize instead. And bad new is she didn't exactly did such a good job at all. An only three dimensional character I saw was a leading man Brandon (more on that later). In the meantime, his fellow friends are left unexplored (especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tommy who has not only an absolute caricature character, but also poorly used to create any necessary tension between other characters). And while Brandon and Michelle travel together, there is a sexual tension going on between them. But the film did a poor job depicting it, and that's mean the whole point of that plot structure have gone completely wasted.Like I've said, considering the topic they aimed for, the story itself is really weak by comparison. For the whole time, we saw Brandon travels to get some help. But after the trip came to an end, it kind of makes you feel that it is an absolutely unnecessary trip. Brandon can't get help as he hoped for. And his alternative solution (to run away) is planned and then dumped in a last minute without a proper explanation. Even when something really bad happened that eventually made everybody to re-evaluate their life, its feel shamelessly manipulative and cliché (which end up with unintentional hilarious macho-bonding thing between two lead characters). In fact, an intermission when Brandon visit his comrade who is simply beyond crippled (lose one leg, one arm and two eyes) is more touching than everything else in the movie.If the cast will make you drool (especially girls), you're not alone. Stop-Loss packed with 'next best thing' casts. But only Ryan Phillippe is worth watching (probably the most mature role of his career to date). Brandon is an important character, since he is a centerpiece to the story. It required him to show a lot of layers, anger, frustration, etc. And the good thing is Ryan knew his character so well and did a very good job (by the scene he beat up thieves who stole his belonging, I entirely bought his character already). On the other hand, there's too limited time for Channing and Joseph to start doing something mesmerizing like their leading actor. I don't know that it would be an improvement or not, but it would be really nice if they decide to share an equal screen time for those three young actors.'Stop-Loss' is yet another anti-war drama like its predecessor (In the Valley of Elah, Rendition, Redacted) that didn't really break into a major audience. I don't really know why those movies weren't successful in United State (in term of box office). My guess (since I'm obviously not one of those people in that 'The greatest nation in da world') is they might fed up with the whole war things that they've seen in the media every single day. So why should bother go seeing another one on a big screen? Well, let's just say I'm glad that I'm not thinking about it like them.",6,1,1,28 July 2008
I'm Not There," Review: I'm Not There
","'I'm Not There' is Todd Haynes's ode to 'the many lives of Bob Dylan'. It's a film that reconstructs his body of work in a very idiosyncratic kind of way. While this film is not really about the life Bob Dylan himself, but merely his role that made an impact to American culture. After we've watched it, we might not have a clue who he really is. But please rest assures that we will definitely know what Bob Dylan means to this world.Truth be told, I ain't familiar with his life and work. And with this ignorance that I have, it's causing me (and people like me) immensely confusion to the film. But that's not is an excuse to not watching this film. Instead, it will enthusiastically encourage people to find out any references that we've seen in the film. In fact, it affected me so deep that I'm ready for prepare Dylan's work in both off-screen and on-screen. There's 1967 D.A. Pennebaker's documentary 'Don't Look Back,' and Martin Scorsese's 2005 doc 'No Direction Home: Bob Dylan' that I have yet to watch.What succeed in Todd Heynes's 'I'm Not There' is that he didn't bombard us with biographical information about Dylan's life. This is not 'Ray' or 'Walk the Line' (by all mean, those are good movies) which attempted to show us in both the man's life and his myths. 'I'm Not There' isn't one of those movies. It didn't really care for the man's life, but only in his myths. Therefore the film is very loose and kind of a free-form to give an opinion about what we've just seen (which is absolutely relevant to the way Dylan lives his life). And it's emphasizing even more when the director employed the total of six actors to play many fractions of one titular character.Speaking of Todd Heynes, I think he's pure breed of art-house director that has one special talent. And that's he really knows how to bring his artsy films into a mainstream. 'Far From Heaven' is not only a film that ode to 50's Douglas Sirk's melodrama, but also explore a hidden gay subtext in those films. 'Velvet Goldmine' is his ambition to re-imagine Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane', but with glam-rock extravaganza era. In my opinion, 'I'm not There' is probably one of the most dedicated and ambition work so far.This movie surely will pleased many ardent fans and will create some new fan base (like me). I think it's necessary that you should watch this film for a second times (deservedly experience, I would say). And please, please don't try to make sense with this film whatsoever. Because, in the end, you'll know it's not a point that this film trying to make after all.",10,0,0,25 June 2008
Juno," Charming comedy with irresistible casts
","What if I have to put one single word for this movie, what would it be? 'Great'? Perhaps. 'Funny'? Well, kind of. Wait...I know it, 'irresistible'. Although I didn't completely fall head over the heel for this movie (like the most people out there). But I can't help but fell in love with every single character in this little wonder.Made no mistake about it, Ellen Page as titular character, Juno, is totally own this movie. It's really surprised to see these wonderful cast (Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons) build around this amazing 21-years-old actress. I once said in the review of 'Hard Candy' that - trust me, she will be a star. I never thought that it will be this soon.There is no problem with this movie at all. The songs are perfect (just like 'Garden State's Original Soundtrack' which came to my mind). The script is sharp and funny (by former stripper to Oscar-winning writer, Diablo Cody). It was directed by very promising young director, Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking). But, maybe it's just me, I'm kind of feel the vibe of manipulation along the way. The world is so bright around Juno's world. She learned her lesson and stay with a person who can 'share her ups and downs'. I mean, that's very rare to happen with a 16-years old girl who unexpectedly got herself pregnant, right? Well, that's movie. It's a make believe machine. When someone is so irresistible or likable as Juno, one cannot help but hope for something wonderful happening to her life. It's wishful thinking that can elude you from the real world we live in for a little while. No harm in that, right? Ps. Ellen Page is kind of look like Thai people. I mean she could walk around here without noticing she's western.",8,3,7,13 March 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The best Western-ish movie of this century
","It took me nearly six hours to finish watching this movie. Yes, I saw it twice. It's not too complicated to catch up or anything. But personally, I think this film is...a landmark. It deserved to see twice in a roll. It's very poetic and visually striking. This is, by far, the best Western-ish movie in this young century.As I said, it's Western-ish. Because it is characters study film disguised in Western genre. There is no such think called 'action' to be seen (except some very violent scenes). The film is, to me, possessed by Terrence Malick-like kind of touch (cue, blowing grasses scene!). I really wonder what took Andrew Dominik (of critically acclaimed, 'Chopper') seven years hiatus before direct this amazing second feature.If you want to look for any surprises, please look elsewhere. Because its title says it all (duh). It's about legendary outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) who eventually got killed by coward Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). The film opened with the last 'job' of James's gang after almost two decades of all kinds of robbery. Jesse's brother, Frank James (Sam Shepard) decided to retire and live in peace. Jesse, on the other hand, decided not to quit (one can assumed that he didn't know how). He recruits Ford brother, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and his younger brother, Robert.Even though Charley is just another ordinary low-life criminal who didn't have any motivation in his own future, Robert has. Robert is a 19-years-old boy who idolizes Jesse since he remembered. He learned to be like Jesse in every single motion (at one point, Jesse asked 'You want to be like me, or you want to be me?). But the more Jesse shows his vulnerability like a normal human being, the more Robert questioned himself whether he might be able to step over Jesse's reputation and make a legend on his own name.One of the great things about this film is, they're able to make a full human being from two titular characters. Jesse is very bleak character who has two completely different personalities. He's a gentleman and family man who kept his secret identity well enough to not get caught. He's also paranoid madman and plain cold-blooded killer who is about to losing his damn mind. Only the other hand, Robert is simply...a child. He is a scared young man pretend to act tough. But when opportunity is knocking on his door, he over did it that it actually ruined his life.I've gotta say, Casey Affleck is a lead in this film (Academy Award nominated him in supporting role really made no sense). I heard there's a 4 hours+ version of this film which Brad Pitt has a lot more things to do. Well, I hope I will have a chance to see it. Anyway, both actors are absolutely perfect for the role. For Brad, this is probably the best role to date. For Casey, 2007 is the best year for him (with the lead in Gone Baby Gone and...this).I can see it why there's only a handful of people went to see this film (in America, of course). They expected for something but, in the end, they've got some completely different thing instead. I know, maybe you don't want to experience another 'Dances with Wolves' (remember when was the last time you see this one?) I know it is decent movie. But that movie is boring as hell. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' will prove you wrong that a long movie doesn't always have to be boring.",9,3,6,27 March 2008
Twilight," Review: Twilight
","As soon as the credit rolled, I completely understand what made girls around the globe went crazy for this book series, because Edward is the kind of guy who doesn't exist in real life. He's moody, secretive and utterly handsome young man (who happened to be vampire). For girls, he's an absolute dream guy. And Bella, a naive young girl who fall for his charm, is a character that every women on this planet wish to be in her position.Well, I adore the concept of 'Love Conquer Everything' in cinema. I love every moment happened in Baz Luhrmann's body of work. His masterpiece Moulin Rouge!, for me, is an ultimate love story that will take you for an epic journey of passion. As well as his directorial debut Strictly Ballroom, the movie that didn't really mind for any cause, reason, motive or whatever that will make it at least believable. And yet it worked out just fine and made me root for our heroes every second on-screen.But that's just me. I know these kinds of films often fall into the category of 'cheesy' or 'cliché' or 'melodrama'. So what's wrong? Maybe people confused between good kinds of melodrama and bad one. But what is good or bad anyway? Well, as far as I know, there is no qualification for it. And I think that's great thing about this genre, it's entirely based on your feeling, whether you hate or love them. It's not like an action movie when crappy stunts tend to make you know that it's poorly done.OK, I haven't said anything about Twilight yet (and it's already three paragraphs). Well, let's just say that I 'feel' love for this film. There's a lot of passionate feeling floating around the town of Forks. Everybody in this film seems to know what they should do on-screen. I think what the director, Catharine Hardwicke, achieved was she knows what to offer (and what's not). Every unmentioned gestures, every character's tendencies, made me realize how determined she was.You simply can't avoid using corny dialogs when you turn this kind of book into film. But with the situation on-screen and their determination, it kinds of made me moved. I didn't fall head over heel like some girls in theater. But considering that those lines are guaranteed cringe-inducing for most heterosexual male, I think they accomplished for whatever they did.I'm glad to say that two leads are surprisingly effective, Rob Pattinson does not only have the look, but he also embodied the titular character so perfectly. Edward is not real person, and he understands it. His ethereal manners will indeed make most of the girl swoon. His counterpart, Kristen Stewart is also believable. Her narration wasn't deadpan like I expected. Many people complain about why she madly in love with the hunk so easily. Well, if you felt this way, maybe this story is not really for you afterall.Waitaccording to my review so far, you guys must think that I will bestow it as best film of 2008, right? Well, no. Because even though I have a good feeling about it, I don't really think that it is an exceptional great movie. Important scenes like meadow scene was astonishingly bad (poorly edited and that 'diamond skin' effect made me feel depressed). And Baseball scene was not as spectacular as it was described by everybody (Have I told you that I haven't read a book?).And the most important of all, a missing ingredient that made this film fails to be placed with other classic melodrama, is CHEMISTRY. Pattinson and Stewart are looking great individually. But together, they gave some audience (like me) a hollow feeling. It's not like they've a zero chemistry going on between them. But they're just left me want for something more. Anyway, since this thing can be fixed (Sequel is ensured by 70m opening), so I'm eager to see what they will do in the next film.Make no mistake, maybe it's not quite good (and everybody seemed to know), but this is the film that will shot through your heart (if you're into this kind of thing). For me, the quality of this film will make no different. People will either absolutely love it or loath it. As for me, well, I'll let my review do the talking.",7,0,3,5 December 2008
Across the Universe," By far, the best musical in this very young century
","After you've done with this movie, you've got to ask yourself that, how one can chose 34 from 200+ The Beatles's songs, and still create such a brilliant songs compilation and coherent motion picture. I mean, you gotta see the mess behind this production and wonder how the hell it wasn't a complete failure. 'Across the Universe' is simply, by far, the best movie musical in this very young century.As you can read my preview at here, I'm gonna skip the whole plot thing and focus on what made it so perfect. And, on the other hand, what made it so flawed in many critic's eyes.So first thing first, what made it so flawed? Easy answer, the plot. It was mediocre at best. Story of Vietnam's war the time of 60's? Hippy? An acid trip? Psychedelic pop? Yeah sure, we've been there a thousand times before. And there are stories of second tier characters which were left unexplained (so that, movie can spend time more with the lead). We never knew what will happened with Prudence, or how Sadie and Jo-Jo got back together again.True, those are undeniable flawed. The movie is not a masterpiece in the world of silver screen. But, hey guys, can we not look it as a movie? Can we see it as a tribute? A tribute to such an amazing era. It is a music-driven story which wrote by one of the most influential musician in our history. It represents what we love and hate. Jo-Jo represents our greatest guitarist, Jimi Hendrix. Sadie represents our greatest female rock & roll, Janis Joplin. Jude and Lucy represents young ignorance people back then. Max represents young man involuntary joined the army in the 60's, etc. I knows, I am babbling here, but what I've said is really happened, wasn't it? I don't know how difficult or pain in the arse of the director, Julie Taymor, really is. But I do know one thing that she is indeed talented filmmaker. Her visionary is really one major thing that made this trip worthwhile. A Bowling scene, Journey with Mr. Kite, Underwater ballet, enrolled army, Vietnam scene. Those are all visual & sounding inventive scenes. And it's not just she used the absolutely right song for the scene, she sometime also re-interpreted the whole meaning that songs for us. Like 'I wanna whole your hand' which is a great, fun and happy song. But in the scene, Prudence sang in a ballad tone. Longing for her true love to hold her hand. I made me realized that no matter how wishful of this song is, it's heartbreaking when you can't hold somebody's hand that you desired.I never thought that they can find a right cast in term of appearance and vocal. But they did it. Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood indeed left me surprised. But what made me cheer with joy is Sadie which played by Dana Fuchs. She is simply astonishing in Janis Joplin's persona. And there's a final rooftop concert that I think is one of the great tribute to the last concert of The Beatles in 1970's.Someone might said 'Wasn't it a suicide to made the Beatles's musical set in the 60's? Haven't you seen Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?'. I think they're taking risk by doing this movie. I'm glad that did it and, by that, did it REAL worth trying for.",10,7,15,13 March 2008
Pineapple Express," Review: Pineapple Express
","I'll have to admit, there are plenty 'wtf' moments for me in the first 10-15 minutes. But then I realized that I really need to set my perception right. Because Pineapple Express is stoner comedy that made by people who stoned (it's not necessary whether you need to get high or not, but it would be amusing if you do haha+). And you must be able to accept a bunch of meaningless gestures and dialogs that spread around this flick. If you can do that, then you will find that what you've seen so far is pretty friggin' awesome.Although it has Judd Apatow's watermark all over it (no doubt, since he is a producer), but if you seek out for meaningful lines or intrigue storytelling (movie like Knocked Up comes to mind), then you will likely to be disappointed. Because Pineapple Express is solely aim for laughs, since it's written by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg. But I would say that their collaboration in this time is a bit letdown from previous effort like Superbad, which is amusing AND touching, whereas PE is totally lack of character's intimacy. Be that as it may, there's a lot one-liners that can guarantee to make you rolling on the floor laughing.First thing when you heard the director's name, you will have a weird feeling about what the hell David Gordon Green is doing here. He is the man who responsible for thoughtful indie dramas like All the Real Girls, George Washington and recently Snow Angels, which starred by Kate Beckinsale (and which going to be my next reviewÂ… I guess haha+). But then my doubt was completely gone since he seems to 'get' the flick. An awkward male bonding, incoherent action scenes and trippy dialogs, all these ingredients he put into can make this film an absolute stoner comedy.Seth Rogen might be on the roll now (Knocked Up and soon to be classic Zack and Miri make a Porno), but sad to say that his character in Pineapple Express was pretty uninspired. Maybe it was caused by the fact that he's got 'straight role' in this film. And sub-plot between him and his barely legal girlfriend feel pretty half-baked and yet it worsens by inconclusive ending.On the other hand, James Franco's Saul is totally own this movie. His character maybe the funniest crack dealer ever put on screen. His child-like persona makes me totally forgive that he sells weed for living. For James, people might consider him to be a lovable hunk in movies like Spider-Man trilogy, Annapolis and Flyboys, but I think his true potential is comedy. It's a role that I find him felt comfy and belonged to, I guess fans of Freeks and Geeks (which I haven't seen it yet) tend to agree with me on this fact.Pineapple Express maybe completely pointless, it also doesn't have any valuable lesson to teach us (don't do weed? Hell no, this film is totally up for it haha+). But one thing that it succeeds is an ability to give you good times. Do you remember simple yet brilliant buddy action-comedies in 80s? (ie. 48 hrs, Lethal Weapon) If you do, then Pineapple Express will give you just the same amount of hilarity.",7,0,2,24 October 2008
