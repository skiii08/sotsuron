The Rock," one of the worst movies of the decade
","The thing about the rock is , that it might seem like a good movie to a person with an I.Q. of six. The writing is bad , the acting is bad , although the ACTORS are good, the plotline is stupid and the actors don't seem to know what they are doing. I don't know how Nick Cage and Sean Connery got mixed up in this. A Bad Bad movie.",Null,0,1,1 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," stupid...but funny
","Now, the two words I  could use to explain this movie would have to be stupid ,and funny.South park was not one of the funniest movies i have ever seen, but it was pretty funny nonetheless. However, it was absolutely MORONIC . The musical numbers were out of place, the jokes were repetitive and ended up being more stupid than funny at the end so it was pretty useless.I have been a film buff for a while now, so i have seen some pretty offensive stuff, but south park: bigger longer and uncut was definitely the most offensive. I was offended as a  canadian, because of the repeated jabs at Canada.I did laugh at the south park movie, but most of it was pretty pointless. ** out of ****",Null,0,0,19 August 1999
Taxi Driver," scorsese'e greatest masterpiece
","When I first saw taxi driver, I was blown away. It was such a realistic , moving film, i could hardly beleive that some critics hated it! The power of Scorsese'e taxi driver comes from the galvanizing performances, mainly Deniro and Foster. Almost as soon as the movie was over , I re-wound it and watched it again, and then again. It seems to get better every time i see it. But don't take my word for it, rent it yourself.",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," brilliant
","Eyes wide shut is among Kubrick's greatest work. it is bizarre, witty, scary , it has it all. Now , the main thing to remember is that this isn't a movie about sex, it is a movie about jealousy . The scenes are so mesmerizing , it is a shame that they digitally altered it to change the rating. They should have released it with an nc- 17 rating instead of changing a master film maker's vision. **** out of ****",10,0,0,18 July 1999
The Matrix," Wonderful visual effects
","The matrix has some of the best FX i have ever seen. However , the FX hardly out-weigh the low points in the film, mainly , THE WRITING . The basics of the matrix are that it is so badly written , that a movie buff such as myself who has seen all the tricks, and knows how they are done, just doesn't impress me, in fact , some of the dialogue is so terrible that it is funny! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who over-thinks it too much , but if you are just looking for a wild ride, see the matrix.",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
