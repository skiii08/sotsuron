The Blair Witch Project," The only shocking thing is the public buying this.
","I have to say that the Blair Witch Project was one of the most disappointing film experiences I have had in a long while, and with some of the tripe that has been around of late that is saying somethingI found it dull, pretentious, and not particularly original.  No, I am not jaded by an over abundance of F/X dominated eye candy.  I have been hoping for horror films that relies more on the imagination then gore & computer graphics.This however is not it, I found it a chore to make my way though the thing. There was not a single frightening moment in the whole thing. I guess this might be impressive to people who have never gone deeper into the wild wood then a slightly ill kept city park.  My guess is that the conspiracy among critics wherein films are cut to bits as a way of teaching the company, or director or an actor in question a lesson.  I think this may have been the reverse, because it was made for a songthe critics have decided to prase it to the hilt. It amazes me that the public is falling for this!  I guess the American public is not as jaded as I thought. In the end, as someone who works in both education and media if these had been my students and they had made it out of those woods and I got a look at their unfocused effort with an audio track filled with the chant of ******** **** as this one was I would given them a solid F-.I nearly laughed out loud at the ending.",3,0,2,2 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," As we use to say What a Trip!
","I have to say that I went to see this film with more then a touch of trepidation. I had more than a few doubts about a film set in 1900 and yet featured music from that later part of the century?  And there is that video that has nothing to do with the film that but was inspired by it... To say the least I was not expecting much.I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  Moulin Rouge is a fantastic intelligent musical fantasy that has more energy in the first 15 minutes than most films have in their entirety. And the fact that they are able to blend the Can Can, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend, Material Girl and Diamond Dogs is close enough to genius to count for me!",10,0,1,4 June 2001
The Matrix," Neo Gnostic film wonder.
","To be sure all the comments before mine say many of thing things I could have said about the fantastic special effects, the deeper than most story, and non-stop action. So I would like to add something else.  I would say that while this film is in science fiction / cyber `drag' I would call it a very Gnostic film. The most Gnostic of a number of such films to come out of late (Pleasantville, Dark City, Dead Man) And if you don't know what I mean by Gnostic then look it up. Learning New (Neo) things is good for you.",10,0,0,2 April 1999
Fantastic Four," The first all prologue film.
","I get the impression this would have turned out better if they had just skipped the first film and made the sequel first.In these sorts of films the 'origin' section is a necessary part that can be the best part or as in this one just tedious.The Fantastic Four it seemed to me was 95% prologue leading to nothing at all.Over and over I kept thinking. 'ah, now the films going to start!' But all that happened was more mediocre dialog from basic cable actors, keeping the pot boiling with a little not very impressive F/X, and even less impressive drama, in a film that I suspect was made by people who were uncomfortable to be making a comic book movie in the first place.A fantastic four minutes at the end, the rest, in my opinion just dull.",4,40,81,8 July 2005
