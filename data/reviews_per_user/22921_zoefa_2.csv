Requiem for a Dream," Confronting and truthful
","As a young Adult I found this movie so truthful to what happens around us. People probably think that Aronofsky exaggerated with the effects of drug addiction and that never happens in the real world. Although it can be raw and provoking, it should be shown to young teens and adults to educate them with the effects of drugs.Aronofsky made the film so much more interesting,that when every time the character took drug he showed a clip of it. He repeated it over and over again which made a great effect. Especially when Harry is going home after he found out his mother Sara is taking drugs to the extreme. He then starts crying, but takes Heroin to kill the sadness. With the small budget they had, its great what they did. The music and filming techniques added so much more onto the movie. The actors added so much more and should be noticed for it. Ellen Burstyn was great as a drug addicted elderly.The ending was brilliant, switching from each of the characters moments faster and faster until the movie ended. It shows the world what CAN happen if you addict to them. There where a few things the movie could have improved on, such as when Tyrone was put in jail and Harry had to use all of there drug dealing money to bail him out-they didn't explain it and could have made it more clear in some parts of the movie.Although a few thing were unclear, I'm surprised this movie didn't get much more notice than it did. Its truthful, confronting and Aronofsky did a great job in portraying the underworld of drugs.",8,0,1,3 August 2012
A Walk to Remember," Heartfelt but could have been better
","I usually love Nicholas Sparks books turned films, but this one didn't capture my heart. I mean it was alright and a feel good movie, but I felt Shane west as Landon Carter didn't express much chemistry towards Jamie (Mandy Moore).The storyline was great and I was definitely expecting a problem to occur to one of the characters, as many of Sparks books do. I felt that they should have shown more time filming Jamie and Landon working together before he tells her he loves her. It kind of went from one bit where he was rude and mean to her, from another bit telling her he loves her.And the scene where Jamie is photo shopped onto a photo which is stuck all through the school. That scene could have been so much more improved and dramatic all I felt was that he saw her upset, then punched a guy and then it was it.But apart from that Mandy Moore was brilliant, she did such a great job in portraying a purist girl without being to cheesy. I felt she did much more of the loving towards Landon, and he was just letting it come to him.Overall it was a good movie, and although there are a few things that could have been improved, it still managed to make me cry and become attached to the storyline. Its a film about first loves, miracles and opening yourself up to things you never imagined.",6,0,0,3 August 2012
