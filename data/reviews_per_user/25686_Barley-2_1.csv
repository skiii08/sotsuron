The Blair Witch Project," ho hum
","Nothing about this film, seen or unseen, is particularly frightening. As the 'actors' were freaking out about the 'eerie' noises around them, I kept thinking, 'Have these people never gone camping in the woods before?' I'm sorry, but little piles of rocks & dangling twig-people just aren't other-worldly enough to give me the creeps, even if I do find those things beside my tent. And while this is certainly an interesting exercise in improvisational scripting, it's no match for a well-crafted script with a beginning, a middle & an end. Good film-making is decidedly NOT about gratuitous gore or special effects, etc., but it IS about plot & dialogue & the movement of a story. Blair Witch fails to deliver any of these things. It's a much more successful exercise in hype & marketing than film-making.",1,0,2,18 August 1999
