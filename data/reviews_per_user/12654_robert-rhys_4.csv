First Man," An outstanding biopic that reveals a person that can be easily related to
","This film is an intimate, unflinching, and at times, touching depiction of Neil Armstrong's life leading up to and including his stepping foot on the moon. The test pilot scenes have a visceral quality to them that makes it easy to feel like you're in the pilot seat yourself. This balances masterfully with the portayal of his personal life and you can't help but see him as a real person that is both excepional and flawed, all at the same time.",9,1,6,14 October 2018
United 93," Poorly chosen scene ruins the entire movie
","In general, 'United 93' is a well-produced docudrama, but unfortunately the opening scene is rooted in a hate-based approach, which sets the tone of the movie to be inflammatory patriotic propaganda. The terrorists are shown as devout Muslims and since everyone knows how the story will end an immediate distaste for them and their beliefs is instilled in the viewer. And please don't get me wrong, I am not a believer of Islam (or any other major world religion for that matter), but the people who hijacked United Flight 93 were religious extremists. Not portraying them as such only incites cultural and religious hatred, rather than true understanding. A much better opening scene would have shown glimpses of their lives and what brought them to this tragic end. Show them as people who through a series of events are twisted and perverted into extremists who terrorize and murder in the name of their beliefs. So please do not watch this movie, it does not help make this world a better place.",1,0,11,6 March 2013
Aladdin," Lots of style, but unfortunately no substance
","With all of Disney's storytelling experience, you'd think that they would be masters of film, but sadly Aladdin (2019) demonstrates that they have a lot left to learn. On the positive side of things, the musical performance scenes are both fun and exciting to watch with good performances from the cast. There's also an excellent storyline change from the 1992 animated version that has Jasmine in a stronger role as a woman as well as a head of state. Unfortunately the negative aspects of this production far outweigh the positive. The most glaring of these is the absolutely flat acting of Aladdin (Mena Massoud). He was jarringly painful to watch when speaking - especially in scenes with Jasmine (Naomi Scott) because there was just no chemistry between the two of them. Switching over to a more nuanced criticism, the script itself was highly disappointing. Disney had an immense opportunity to more deeply explore the Arabian folklore at the center of this story which would have more prominently pitted Aladdin's street smarts against Jafar's cunning. Instead, the writers (John August & Guy Ritchie) chose to downplay and trivialize this conflict which results in a very shallow, uninteresting story that must rely on its visual effects to get by when it could have been so much more.",5,3,5,26 May 2019
The Witch," If it weren't for the offensive content, this might have been one of the best films of the year
","The creepy atmosphere was first rate and the performance by Anya Taylor Joy was outstanding, but unfortunately the script was utterly tasteless. There was certainly a mass hysteria promoted by Christian fanaticism in the colonial period and many innocent people were murdered because of it. I'm sickened by the direction that this film takes because rather than creating a horror film that explores how twisted and demented people of the time were and then gruesomely illustrating their terminal descent into madness, the film actually gives credence to their fanaticism by making their fears into reality. And to make the point, I'm not against supernatural elements in storytelling, in fact it's one of my favorite themes, but depicting women, animals and forests as wicked and depraved things to be scared of is completely unacceptable.",1,6,14,9 March 2017
