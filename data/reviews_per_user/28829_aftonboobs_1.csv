The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Outstanding
","I just saw this movie and I cant believe how this movie slipped past going 'mainstream' (forgive me for using that word)This whole movie has been an emotional role coaster that deserves every star I can give. The only reason why I signed into IMDb is to write this review because it deserves all the publicity it gets.They chose an excellent set of actors that really made the characters glow and I bet captivated every vision the director had.I wont give out any details, just do yourself a favor and get the movie!-Robert",10,2,5,1 April 2013
