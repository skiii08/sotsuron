3:10 to Yuma," A good Western?
","I must admit I have always loved westerns. So, when I heard that Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were going head to head, I was very exited. I saw the original years back and liked the film. This movie is considerably better. The acting is solid all around. I love seeing Peter Fonda. I wish he was a little more active. His career never got the bounce it deserved after his 'comeback' film, Ulle's Gold. The two leads are predictably excellent. My main problem with this film is with Crowe's character. His transformation from beginning to end seems forced. There is nothing in the movie which seems to pull him towards his actions at the end of the movie. The bond between him and Bale does not seem authentic. The best Westerns are usually clear cut stories about good and bad. This movie is more about redemption. The rest of the movie is good enough that it's flaws are forgivable. I would recommend this movie to fans of Action movies as opposed to Westerns. It just doesn't feel like a Western.",7,1,2,11 April 2008
Blood Diamond," Excellent film, terrible advertising.
","I truly had low expectations for this movie. When I saw the commercials for this, it looked like another action dud. It had good press and had garnered a couple of nods from the Academy, but I just could not get past the advertising. So, my friend loans me the DVD the other day, and to my surprise I really liked it. The performances are very strong by all three main characters. The action is not overwhelming, and well executed. I see two primary flaws in this film. First, it is a little melodramatic. The weight of the subject matter is enough. The constant fist clenching, screaming at the sky seemed forced. Second, I feel the movie should have ended ten minutes earlier. Far to often studios feel the need to punctuate movies with a tidy conclusion. Sometimes a film is well served by a little ambiguity. Despite it's flaws, this a very good film. Not just the sum of it's action sequences.",7,0,0,3 July 2007
Shooter," 2/3's a great film.
","As my summary and score indicate, there is something missing with this movie. To be precise there is 33% missing. First I'll cover the 66% that made it. Marky Mark is spot on. I still haven't figured out why he isn't a huge action star. He's a good looking kid and a far better actor than other more popular action stars. He has certainly been successful, but action super stardom has eluded him. In this movie he is pitch perfect as a the disgruntled ex-military sniper. He is bitter, intense, and deliberate. The overall direction of the films is quite good also. The look and feel of the film is somewhere between Ridley and Tony Scott. It is razor sharp and a little frenetic. Most of the supporting cast is good. The procedural look at the sniper craft is really cool. Now, the 33%. There are Gaping plot holes in this movie.$ It seems to give a great deal of screen time to stupid stuff, and then totally ignore things it shouldn't. Ned Beatty and Elias Koteas are awful in this film. The real shame is both of their characters seem unnecessary. I would also like to point out something that has bugged me for a long time. In all of the sniper movies they talk about all the precise adjustments necessary for these long shots they take. Then, when the camera cuts to the scope view it is centered right on the target's head. I love the procedural minutia, but they really should explain this. My last and largest complaint about this movies is the final acts. This movie has two endings. The first one is on the mountain, where it should of ended. The second one makes NO sense whatsoever. Did they reach the end of filming, realize they had some money left, and just keep on rolling. I am not going to give away the endings, but you will know what I am talking about.",6,1,4,3 July 2007
