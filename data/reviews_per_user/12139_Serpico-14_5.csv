Alien 3," Not that bad
","This third installment in the Aliens saga has taken a lot of bad rap for it's sluggish script and sometimes less than 3 dimensional characters. While I do agree with this to a degree, some of the lesser characters should not be overlooked. Charles S. Dutton with his usual unbridled fury and the wonderfully poised Charles Dance. Plus, the intense gloom of Fincher's camera that pays homage to Ridley Scott's original Alien. All in all, it's still a keeper.",8,0,3,30 September 1999
As Good as It Gets," Seeing the heart and laughing at the face
","This film is certainly one of the best romantic comedies made within the last ten years or so. Spectacular performances from all the leads with superb, solid back up. Outstanding direction as well. All of this is evident upon viewing, clearly. The premise of Helen Hunt's character falling for a jerk like Nicholson took a lot of bad lip service. But this film is about how love truly looks within to see the good and takes the bad on the exterior, accepting the whole package and even learning to laugh at it.",10,0,0,30 September 1999
Alien," Simply classic
",There simply will never be such a film as this one. It was indeed a the first of a timeless classic series. Ridley Scott moody and texturized visuals have been diluted in sequels but here they are fresh and vivid. Remarkable performances all around and special effects ahead of their time. For science fiction/horror lovers it's one for the library. I highly recommend the DVD with all it's extra features and sound/picture enhancements.,Null,0,1,30 September 1999
Armageddon," Good time
","Armageddon...while certainly not one of the most soul-searching, explorative films by its content is good film for it sheer entertainment value. This is why we still have the big screen. To be able to ooh and aah at the special effects and cheer heros. The villain isn't human and therefore not ambiguous. It's a comic story of epic berth which makes us love the experience of going to the movies.",Null,0,1,1 October 1999
Aliens," Another great chapter
",This film contains a very different setting and feel from Ridley Scott's classic. It adds much more action than the original while maintaining the suspense very well. The viewer comes to identify with a female heroine which is part of what makes the Aliens films so unique. Masterful direction and grand special effects that never cease to amaze and startle. Another one for the library.,Null,0,0,30 September 1999
