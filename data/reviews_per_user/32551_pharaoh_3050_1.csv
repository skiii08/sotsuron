Vertigo," the best of hitch, if not the best, period
","This movie is Hitchcock at his finest. Every scene, every frame, is artistically done and adds immensely to the overall quality of the piece, as does superb acting by the cast, especially Stewart. If you don't believe me, watch the end again; he adeptly displays the anticipation of sweet revenge, the fury against a deceptive lover, and the bittersweet remembrance, and longing for, that lost love. The wonderful icing on the proverbial cake is, of course, the beautiful, touching, and haunting music by Bernard Herrmann. This melancholy soundtrack brings my favorite movie to completion. I only have two small wishes about this film to make it better in my eyes, that the shot which pans up to show the outside of the court room hearing was better done and that the shot of the pillow hitting the ground when Scottie asks Madeleine to sit by the fire was repeated when Scottie does the same thing with Judy. Mere trifles, I know, but it's still my opinion. The closest to perfect a movie can get, sit back, and begin another journey into this emotional tale with those infamous designs of Saul Bass and watch the master at work.",10,2,5,7 September 2005
