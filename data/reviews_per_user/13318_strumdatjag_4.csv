United 93," Suspenseful, Well-Acted, Jumpy Camera-work
","Paul Greengrass has created a suspenseful, well-acted version of events regarding United 93 and the heroic passengers onboard. This is a great movie for these times, regardless of your political opinions. While some have complained that it is 'too soon' for this movie. From a story-telling standpoint, the opposite is actually true. While the telling of this heroic story is very moving and suspenseful in 2006, I suspect that a channel surfer 30 years hence may find boring the long introduction of everyday scenes of passengers boarding and sitting in an airplane. Yet, for the current theater-goer, the familiarity with the story and the understandable obliviousness of the passengers and crew to their impending doom only adds to the suspense. The hand-held camera for the most part makes the viewer feel like a passenger in the aircraft and a fly on the wall in air traffic control rooms. However, I was distracted and annoyed by much of the sudden irrelevant zooming and jerking especially at the end of many shots. It was not as nausea-inducing as the previous Greengrass film, 'The Bourne Supremacy', but a little less jumpy camera-work would have helped this movie. Because of the somewhat excessively jumpy camera-work, and the lack of timelessness to this otherwise great film, it gets 3 1/2 stars or an 8/10.",10,2,7,29 April 2006
BlacKkKlansman," Drags on a Bit - Some Very Good Performances
","There is much to like about this film, but I only give it a 6/10, blaming most of the negative aspects on Spike Lee's direction. There are more than a few very good acting performances: Washington and Driver, and several of the Klansman, especially the husband-wife duo (especially when contrasted to the poor acting of the 'bad cop' character). But Topher Grace as David Duke is a great, spot-on portrayal of the smarmy, 'marketable' klansman David Duke.. I was less convinced by the love interest/student activist and her relationship with Washington's character. The film suffers from an identity crisis, not knowing whether to be a drama or a comedy. This would have been a better story to be made as dark comedy (maybe like 'I, Tonya' (9/10)), or maybe an action, suspense drama. But instead it meanders throughout much of the film. When it's good, this film is superb, but there is much dead time in it. The long speeches greatly slow down the pacing of the film (and I'm NOT a person with a short cinematic attention span - I love '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the wedding scene in 'The Deer Hunter'). A second long speech is a lost opportunity to build suspense. Lee tries but fails to build that suspense, with cinematic tools he should know how to use by now. Lee's attempts to tie the 70's Klan to Trump were forced and at times insulted the intelligence of the audience (Did he really think he had to repeat a Trump catch-phrase over and over and over . . . or we'd somehow be too stupid to get his point?). Factually,.this former Colorado Springs resident can accept (for cinematic reasons) moving the mostly flat city of Colorado Springs to the hills (Spike's city looks more like neighboring Manitou Springs). At least the Black Student Union sign was written in the correct Colorado College Colors. Go Tigers.",6,2,6,18 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I Don't Understand the Hate
","This is a superb finale to the Star Wars saga. The loose are tied up nicely with some interesting twists. It's great. Go see it and have fun. Of course there are some clunky performances at times from the veterans of the franchise, some stupid dialogue and a few 'if this happened then why did that happen' moments. But overall it was great Final ranking:. I gave a 10 to 5,4 and 6 I gave a 9 to 7,9 and 3. I gave a 7 to the much maligned Episode 8, a barely passing 6 to 2 and a flunking 5 to 1.",9,7,17,27 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better Than Episodes 1 and 2
","Somewhere there should be a review from one of us who gave this a positive scor - mine 7/10.. The re-intro to Luke is a bit ho-hum. Indeed, the first half of the movie is a bit substandard. But the action picks up in the second half and the story is advanced. It's visually stunning, and there are some things unexpected that apparently upset the rigid Star Wars nuts. Still I give it 7/10 and rank it ahead of Episodes 1 and 2. Now the hardcore can go after my lack of Roman Numerals. For the record, I rank the episodes: 5, 4, 6, 3 (all 10/10), 7 (9/10), 6 (7/10), 2 (6/10) and 1 (4/0) Episode 1 is the only bad movie of the Saga.",7,3,18,4 May 2019
