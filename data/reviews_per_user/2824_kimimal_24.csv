The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Watch it!
","-Great characters.
-Great dilemmas.
-Many heartwarming moments and crazy revelations.
-Music is good.
-Drama is perfect!-Only complaint is how teen-ish it gets, but that's the spirit of the movie so completely forgivable.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Fight Club," Awesome.
","-Great actors.
-Great story.
-Bizarre moments and characters.
-Great suspenseful moments and unspeakable actions.-I totally called the twist though.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
The Day After Tomorrow," It's better than most disaster movies
","-Like how it brings global warming the attention it deserves.
-The survival tactics were commendable.-I didn't get too attached to the characters, thus there wasn't much suspense.",7,3,3,30 April 2020
Deadpool 2," Not as good as the first but still worth a watch.
","-Same love put into the 4th wall breaks and characters.
-I love how it tried to break your expectations.-I remember not liking the ending. I don't remember what happened though.",8,1,1,30 April 2020
The Prestige," Not For Me Personally
","-Really clever tricks and twists
-Interesting characters-It is so depressing.
-Characters are unlikable.
-Gets you into a really bad, hopeless mood.",6,0,0,30 April 2020
Blades of Glory," So Hilarious
","-So funny; I love re-watching it.
-I like how the two characters learn to get along.",8,0,8,30 April 2020
Nacho Libre," Still has a big place in my heart
","-I loved this movie as a kid and still do.
-Hilarious.-Definitely due for a re-watch though. My opinion has probably changed.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Literally fell asleep in the theater
","-Only saving grace is the amazing CGI, especially for Leia.-This just feels like a side story, not part of a trilogy.
-Ending made no sense at all and just feels infuriating and cringe-y.
-All the characters have nothing going for them and are completely devoid of anything remotely like development other than the villain. He's literally the only character I like and he's the bratty antagonist.
-Where is Rose? What happened to her from the last movie?!
-Yeah great there's a lesbian kiss of two characters that never speak and have no character whatsoever. That's just an insult, using lesbianism for better ratings. Anyone can make two female extras kiss for 2 seconds. If you had balls, you'd make Ray lesbian and have her kiss a girl. That'd be so much more praiseworthy.
-Story was so boring and linear. Go to A, B, C, then finish. I fell asleep toward the end it was so boring.",2,15,22,30 April 2020
Schindler's List," Great, but it is way too long. It can be cut down a lot and still be great.
","-Like Dunkirk, it really focused on the facts rather than making it hollywood.
-Filming it in black and white was very fitting.-The length is kinda dumb since they could've literally cut out a bunch of stuff. Because of that, it's hard to re-watch.",7,0,3,30 April 2020
I Am Legend," Eh it's okay
","-Pretty okay story.
-Good music.
-Always had me in suspense.
-Very good at mood and atmosphere.
-Very lonely movie (which leads to a boring plot).-The stupid 'they feel' nonsense is dumb.
-Gets pretty depressing.",7,0,1,30 April 2020
The Imitation Game," Good stuff
","-Good actors.
-Good story.
-Good relationships.
-Really cute and suspenseful moments.
-Great music.
-Very lovable main character.
-A lot of lovely quotes.-After a certain point, it gets very boring.
-The flashbacks were delivered badly.",8,1,1,30 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Pretty good!
","-Cute characters, even tho girl was extremely annoying and impulsive sometimes.
-Very hipster kinda movie.
-Great music.
-Great visuals and shots and transitions.
-Funny situations.-The story was pretty monotonous toward the end.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Original is def better.
","-Had small changes here and there that was pretty cool.
-Pretty cool beast design (maybe could've done better on face though)
-Some great extra songs.
-LeFou is gay which is interesting.-Didn't really add anything to make it stand apart and possibly be better than the original, making it not as good.",6,0,0,30 April 2020
The Shape of Water," Just spectacular.
","-I can understand why some people may have found this movie boring since the story isn't much, but it's about the characters and their relationships.
-The development of the characters was SO touching and lovely.
-I love the focus on how monsters may be more human than some humans are.
-Ending was so memorable.-I guess the it was a bit off-putting but other than that, great!",9,1,13,30 April 2020
Joker," An Extremely Disturbing and Empathetic Look at Madness
","-Definitely need to rewatch to fully understand what happened.
-Story seems regular but it's the actual journey of the film that makes it so amazing.
-We truly do live in a society. A horrible one at that that treats mental illness like dirt.
-I love the mixture of what's real and what isn't occurring in the film. It truly makes you doubt what is happening.
-Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job. He's so haunting and demented in this movie. It's spectacular.
-Truly a movie that disturbs you much like how the Joker should.
-You really understand why someone like that would go crazy, maybe even why so many other people in the real world go crazy or just do crazy things. The world keeps pushing them down. So how else can someone who's been through this react?",10,1,2,30 April 2020
Inception," Even Though I've Only Seen It Once, I Can Remember Everything
","-Extremely memorable.
-Throws you entirely for a loop.
-Very interesting characters and story.
-Effects are crazy!
-Ending has a very meaningful message I think a lot of people should know.",10,0,1,30 April 2020

-Good voice actors.
-Funny.
-Who doesn't like pets?-Premise is typical.

Finding Dory," It was 'kay.
","-Good story.
-Fun new characters (Hank is great :3) and the usual old characters
-Good music.
-Interesting outcome and story.
-Everything after the ending is really good.-Opening is weirdly out of place.
-The first 3rd feels very rushed.",7,1,2,30 April 2020
The Blind Side," I don't like sports, and I loved it.
","-Great story. Very inspiring and touching.
-Great characters.-I do think the melodrama at the end was unnecessary.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Lives Up To Everything I've Heard
","-Great story.
-Great characters and casting.
-Great dialogue.
-Great music.
-Never got boring.
-Very clever and uplifting message about hope.-I can't think of any bad things about it except maybe the length but it's chock full-o-fun.",10,0,0,30 April 2020
Deadpool," <3
","-Good humor.
-Good characters.
-Great emotional moments.
-The ending was ON POINT! SO proud!
-4th wall breaking was hilarious.
-Love Al and his bartender friend, just wish they had more screen time.
-I'm so glad they makers took risks for this. It wouldn't be Deadpool if it wasn't R.",9,0,1,30 April 2020
The Pursuit of Happyness," Yes
","-Great characters.
-Great story; great morals and lessons; really portrayed difficulty and overcoming it in the end
-Very inspirational.-It does drag on for a long time at many points.
-Gets extremely depressing at many points too. If you stick it out though, there's hope.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
Jurassic Park," Amazing movie!
","-Characters all had their own priorities and ideas and development.
-Does an amazing job with build up. Spectacular. Your initial wonder is immediately filled with doubts not only from characters in the movie, but other events starting to unfold. That feeling of dread only builds to its peak right when things start going downhill.
-Action and CG are amazing.-I just can't ignore how some characters knew this was gonna go bad somehow and didn't act on that feeling before it happened. It's just dumb.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
The Martian," Solutions are very Cool!
","-I really liked how the martian was able to solve his problems with SCIENCE! I had no idea you can 'make' water.-Not sure if all of it is pretty accurate.
-Story really started to drag toward the end. It focused on how he's so smart and thought out so many good solutions then have him sit and wait for someone to get him. Real stark contrast.
-I didn't grow attached to any characters.",7,0,0,30 April 2020
