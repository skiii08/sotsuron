The Avengers," The Avengers by ERIC GOLDMAN
","We can all rest easy. They pulled it off! Marvel's The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble, as it's known in the UK and other markets) is everything we've been hoping for an exciting superhero team-up film packed with memorable moments.I've been waiting for this movie since I first read an Avengers comic book when I was 8-years old, and of course, that sort of feeling is shared by so many people, across multiple generations, given The Avengers' 49-year-old history. That's a huge burden to put on the shoulders of writer/director. But if anyone could make it work, it would be the director, whose geek creed (and gift for strong characterization) has been long established via the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, and his time writing for Marvel Comics' Astonishing X-Men.ERIC GOLDMAN from IGN",8,2,6,1 April 2015
