","As a life-long Bond fan I wanted a movie that brought some of the missing values to the Bond/Eon series like Moneypenny & Q. Mendes & Craig pulled off an enjoyable 007 adventure with a reliable cast including a good baddie at last in Javier Bardem. Good location use of London's familiar landmarks. Also glad to see the end of Dench era, a good Eon servant but now with Fiennes as a new younger 'M' perhaps offers more scope. Finally good to see the movie rewarded with awards particularly Adele's title song & Thomas Newman's soundtrack. Now we look forward to their efforts of Bond 24 which is rumoured to start filming in October 2014.",9,1,9,20 March 2014
