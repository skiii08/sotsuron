Hereditary," I can not say enough good things about Hereditary
","Hereditary is probably going to be the best Horror movie of our time and let's start with Ari Aster a first time director, creating a masterpiece of cinematic horror, this movie and everyone involved deserve to at least be nominated for an Oscar. I will tell you the two standout actors in this movie and it's Alex Wolff as we watch his characters descent, don't wanna spoil anything, but he gives one chilling performance as does Toni Collette, that women can act and is so great at it. Wow I am still shook to my core with this film. Go see it people!",10,29,60,8 June 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Love, Love, Love Three Billboards Of Ebbing Missouri!!!!
","I was entertained frame by frame of this riveting movie, the performance of Frances Mcdormand is probably the best acting I have seen in a long time, Frances is amazing in this movie and her subtle nuances are something to behold. Sam Rockwell's character I hated, but about halfway through the film something happens and my opinion of the character totally changes. Sam is such an amazing actor that and deserves an Oscar for his performance in this role, I absolutely love that man. There is another amazing performance that is worth noting, actor Caleb Landry Jones is incredible in the role of 'Red' Caleb is new to me, but I remember him from Get Out and he's just perfect in Three Billboards. I've read some negative reviews about this movie and I always chalk it up to, there's always somebody who's not going to like this, but come on people, it's a movie! It's supposed to entertain! I read one review and they broke down every situation that was wrong with the film, like the movie would be over If blah, blah, blah got arrested, the Billboards should of burned, like it's the story! If you want reality watch the news! Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri is a movie everyone needs to see. It's a movie that is meant to entertain, relax and enjoy the ride. I didn't want the movie to end! That's what I didn't like about the movie 'It Ended' go see it people, don't listen to the negative people that want reality and no fun.",Null,1,5,16 January 2018
Baby Driver," Baby Driver, best movie of 2017
","Love, love, loved this movie!M saw it 4 times already and about to see it again. Finally a feel good joy ride of a movie, if you fall asleep during this movie, something is wrong with you, the acting, the music, the direction, the action and the cinematography is top notch in this movie. Ansel Elgort is an amazing actor who now has a fan for life and Edgar Wright is a genius. I even loved how there was a deaf actor who was great by the way, his name is CJ Jones and Lanny Joon was really funny as JD even though the character was quick he was awesome. The movie had 3 heist sequences and each one was better than the next and I'm telling you I was literally on the edge of my seat the first two times seeing the movie, I was able to sit back and really enjoy it the last two times. This movie needs to win every award there is because it is that good. Please do not listen to the sour pusses with their negative reviews, this movie is genius, please do yourself a favor and go see Baby Driver, and on the big screen too, don't wait for this to be on DVD.",10,11,19,31 July 2017
Get Out," Get Out Delivers the goods!
","Getz Out is definitely the best horror movie to come out in a while, Get Out is the perfect blend of terror and comedy and to me that is why we go to the cinema, to laugh and to be scared and this movie really delivers. The acting, directing and just The over all feel of this movie is simply perfect. I really enjoyed the little twist near the end too and I will not spoil it If you have a chance go see Get Out. And any negative comments about this film are just people that do not know great film making because this film is really that good. Oh and also I want to point out that this movie is not dark like most horror movies are. It has great lighting at a great location.",10,6,18,28 February 2017
Creed II," Creed 2 fires on all Cylinders
","Fantastic well made cinema here, the acting, Directing and the sound in this movie is outstanding. It was a great time at the movies for me and when the audience clapped at the end I really felt the love for it. I loved Creed, but I think I might like Creed 2 better cause of the character development. Go see it!",10,1,3,1 December 2018
