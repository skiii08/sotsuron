The Blair Witch Project," THE WORST MOVIE EVER
","In my lifetime, I guess I've seen somewhere around a 1000 movies.  Well this is the tops.  Tops of the worst that is.  1/10.  The movie is not scary or thrilling whatsoever.  Which after you've decided that, only leaves the film with a guy with a bad hand for holding a mini-cam.  It was supposed to make you feel like you were there, well nice try but not even close, all it did was annoy me.  Plus it's all of 1 hour 20 mins long tops....not exactly a great buy for $10.  But even this short amount of time had me starring at my watch wondering when this movie would end or get better, which it never did. The movie finished the way it started, weak.  I can't say one good thing about this film.",1,2,4,20 April 2000
Rules of Engagement," Excellent film, Great performances by Jones and Jackson
","Rules of Engagement was an excellent film, with lots of action and very fiery performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones.  The cinematography and use of sound, made one feel as though they were in the middle of the film.  One of the best movies of the year.  Well worth the money, a must see in a large threatre.",10,1,3,19 April 2000
