Source Code," A must-see in action and SCI/FI
","I have a problem with Jake G. Ever since I saw him in 'Brokeback mountain' I have problems placing him in other characters. To give you an example, when I saw 'Zodiac' I had to force myself out of the 'ok, so a gay cowboy working for a newspaper' thought. Luckily for me, I only spent five minutes looking at a gay cowboy on a train, because Jake G. managed to pull this one off beautifully.Is a good story and (what I like most about sci/fi movies) it has just the right amount of 'wow', 'I didn't expect that!' and 'I told you I didn't like that guy' to keep you glued to your seat. The actors are all believable, and the special effects are so subtle that you barely realize they are there, so kudos so far.The again, I didn't give this movie full marks for a reason. The main problem is the storyline. Yes, I know these types of movies require you to take a leap of faith and leave aside logical explanations, but the 'parallel universe yes, parallel universe not' that only serves to justify the end did not help me buying into it. And then is the end. All the intrigue and emotion that has carried you during all the movie to end up in something so predictable that makes you sad. OK, let's be fair, there are a couple of smile-provoking things towards the end, but to me it was simply not good enough.Key phrase: 'First blood's Rambo and this guy definitely have something in common'",Null,0,1,13 July 2011
John Wick," If I was the doggie I would have suicide...that is how bad this movie is
","No spoiler here. You can already see in the trailer that the doggie dies and he goes all vengeful so here we have, for the nth time, a movie about killers and revenge. Problem? This movie does NOTHING to add to the genre.Plain, predictable, boring, and worst of all it seems that it even took ideas from other movies, such as 'Collateral' or 'Wanted'. It even went all 'direct to VHS' with scenes that left you thinking things like 'the guy you want dead the most happens to be right in front of you, you spent half the movie trying to kill that guy, and then for no apparent reason you just don't do it, just to try to kill him again once he is safety away from you...just WHY?', or the classic 'bad foreign guys talking English when they are alone'...all the things that make us laugh when watching B-movies. Problem? The lead role is friggin Mr. Keanu Reeves! I mean, Keanu, my man, what's wrong with you? Did you already spent all that Matrix money? And you did some good stuff before and after so tell us, why did you find the need of making this movie? How could this topical typical unwanted and definitely not needed movie help your career? Man, I even liked Devil's advocate but this? This is murder man.So Mr. Reeves, I sincerely hope whatever financial problems you might be in, whatever favor you needed to do, whatever contractual requirements you had to fulfill, are now over and you can go back to do proper movies.As for whoever wants to watch this...just don't waste your time.Finally, if you want to ask why I did not give it the lowest mark the answer is that I like the golden coins thing. That is all I could savage from that dumpster of a movie.",2,2,10,24 May 2015
Split," Not bad, but it could have been so much more...
","Maybe I am getting picky, maybe I have been spoiled by better movies, maybe I kept going back to 'Identity' but Split was not what I was expecting.The movie is OK if you take it as an exercise in simplicity. Girls get abducted and then things happen. But you become sad when you realize all that this movie could have been and was left at the surface.Each and every character could have been developed. The very predictable story could oh-so-easily become unpredictable. It is like you find a pot of gold coins but you pick a few because your are too lazy, or easily satisfied, or didn't have the time, to go and take it all.Case in point is that I could interchange a couple of the victims and the plot would still remain intact.The only good thing that keeps this movie together is the great interpretation from James McAvoy. He has a pretty complicated character, or sets of characters, and he delivers them all with easy. 'Identity' had a far superior plot but the actors had a much easier task, comparatively speaking. For his interpretation alone this movie is worth watching. But unfortunately, for not much more else.So, if you come to see this movie with low expectations you will be satisfied. If you still remember 'Identity', you will suffer with what this movie could have been. If you haven't watch 'Identity', you may as well skip Split altogether.",5,1,3,11 September 2017
It Follows," Excellent classic teen scary movie
","Let me precede my review stating that at the time of this review (October 2015) I am far from a teen. Yours truly is almost 40. But that does not mean I have lost the taste for a good classic style horror movie, and this one delivers 100%.The plot is simple. The scares, crafty and, even if sometimes expected, you can always find yourself surprised by the delivery. The actors can perfectly fit your group of friends back when you were a teen (or right now, depending on your age).This movie kept me watching it to the end, so its a movie that I would definitely recommend to others.",10,5,18,3 October 2015
Children of Men," If you can hold at the beginning, you will be rewarded at the end
","I loved '28 days later', so naturally I was hoping, though not expecting, (one has his fair share of near and full misses believing biased reviews in newspapers), something on the lines of a realistic, do-it-yourself McGyver sort of action movie, and while it was not all that bad, the first half almost killed the second one.The problem of this movie is that, unlike in '28 days', here the spectator needs to wait and wait to really start getting into the pace of the movie, and is not like the plot takes to unfold (the trailer tells you everything you need to know) but that you could easily snooze the first 30 minutes and then wake up to see what this movie is really all about.If you manage to wait without dying of boredom, you will eventually find yourself in a movie with a good level of thought-provocative questions about immigration and political agendas, but don't let my words scare you; these questions are there only if you want to think about them. Otherwise the movie keeps you entertained just fine.The one thing I did like about the movie is that most characters have a two-side personalityand you will see what I mean if you watch the movie.Key phrase: Waitso this one was the good guy, and that one wasn't?",Null,1,6,13 July 2011
Casino," One of the best movies of all time
","You know you are facing a work of art when you watch it again and again and is always fresh and new and attractive. Casino does that, and more.Superb acting of every actor involved, but with an special mention to Joe Pesci who basically played the exact same kind of guy of 'Goodfellas'. Robert the Niro, totally believable, and even Sharon Stone, someone I don't particularly like on screen does an excellent job transforming herself along the movie.One thing I absolutely love in movies is when they talk to you. This happened both in 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas'. I felt as if I was sitting with the characters and they were talking to me. And unlike 'Goodfellas', where the main character is the one doing the talking, this time a few of the characters talk, and even give you reasons to why they do what they are doing.The plot is about a mafia-controlled casino and about the life and times of Sam Rothstein, professional gamble turned into casino manager and his trigger-happy friend, or about a perfect operation spiraling out of control.You don't want to miss this movie. In fact, I recommend you to own it instead of rent it because you will want to watch it again and again.Keyphrase: 'Why you have to get married is beyond me'.Is a long movie but it doesn't feel long. That is what happens when you watch a movie that is a complete piece of art.",10,1,2,27 December 2010
The Nice Guys," It blew on my face after 30 minutes
","Have you ever started a dish, found that you don't like it, and eat it all? It seems that, with movies, we are to watch the whole thing until the end, no matter how bad it is. Thankfully, more and more people began leaving the theaters when bored, and this is exactly what I did with this movie.I watched some 30 minutes before deciding that enough was enough and left. It is not that the movie was awful, or the acting terrible, but for the life of me I could not get hooked on the story no matter how hard I tried.The movie began in a very promising way, with very funny parts...and then, nothing. In retrospect I feel that the movie was more like a collection of funny gigs without a plot. Once the plot came, the movie went out of the window.Ryan Gosling is very good. Funny and fresh. Not the same can be said about Russell Crowe who seems tired which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that he is supposed to be an action type of guy. The rest gets lost to me.By the time Kim Bassinger showed up I was ready to leave and left. I have no idea how the movie ended, so my 3 points are based on the initial performance of Russell and Gossling.Another movie I really wanted to like and didn't make it. Pity.",3,3,13,25 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Crap Max: Fury on the spectator
","Understand first where I come from. I am a die hard fan of the Terminator saga, and particularly loved T2. I watched all previous Mad Max movies and I did like them. And I have seen pretty much every post-apocalyptic movie and TV show there is, because this is how I roll.So when I come to see Mad Max 4 I know what to expect. I know it's going to be pretty much action everywhere, a bit of background story, and some character development to keep it all somehow together. I do not expect more, but I also don't expect less because that is what the Mad Max franchise has been giving us.Then, before I get to see this movie, I read all sorts of great reviews from everywhere. I do not read spoilers, and I do not watch trailers, but I can feel from all these reviews that this Mad Max movie seems to have something going for it. It even ranked number 1 of 2015 in IMDb, the very site where I do all my movie reviews, so I decided to give it a go.Unfortunately, this is what I've found: A Benny Hill-esque type of movie but without trying to be fun. Also without any character development, background story, or pretty much anything other than action that gets boring after the first five minutes of it.And it's not like the story didn't have a change to fill those gaps: The main characters give us a hint, even sometimes a mysterious indication, of things that happened to them and things that they wanted. What happened to character X's past that are so present in the movie? What sort of accident happened to character Y? Why character Z became the big boss of that one tribe? Unfortunately there seem to be no time to answer any of these questions, or any question for that matter, nor time for any development or attachment whatsoever.Speaking of time, you may argue that there was none for all the questions I had. Well, Mad Max 4 is a good 2 hours, so I tend to disagree with that. The movie could easily do without 20 minutes of meaningless vehicle chase and put that time for the audience to learn the bare minimum about the characters so we did not feel we where the audience of some sort of monster truck show.To make matters worse, the movie don't even have the minimum respect to fundamental physics. And nope, I am not splitting hairs here. I am not going to tell you that a vehicle cannot fly that high or anything like that. I am going to stick to the basis: Humans cannot run as fast as moving vehicles at high speed. Humans cannot run for miles without panting for at least a couple of minutes. Pregnant humans on their nine month of pregnancy cannot run as fast as non-pregnant humans. And of course, if going in a hurry from point A to point B takes X hours, going back in the exact same route with the same hurry should take more or less the same time. But not in the world of Mad Max 4. Here everything goes because, apparently, the audience will love the franchise so much that it will justify every single of the many errors of this movie.The funny thing is that for a while it seemed to work. I went to watch it with someone not familiar with the franchise, and for a while I tried to forgive and explain the movie, as in 'well, maybe the vehicle looked like in a hurry but in reality was making 2 miles an hour' but at the end my companion and I decided to laugh it off even though the laugh was on us because the investors of these movie were the ones pocketing our cash.So my advice to you is the following: Do not bother. Wait until it goes for free on your TV, or you have a long flight and it's on. Or skip it all together. Watch again one of the old Mad Max movies and be done with it.",2,18,38,30 December 2015
