Alien 3," Great atmosphere, yet not Alien worthy
","For me a good sequel needs to have new things, and it should not be a rehash of it's prequel. That's the problem with Alien3. Alien was a great movie, the Alien is one of the coolest movie monsters ever created (together with Predator). Aliens improved on this by adding a lot of new cool things, most noticeable the Alien Queen. Alien3 doesn't add anything new. Well, there is the queen parasite, and the new alien is a 'dog Alien' (makes you wonder what the Alien from the space jocks (Alien 1) looks like...), but these are so insignificantly. So we're stuck with a been-there-done-that monster-chasing-victims movie. Still the movie is fun, and it looks absolutely awesome (great atmosphere). Not the crappy movie you might expect, but not a worthy addition to the Alien series too. Go see parts 1,2 and 4 !",Null,393,411,27 January 1999
