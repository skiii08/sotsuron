Source Code," As Exhilarating As Inception
","Source Code is a Action Sci Fi Thriller film Directed by Duncan Jones (same guy that brought us Moon, 2009) This film centres a soldier who wakes up in another man's body. He soon discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. It's starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Russell Peters, Michael Arden & Scott Bakula. #FACT: Topher Grace was also considered for the lead role.SLIDER'S REVIEW: When I saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to go see it. Last time I saw Jake Gyllenhaal in a major role was in Love & Other Drugs and his performance there was very heartfelt.When I watched Source Code I was surprised that it surpassed all my expectations, believe me when I say this is one epic blockbuster (a must see). It's one of the most thrilling rides I've been on whilst watching a film. The action is very hands on and detective like work so were exploring with the lead role, this made it very entertaining. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is as good as Inception (yep it's that good). From the moment we meet Capt. Colter Stevens on a train this film had my full attention (it just grabs you from the word Go). I felt like I started off with the main character because he knows as much as I did when the film starts so it felt like we went through understanding the Source Code together. I loved the twist and turns the storyline takes, one minute I thought I knew what was going to be the outcome... then it switches. it has a very creative plot alongside the type of love story I could see developing. Parts of the film has that jaw dropping effect that just keeps getting better. I think most people who see this film will want to watch it again to understand it more or simply to just to watch it again. I loved the concept that a man could go back 8 minutes using a computer programme before an explosion in a bid to save lives. The visual effects of the explosions looked really cool to watch. The director has produced the world a smart action thriller that does its job extremely well and will be talked about for months to come. The Best Film in 2011 So Far.Jake Gyllenhaal has done it again. This has got to be his best work on screen in a very long time. His character as Capt. Colter Steven was a very heart pounding person to watch. He carried this film from the moment we set eyes on him all the way to the end. He's a smart and charming man that just had everything his character needed. A Very good actor. Michelle Monaghan is one pretty woman. Her character was Christina. She plays this neatly dressed, well-spoken woman exceptionally well. I'm sure it wasn't easy trying to keep up with forever changing scenarios. The women on the monitor screen is Carol Goodwin, her character is played by Vera Farmiga. She help us understand more as the film goes along. She also is a very good actress. Jeffery Wright plays a very believable Dr. Rutledge. I for one was surprised to see Russell Peters in this film (when did he become an actor?). I have to give credit to the comedian because he does an Applausable job, surprisingly the acting seemed to come natural to him.This cast was amazing as a whole.",10,4,11,1 April 2011
Limitless," Top Notch Entertainment
","Limitless is an Action/Thriller film Directed by Neil Burger (same guy that brought us The illusionist, 2006). This film is about a writer who discovers a top-secret drug which gives him super human abilities. Its Starring Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel, John Whitworth, Robert John Burke & Tomas Arana.#FACT: This film is based on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn.SLIDER'S REVIEW:Watching the trailer was exciting enough to get me psyched to watch this film. The plot looked fresh & fun plus the feeling of going on a journey with a man with no limits is intriguing. The front man Bradley Cooper has been a knockout in his recent performances like Hangover & A Team so I was not expecting any less.Everything I expected this film is to be is exactly what it was â€“ Top End Entertainment. The moment it started I was engaged till the end. This had a original story feel to it and, it doesn't go too deep that you gets lost in questions like how's this drug even possible. It even tries to makes you believe the story is real. It doesn't even beat around the bush it just goes straight to the good stuff. Our main character Eddie starts off as a writer who then goes into other business areas but the longer he was taking these pills for the bigger his problems became. We go into a world of super intelligence that you won't want to come out of. The longer it went on for the more interesting it became. I for one wouldn't mind a part 2.This film manages to mix in a few genres that kept on surprising. I just didn't know what else they could throw in. The effects used merge into this film perfectly because they found a way to show us what the main character was feeling and how it was happening to him. It didn't get in the way it just looked really cool.From the good guys to the bad ones, everybody acted superbly in their roles. Bradley Cooper does a sensational job as Eddie Morra. His character transforms in a blink of an eye (literally) and he becomes this superhuman that was just awesome to watch. This is a journey of self-discovery that just has to be seen (Makes you imagine what super YOU could be like). I liked Robert De Niro character Carl Van Loon, he played this intimidating straight talking businessman who role was taken seriously. Abbie Cornish stars as Eddies Girlfriend Lindy, she also does a great job on screen. I liked it when her character was backed up against the corner and had only one choice. Anna Friel plays Melissa, her character brought a sense of realness to this storyline. She was an aftermath that we didn't know about and was surprising to see.#FACT: Shia LaBeouf was supposed to star as Eddie Morra but had to give away his role due to a car accident where he injured his arm.",9,2,4,30 March 2011
