The Avengers," Good but inherently flawed
","This is a good film but the current overall IMDb score of 8.9 is rather high.Put simply its entertaining and fun. However the problem inherent in the film is how to fit so many larger than life characters into one story and give them equal screen time. Whedon manages to do it but as a result i feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story. There are a lot of new character relationships that have to be established. It gets a little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itself.The threat facing the avengers, i.e Loki and his rather randomly sourced army, just seems a bit cobbled together. Especially the army! Where they came from or what they are doesn't seem properly explained. Just that Loki somehow has one. The threat the Avengers face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains. Loki on his own just doesn't seem that threatening. He is wonderfully without remorse though. Bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge. One of his scenes with black widow is almost like Hannibal Lector and Clarice in Silence of the Lambs.Black widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film. Maybe its because she doesn't actually have any super powers that makes her so. What she does have is an exceptional mind, attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills. Played wonderfully by Scarlet Johannson she is a pleasure in practically every scene.One of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes. Whedon is a master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesn't disappoint here. The cinema audience laughed hard many times. The Hulk having the two biggest laughs in the film.This is a decent film which could have went horribly wrong. A lot of lead characters vying for screen time is a problem. Time spent establishing new relationships also. Perhaps the next one will be more compelling? The film isn't overly subtle but then what did i expect given the nature of its premise!?",7,10,23,29 April 2012
Life of Pi," Not sure what the fuss is about.
","I'm afraid I must have missed something about this film. And perhaps I really did but there is nothing particularly awe inspiring as you might have been led to believe. For one the grand claim about making you believe in God is never really answered. There is a quick vague nod to it at the end but for me it made no sense. The main story has nothing whatsoever to do with God. So I'm a bit puzzled on that one. There is a bit of a semi twist near the end that I didn't see coming. This reveals an extra dimension to the story that was previously hidden to us. However the impact of the twist is never really brought home in any tangible way (that is quite possibly intentional). You would have to watch the film again to appreciate the twist but like me you will probably not be bothered. The best thing about the film is the cinematography, visual effects, pi himself, young and old (both characters and both actors)and the various animals. They are sometimes cute and have their own personalities. If you like nature programmes you will enjoy it. The 3D was never spectacular but a nice extra. There are a few gorgeous looking tableau like scenes of the boat on the sea with the skyline. Visually the film looks good throughout. Pi (younger)is an interesting character. He is intelligent and has a hunger for learning. His strange obsession with gods and religions is quite annoying though (especially for an atheist like me)and seems to serves no purpose for the narrative. I think the film might be trying to say something quite profound about religion but I'm afraid it was either made too subtly or just isn't there at all. Maybe you need to read the book. The actor of the older pi is quite brilliant and very engaging. Very stoic and dignified. All in all not a bad film but please don't believe the hype! Its a sad story really but the way it ends left me kind of cold and underwhelmed.",6,7,16,6 January 2013
Pacific Rim," fun fun fun
","OK, so yes its a special effects extravaganza involving giant robots (called jaeger) fighting giant monster aliens (called kaiju) from another dimension. Which sounds a little worrying especially when the trailers make it look like a longer mighty morphing power rangers episode. It had so much potential to be awful. Guillermo Del Toro (science fiction/fantasy/horror storyteller extraordinaire) of course was not going to let that happen. It turns out to be very entertaining and fun. One important thing to mention to anyone not in the know is that this film is heavily indebted to the many Japanese films and TV series which tackle a similar giant robot/mecha suited subject. I think perhaps (not that I'm an expert) most notably the TV and film series Neon Genesis Evangelion. I imagine this is the sort of thing that inspired and influenced this film. Which of course is a great thing given how flipping good the first two film recaps have been. If you haven't seen any of this please go seek it out. Therefore it is a nice touch that one of the main characters in Pacific Rim is a Japanese women. Most of the action is set in Hong Kong but unfortunately, while there is a Chinese Jaeger team and also a Russian team, both have very little screen time or speaking parts. Apart from the main team in the story - Mako and Raleigh, the team with the 2nd most focus is given to the rather bland father and son (Australian? - the accents were hard to define) team. I found myself not caring too much about them to be honest. Felt more for the Chinese and Russians who had much less characterisation. Perhaps the film producers felt that they needed to have a larger white male presence in the film to reflect the films probable viewing demographic. Which I'm sorry to say is just dull, lazy and boring. I'm sure this sort of consideration is necessary for any big expensive film to be given the green light but its sort of disappointing all the same. The first few minutes of this film manage to do something quite impressive. In this very short time they manage to give a very accurate and believable summary of the first 7 years of the kaiju/human/jaegar war. 7 whole years told exceptionally skillfully in a couple of few minutes. This sets up the film beautifully. Yes i said believable! How did they manage to make it seem realistic that huge monsters could rampage around major cities a la Godzilla? Plus the fact that said monsters originate from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the pacfic ocean? I don't know either but they did. The human interest stories are of course what make any film and the relationship between Mako and Stacker (Idris Elba's stern military leader) is quite compelling. A scene involving Mako's initial encounter with a Kaiju and then Stacker as a child is really quite poignant. The child actor plays the part so realistically (all strained breathing and crys) that you wonder if she thought it was actually happening. Of course there's a whole lot of fun stuff too. Did i mention the giant robots fighting giant alien monsters? Well, its done well, you can actually follow what's happening and the there is invention and creativity in the fights. The special effects are of course top notch. Charlie Day's scientist character is a good laugh throughout the film. The 'drifting' concept (2 humans must share the 'neural load' of piloting a Jaegar and drifting is kind of like a mind meld where they share each other's minds and therefore memories) is used to good effect. All in all this is as fun and intelligent a film can be considering its plot :) So go see!",8,13,20,19 July 2013
Hugo," beautiful
","On the plus side this film's set design is quite stunning. The backdrops of Paris are also impressively beautiful and almost dream like. It would make you fall in love with Paris and want to visit purely from the visuals (really). The film starts off well enough and maintains some sort of magical allure for the first hour but then becomes decidedly convoluted and less magical. Adult and real-world problems intrude and the fantastical illusion is rather shattered. I was under the impression this was a borderline kid's film, perhaps I got that wrong. No kid would have the patience for this 2hr+ film that begins to drag around half way. The film becomes hijacked by a plot line based on the famous french film director Georges Méliès. I don't enjoy a huge slap of real life in my fantasy films! Kind of takes away from the point.",5,2,4,23 December 2012
Avengers: Endgame," Underwhelming
","Endgame consistently felt off from the start to the end. The tone is just strange, the pacing is messy and the plotholes are ridiculous and badly effect the enjoyment of the film. That said there are some fun scenes.This felt more like a tying up of loose ends rather than a real self-contained film. While I liked Infinity War they really backed themselves into a corner when they got time travel involved. So many plot holes and convoluted plot lines concerning time travel.... How is Captain America able to come back at the end if he has gone to a different time line? This is a direct contradiction of something they said previously in the film - that going back into time does not change the future. But, lo and behold, Captain America is suddenly in this very timeline, but somehow without affecting it? This makes no sense.How does Captain Marvel know where Tony Stark is??! In the vast endless expanse of space she somehow randomly comes across him!!? This is never explained.Stark figuring out time travel in about 2 minutes is just laughable.How can Thanos be so powerful without the infinity gauntlet so that he can easily defeat Thor, Iron man and Captain America all at once?!? This was the most fun fight scene by far but it is partly ruined by its illogical premises. Reminds me of Star Trek Discovery where we are supposed to be dazzled by the spectacle and not take plot continuity seriously anymore.As other people have pointed out they ruined the character development they had set up with Thanos' character. This wonderfully rich character is killed in the first 5 mins of the film. Only to be replaced by his more one dimensional past self later. It might as well have been any generic bad guy. There is no satisfying link to the Thanos of the first film.Fat comedy Thor really disrespects his character and just looks and feels so silly. They could have made him depressed and overweight sure, but why make it so pronounced that it becomes hard to take seriously. He has become a (bad) parody of himself. I like the comedy element of these films but please take it back a notch.The interactions between Stark and Rodgers seemed stale and repetitive. It was hard to care anymore. I actually liked the Hulk/Banner hybrid - this was one of the more inventive/original parts of the film. It would have been good to see him actually fight! I liked the interactions between Hawkeye and Black Widow. Their relationship has always been interesting/layered and well acted.The final battle scene felt like a rehash of the one in Wakanda. So, again, hard to get excited about something we have seen before. But of course, it has its fun moments. I loved seeing Scarlet Witch take on Thanos one on one and get the better of him until he calls on the big guns.It seems like the story line of IW bit off more than it could chew. It becomes so overblown and fantastical that it is hard to take seriously anymore. A bit of an anti-climax. But of course its still a must-see because its the culmination of a decade of Marvel films. I still enjoyed this film to an extent, its just a bit disappointing. I could have easily sat through another hour of this if it helped sort out the pacing problems and made more sense of things.",6,6,11,28 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," It's OK but lets hope the sequel is better
","It's not a bad film but its ultimately disappointing due to the sheer amount of plot holes and lack of believably I've not seen in a marvel film before. Also there isn't enough character development as the film is practically non-stop action.I think one of the main downfalls of this film is mixture of the earth bound MCU and the space bound MCU. The guardians of the galaxy shtick works for them in the bounds of space whereas the relative seriousness of the earth bound marvel characters works for them partly because of their limited and sober earthly setting. Mixing these two just doesn't work in my opinion. This film lent too much on the former to its detriment. For example, comedy is regularly overused and occasionally seems out of place given the relative gravity of the situation. Non-stop comedy works well for the guardians and it worked well in Thor Ragnorak but it really is overused here. Don't get me wrong, the jokes mostly hit their mark, I laughed a lot. But this just takes away from the supposed seriousness of the threat they face. One of the most irritating things in the film for me was Vision. He's one of my favourite characters but for some unexplained reason he seems extremely weak and powerless in this film. He's supposed to be one of the most powerful avengers but seems unable to put up much of a fight at any point. I don't recall him using his phasing or laser powers even once. Very disappointing. Thanos has the most character development in the film. He's an emotionally complex and extremely powerful villain. But this is an avengers film not a Thanos film so it would have been nice to have seen more of the avengers interacting with each other and having little characters arc moments. They mostly come across quite shallowly as a result. There are however problems with Thanos and the infinity stones in general. First, Thanos wants to kill half the universes population for quite a flimsy silly reason. Because there are too many people and he wants to balance this out? This doesn't seem like a very good justification. Why would the universe suddenly be better if there were less people? Why care about 'the universe' more than people? He feels justified because his own planet was overpopulated but how does he know that other planets have the same problem? And won't these planets just repopulate themselves in time? His plan doesn't seems like a very practical or permanent solution! Plus, if he has all the infinity stones which give him infinite power then why not think of a more compassionate or permanent solution!? Thanos becomes way too powerful and so there is no fun watching avengers struggle to contain him, you already know he can only win as this is the first half of Infinity war and can only end badly for the Avengers to set up the next one. Why does Thor waste so much time making a new hammer? It seems a bit pointless. Do the avengers on Wakanda really need to open the force-field thus letting in the alien army in order to stop them circling around? This seemed like a massive tactical mistake. The force-field was one of the few things keeping them safe. The ending of the film where so many heroes 'die' is cheap and empty. We all know that most of these characters will be coming back in the next film as so many of them already have their own sequels lined up. Some of the cool things in this film: Ebony Maw is genuinely creepy and his powers are really cool. The other children of Thanos weren't as fleshed out or their powers as interesting or effective but they were still malevolent antagonists. 
 
The red skull appearance was a nice surprise. Totally unexpected.As usual I love how Ironman fights and its always interesting to see how he has updated his latest suit. The interaction between Stark and Strange is fun as the two egos butt heads. It would have been nicer to have seen more of this. It's also fun to see Strange using his powers in inventive ways but again not enough of it. All in all, its fun but its pretty shallow, unless you're a big Thanos fan. Hopefully the real payoff will be in the sequel and there will be more space for the characters to breath. Well, since most of them are temporarily dead there surely will be!",6,1,5,15 May 2018
Room," The human spirit triumphing over adversity
","Room has a fairly simple premise. Most people if they've seen the trailer know how the story goes. Woman and her son are locked in a room for several years. Eventually they escape but now have to negotiate a different version of reality. But which is realer to Jack who has only known the inside of the same 4 walls for his entire life? Will either of them be able to cope?This is a surprisingly sweet film given the darkness of what happens in it. Perhaps this is because at times our point of view is that of the 5 year old boy. His mother has concocted a fantasy world in order to protect him from their harsh reality. And so we don't feel shocked when we hear her routine rape (albeit unresistant) because it is made to be part of the normal routine of 'room', for Jack's sake.The planning and implementation of Jack's escape is the most harrowing and tense part of the film. I was shouting at the TV for him to get the hell up and run.When they escape things don't get any easier. Real life is new and frightening and the readjustment a shock to the system for both. The film then shifts from the relative simplicity of room to the much more complicated real world. The acting in the film from the two leads is great but particularly from the youngster. I know Larson wins the Oscar (and she is good) but Tremblay's performance is more affecting. I really couldn't tell if he was acting or actually just being himself. I'd recommend this to anyone with an open mind who doesn't mind something a bit different. No explosions in this one, just family drama, human relationships and human nature, all told without pretence or sugar coating.",8,1,3,8 November 2016
Silence," Religion laid bare
","A pair of Portuguese Catholic priests go to Japan to determine the fate of their former mentor. Instead they mostly administer to a small villages of faithful Japanese Christians. This they must do in secret as the Japanese authorities have cracked down hard (torturing and killing) on those found to be practising in an effort to stamp out the 'foreign cancer'. Thus sets the scene for Andrew Garfield's Padre's faith to be severely tested. Does he apostatise (even just symbolically) in order to save the lives of others. For me as someone who has been an atheist since the age of 15 this film shows up the problems of most Religions: the false ideas of God as person and a perfect afterlife, thus making us believe that this worldly existence is just a test run, something to be tolerated. The Japanese thought this dangerous to society. Their ruthless crackdown on those caught practising was, in their minds, a way of protecting Japanese society.Others will see any refusal to step on the image of Christ as a sign of great faith. But what is great faith in this life when all it brings is misery. They are sold the lie of a great paradise in the next life, all you have to do is believe. This worldly reality becomes unimportant as a result. The Japanese have always been keenly aware of this worldly reality as being the ultimate reality and therefore could not tolerate an idea that would undermine it.The silence referred to in the title was the response given when the Padre needed guidance from his God. Is he just talking to himself? How does he know God is listening, how can be be real if he never talks back? He just needs to have faith that he is. He hopes and hopes and hopes. But always silence. Is it a good thing to cling so desperately to an idea, any idea? Especially one based solely on faith.The film is good at illustrating the problems with this position and what it can lead to - the peasants blindly accepting death and torture for a better life in paradise. It also shows the intolerance on the other side and what it can lead to - killing people for false beliefs. The silence is what we cant tolerate. We make up a sky god to fill the silence. We'll do anything to fill the silence. Because we cant stand to face the reality of our nothingness and meaninglessness.The film is good because it asks these questions but it doesn't go so far as to openly condemn these false beliefs. It lets them speak for themselves, which to me was their folly but it also has sympathy for those that cling to them.",7,6,14,16 January 2017
Midsommar," Convoluted
","I thought Hereditary was one of the best films of last year (if not the best). So I hoped that Midsommar would be approaching the same quality. Alas no. Midsommar is convoluted, messy and doesn't really follow any sort of satisfying arc. It meanders along without any of the ratcheting of tension that Hereditary did so well. There is little that is exciting or compelling. It just seemed quite shallow but pretty looking. Perhaps there is a very clever hidden message in the film that explains everything and makes it much more compelling, but it wasn't present on screen. And for me, that is a basic film-making failing. The film is also massively long - which contributes to its unnecessary and meandering feel.A real pity, I really wanted to like this. It seemed to follow hot on the heels of hereditary so perhaps Aster just wasn't allowed the same time to craft something as good. Hopefully he takes a longer time for his next film.Something else that pops up with his two films are the themes of cults and family. Perhaps he could try not repeating the same themes for the next film? He has said enough about family and cults in Hereditary so it was unnecessary to retread old ground in Midsommar. Perhaps that is why it went wrong. It felt tired and 2nd hand.",5,1,3,8 July 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Very entertaining sci-fi flick
","Very entertaining sci-fi flick. Starts on a slightly dodgy premise though. Basically, from out of nowhere Tom cruise's military Major is forced to fight in the front line of a major offensive against alien invaders. Even though he is a high ranking soldier who seems to have all but retired from duty in the field. He apparently has little to no active duty under his belt, at least not recently. And seems very very reticent about returning to combat. He even tries to blackmail the General to get out of it, who then attempts to arrest him but not before Cruise makes a run for it before being tazered and waking up handcuffed on an army base. All very implausible! But we can forgive and forget this as it sets us up for his recurring nightmare. As you can expect Cruise's foray into onto the battlefield is disastrous and grizzly and he and many others die. Cruise is very fortunate though. He manages to luck into a very unique event which allows him to relive the previous 24 hours every time he dies. And he dies a lot, but each recurring day he lives he manages to learn a bit more and become more adept at staying alive during the battle. Cruise joins forces with Emily Blunt's kick ass, sword wielding 'full metal bitch', a highly decorated war veteran. Blunts character had the same ability to relive her last 24 hours before death but has now lost it. Together they work together learning from Cruise's accumulated experiences to forge a plan to pinpoint the alien brain hiding somewhere in continental Europe! Cruise slowly begins to get to know Blunt over the many recurring days they spend together. From Blunts point of view however she has only just met Cruise. Cruise of course falls in love but its believable (who wouldn't fall in love with her) and poignant, as it seems hopeless and doomed, the odds of survival seem insurmountable. The journey of Cruise from inept coward to kick ass braveheart is believable and satisfying. The actions scenes are dirty and gritty and done in a realistic way, harrowing and tense. The aliens are sort of like the squiddies from the matrix only much faster and with more moving parts. Sort of like metallic shape shifting octopi. They do their menacing job well. Deadly and uncommunicative. Very unlike anything humans can understand or compare to. The ending is a little Hollywood i.e. inexplicably everything turns out rosy for everyone, but without much explanation as to how. More time travel twistyness is afoot but there is no logical explanation as to why cruise appears to wake up days before anyone dies and the enemy defeated. Ah well, I cant say that it really annoyed me that much. Just left me scratching my head slightly. All in all a lot of fun.",8,5,9,26 June 2014
Prometheus," Unsure....
","I really don't know what to think of this film. I'm not sure if i actually liked it or whether I'm just disappointed. As things stand, a few hours after viewing, i'm still not exactly sure if i fully understand the events in the film. And how they lead to, or their relevance to the first alien film (perhaps there will be a sequel to this film that will explain that). The main downfall of Prometheus is that it seems to require more analysis and further investigation to try to fully comprehend. Maybe its a film that requires repeated viewings and a lot of thought. We shall see, but this is my initial impression and i think that's worth basing a review on. I suspect that the film makers have intellectualised where they should have entertained or thrilled. There are a lot of questions left unanswered and i think that is the main problem. Are we supposed to just randomly guess for ourselves? The space jockeys themselves are impressive looking creatures. Well done to the make up dept for that one. Very realistically other-worldly looking but still obviously humanoid. They are the most interesting aspect of the film. What was their aim, their motivation, what happened to them on the planet, where are they now? Unfortunately we never fully find out. A lot of the film had 'why is this happening?' moments. Everything is left for the viewer to try and figure out. This can be a good thing but after a while you're just left confused and unsure to whether you're missing something. Sometimes you need a bit of direction....It's always interesting viewing human nature through the eyes of an android and David's character does that quite well. Fassbender plays him with subtle malevolence. Such intellect and knowledge and yet used in such a subservient way. The comparison of humans creating David and the engineers creating humans is interesting. It puts humans in such a deliciously bad light.Shaw's character is initially a little too naive and optimistic. She thankfully shows her resilience in the latter stages of the film but she seems a little under characterised leading up to this.Charlize Theron is fun to watch playing the bad girl but meets a somewhat pointless end and you wonder what really was the point of her in the first place other than to simply have a 'bad guy'. Peter Weyland seems even more pointless....Its worth seeing if you're a fan of the alien universe but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. You may be scratching your head for days.",6,0,7,1 June 2012
Black Panther," Average
",Overall its a bit disappointing and the story isn't very believable. The lead villlian is a bit of a caricature who lacks any real motivation other than being a resentful child with daddy issues. One of the most annoying aspects for me is that the fight choreography is generally quite poor. Unforigiveable for a film like this! Super quick editing and super close camera work make fight scenes impossible to follow. The final 'big fight scene' between the 2 panthers is just by the numbers genericness and quite possibly completely CGI. The actresses/characters who play the tough and loyal General and Black panthers technological genius sister are the most interesting and unique in the film. While the actor who plays the Black Panther just about carries it off. One of the most interesting aspect of the film is the idea of Wakanda. A futuristic city hidden in the middle of Africa. Its a nice idea and kind of joyous celebration of African culture and uniqueness. Though one might object to the fairly incongruent mash of traditional tribal stereotypes and futuristic technology. It's not overly believable. But it is a sci-fi fantasy after all. Overall I'd say it's one of the weaker Marvel superhero films but still entertaining enough if you can forgive some of the sillier African stereotypes.,6,1,2,11 March 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Fun and inventive.
",Just back from the cinema. I quite enjoyed this. I am a Joss Whedon fan and knew that this would probably be worth seeing and wasn't going to be your generic teen slasher. What struck me was just how out-there the actual story line is! There are many different film references and this film is hard to pigeonhole in any recognisable genre. The obvious main reference being the evil dead films. Then the Truman show. There are even shades of his old TV show Angel. This film is very knowing. It is smart and aware but doesn't try and bore you with it. It's also quite funny in a lot of places. Most of the laughs coming from the stoner character. Played very very well by Franz Kranz. The special effects and inventiveness with the monster characters are particularly brilliant. Go see!,9,12,27,13 April 2012
