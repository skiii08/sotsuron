Skyfall," The name is Bond, James Bond
","Daniel Craig is back as James Bond in this movie. In the third time he played James bond, he proved himself as a worthy James Bond actor. About to the plot. The loyalty of Bond to M (played by Judi Dench) is really tested in this movie. This is definitely one of the better Bond stories. There are several tributes to previous Bond movies. Although there is really no surprise in the plot. It's expected towards a Bond movie. Every Bond movie is so in some degree predictable. The scenery in this movie is definitely up to power points the best scenery in a Bond movie. Conclusion. Bond fans will really enjoy this movie. In my opinion this movie Is as good as Goldfinger or Dr. no. Daniel Craig is marvelous James Bond. Also there are some the characters (re)introduced.",9,5,22,28 October 2012
Salt," Jolie + top action + twists = Salt
","The only reason why I went to see 'Salt' is for the fact that Jolie the main character played. Wen I was watching I was thinking 'Hey, this could be not that bad'. Wen I left the theater I was thinking 'Jolie you did it again.' Yes I admit I enjoyed this movie quiet well. At the time of this review I already own the movie on Blu ray. Why, well because it was a good action movie with twists that were very well puled off, but nothing from what i said 'What a hell.' O Yeah only at one point, near the end. But I won't say what because I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't seen 'Salt'. I Only can say 'Where the hell are you waiting for, go rent it or if your a Jolie fan, like I am buy it on Blu ray'. Oke that was the positive. Now the negative. Because I never saw a perfect movie. Well... 'Inception' got near but thats another story. OK contra: Its a Hollywood film, with that I mean is that not everything is very realistic and quiet stereotype. But I didn't expect it to be, so should you if you'll see it, what you should. Last thing: go go go, go watch Salt...",7,1,3,1 January 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Beautiful, exciting, and an adrenaline rush
","I heard great things of this film, but I went in with little expectations. But I was very happily surprised with the film. Let me start of with saying this is visually a gorgeous piece of film. Every frame is so original and beautiful you would only watch it again so you could admire the background. I can also confirm that this film contains loads of talented (young) actors. I loved the performance of Bruce Willis as Captain Sharp, Jarid Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy. The story itself is very basic and may appear nothing special. But in combination with the cinematography, acting, passing and music this is just a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. At this point in time I've watched the film like 3 or 4 times (what's a lot for me). The more I watch it, the more excited I am about it. This is a film you will like if you like the previous or later work of Wes Anderson.",10,0,0,9 January 2015
