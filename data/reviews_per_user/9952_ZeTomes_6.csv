Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Ewok Adventure: The Beginning
","Hello, I am an original spectator of Star Wars theatrical début in Portugal, having 4 years old, raining heavily in December it was close to my birthday, it was Christmas. Neither I have seen anything that spectacular nor the world, or my father the one that lead me to this memorial day... In terms of space fantasy of course. I saw it at least 20 times at cinemas. I'm mentioning it because I had severe asthma attacks and had to leave the theatre at some point, by the excitement and emotional attachment. Well, ultimately my parents pushed me into it. They were feeling also as kids and they were establishing a bridge of communication with their son compensating the gap between us, perhaps the world was finally taking a break, a deep breath from previous political disasters which like a wave reached all corners of the world. I deeply felt the 70s and the beginning of 80s were the best times of my life. There was hope, I felt it. No. This is not a parents guide, neither vanity, neither morality, it's just to simply state that I never got tired of seeing Star Wars despite all, not even by now, all the genuine three. And I have an eye for films, don't ask me specifically why or in what, but boy I can tell if a film is a hoax or not.By now I don't have any problems confessing my fan crimes, transformed myself as a Star Wars atheist. They begun with 'Empire Strikes Back', somehow with its special effects. Neither the tauntauns or the AT-AT walkers frame to frame animation caught my interest... something was changing, perhaps an excessive preoccupation to exceed everything, a megalomania quest... but Master Yoda did it, the psychological cave did and Freudian Vader did also. I forget my inner thoughts, the hope persisted and I sincerely cried when the Jedi returned, sacrificing himself for his son. I still do considering the ascension to Vader's redemption one of the best scenes in Star Wars universe. I was being taught to never lost hope for Darth Vader, my anti-hero, the revolted anger the one that suffered in silence, myself as a child. Somehow I always knew Vader wasn't bad but a victim and a pawn of circumstances, I was being Luke Skywalker in heart, excusing my family scars giving pause to guilt. Perhaps Star Wars compensated my lacking of a familiar functional structure. I saw 'THX 1138' definitely acknowledging that Star Wars saga was encrypted with philosophy, mythology and psychology, it was juicy and complex, my inner attachment wasn't in vain. I was delirious. Lucas was indeed my mentor. When I was lost, Star Wars was my anchor, I think it was also Luca's.The 'Ewok Adventure' was released after 'Return of the Jedi', making me suspecting at that time that something wasn't going right, something disturbing the force, something paradoxical. The same director created both the trilogy and this... nonsense. How could it be? I understood by then that a film was composed by many pieces, Lucas only directed Star Wars IV in Star Wars first trilogy. If there weren't many key factors as its perfect edition (Lucas's wife included) Star Wars would be a flop. Lucas didn't compose the music, neither illustrated his imagination, nor put to effort the realistic special effects, or voiced Darth Vader, created the laser sound effects, C3-P0's soul, R2D2's bips and independent personality, Chewbaka's corporal expression, Yoda's puppeteering, Vader's breeding, Han Solo's acting, Luke's commitment, Ben Kenobi's humongous acting posture... and so forth. After that 'Return of the Jedi' was re-released in theatres. I thought good, perhaps Lucas is creating the first 3. I noticed the credits were slightly modified, I didn't understand why.When I picked a look at some samples of the new remastered trilogy in 1997, I felt the same strange feeling when facing 'The Ewok Adventure', something wasn't right again. Something wasn't definitely right when the originals were shadowed from the market. My stomach got funny just by thinking Lucas was erasing and changing history, just by wondering Lucas was acting as the emperor of his appropriated empire. I couldn't believe Lucas was spoiling his own work... or indeed it was exclusively the fruits of his only own work? There was a disturbance in my force when I started to understand there were many many people involved allowing Star Wars to be a success as I discovered the beautiful art of Ralph McQuarrie. I started my own quest in search of the hidden crucial elements. But I couldn't betray my master, not in a Sith way. I kept the hope... until I sceptically saw 'The Phantom's Menace'. Coincidentally cutting relations with my father at a contemporary time. Wished he was at this début as he was in the first time.For 30 years I expected to see a complex intricate dark transformation of Darth Vader, to understand why there were so many parallels in this Father and Son Freudian story, reflected on my own family relation. Why one should follow the Jedi way expressed on the artist's work, the sequel of his philosophical pursuit of a better world, a better democracy, a recycled expression of Luca's principles? All of it has been betrayed for economical interests, antagonizing the code of the good ones, effectively extinguishing the Jedi order, showing that indeed Society has a Sith partnership and the empire hides in pseudo principles absorbing everything to itself. Perhaps he'll return as a Jedi, but I already lost my hope. Jedi fans as myself became orphans of a pseudo world antagonistic to a raw cruel reality. The Jedi order was betrayed and slaughtered by its innocence and naivety, Lucas abandoned his own therapy, his own parallels to the world he'd created, his idealism now transformed into cynicism, the tool of the survivors, the preachers.",5,1,5,10 July 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Chimeras - a new genre of Hollywood movies
","Cloverfield presents itself as a chimera of distinct genres and as we all know, crossing different species does not work in the real world. Well, in the fictionalized world of Cinema theoretically it may be done but only if masterfully orchestrated by a talented director, not a pretentious one.Dan Trachtenberg just cut and pasted 'helped and imprisoned by a psychopath' (Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Bad Boy Bubby, Misery, etc.) with 'sheltering from an unknown menace and stick together' (The Divide, Evil Dead, etc.) and 'aliens invading with a weak spot' (H.G. Well's War of the Worlds paraphernalia derivatives) without even bothering to stitch the different themes nor properly nor in whatever form.As far as my experience goes and apart from movie genre analogies, when a script wants to grab everything for the sake of 'surprising', just because 'To surprise' is to be a 'fantastic' director or writer, everything becomes predictable, boring, vain and volatile. Nothing seems to have mass or a tangible form. It becomes ridiculous unless it has stupendous performances, also not the case.Some combinations are simply not congruent: Hypothesis A) The Guy is a psychopath and the menace only exists in his mind - generally works;Hypothesis B) The Guy is right but severely stressed and indeed there is a menace outside - generally works;Hypothesis C) The Guy is a lunatic and there is indeed a menace outside and we've been 'fooled' all the time (wasn't this movie supposed to be connected with 'Cloverfield' at the first time?) by an elusive script which jumps from the 1st to the 2nd hypothesis to culminate on the fusion of both (wow) - it becomes rubbish if a movie pretends to be realistic or the director is a glutton of genres.This piece of crap (pity for John Goodman because he has done a satisfactory work and he is a very talented actor) represents a Hollywood stereotype of movies made by directors 'full of original ideas' who generate cheap 'bombastic' dry firepower movies wrapped by a sparkling marketing and destined for ignorant audiences who will justify the profit of the movie by ephemerally paying its tickets on a one night debut.",4,3,8,14 June 2016
American Sniper," America is not a shining paladin
","Someone compared Chris Kyle with Tarantino's German sniper, one of the important characters of Inglorious Basterds who symbolized the nazi propaganda glorifying its Third Reich.I couldn't agree more with this association about both soldiers.Although Fredrick Zoller, the Tarantino's sniper, is a fictionalized character apparently inspired by another fictionalized character (an American hillbilly sharpshooter from Howard Hawks' Sergeant York, or/and by a real Austrian sniper, Matthäus Hetzenauer), as much as Chris Kyle was indeed a real person (and American Sniper is a tribute to Chris Kyle's autobiography), both snipers had served propaganda regime agendas, and their respective integrities were inflated on their testimonies as in every war heroes, to promote war for political purposes... since Proto-History, at least. The difference is one movie uses the soldier as a satire and the other as a glorification but both focus on justifying the stage of war with patriotism, heroism and comradeship diluting the rational interpretation of war itself. Simplifying, at the end of this intellectual roller coaster journey about pro or contra arguments which this movie pretends to state about war, one is certain: war is justifiable if not to backup and respect the bond between your 'brothers in arms'. Well... nope. The valorous feelings a soldier might have with his comrades don't necessarily correspond to the political agenda of War itself. His valour does not equal to 'the' valour of War.Because I don't buy simplistic arguments, I give one awful star against the gratuitous promotion of violence, stupidity, absurd blinded patriotism, ignorance, lack of questioning, arrogance and imperialism. Specially because I like Clint Eastwood and because he's supposed to be an example of wisdom, a cultural symbol, a... well, a sort of utopian faded memory of what half America was before it became a corporatist separated continent chronically corrupted:Everything which stands against America's Declaration of Independence, Justice and Liberty for All, sadly transforming ideals into crap and propaganda those which we've learnt and assimilated as ideological true, not political agendas or corporatist interests! For the ones that simply didn't follow Iraq War, or simply had a restrict perspective about it and were 'pushed' by their apathy to consent it, 'Colateral Murder' exposed the banality of massacring Iraqi lives (out of a danger zone); the outcasting 'execution' of Bradley Manning showed what happens to someone who's ideologically truthful and stands against what is wrong and therefore against the instituted powers; the war itself against the non existent evidence about nuclear warfare, against the demonstration of a progressive willingness of Saddam Hussein with UN inspectors showed the imposing standing of USA against everyone. The lunatic association about 9/11 and Iraq put a cherry on top.Shame on hypocrisy and inconsistency and please, instruct yourselves before having a mass opinion about things. Be critical, skeptical, and above all rational.Don't make mistakes, I sincerely love The critical America I just can't stand bull-evacuation.",1,5,25,26 May 2015
2012," Economics, religion, enterprise
","Well, people justify a positive review of this piece of... by comparing it with common movies being made in Hollywood, also the recently baked ones. Exactly, presently made in Hollywood. Except the universe is not Hollywood neither cinema was born today.If you still believe cinema was created a few years ago and you think the film industry gravitates Hollywood, well, you're wrong and probably you're having issues about transforming yourself into a gasified brainless popcorn. You'll love this one if that's the case, I mean, if you already are indeed a newborn popcorn. Not the case, you'll only taste a synthetic audience statistical bombastic and orgasmic glutton load of b.... of a movie fully packed with good actors.That's all, you'll be hungry a few minutes after, after you've seen this rubbish as if you ate a junky non deteriorating cheeseburger, and in the comfort of your home without noises to interfere your thoughts you'll be quite upset for wasting your money understanding you've made a major mistake: believing in money gluttons disguised in fairy promotional cultural religious tales. But as people say... it's Hollywood!",2,1,3,10 July 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Ultron Rubbish Money Making Machinery
","The real vote would be 4, but because there are so many hysterical votes attributing this crap as a masterpiece, I had to give it the worst possible evaluation.Extraordinary bad Special effects. Copy and paste, sloppy and poorly done. Not congruent with contemporary technology specially having such an immense budget and such history background (also mediocre with some exceptions).It's irritating the omnipresent allusions to sex indirectly pointing to a teenager's world of erotic fantasies: Thor's deified masculinity attracting every women, the focused mums in desperation jumping with big breasts (perhaps both Freudian allusions), and so forth.It's annoying to note the paradox between the surreptitious sexual allusion in contrast to the puritanism against using slang. Reminds the 'good old days' where everything was censored (I'm being satirical) although very bad things were happening behind the stage. If you know what I mean.It's fastidious and ridiculous to hear the same cheesy jokes over and over, like hysterical paranoiac people, desperate to make a stand or to supplant the others.The costumes wouldn't be immensely corny if at least they weren't pretentious or didn't pretended to be modern. Captain America's is the only good costume.The present effect sounds were used already at least a thousand times on other movies.The only glimpse of good representation is the shower act between Bruce and Natasha. The rest of the it is mediocre, specially Chris Hemsworth's who looks exactly like someone who has painted his hair in yellow and is wearing a Carnival Comic costume; adding the fact he sits upon his masculine appeal and forgets how to act or incarnate his character.Ultra-rubbish! The mega Hollywood making money machinery who brainwashed and conquered the World!",1,1,34,17 September 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," People want to believe
","Wannabe, wanna be, therefore it is. Let's face it: Dark Knight was good, a very good film, but frankly it was almost exclusively that good, because it was a sort of adaptation of Alan Moore's 'Killing Joke' and because, despite the hysteria of Heath Ledger's dramatic and unfortunate death, The Joker was a great one, a master villain. I will not compare it with Jack Nicholson's because that one was exceptional. Ledger's was very good, almost excellent. The residual memory emerges from this point; people want 'The Dark Knight Rises' to be a sequel of that excellency, as I did, as Nolan forced us to believe so... as some kind of religious belief keeping us blindly seeing the way it was supposed to be, but it wasn't. It wasn't indeed, as the first of Nolan's trilogy it was a disbelief and a mime of the second. Without a matured anti-hero, this Batman collapses.Somewhere somehow if not already at the plane, I started to feel I was being fooled by the Hollywood machine, again and again; my 'want it to be as so' was there no more, vanishing, while I gradually started to notice the annoying, repeating and exaggerated soundtrack pushing me for a critical pause. Hans Zimmer made me seriously question about everything in this movie, existentially, if indeed I was facing the terrifying possibility of seeing another 2 hours of hollowed clichés noised by a syrupy music... another disappointment to add. You name it, Star Wars, Prometheus, Conan... I tried, I really did, I even said to myself to take it easy at my criticism and expectation, but there was no emotion to attach with, instead the music was continuously persisting in forcing the spectator to delude himself that indeed there was, like a crazy frantic miraged dance going to nowhere subliming the emptiness. Simply put, the narrative didn't allow me to empathize with the characters, all of it was forced like an hyperactive quest to push the audience for an illusion of a final master piece, an idea that would be preferable not to be discarded, like a comfortable thought as nice as a wall separating the movie from the spectator. We were comfortably eating popcorns nicely throwing the bags to the floor. I didn't like Bate's Bat forced voice, I don't like his costume, I haven't felt jubilated when he arose from the ashes, I kept wondering about Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns': what a pale reflex this film was revealing itself, bad omen I was getting bored, I wondered about the time of the intermezzo that would never come. I felt myself observing a hysterical sequence of forced dramatic situations, not realism, not Bat's Gothic existentialism. There was no voyeurism, there was no personal attachment, there was no time to feel emotionally connected... there was right in front of your nose... another banal Hollywood film using a Batman's stamp, a 'Bruce Wayne's' costume fairy tail.You have to be given compassed storyline hidden behind a door's hole, like preparing for the battle tasting a good cup of old wine expecting the confronting dilemma of mirroring yourself, like Alan Moore's and Frank Miller's Batman art of questioning... not this artificial and plastic speaking dolls acting for a spoiled audience, for statistics and budget and major gross openings! Michael Caine, I would punch your nose, how could you let this happen?.Everyone speaks about Bale's voice... heck with it! But of course it's strange, but of course, you just have to wonder you are a human being deprived from your childhood, although a noble guardian of a child's innocence... his own lost one... no? Great potential, great inner thought, great professional and passionate commitment and study, Tom Hardy's personification... but not properly explored by his director. You weren't given time or you weren't properly presented to his drama simply put. It was illustrated as just another sketched brute villain, with an Ah...! here he is, surpassed by the next one, Ah... he is no more... and after a Oh...! a magical ethereal Batman is again, with his darn forced bad ass voice, right from the canonic pit of the survivors to smack the forces of evil... (Joel Schumacker... no?)I won't spoil the storytelling although I was spoiled by this film's lack of depth rich of busted expectations. Like every popcorn movie, this one innovates itself... it's Gothic an it has wings; obviously satisfies one's expectation behaving as just as commonly as a epidermic chain of pretentious tragic sensations, clichés, totally predicted and totally comfortable. And don't tell me this is just a comic movie, don't be so intellectual you say... Oh yes? Don't throw me that load of crap, because Nolan wanted this trilogy to surpass the previous ones using as trump two of the most darker comic book authors: Alan Moore and Frank Miller. If anything was to be expected, it was fulfilling expectations!At the end, nothing new is added only sustained by its historicity and by the programmed acting of it as a frantic piece of firework conquering claps and tears from the crowd. This is not for a Batman apologist. This is equal to what was pretentiously challenged except for now the difference is merely dressed in kinky black and pompous tricks of magic.",5,3,10,9 August 2012
