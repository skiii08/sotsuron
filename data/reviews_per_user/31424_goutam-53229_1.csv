Airlift," A Movie that Shows What India can do for Indians
","Awesome will be an understatement for this movie. It might look bit tiring, lengthy and boring at patches but its only because of the story shown in a real way and without much commercial flavor or manipulation done to the real event.Akshay shines out without a trace of his super-stardom, Purab Kohli and Kumud Mishra just hit the chords right and makes it believable in whatever they do! Nimrata too plays a wonderful role.But the star of the movie is the story.This story will show NRI's about what their forgotten motherland 'INDIA' can do for them even if they themselves hate to be called as Indians! And the best part is its true story and non manipulated one! Goosebumps guaranteed.. The last monologue by Akshay is something that should not be missed.. GO ahead guys watch this classic movie with some stellar performance! their is no excuse for missing this movie. it deserves its due credit!",10,4,7,24 January 2016
