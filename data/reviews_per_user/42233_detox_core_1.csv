Requiem for a Dream," what an impact!
","Hello, a couple of months ago i have seen the movie 4 the 1st time, everybody told me about it, but i never had heard about it, or seen it.until it was on the TV i decided to watch it. The 1st 20 minutes reminded me a little at the movie GO. After the 1st 30 minutes i felt a sleep and missed the whole turn over and downfall.The reason i woke up was the music at the end and sleepy as i was i watched the last 20 minutes. I started to feel pretty sick and my stomach almost turn over. I never felt so depressed and confused after seeing a movie. Maybee its because i missed the half of the movie.The most bizarre thing was that after a couple of weeks i sorta forgot the movie, until i seen a commercial on the TV which used the same music as in the end of Requiem for a dream, i started to feel sick again and had to throw up.From now on i'm looking for the movie to buy it because i really want to see the rest of it, but i cant find it anywhere!!!!!!!! I tried so many shops but they just don't sell or rent it anymore.For what i've seen it is the first movie i have ever seen which had such an impact on me, and hopefully i can see the missing parts of the movie soon.Sorry if my post is a little weird but my English is not so good and i did not see the whole movie, I just wanted to give my thoughts and opinion about it! Thank you :) Dennis",10,1,2,1 July 2006
