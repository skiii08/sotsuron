Antz," I just got back from seeing this movie and...
","It ROCKED!  My friend and I had a constant smile all throughout the movie, and all the ride home.  The story was great, the casting was great, the computer work was excellent.  Definitely a movie for all ages.  And unlike other movies with that same phrase attatched, Antz is a movie that all ages will actually like.  Congrats to Dreamworks.",10,0,0,12 October 1998
The Evil Dead," Let me be the first to comment....DOH!
","Well, even though I'm the 5 billionth person to comment, I couldn't resist saying SOMETHING about one of the best horror films ever.  If it spawned such classic sequels, something must have worked.  And it did.  The movie was crude, yes, due mostly to budget restraints and studio hounding.  But Sam still carried out most of his vision, and the movie was great.  Yes, the sequels are better, in my opinion, but I still love the first, it's always great to watch to see how great things are born.",10,0,1,6 January 1999
Army of Darkness," I'm sure maybe two people might read this...
","But WHO CARES.  I just felt compelled to comment on the Evil Dead trilogy, and of course that includes Army of Darkness.  This movie is incredible. Bruce Campbell is just great, he does a great job, and of course my respect for Sam Raimi doubled after I saw this movie.  I love this stuff.  Watch it.",10,1,1,6 January 1999
Evil Dead II," Please see this movie
","Or even go out and buy it, it's cheap! This movie is supremely awesome.  GO SEE IT.  Don't be one of those 'I don't like any horror movie except for Scream of course' people! See this movie, you will laugh yourself sick. Trust me.  Get off your butt.  Now.  I'm waiting.  Hurry up.",10,0,0,6 January 1999
