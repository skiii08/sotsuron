The Expendables 2," Old school fun
","Let's not take this for more than what it is. It's a fun movie of the classic action heroes getting together to blow stuff up, shoot some bad guys (excessively), adventure in foreign places, riding Harley and old planes. I enjoyed the movie and the biggest action stars of previous decades making fun of each other (Willis: 'You've been back enough time, I'll be back'. Schwarzenegger: 'Yippe-ki-yay'). And Chuck Norris going through Chuck Norris jokes was priceless. It's not some deep movie about war, it's not a special effects movie, it's not a science fiction action movie, it's just a fun movie. If I can change one thing, I would pick a different lady to play Maggie Chang, needs to pick someone with better chemistry with Stallone.",7,3,4,16 May 2013
Cloverfield," Great balance between a monster movie and a love story - IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT
","Or maybe this is what the perfect love story look like ? The story is told from a very interesting, unique, point of view. Instead of the usual, chase the monster, find its nest and weakness, and kill it with a gazillion bombs, this movie finds a new way to explore a horrible (yet familiar through all previous movies) event. The film itself focus more on how ordinary lives are affected by an attack on Manhattan, instead of filming a bunch of superhumans who can always find a way out of a tight spot and escape unharmed. It makes everything seem so real. Matt Reeves & JJ Abrams did everything absolutely right. I love the subplot of what happened between Beth and Robby. Flashbacks in the movie made everything seem so human and reminds the audience of more normal times,when the only thing that matter was love, and each other. In the end, in the midst of all the destruction, that's all there is left.",10,3,7,20 January 2008
Mission: Impossible II," A disappointment.
","This movie is a disappointment for fans who like the TV series or the 1st movie. Instead of building the movie around things that make the TV series so popular, such as careful mission planning, inventive gadgets, teamwork, and having a mission that is actually impossible, MI-2 relies heavily on slow-motion action, good looking sporty cars and motorcycles, exotic locations, which makes the movie look cheap artistically.Tom Cruise kept diving left and right in slow motion while shooting a few bullets at the villains the whole time. And that is about all there is to the movie. MI-1 is so much better because the mission itself is impossible, but MI-2 looks like Rambo taking on a whole army by himself without being shot or even scratched. It is just so shallow.",1,0,1,30 May 2000
