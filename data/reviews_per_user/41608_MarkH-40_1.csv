United 93," One of the most moving films of my life
","This was the only time I can remember leaving a movie being sick at my stomach. I am truly impressed by this film, by the selflessness of the passengers and by the completeness of the story. This is a must see for every free person on the planet. It speaks of taking charge and doing all that can be done. I was most impressed by the simplicity of the scenes. I was shocked that I was still so sensitive. I guess that we should never become calloused to that tragedy. When the movie was over, the theater was silent. We filed out slowly and the only conversation was in whispers. Thank you for making a film that will be a part of my collection.",10,0,2,7 May 2006
