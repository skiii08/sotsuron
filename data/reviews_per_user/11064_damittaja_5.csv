Skyfall," An entertaining movie
","The movie was enjoyable. The music was good and suited the scenes. Action was smooth and didn't hog too much screen time. Visually the locations in the movie were interesting, varying and beautiful. Craig continues to perform well and fits the character perfectly. Same goes for the other characters. The villain stayed within logic and wasn't evil just for the sake of being evil. The plot is OK even though you can pretty much guess how it'll play out right from the start. The makers of this movie knew what the audience expects from a Bond movie and deliberately made jokes of those things, which for me was very refreshing. As with movies involving high-tech in the plot, there was hacking and such computer stuff in it which was a 'bit' overplayed and animated compared to how it is in real life, but I accept this for the sake of making it visual for the movie viewer.",9,2,9,26 November 2012
Billy Elliot," A sweet sweet story not set in the colonies
","One tends to heard about this movie now and then combined with praises but I watched it for the first time in 2013. I expected it to be good, but on the other hand the poster on its IMDb page is a bit turn off for me. When I saw in the intro credits that the movie is produced partly by BBC I got into a mixed state of feelings. My association with BBC is mainly to documents and news.Once the movie progressed I soon got to a sweet state of mind. The protagonist is so sympathetic with his big ears and bright nature. A perfect actor choice. The locale where the events unfold are also very serving. They convey at the same time a feeling of poorness mixed with hope and plain old good will to live.The characters react to Billy and his dancing hobby as one would expect them to react and a lot of funny moments play out due to this. I liked the music also - rock, punk and classical pieces mixed together.All in all, the movie is great. I was unconsciously trembling as I followed Billy's story unfolding. I would recommend this for anyone who asks. Also, the strong English accent and vocabulary rocks totally.",9,0,2,14 April 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," An excellent movie for kids and adults alike
","I didn't read any reviews or watch trailers before I went to see this movie in the theater so I expected it to be a regular kids film with a silly story, action and fart humor. My expectations were utterly smashed right from the beginning as the movie revealed itself to be a bow to both the good old and modern times at the same time. I've grown around video games and arcades and this movie is full of those and characters from popular titles. It's part of the pull - you try and see how many you can spot and recognize. I laughed out loud how humor was made out of these characters that would never get a chance to meet otherwise. The jokes very pretty brilliant and yes, there was a few that I just didn't find funny, but that is humor often is - you bundle up a lot of ideas that you think will make people laugh and some of them will hit while others miss.The story in the movie was interesting and full of twists. You can call it a bit predictable, but hey, kids are supposed to be able to follow it too. The animation was smooth and pretty. Effects and styles were used appropriately in my opinion. Sound effects were fitting also. Because I went to see this film with a few kids, we had to go see the version that was dubbed in Finnish. The voice acting was fitting in that version, but I always prefer the original one and sadly I can't comment on that here.All in all, if you or your kids like video games this movie will rock for you. That is not to say that you must be a gaming addict to enjoy this one - it's just a nice bonus.",9,0,0,7 April 2013
Cloud Atlas," An engaging movie that requires that the viewer wants to think about concepts
","I went to see the movie with mixed expectations. I had read reviews beforehand that warned of a messy plot line with multiple stories. I was positively surprised on how untrue that was. The stories play well out in terms of pacing and characters. There are a lot of them in total, but each part (or you could say 'act') has only a couple central characters, like you would expect from any typical story. The different stories are very easy to follow because they are so different, yet they are the same on many levels. I specially like how the film expects you to think. You can watch this movie just for the visuals, but to really appreciate it, you need to think what happened and because of what. Some reviews I've read say that the stories are not connected. I would say that if that is how you feel, you did not pay attention at all and were expecting the movie to give everything pre-chewed to you. Instead the movie expects to you to fill the missing bits, notice references between the stories and to imagine what has happened between the transitions from one story to another. There is even an exchange of lines in the movie which can pretty much be summed up as the characters saying to the audience that we won't tell you everything, you can imagine and fill the blanks yourselves. The movie has a message and after you've processed the stories, it should be quite obvious. It might not be exactly the same message as I got, but still. Music and sound effects were good, not exceptional or bad, but satisfying and did their part well. The locations and visual effects were really nice and at times stunning, fitting for the events that transpired and interesting. Acting was good, the characters were played well and the actors fit their roles neatly. My only criticism is about the masking - same actors played different roles and genders, and the masking department had not been up to the task at all times. Or maybe it is that I perceive female actors playing male characters and vice versa a bit hard to digest due to the different body/facial structures of genders. I would recommend the movie if you want to see something that requires paying attention and ability to concentrate for nearly three hours, but in exchange gives food for your thought and imagination. Don't watch this if you just want to hang out with friends and chat at the same time.",9,12,17,11 February 2013
Easy A," Wonderful entertainment
","I really loved the movie. Usually the comedy/romance movies my wife picks are boring so I didn't really have high expectations for this one either. Was I surprised.The plot - while it stretches plausibility a bit (but don't nearly all great stories do that?) - is wonderful. It takes the topic of fast paced rumor mongering and twists it into an entertaining story. The movie is clearly quite cheerful so naturally from that follows that the plot is quite predictable. However, even if you can guess what probably will happen next, the events are portrayed with such skill in acting and tempo of witty speech that they are still wonderful to witness.Comedies are often bad because good comedy is hard to pull off. Fart jokes are for children etc. etc. The comedy in this movie is golden and pulled off with style. It's based on the question: what kind of situations might happen when you don't want to act like your peers expect or pressure you to? Technical details. The music score was good. Not epic like in some massive artistic films, but light, playful and rock-ish. Perfect match for this kind of movie with a rocking female heroine. Filming locations generic enough so that you can imagine them in your own hometown. Camera work was solid too.All-in-all, I can very warmly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a modern comedy with a not-so-subtle romantic component. Also, it probably helps if you are under 35 of age (as the events transpire in high-school and I feel it would be a bit silly to watch a movie about school life when you can't really remember what your own school life was like). The movie left me with a very happy and silly feeling inside.",9,1,1,26 October 2013
