The King's Speech," True to life depiction of a man imprisoned by his voice.
","I stutter. I've forgotten when it started but I must've been around 5 or so. I've never known life without this impediment. And the obvious irony is that I am a lawyer because everyone else in the family was so.. . Life has been a series of recurring nightmares accentuated by sympathetic glances and long pauses because my heart sinks whenever someone asks my name knowing I won't be able to pronounce even that and often tell them I'm my brother whose name's a bit easier on my tongue. As you may have guessed by now,I'm not of much use to the prestigious family law firm. Imagine being lost and not be able to ask for directions, to stand in front of the Court with the Judge staring down at you, thinking of some vowel you won't jam on to add to 'My Lord'.I don't cry when I watch movies but I cried silently while I watched Mr Firth in The King's Speech. It was like looking at a rather well made home movie. One of the most painful experiences of my life. Well, Mr Firth played the King and me flawlessly.A very well deserved Oscar win for Mr Firth.",10,0,0,28 March 2011
