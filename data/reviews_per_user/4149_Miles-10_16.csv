Moneyball," Moneyball review
","This is a story about pioneers changing old patterns of business-as-usual, but Brad Pitt's affecting portrayal of Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane gives this movie its heart. It opens in 2002 as the team is losing a championship game to a team with three times more money. The New York team has simply hired more of the best players, which Oakland can't afford to do. Billy sees that unless the team tries something different, they are going to lose again next year; yet his scout/advisers almost absent-mindedly to go back to the same failed practice of hiring the second-rate players that the team can afford, while expecting there to be a different outcome. Their 'intuition' amounts to arguing over whether a player has any confidence based on whether or not he has an attractive girlfriend.Billy's innovative solution turns out to be common sense, but he doesn't know what it is to begin with; rather he feels his way toward it gradually. The first step is to see the problem, but the next step is to see if anyone else sees it, too. How can they jointly solve a problem if only he can see it? Billy asks his scouts to articulate the team's problem and is frustrated when none of them can put it into words; but the problem is simple: the team doesn't have the money to hire the superstar players who invariably beat the Athletics. Billy sees this, but he does not know how to fix it until he goes to Cleveland to trade players; there he notices that their manager is listening to the whispers of a little nebbish named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), who turns out to be a brilliant player analyst. Peter's insight is that there are many players in baseball who are under-valued for what are often silly reasons. For example, one pitcher has a peculiar way of throwing the ball, and all of the scouts tell Billy he should be rejected because he looks ridiculous, but Peter points out that this pitcher nevertheless has a decent record. Because prejudice against such odd players is widespread, they can be picked up for a song, and a team made up of similarly under-rated players, Peter thinks, could be a winning team.After banking on Peter's approach, Billy faces another problem. Coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) doesn't understand what Billy and Peter are trying to do, so he keeps playing the players he thinks are best. The team loses game after game. Ironically, the soundtrack presents excerpts from a sports radio call-in show where host and fans agree that the team's poor showing is the fault of Billy and that Art Howe is doing the best he can. Finally, Billy figures out a clever if risky way to outfox Art so that he has no choice but to send in the lineup that Billy and Peter have chosen. After that, the team's fortunes improve dramatically, but when they lose another season-ending championship game, no one remembers how much they have improved over the previous year. Billy is denounced by the experts: 'You can't reinvent baseball', one of them intones authoritatively.The final development in the story proves that the 'money' in 'Moneyball' has nothing to do with greed. Billy seems almost to surprise himself when he turns down a multi-million-dollar contract with an East Coast team owner who recognizes what Billy is trying to do. The owner wants him to do the same for the Boston Red Sox, but Billy knows that what he really cares about are his daughter and his work with the As, and both are in California.Pitt makes us care about Billy's quest not just to win but to achieve personal fulfillment. His performance communicates the depth of his character's passion for his job and his family. Billy not only has a work ethic but a genius for recognizing a problem and its solution. He also has the humility to realize that he needs someone with the technical expertise to help him, and the friendship that develops between Billy's former jock and Peter's Ivy League nerd is tender and genuine. Through most of the film, these two are the only ones who believe in themselves and each other, and they back each other when no one else stands with them.As I watched, I kept having the impression that Pitt is channeling Robert Redford, but I am not convinced that this is intentional. Perhaps it is just something that is happening to him as he enters middle age. (One could hardly age more gracefully than that.)",8,0,1,7 November 2011
Capote," Excellent
","By now, everyone has said that Truman Capote--I mean Philip Seymour Hoffman--is brilliant as is Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. So is Bruce Greenwood in the role of Jack Dunphy, though the actor like the real-life character he plays, becomes overshadowed by the star.I found Chris Cooper as the K.B.I. agent understandably intense since he has to carry the weight for all of the folks in Kansas who were p.o.ed at Capote for doing things like finding Hickock and Smith an attorney for their appeal. Capote also found that he had to come down on the side of the victims or the killers in his focus if not his sympathy (though there is that, too, of course), and he ended up giving the victims short shrift. People who knew the family were ticked about that, too. (In an early scene, Capote tells Cooper's character that he doesn't care whether they find the killers or not. Cooper says that he cares very much. That is the start of the bad feeling between them, which never seems to resolve amicably.)",Null,1,3,14 November 2005
U-571," Excellent if formulaic war movie
","Writer/director Jonathan Mostow knows the formula for an exciting story and that is good for everyone looking for an entertaining adventure yarn. I can only recall one discontinuity. Matthew McConnaughy's character punches Erik Palladino, and in the next shot Palladino doesn't look as if he's been punched at all. But such glitches are rare. Another criticism: While it is refreshing that Mostow wants to convey that his characters are scared even when they do brave deeds, the director has McConnaughy spend more than half his screen time with his eyes wi-i-ide open. But I quibble. This story is fun for many of the same reasons that 'Star Wars' (1977) is fun although 'U-571' is much darker. You have the hero, Lt. Tyler, who wants to be a skipper, but he isn't ready because he doesn't know how to make risky decisions. (Trust in the force, Luke.) The hero has two mentors and one dies off early just as Obi Wan Kenobi died off surprisingly early. Nice touch, giving him two mentors, because then we don't have to believe the hero learns his lessons from the dead mentor only. Realistically, he needs more than one lesson, as anyone does. Whereas a fantasy like 'Star Wars' can have Obi Wan come back as a ghost, a gritty combat film must have a living mentor to be credible. The hero's initiation into the adventure is made more tense when he is kept in the dark about the mission until the crew is out to sea. Adding a sinister element of mystery is Jack Weber as Lt. Hirsh, a secret operative who is forced on the crew whether they like it or not. (Is he from signal intelligence, a precursor of the NSA?) Hirsh along with David Keith's Marine intelligence officer, immediately suggest that there are secret forces at work--even among the crew. In an eerie, disorienting scene, Hirsh exposes the fact that the radio operator (Jack Noseworthy) speaks fluent German, something he has kept hidden from crewmembers for fear of being identified with the enemy. In other ways, the language difference between the Americans and their enemy is exploited for tension: What if your life suddenly were to depend on operating a vessel on which all the controls are labeled in a foreign language, and you have only two men capable of running around the ship, translating for your crew? The hero in 'U-571' faces one edge-of-your-seat challenge after another as he learns to command 'on the job.' The tough situations become tougher and tougher until the climatic scene in which the hero not only gets to blow up something big (not quite the Death Star, but then Darth Vader isn't aboard, either), but he learns the final grim lesson of command in the process. The equally grim moral question that is implicit here goes unquestioned by film-maker Mostow, but then the hero's lesson is precisely that he does not have the right to hesitate about life-and-death decisions. Unless you avoid war movies like the plague, you won't want to miss this exciting film. By the way: Yes, the movie is fiction. The British, not the Americans, caught the first German Enigma machine on a U-boat. And they didn't have as difficult a time bringing this war-winning elixir back to their 'tribe' as do the crew in 'U-571.' According to the legend on screen at the end, the first two or three Enigma's were found by British ships and then a US ship caught another one near the end of the war. I hate to quibble further (or do I?), but the part of Eddie (Terrence 'T.C.' Carter), the black cook who gets to play an equal role as the crew dwindles, bears on the film's rather unrealistic treatment of race relations. Except for an early comment about how he finds out important things because white officers heedlessly speak in front of him as if he were not there, no further reference is made to the servile role forced upon African-Americans in the US Navy during World War II. No one expresses a lick of prejudice toward Eddie. Even when the Germans are accused of being prejudiced (by Eddie), they are never given the chance to show it. I think the film-maker's defense is that all historical movies are really contemporary stories; 'U-571' portrays race relations as they ought to have been rather than as they were. To complete the Star Wars analogy--for now at least-- Hitler is the ultimate Darth Vader but since this story is more realistic than Star Wars, it is about men fighting a small but significant piece of the war against Hitler, not the pitched battles we so often see in Star Wars where there is the possibility of taking out Darth. (Though, Darth is not really the head of the Evil Empire, is he? But lets not niggle.)",7,0,1,21 May 2000
Patton," This Movie is Omar Bradley's Take on Patton
","Although two other soldiers are credited with consulting on 'Patton,' Gen. Omar Bradley gets consulting credit in huge letters, and the sources for Francis Ford Coppola's script are given as Ladislas Farago's biography of Patton plus Bradley's own memoir, 'A Soldier's Story.' This is significant because much of this movie is told from the viewpoint of Bradley including the way Patton is ultimately portrayed. George C. Scott ultimately 'defends' Patton. (I once heard an actor say that 'defending' is often an actor's job when playing a villain but that it can be the job of playing a flawed hero, too.) Nevertheless, having just watched the first half of this movie (having seen the whole thing years ago and mindful of not remembering the rest of the movie as vividly as the part that I saw last night), I can't help seeing this great movie in a bit more critical light than I did when I did not know more about the real life people in question.A good example of how the movie takes Bradley's side against Patton (but how Scott defends him) is in the scene in which Bradley complains to his superior about the losses in Sicily and Patton says, it's time to remember how many more losses there would have been if men were still slogging up that road they had been supposed to follow. Of course, this raises the problem of how do you know what would have happened if you had taken a different path from the one you took, but Patton could have been right; there was, after all, no bloodless way to take Sicily away from the Germans.In a prior scene, where Bradley is advocating caution and taking time, he says to Patton, 'The difference between you and me is, I do this job because I was trained for it, you do it because you love it.' There is a certain amount of self-justification in all of that. After all, later on it wasn't just Field Marshal B. L. Montgomery who screwed Patton in Europe, it was Bradley whose over-caution led him to reject Patton's plan for a swift entrapment of the German army followed by a swift invasion of Germany. Patton was a bastard, there is no doubt, but his plans were daring enough to shorten the war by a year. Bradley's caution, in the end, cost lives, as Puck-20 already implied in his review. Loving your subordinates is warm and fuzzy, but give me a Patton who gets the boys home by Christmas by winning the war.",8,0,0,28 October 2011
Hidden Figures," Moving tribute to behind-the-scenes heroes
","Historically, patriotic African-Americans have often had to fight on two fronts at once, fighting for their country while countering friendly fire from countrymen who doubt either their ability or willingness to do the job. The story of black 'computers' and engineers working in the U.S. space program in the early 1960s is presented here as one such example.The Langley Research Center (near Hampton, Virginia, and not connected to the famous town where the CIA is headquartered) was an early hothouse for NASA research and development, and provided work for men and women of all races in what we now call the STEM fields. To give an idea of how affirmative action developed at NASA, by 1984, only 2 percent of U.S. engineers were black, but 8.4 percent of NASA engineers were black. This movie dramatizes how this shift developed from the beginning of NASA, when talented female and African-American mathematicians got the proverbial foot in the door. (Although, government and government contractor employment of African-Americans and women to do math related tasks went back at least to World War II, and the ups and downs of African-American civil servants can be traced back to the 1870s.)The focus of this movie is on math prodigy Katherine Goble Johnson who becomes indispensable to the Mercury Space Program even while she has to work in a facility that still has segregated restrooms. It takes her a minimum of 40 minutes to take her breaks because the nearest 'colored' restroom was half a mile away! (Sorry, as dramatic as this story is, it turns out that many of the advancements portrayed in the movie, from the biggest professional achievements of the three main characters to the desegregation of the restrooms, actually occurred by or before 1960.) Nevertheless, this is an excellently told and acted story. As often happens, though, the filmmakers found that they had to pick one of the three characters to focus on more than the others. (Not that the other two women are ignored, they are just not done full justice.) Tariji P. Henson is a star in the best sense. Janelle Monáe and the increasingly ubiquitous Octavia Spencer round out the leading roles along with Mahershala Ali as Katherine's devoted husband. Good, if a bit stereotyped(!), in supporting roles are Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons. Glen Powell as John Glenn seems sufficiently Boy Scoutish, but he doesn't look like the thin and prematurely balding Glenn. (Ed Harris, in 'The Right Stuff', remains a far more convincing Glenn.)Couldn't quite make sense of the way Al Harrison (Costner) went about desegregating the restrooms; if he were going to be seen knocking down a sign, why the 'Colored only' sign rather than the 'Whites only' sign? Wasn't the latter the real problem for his star computer?",8,3,9,24 February 2017
Woman in Gold," Good story survives cinematization
","When dramatized, true stories are almost always over-dramatized. This movie is no exception, but that does make it entertaining. It also raises, though doesn't fully settle, questions about restitution. (Almost leads one to think about it.) The best reason for seeing this movie is the excellent acting. Mirren is great, Reynolds is a positive surprise, and I was only surprised that I did not know ahead of time that Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany is in this. That, given her presence, she delivers a terrific performance should be no surprise to anyone familiar with her. If there is no Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her, there is no fairness in the Academy.",8,0,1,19 April 2015
The Da Vinci Code," for the bright twelve-year-old
","There are some intellectual movies (and books) that are just right for the precocious 12-yr.-old. This is one of them. Lots of stylized intellectual arguments between characters, but also occasional action and humor woven into a strictly formulaic plot. I won't give anything away, but if you are like me and didn't read the book, there is a 'surprise' twist at the end. I began to guess it, though, and I became convinced after the conflict in the plot ran down but the movie kept going. To keep going after that point, there has to be a really potent plot twist and I guessed it. Telegraph received.This is a fun, entertaining movie (see four points of Redeeming value below). A lot of stuff is silly. Several facts are just wrong. For example, the Catholic Church no longer holds that Mary Magdelene was a prostitute. It once held that position --held it for almost 1500 years-- but since 1969, Church doctrine has been that she was not a prostitute. So some of things in this movie are, to one degree or another, not to be taken as true. On the other hand, the contention that Emperor Constantine was not a real Christian--that is true. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie are the burnished tableaux of historical and speculative events such as the death of Constantine and the Council of Nicea (those are historical). The Council is shown with the Bishops of the fourth century Church in a great hall that is lined with Roman soldiers; some bishops in togas and neatly coifed while others are in rude tunics, long hair and beards. They are all shouting and arguing. Yes, that is what it probably looked like.The characters are either flat or caricatures. The plot is unbelievable in whole if not in a few parts. Liberties are taken with real life organizations. This could have made for fun satire, but ultimately it's a pseudo-intellectual suspense yarn that delivered little intellectual stimulation and little suspense for me. So why see this movie at all (say, when it comes out on DVD)?1. Ian McKellan steals scenes like nobody's business 2. scenes inside the Louvre (unless you can go to the Louvre in person) 3. some of the historical tableaux 4. over-the-top performance as villain by Paul Bettany tied with understated performance as villain by Alfred Molina",5,1,4,30 May 2006
Jersey Boys," Life's Soundtrack
","I knew going in that Clint Eastwood was not going to do this movie as a standard musical. (The French might like the movie better this way, though the final credits do run over a musical street scene in which even Chris Walken's Godfather-type character dances in the chorus.)At more than two hours, this movie still has to turn many of the events in the character's lives into highlighted moments. For example, the tragedy of Frankie Valli's daughter, Francine, is obviously a movie all by itself, but this movie only has time to suggest rather than explore it.It is surprising that the movie does try to be more than just the 'Frankie Valli Story,' giving some attention to the other members of the group. One of the ways we get more of them than we might have is the technique of having them talk to the camera. It makes the viewer conscious of the play for a moment, but then the story--and the music--draws us back in, and we know something more than we might have otherwise. There are other ways the movie makes us realize that it is a little bit the Tommy-Bob-and-Nick story, too. For example, we find out what it was like for Nick to room with Tommy for what he describes as a ten-year jail sentence, and I never thought I would find out Bob's story behind the song 'December, 1963 (What a Lady, What a Night)' (but I never thought I needed to know).There are delightful characters along the way such as record producer and sometime co-songwriter Bob Crewe. Walken is good as the mob boss who made sure that Valli didn't get in too much trouble. Also, while the band members do not seem to age much during the 1960s and early 1970s, the make up on their appearances in 1990 are pretty spectacular. (That is, they don't seem fake.)Most of all, this movie uses lots of the Four Seasons' music, reminding me that even though I was never a big fan at the time, they were nevertheless the soundtrack to more of my own life than I had realized. I can remember like it was a minute ago, driving along the Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire in 1962 between my father at the wheel and older brother riding shotgun and 'Sherry' beaming into our car radio from WBZ in Boston.",8,11,17,25 June 2014
Defiance," inspiring if a bit fast & loose with history
","I was very moved by this movie even while I noted many departures from fact, which were obviously done in order to make more dramatic fiction. (Usually I go to historical movies first and then go out and read about what really happened. In this case, I read Peter Duffy's 'The Bielski Brothers' before I saw this movie, which is based on Nechama Tec's 'Defiance,' which is also one of Duffy's sources.) This true story is too little known. It can stand to be Hollywoodized if that means it will at least be told. Just as 'Valkyrie' reminds us that not every German joined in Hitler's orgy of inhumanity, this movie reminds us that not every intended victim of Hitler's program of extermination went quietly. (Indeed, even those who were put into ghettos or taken to death camps did not always go quietly and they did not necessarily give up.) This movie is about one of several groups of Jews who responded to the Nazi threat by going on the offensive and becoming warriors. (Aside from the above-mentioned books about the Bielskis, there is now another book about Jewish guerrillas in Eastern Europe, 'Until Our Last Breath' by Michael Bart.) One thing that comes out in this movie that is historically accurate is that the Bielski group took in women, the elderly and childrennon-combatants who others would not have taken because they might hinder the fighting mission of a partisan group. Tuvia is quoted in the books as saying he would rather rescue one old Jewish woman than kill ten German soldiers. The movie doesn't have him say that, but it shows him doing it. As Peter Duffy notes, the Bielski brothers saved more Jews than Schindler of 'Schindler's List' fame.Some facts are played fast and loose with. Whereas only Tuvia is portrayed in the movie as riding a horse, actually, the other brothers rode horses, too.The gentile farmer who helps the Bielskis is perhaps supposed to be a composite of those who helped them, but there was a real farmer who actually did more than his share of helping, and he survived the war. (Indeed, it is rather amazing that the Nazis were so slow to realize that he was running an underground railroad for escapees from the ghettos and that even after they finally caught on, they never caught him.) The filmmakers' choice is to concentrate on 1941-1942 when the Bileski group formed; however, they have added some events from 1943 such as the move from the Lipichanska forest to the Naliboki forest and the trek through the swamp within the Naliboki. The battle with the tank unit at the end did not happen. The whole point of the trek through the swamp was to reach a place that could hardly be reached by a tank. But I understand that this sequence was made up in order to juice up the action. (I am afraid that I have seen worse dramatic betrayals of the facts.)Thus they have gained more action and drama while avoiding the complication of showing the later increasing control over the Bielski group by the Soviets, who divided the group and gave each of the three brothers a different posting (which was OK with Zus but not with Asael). One of the consequences of the filmmakers collapsing the time line is that it makes it seem as if the Bileski group was already in the Naliboki forest in 1942, which it was not. The Bielskis have been accused of participation in the May 1943 massacre of the town of Nalibokiin some people's minds, as if they alone planned and executed the attack. In fact, at the time of the massacrewhich was led by non-Jewish Soviet partisans who were probably following directives from MoscowTuvia Bielski and the bulk of his group, consisting mostly of non-combatants, were some 40 kilometers away from the town of Naliboki in one of the smaller forests between the Lipichanska and Noliboki forests, busily moving from one forest to another to evade the Germans. They would not reach the Naliboki forest until the month following the massacre.One dramatic weakness that I have to complain about is the short shrift given to the Asael Bielski character (Jamie Bell). Viewers will be surprised to learn that he was older than Zus, not younger. Moreover, he is kind of a nebbish in this movie, eventually forced to shoehorn himself into a leadership role. The real Asael was well-organized and rather tough, sharing some of the strengths and flaws of each of his brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus (Liev Shreiber). The characters of these latter brothers dominate this movie, with Tuvia embodying all of the leadership traits and Zus all of the tough guy traits. For example, it was really Asael not Zus who disobeyed Red Army orders and left his post to rejoin Tuvia. (In real life a Soviet partisan officer ordered the execution of Asael for this desertion.) Tuvia and Zus become exaggerated types while poor Asael becomes an empty suit. Aron Bielski, whom I believe is still alive, will not recognize his brother Asael in this portrayal, while he might recognize the characters of Tuvia and Zus only as more or less approximating their real life counterparts.",8,3,9,17 January 2009
The Blind Side," Three Strikes and a Touch Down
","This movie had many strikes against it going in. I am not crazy about football movies, or feel-good holiday movies where everyone is without a mean bone in his or her body (except some clichéd curmudgeon who has a Scroogian change of heart in the end whether he/she be a major or minor character). Nor for the emotional manipulations and simplifications that go on when a movie is based on a true story and the filmmakers melodramatize it and dumb it down for the audience. In 'The Blind Side', if these people were half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this picture, there probably never was any conflict that amounted to anything as melodramatic as the climax here. All that being said, I must give this movie a positive review.'The Blind Side' also had a strike against it because it reminds me of the cynical joke in 'The Hollywood Shuffle' about a TV sitcom where a white person takes in a bat played by a black actor and the name of the sitcom is 'There's a Bat in My House', which is clearly meant to parody every clichéd sitcom about a black person living with a white host.'The Blind Side' overcomes an awful lot of the strikes against it by being well written, directed and acted. They don't seem as much like clichés while you're watching them. Yet the clichés are all there. That is an amazing achievement. I wouldn't go to a sequel or a remake or other attempt to recapture the magic of this movie because nobody could do it without turning it into utter schmaltz.Sandra Bullock is at the top of her game as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the real-life Memphis woman who decided to take Michael Oher, a good-natured sixteen-year-old underachiever (played sensitively by Quinton Aaron) into her home one Thanksgiving Eve and never let him leave until she and her husband sent him off to college two years later, in the mean time having become his legal guardians, hired a tutor so that he could improve his grades and seen him become sought after by dozens of college football coaches.The only major conflicts in the plot (there are minor conflicts, of course, but we are never really afraid of them) stem from the appearance of impropriety in that the Tuohys and Michael's tutor are all alumni of the University of Mississippi and they all are seen encouraging Michael to accept a football scholarship to 'Ole Miss'. As the investigator from the NCAA suggests, it looks as if the Tuohys did everything that they did for Michael just so that they could boost the football fortunes of their alma mater. In the movie, Michael, who has never considered this possibility until the investigator spells it out, suddenly considers it seriously, and runs away from Leigh Anne and goes back to the projects where he spent part of his childhood. There he nearly gets killed. I smell an injection of melodrama into a more placid real life story where the dramatic conflicts were more mundane if not absent. If the Tuohys are half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this movie, I suspect that Michael would never have believed for a second that they were that nice to him just so that they could exploit him. Human beings are capable of great deviousness, but nobody can sustain an uncrackable facade of faux affection toward someone they do not really love for two whole years, especially if that someone is a teenager.As is often the case in these sorts of movies when they are done well, the pathos is judiciously mixed with gentle humor. I laughed, I cried, goes the cliché and here it was true. I actually enjoyed being manipulated by this movie, and that says a lot considering that it had so many strikes against it going in.Disclaimor: One thing 'The Blind Side' had in its favor from the get-go is that it stars Sandra Bullock whom I absolutely adore.",8,1,2,10 December 2009
Centurion," If you liked 'Gladiator' you might like this
","After staying up late watching this blood-drenched but exciting adventure film, I was stunned to learn that it was something of a box office flop, having made back about half of what it cost to make. Most likely this has to do with how few screens the movie opened with, just over 100 in the UK and about 25 in the US, presumably with no hype. (I never heard of it until seven years after it opened.) This is certainly not your average date movie unless both parties like their violence graphic. So much for the chancy, grim aspects of movie-making. (Almost as grim as the blood in this movie.)The story and acting are pretty good for an adventure/survival yarn: A small band of survivors of an ambush must take a circuitous route through enemy territory to get home. The hero is the son of a gladiator whose father taught him all of his skills and tricks. The best villain is a fierce woman warrior who tracks down the Roman prey. She wears animal skins and war paint, never speaks or smiles, and wields a scary, partisan-like polearm as if it were an extension of her body and soul. (This is not only about guys doing macho stuff, it has a couple of macho women characters, too.)If you do not mind the blood and gore, this is a great adventure story with amazing photography of untamed Scottish mountain country. An interesting note (to me, anyway): The Romans speak English instead of Latin while the Picts speak Scots Gaelic instead of Pictish. Very little Pictish has been preserved, but from what we know of it, it would have been more similar to Gaelic than English is to Latin.",8,0,3,20 April 2017
Wonder Woman," Not a big superhero fan gives a big thumbs up
","'I am both frightened and aroused,' says Sameer after Wonder Woman tosses a gun-wielding bully across the floor of the pub where she has been introduced to Sameer and other allies by her main ally, Steve Trevor. I am not a big fan of super-hero movies, but this one has remarkable acting, writing, direction as well as impressive sets and costumes. (It is set during World War I.)The opening scenes are richly imaginative as they take place on the mystical island where the Amazons live and where Diana (Wonder Woman) has been raised. The world of young Diana is sun-drenched and Greek-ified and establishes the mythological universe that informs Wonder Woman and all that she does for the rest of the movie.After Steve Trevor is chased into the island's airspace and has to be rescued from his Imperial German pursuers by Diana and all of the Amazons, more and more of the world of (circa) 1918 is evoked. Diana goes with him back to Europe and becomes Wonder Woman as she battles the German Army and a fancifully villainous version of General Erich Ludendorff, one of the chief leaders of Germany during the war. (Though he would go on - historically speaking - to be largely responsible for introducing a nobody named Adolf Hitler to many of the influential people who helped the future dictator in his rise to power.)There are formulaic action scenes that get Wonder Woman and her band of allies into and out of all kinds of predictable trouble. These are well-done dramatically with the help of bold special effects.Most of all, the casting is terrific with the breath-taking Gal Gadot, as the title character, holding up the movie in all of her many scenes.There is good chemistry between her and co-star Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. Their band of allies are entertainingly quirky if often ineffectual.The most grievous fault is that the villains are too numerous and their villainy too spread out among them, and the Big Bad is only introduced at the very end. Almost anticlimactically.The battle tactics of the Amazons are inexplicably poor. I am reminded of the titular protagonists in '13 Assassins' (2010) who shoot arrows from the roof at their enemies below until they voluntarily stop and jump down into their enemies' midst because their samurai pride won't allow them to take advantage of anything better than ten to one odds. In 'Wonder Woman', no explanation is given for the Amazons giving up their similar but greater high-ground advantage over the Germans in the first battle sequence of the movie.I found most of the humor organic, not strained, and the preachiness that some talk about was really kept to a minimum. (Native American grievances are alluded to and Wonder Woman recognizes that the Germans did not start the war alone. As presented, though, these things are acknowledged even by many conservative historians.)When Trevor's secretary describes her obedience in her duties, Wonder Woman says, 'Where I come from that is called slavery'. But this is funny, and, otherwise, Wonder Woman takes the advice of her allies in fitting into a 'patriarchal' society.A big, fun, escapist movie with some vivid touches of realism for atmosphere. I particularly liked the scene where Wonder Woman, the super-hero and goddess, rises above the historically accurate portrayal of the stalemate along the Western Front to march across No-Man's Land. (Though maybe there were too many trees and not enough barbed wire. The trees were dead and short but should have been non-existent due to frequent barrages.) She single-handedly defeats the German defenders, inspiring not only her band of allies but most of a British regiment to follow her. (If such a miraculous, un-ordered and unplanned attack had the faintest chance of working, it would have been because the higher-ups did not spoil it with a preliminary artillery barrage, which always tended to warn the enemy you were coming and tore up No Man's Land in ways that made it more, not less, impassable).",8,5,13,6 June 2017
300," Disappointing
","Sure, the special effects are spectacular. In the sense that they add up to a spectacle. (As in, Stop making a spectacle of yourself.) But is that what I really want when I watch a movie? The graphic equivalent of purple prose? Xerxes looks like the Big Bad in a 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' arc. I kept expecting fangs.What really got me was the scene where the Persian emissary meets with King Leonidas and demands, 'Surrender your weapons'. This is a rightly famous moment in Western history, although, given the Spartans' warrior ethos, Leonidas' reply was a foregone conclusion. ('Spartan' is Greek for 'Klingon'.) All Leonidas said was two words: 'Come take'. A phrase so laconic it has ever since frightened translators who usually insist on adding words to what he said. What '300' does is worse than add words, however; it adds images, narrative. It stretches out the scene unnecessarily. Cinematically, Leonidas basically says, I will answer your question, but first I must have a flashback. Then I must overdramatize my reply instead of making it understated, which is all that is needed.This movie lost me right there.",4,3,4,12 September 2014
Hacksaw Ridge," Emotional tribute to a man of principle
","Not a dry eye in my house while I watched 'Hacksaw Ridge' alone. Desmond T. Doss was previously unknown to me, yet he was the real deal. Made me want to see the documentary about him. Evidently, the movie downplays the true story rather than displaying the usual Hollywood exaggeration. Moral of the story: You know your objection to handling guns is principled when you are willing to march into battle without one. Doss only touched a rifle to use it as a splint or part of a makeshift travois. (No indication, though, that he knew to empty the weapon before so using it!)The cast of this movie is terrific. Obviously Andrew Garfield in the starring role, but also Teresa Palmer is fine in the kind of role that usually gets thrown away in a war movie (the hero's wife). Hugo Weaving deserves every award he can get for his role as the father, Tom Doss. Vince Vaughn is uncharacteristically understated as Sergeant Howell - even while saying lines that would make R. Lee Ermey jealous. Sorry to be so provincially and patronizingly amazed at how so many Australians do believable American accents, but the average American movie-goer is probably not going to notice how few of the actors in this movie are Americans. (Andrew Garfield was born in the U.S. but did not grow up here.)",9,2,5,24 February 2017
Cinderella Man," Not bad at all
","Excellently told story. As usual, you should not assume this means it is perfectly faithful to history. (Russell Crowe and Ron Howard collaborated before on 'A Beautiful Mind,' and I now know that that was wildly inaccurate historically and scientifically--things didn't quite happen that way, and they explained Nash's theories incorrectly.) I kept thinking while watching 'Cinderella': I have heard of Max Baer and Joe Louis, but Jim Braddock? I was totally surprised by the ending, which goes to show how much of a boxing buff I am (not).Good acting by the principals, but I fear Craig Bierko will be overlooked for the Academy Award nomination he deserves for his performance as a truly scary Max Baer.It is amusing to say that there are no tricks used to tell this story; the use of intra-psychic imagery (showing us how the character 'sees' what he or she is looking at in contrast to how it would appear to the objective observer) must have been done subtly enough or else we are now trained to accept this in movies so that one can overlook it.",8,0,0,15 July 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," work of weird genius
","The Coen brothers have made a mark on the movies since their 1980s debut, 'Blood Simple.' They reached a mass audience with 'Fargo.' Now they have given us another skewed vision with 'O Brother, Where Art Thou.' The question is, a skewed vision of what? Of Homer's Odyssey? Of America's fly-over country? Unless I have missed something in previous Coen movies, while these co-script-writing brothers are obviously literate, this is the first time they have based the plot of a movie on a classic story, but it is not the first time they have told a story set in that vast part of the US which many movie-makers ignore. On the other hand, some residents of fly-over country might prefer to be ignored. The Coens paint America's hinterland with broad and comical strokes. I laughed at the antic characters in this movie, but I winced, too. The Coens make sport of hicks, hayseeds, rubes and hillbillies--the only people it is still politically correct to make fun of. Perhaps this is allowed precisely because such folk are themselves famously politically incorrect, or more to the point, they too often look on political correctness as alien to common sense. (If one becomes genuinely sophisticated as opposed to being a poseur, one realizes that the rubes are often right.) A sense of fair play makes me think that rural folk ought not to be picked on so much. On the other hand, I want to say, 'Yeah, but this is really funny!' That, of course, would be regarded as a poor defense of any comedy made at the expense of some politically correct sacred cow. That said, 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is so full of fun that I can hardly wait to see it again. Homer's tale becomes a departure point whereby every cliche about 1930s rural America in general and Mississippi in particular is rendered larger than life. You have chain gangs, 'ole timey' country music (the way it was before Nashville discovered electric guitars), folksy politicians, new Deal hydro-electric projects, dirt-poor farmers covered with real dirt, women with seven or more children, bank-robbers who drive fast cars while wielding tommy guns, and even the Ku Klux Klan. If you don't appreciate this movie, you should check out some of the fare on American Movie Classics. The Coens are making loving fun of the style of 1930s movies, complete with a performance from George Clooney that often parodies '30s mega-star Clark Gable.",9,0,0,8 February 2001
