Hereditary," Not for everybody.
","The most helpful thing I can say about this film is that it's not for everyone. If you're a fan of movies like Saw, Hostel, The Nun etc. Chances are you'll hate this film. But if you're a fan of movies like The Blair Witch Project, Annihilation, The Witch and The Babadook, chances are you'll like this one.Personally, I've got to say this movie has stayed with me. I'm not sure if it frightened me, repulsed me, depressed me or fascinated me? Or a combination of all of these. For me all the lead actors were spot on with their performances. And yeah, granted, after the movie I had to go Googling to find out what it was all about, and about some of the iconography that featured in the film.If true be told, the story itself isn't that original, or even that clever. But for me is the general mood of the film that makes this something special. As with The Babadook, there is a distinct sinister, creepy, unpleasant melancholic feel to the whole film, and there is no comedic relief to ease the mood. Right from the start you are on a downward spiral into the abyss. And again, if I'm being truthful, chances are you'll be left feeling quite depressed after this film.... But in a good way. If that makes any sense.For me the final chapter of the movie is its star. Without giving too much away, the whole last section of the movie feels like surreal nightmare. Both fascinating and repellent at the same time.As I say, not for everybody. There is little in the way of jump scares, gore or even action. There are a few 'OMG' moments. But this is a long movie and one you need to put a bit of investment into. Worth a watch.",9,2,5,21 January 2019
Man of Steel," Great movie for the right audience. A modern Superman.
","To be fair, making a movie about Superman you are never going to please everybody all of the time. The die-hard comic fans will have very specific expectations of the film. Fans of the older Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve incarnation will have differing expectations. So to make a film like this, you'll always be stuck between a rock and a hard place. So to say this movie is bad is just wrong, because it's not. Fans of the comics or the Reeve versions should maybe not go see this movie. It's a Superman for the modern age. Yes it's loud. Yes there is a lot of fast action sequences. Yes the original storyline has been remixed and revamped. And yes, there is a lot of CGI in the movie. So what. It works. People who bang on about the use of CGI in movies; yes I'll agree there are some bad uses of the technology out there. But not in this film. Besides, what would you prefer? A return to rubber monsters, dodgy animatronics and the use of models to simulate everything. I feel people that moan about the use of CGI think you just bang in a few parameters into the sausage machine and hay presto, you have a full blown complex CGI scene fully rendered at the other end. This is not the case, I should know. The process of producing CGI, GOOD CGI, take a lot of time and a lot of artistic and technical knowhow. And in a lot of cases, takes just as long as a more traditional method. So, the bottom line with Man of Steel is this: It's a great movie. Very exciting. Yeah, it's no Shakespeare or Dickens play, but if you're going excepting that, you are stupid. If you love the comics or the Christopher Reeve version, maybe think about not going to see this one. And if you don't like CGI, Super hero, Science fiction or action movies, then don't go see this movie and then moan about how crap you thought it was afterwards. That's like punching yourself in the face and then complaining about how painful it is. Please!Man of Steel. Great movie, would recommend.. with the above provisos.",9,7,14,4 July 2013
Ender's Game," I tried to like this movie. Honest.
","I'm a big fan of SciFi. So much so that I will be quite forgiving when viewing scifi movies. I'll be honest and say I'd never read or even heard of the book. But after seeing the trailers I was looking forward to this film. Good points first. The look of the film and the special effects are pretty good, if a little confusing in some places. Some of the space battles are a little overly complex, and therefore tend to loose their impact and drive. Bad points. The acting was painful. Very hammy, and laughable in places. Even veterans like Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley looked almost embarrassed in places. I think this was mostly down to the terrible dialogue of the script, forcing the cast to deliver some pretty terrible lines. Not good. The story was OK, I guess, as thin as it was. You couldn't help drawing similarities between this and The Hunger Games. The ending however was appalling. I found myself shouting at the screen, 'REALLY....!!!!'. It just seemed so abrupt and almost like an after- thought. All in all I was very disappointed in this movie, and no matter how much of a sci fi fan I am, I just couldn't forgive it for being such a stinker. Sorry.",4,1,3,14 March 2014
Evil Dead," To say this is a bad film is just plain wrong
","To say this is a bad film is just plain wrong. It's not bad at all. Not a classic, but not as bad as everybody is making out. Where this movie falls down, and where it always was going to fall down, is too many people regard the original as a classic. It doesn't take a genius to work out, if you're going to make a remake/reboot/re-imagining of a movie, don't chose a cult classic. No matter how good your remake, it will always be slated. I don't hold the original in such high regard. Yeah, it was a new take on an old genera, and it had some, then, good effects, and the cinematography was pretty clever, as were all of Sam Raimi's early films. But classic. I think not. I feel the 2nd Evil Dead film was loads better. And as for people slagging this remake off for bad acting do you remember the original?OK. This movie. Yeah it is pretty gory. But wasn't as bad as I was expecting. The general feel to the movie is unpleasant. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, especially for a horror movie. But there wasn't the underlying humour of the original, and moreover its sequel. I think that's where this version fell down a little. Played it a little too straight faced, and therefore was nothing new. In fact that was my biggest problem with the movie. It was nothing new. It had some well- paced set pieces but lacked any real tension and peril. You didn't really care about the characters, so didn't really care much to what happened to them.On the plus side, I felt the cinematography was pretty good, and added to the underlying 'unpleasant' feel of the movie. The effects were good. And yeah, I'd say the acting was OK too. Don't believe all the bad reviews.All in all, a perfectly watchable horror movie, with some pretty good moments. But a word to the wise. In future don't remake a cult classic. IE. Don't remake the second Evil Dead movie, The Exorcist, The Shining . Yeah I know they remade it as a TV series, but you get the idea.",6,10,18,26 August 2013
