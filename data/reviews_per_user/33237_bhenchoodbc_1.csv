Hereditary," BEST HORROR MOVIE MADE. PERIOD.
","No cheesy jump-scares. They aint tryna do the 'ha ha gotcha' , genuinely and intensely scary. I felt my heart beating rapidly from the start to the end. Felt like my heart was gonna pop out. IVE NEVER FELT THIS UNCOMFORTABLE WATCHING A MOVIE IN MY ENTIRE MOVIEGOING EXPERIENCE.PLEASE WATCH THE MOVIE AND TRY FOR YOURSELVES, DISREGARD THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS.",10,3,5,25 February 2020
