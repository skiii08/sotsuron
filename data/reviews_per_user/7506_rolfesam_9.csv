Blade Runner 2049," This is How You Do a Sequel
","This director is one of the best working in the business today and this is his best film to date. I can't believe the man managed to top Ascension and Sicario which are two of my all time favorite films of the last decade but leave it to the genius that is Denis Villeneuve to top himself in the most incredible ways. Denis Villeneuve's direction for this movie is impeccable and I am fully convinced that no other director could have handled the film and delivered it nearly as masterfully as he did and I would not be surprised if the Academy decided to honor him with (at the very least!) a nomination for best director. I'd be remiss if I did not mention the incredible performances by the amazing cast of the film. All around there were so many strong performances! The fact that a lot of lesser known actors were able to go toe to toe with the likes of Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Robin Wright, and Jared Leto (who are all at their best in years) is something to commend! In particular Sylvia Hoeks and Ana De Armas completely surprised me with just how good they were. Yes, this movie would be nothing without its stars, so with that I will go ahead and say that this is my favorite performance from Ryan Gosling since his role in Drive back in 2011 (which is six years ago, holy crap where has the time gone?). He does so much to display the reserved character of K. He plays the more reserved scenes with such subtlety that it genuinely caught me off guard just how much he was doing with so little, as well as capturing the more emotional scenes without it coming off as out-of-character or corny, which it very well could have been. Harrison Ford also is incredible in this movie! Really, this might just be the best performance of his entire career. There was one scene, near the climax of the movie, where there is a shot that lasts several minutes and Ford only says one sentence in the entirety of it, but was still so gripping because of the acting that Ford accomplished! With nothing more than posture and facial expressions! I would be horrified if Ford were not nominated for best supporting actor. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if he walked off with the award at the end of the night. However, despite how much I've built him up in this review don't go in expecting to see too much of Ford. This is Gosling's movie, and Ford does not show up until much later. Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks both play very good antagonists in the movie, and really bring the characters to life with their great acting. It goes a long way that, even though they are a little on the 'crazy bad guys' side of things, they do have a very clear goal with a clear desired outcome and a logical reason to be doing what they are doing. There isn't any being-evil-for-the-hell-of-it moments. The audience understands the stakes that both of these characters have in the outcome of the story, and you can understand the motives behind their actions. This is such a refreshing thing to say in the age of Marvel movies, where the majority of antagonists are simply World Ending Baddies.The Mixture of practical and special effects in this movie are also worthy of applause, and that goes for both the artists that crafted them as well as to the actors in the film itself. They make every little piece of the world feel real and lived in. I will also roll the practical effects that the actors performed in the film itself, as both Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford actually physically hit one another(!!!) in their fight scene. This in itself really helped to sell the scene and demonstrates the actors dedication to the film as a whole.The crown jewel of the film though would have to go to Roger Deakins' cinematography. If this man does not win this years best Cinematography Oscar than the whole award is a farce, because I am not sure if I have ever seen a single film (since the films of Stanley Kubrick) that were this consistently stunning in every single shot. In most films there may only be 3-4 scenes where great cinematography was used but in this film there are only 3-4 scenes that aren't jaw dropping. The way that the shots are cut, the composition of each shot, and the way that many of the shots seem to linger and play out is nothing short than an example of moving art. Really I would say that the shots are so good and convey so much information to the audience that you could watch the entire movie without sound and the film as a whole would still be comprehensible and enjoyable and that is an achievement worth applauding. Overall I could go on for hours about every little thing I loved in this film (and in reality I have with people in my day to day life) but I absolutely do not wish to spoil this film for anyone so I will conclude by saying that this movie is a masterpiece. It is one of the best sequels ever made, it is one of the best science fiction movies ever made, this is one of the best movies of this decade and it is one that you need to go see for yourself.Or else this film may be lost to time, like tears in the rain.",10,2,10,7 October 2017
It," IT is What Stephen King Deserved
","IT is a 2017 horror movie from director Andy Muschietti and it was actually pretty great in my opinion. Everyone involved in this film really deserves props for even getting an adaptation of Steven King's famously lengthy 1986 novel of the same name, let alone producing something as well made as this movie turned out to be. The film makers wisely chose to forgo the segments of the book that happen during the main cast's adulthood to focus on their childhoods. This could have turned out poorly as child actors have the stigma of being bad actors and having the entire main cast be comprised of teens under 18 years old could have backfired. Thankfully the entire cast of kids gave a very well acted performance with the only real exception being the actor who played Ben who's performance was simply 'good enough'.Of course I would be remiss if I failed to mention Bill Skarsg√•rd who really brought new life the role that manages to both stay true to the character while making it distinct from Tim Curry's famous 1990 performance of the character. I feel like he made a great monster for the movie and really has some great scenes where I was genuinely impressed by what he did with his performance. The director is also someone that I want to briefly touch on. Andy Muschietti really showed what he could do given a proper budget and it really surprised me. He was able to get a lot of really good performances out of his cast as well as making the mid 1980's town feel real and lived in. I've got to say though there were a few moments that really stuck out where I questioned his intentions, the most memorable would be the boys to men poster moment when he played a clip of the groups music that was jarring. Overall though I am more than impressed by Muschietti and I can't wait to see what he does with the sequel and with his adaptation of Shadow of the Colossus. Overall this is a flawed movie, but so are the best horror movies. There is no doubt though that the movie is scary, thrilling, and all around a really good watch. This definitely gets added to the positive list of Steven King movies and manages to avoid joining the loser pile.",8,2,3,11 October 2017
Akira," The Silence Between the Screams
","Akira is a violent movie, nearly to a fault. While violence has existed in film nearly since its very inception it really isn't used to this extreme except in the case where a film relies on it for a central elemant of the plot or enjoyment of the film (such as in horror or war films). But Akira isn't into about those things, despite the elements of both genres that it wears throughout its 2 hour run-time. The violence and gore in Akira is simply meant to convey the feeling of basic feeling of pain and the crushing feeling of anxiety that the story's characters suffer through. But there are moments between the gore and blood where there is just beautiful silence or near silence that come out of nowhere and just leave you with scenes told entirely through animation and expression rather than from exposition or any dialogue. these moments are some of my favorite in the entire movie with two scenes in particular that are sticking in my mind. I won't spoil the one that comes towards the end but during the first act of the story one of the two main characters Tetsuo begins to see terrifying visions and insinuation that show some really scary stuff in dead silence. It's almost suffocating to watch this scene without sound and it adds considerably to the panic of the scene. Animation wise this may be one of the greatest hand drawn animated movies of all time. the skill and detail in each frame of this film is staggering even 20+ years later. Honestly there is only so many ways that I could describe the visuals with words other than beautiful or impressive. The film is also a pinnacle in the cyber-punk genre of film, standing tall among other important films like Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner as some of the finest examples of this sub-genre in film form as the buildings and neon of the city are as imposing as a wall in a small room, almost making being outside as claustrophobic as being indoors. I'd recommend this movie if you were 16 or older and had a stomach for disturbing imagery, otherwise I don't know if you'd get the fullest out of this movie as you would otherwise.",10,2,5,7 December 2016
Moana," Another Strong Contender for Best Animated Film of 2016
","Moana is a story about learning. Not Romance, not Adventure, not stopping evil people from doing evil things because they are evil. Just Learning. And that in a lot of ways is a fantastic message to put in a film aimed at children because children are always learning and often times they really don't like doing so, but Moana makes the concept of learning seem fun and important. For example Moana in the beginning of the film learns a secret of her people that gives her confidence to go forth with her plans to save her people from the main problem she faces in the story (which I will not be spoiling). But that discovery makes her eager to sail but she doesn't know how to sail, so she learns the basics on her own and later has no problem asking for help when needed to get even better at the sailing. This desire to learn and impliment that learned knowledge in the world and situations Moana finds herself in is a great message for the youth and adults in the audience. Another fantastic thing that Moana has to boast about is the voice acting that it boasts. Really there are not as many characters in this movie as there have been in other Disney movies so the voice acting that Moana does have had to be good to carry the weight of the film and boy do they. Each voice is distinct and fantastic, there is so much charisma and charm to these characters that you don't even think of them as actors in a studio somewhere.And when they sing. Oh My God! Lastly the visuals, of course they are beautiful, its a Disney flick after all. But the water is absolutely incredible, it may be something strange to say but it absolutely made my jaw drop seeing a 3D film with this kind of environment. Overall I do not think this will be the best animated movies of the year, not even the best Disney animated movie of the year, but that is not a knock to Moana its just the year that we have had. Moana is a great movie and can stand with the best of them. It's great, go watch it, everyone, everywhere, any age. It's worth it.",8,5,16,22 December 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," You Can't Think About This Movie
","OK, I'm going to preface this review by saying that overall I am a fan of the MCU and I think they've given the world a fair few really good movies and the remaining ones are almost always OK. That feat is something that is commendable and something that I doubt will ever be recaptured over a series that has this many movies in it. Now that that is out of the way let's get our hands dirty. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dumb movie. That in of itself isn't a damning thing really, a lot of great movies are dumb and rely more on emotions to connect the audience to the plot but in this movie the emotional connection is very scarce which is pretty unforgivable for a movie nearly 2.5 hours in length. There are two emotional parts to the movie which are both short parts to the film that I found to be much more engaging and relatable than the rest of the movie as a whole and I would be much more interested in an MCU movie that simply expanded on them. These two parts being the party where the Avengers are all hanging about and interacting in a way that reminded me that these actors are actually all really talented. like seriously, who here forgot that this cast has been nominated for a combined 9 Oscars? Anyway the other scene is where the group spends a few days isolated on one of their members property. Once again I'd love to see an entire movie focused solely on these characters and how they get along but we will never get that film so oh well. The action in the movie is good if not a little too clean for a movie in which there is a explosive highway chase, a flying city and a derailed train but this is technically a Disney flick so I'll let it slide. The thing that I do not intend to let slide is the emotional manipulation that the movie tries to pass of to its audience. I find it pretty absurd that the same people who have accomplished so much with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even Dr. Strange are willing to turn in such canned and phony plot beats and call it an Avengers movie. I mean the first movie even has a scene that perfectly explains exactly what this movie tries to un-ironically accomplish (the scene with the bloody trading cards if you were wondering). It is really something that stops me every time I think about re watching this movie because it irks me too much. Every single new character is treated with the same level of tragic backstory as a middle-schooler's OC in a fanfiction, its pathetic.But at the end of the day if you are willing to simply go into a movie and be satisfied with people punching things to solve their problems then you will be fine with this movie. Just try not to think about it too much, you may accidentally put more thought into it than the writers.",5,3,4,8 October 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Not the Great Ape's finest hour but not his worst
","Kong: Skull Island is a decent movie, not a great one but is enjoyable enough to enjoy. Tom Hiddleston plays the main character who is pretty bland unfortunately as is John Goodman's role in the flick. really if you have seen a modern American monster movie then you have seen these two characters over and over again to the point that it really isn't the enjoyable portion of the movie. Really I can say the same for Sam Jackson's role in the movie but since it is Sam Jackson in the role he automatically makes the role more enjoyable than it has much of a right to be. Really the only really interesting character is that of John C. Rielly who is the focus of the easily best scenes of the movie which makes the movie much more enjoyable to watch.But you didn't come to this movie for characters did you? You came for a monster and for a monster fight didn't you? Well lucky for you the special effects are actually really good. better than I thought a movie like this would actually have. The fights themselves are decent enough but they feel like they kind of come out of nowhere with very little build up from the film. Really I'm not convinced that I want to recommend because if you want to watch a good modern monster fight then there's Pacific Rim, if you wanted a monster flick with better character there's Monster, and really if you want a better King Kong movie there's the original so I really couldn't recommend this as freely as I feel I should be able to.",5,0,0,14 August 2017
Inception," Intelligent and Brilliant in Every Moment
","Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of the early 21st century. I don't think there would be many to dispute that fact. Inception is one of the best movies of the early 21st century. I doubt that causes much of a stir either. However when I say that Inception is probably Nolan's best movie to date I'm sure I would get a lot of complaints. So why is Inception such a masterpiece to even surpass the other works of the 2000's is the skill seen in every aspect of the films creation. From the sound design and musical score that is provided by the master composer Hans Zimmer to the more than praiseworthy cinematography of Wally Pfister who is at his best here in providing some of the most gorgeous shots I have ever seen in a blockbuster film like this one. I haven't even had time to mention the visuals. There are times in modern day cinema where I feel fatigued of the constant barrage of bad CGI implementation in the movies that are touted as the 'best action movie of the year' that I forget just how much of a beneficial tool it can be when used correctly. This is truly Inception's greatest asset. The many great moments of this film are a mix between the real and practical effects and the computer generated special effects that blur together in such a way that you can barely make the two apart and scenes you'll swear must have been made on a PC are made the way that film makers have been doing for nearly a century. This great uncertainty in what is real and what is not adds magic to this film that has long been becoming a rarity in this age where we truly must marvel in how a scene was done. The acting is of course as good as one can expect from a cast of this caliber and hold their own among the other heavy hitters.I beg you to watch this movie if you have not yet. It will remembered in the same class of those that came before from the hands and minds of those like Spielberg, Lucas, and Scorsese.",10,0,3,16 October 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," When Did Action Get So Good?
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the fourth installment in the post-apocalyptic outback based series and the first to follow the new Mad Max played by Tom Hardy. This time Max is Dragged along, quite literally into a two hour car chase of a movie that all at once showcases some of the greatest action sequences put to film, a celebration of practical effects, and a story with characters who are several times more interesting and layered than what many expect from action flicks in the age of Micheal Bay and superheroes. I can't recommend watching this enough and I can't recommend going into it blind more either.",8,0,2,15 October 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Full of Story, Light on Style
","Hacksaw Ridge is a good movie. If you're only curios if I recommended this movie then yes I do. But I will not say that this movie is as good as many people are saying. The movie is really cut into three sections (which nicely break this movie into the traditional three act structure quite well) which are the scenes before joining the military, the scenes of the main character at fort Jackson, and the titular battle of Hacksaw Ridge. To Be quite blunt the first two portions are really well done if a bit melodramatic in a lot of sections. The acting all around is really good, especially from Vince Vaugnh and Guy Pierce who kind of steal the scenes that they are in. However the story takes a strange turn once it gets to the battle the film was named for for chopping it up so much that a lot of the vital information is lost and has to be indirectly told to the audience such as: 1. How many people has he saved? 2. How long has he been up there? 3. How is he feeling during this time? Truthfully, what should have been its greatest moment turned into a confusing and totally bland montage that does little to enlighten the audience on the mental toll being taken on the character, the test of his morals under fire, and if his relationship with his God/religion ever waver during the hell of war. The worst bit is when Garfield's Character sneaks into one of the Japanese tunnels to help wounded men and then leaves. no real extended tension on if is caught, no mental dilemma about literally walking into enemy hands, it just happens. And that's the real on the movie, it fails to really add tension to what could have been an edge of the seat, heart-pounding, nail- biting, third act. Its more interested in showing what happened rather than to entertain which is not a bad thing but it is a facet that is better handled by documentaries than it is for a blackbuster with the goal to entertain.",6,1,4,21 August 2017
