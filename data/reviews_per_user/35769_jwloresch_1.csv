3:10 to Yuma," Ridiculous Script
","This is the most unbelievable, incredible movie that I have ever seen. 'Good guys' can't seem to shoot the broad side of a barn, and what's worse, have no inclination to even try to level their guns at any one of a gang of mass murderers standing in clear view with no cover. Why, why, why? Why did any of them even bother carrying a gun , when they had no intention of (or ability for) using it? The 'sweet-talking, abused child, mass-murderer with a heart of gold' theme is also hard to swallow. Why in the world would his captors not have gagged him? Why would the prisoner not be fettered? The thing is, I enjoy a good action flick as much as the next guy. I love the Die Hard movies. They're incredibly far-fetched, but fun. Unfortunately, this movie was not of that genre, but any of the escapist Die Hard fare is ten times more plausible! Although I have never seen it, I would bet that the 1957 version was not written like this at all. This was a waste of good production & good acting. Don't waste your time.",1,18,32,11 February 2008
