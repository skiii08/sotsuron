The Avengers," Loved it!!
",This movie took the design and CGI to a whole new level. Was a spectacularly designed visual treat. The storyline and theme were beautiful.,9,1,1,29 September 2019
In Bruges," sweet little tale of friendship, principles and love...with lots of fun
","In Bruges excels in everything it wants to be. It is funny when intended, actiony and most of all, touching. It is a movie that will surely leave you with a feel-good vibe when it ends, with some accompanied sadness of course.Collin Farrell was particularly good, especially when he was funny. Overall, it's a sweet little tale of friendship, principles and love.",8,1,2,8 January 2020
The Others," Unexpected!!
","The Others is a movie which moves creepily yet normally towards the end, and just when one begins to judge it as another cliche' attempt, in comes the twist.
Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart has delivered an exceptional performance, probably the most important performance the entire movie was holding on to.",9,0,0,30 September 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor re-invented
","Loved the film. Though the movie introduced some unexpected changes to the future storyline, it was a thorough fun-ride. The dialogues between the characters were gold.....pure fun.",9,3,7,29 September 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fresh start for Spidey
","So spidey's finally installed into the MCU. The movie was fun and tried to get more close to reality, with a teen trying to fit in his superhero shoes. Loved Robert Downey's presence, gave it the Iron-man touch",9,0,0,29 September 2019
Shutter Island," Flawless screenplay..
","This movie blew my mind.
The movie begins with the protagonist, Edward Teddy Daniels, on his way to shutter island aka mental asylum. With him is his newly assigned partner, Chuck. What starts as a missing patient mystery soon reveals Teddy's own intentions to hunt down his wife's murderer on that island. One event leads to another until Teddy is convinced of a conspiracy against him that is preventing him from uncovering the real truth. He believes unethical mental experiments are being done with the patients there.
He then meets the lost patient in a cave, who convinces him about everyone being evil on the island and that they would do anything to not let him go. He swims his way to the lighthouse and confronts Dr Cawley. THIS IS WHERE THE PLOT EXPLODES.
As Dr Cawley begins convincing him that Teddy himself is just another patient affected by OCD, we the audience feel the cunningness in his attempt to mislead Teddy. But line after line, Teddy and the audience, slowly begin to accept Dr Cawley's version of tge story. THIS IS WHERE THE BEAUTY OF THE MOVIE LIES.....as in throughout the movie, both Teddy and we were under an illusion, and Dr Cawley's suggestions brought both Teddy and us out of our delusion...... Masterful.
So what could have been a dull insight into an OCD patient's life turned into a full length suspense-thriller.... just because of the way the entire events were arranged. Brilliant!!!",10,3,4,30 September 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Morality - to each his own..
","Shows how morality looks different from different eyes, and how individual needs build moral perspectives. Casey Affleck puts on a decent show of talent and holds his own when sharing the screen with veterans like Morgan Freeman.
A film that makes us think and feel for characters, who in their own reasoning are morally correct. And how sometimes, one that shines can also be the one that burns - Jack Doyle reminds us.",8,1,1,30 September 2019
Ant-Man," Underrated!!
","Loved it. Definitely a movie worth watching in the movie hall with those 3D glasses. The best part is the inclusion of Paul Rudd in the MCU, who beyond doubt will bring along fun unlimited.",9,0,1,29 September 2019
Nightcrawler," Part satire, part real and a full-blown thriller. Couldn't get a better cast..
","Jake Gyllenhall was the perfect choice for his role as the night crawler, an unemployed but aspiring man who stumbles upon the world of crime reporting and takes it to extreme lengths to get what he wants. It his transformation from a budding reporter to higher levels with utter disregard for ethics and eventually, even humanity.And all this is packed in a tense thriller of movie. Nicely done.",8,0,1,29 December 2019
Django Unchained," Not uncommon movie tropes, done in a clever and fun way....
","When a movie that stars Leonardo di Caprio as the main antagonist takes more than one hour to finally introduce his character, one gets the idea this is going to be special.
And the sole reason for this audacity is the charming and captivating presence of Christopher Waltz, who had already proven his mettle in Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' - evidently becoming the talking point of that movie. The rest was taken care of by Jamie Foxx playing Django, a character that transitions from the oppressed to the entertaining to the Badass.What also surprised me was the timeline of the film which was relatively linear, given Tarantino's fondness for messing with the order of events.So the movie begins and Christopher Waltz within minutes convinces you you need to look no further for surprises and fun. Accompanied by him, Django, the freed slave embarks on a journey of Bounty killings until he decides its time to free his wife from slavery. Waltz, realising how dangerous an adventure like this cpuld get offers his guidance and comes up with a plan. It is shown Waltz is fully aware of how difficult it could be to free the woman.They ride together, disguising themselves as dealers of fighter black men. And then do we finally get to meet possibly one of the best movie villains - Leonardo di Caprio as Calvon Candie. He is introduced as an affluent man with devilish fetish of a wrestling game that mostly ends with a death and lots of blood.He does seem intrigued by Django's ways and demeanor, but reserves his approach as Django offers him a plump sum to get one of his wrestlers. And as they ride to his house, the guests get a live show of Candie's personality and business ethics as he punishes one his fighter slaves who tried to elope.All seems to be going merry to the plan, until Candie's pet slave figures out the real scheme of the guests....and that is when Leonardo's character gets to shine. Be it the skull demonstration or the fiery thumping on the table with a thunderous scream...he was instilling fear and accompanied awe every moment.Waltz, pale and later red-faced signs off a new deal offered to have his way out but chooses to not shake hands with Candie. This isn't received well either as Candie takes it as an insult and tries to surrender Waltz into a handshake. So Waltz walks up to him, smiles and does something that leaves us as shocked as Candie. And with the two star characters gone, it dawns upon us that the finale belongs to the character to whom the movie belongs - Django Unchained.What then follows, from his escape to his final revenge reeks with goofiness, but Django's crazy gun skills make us feel he could've actually pulled it off.The end is pretty cliche' but there is no denying it is satisfying. And Tarantino's signature blood baths arrive, albeit late, in full glory.",9,0,2,5 January 2020
Dumb and Dumber," Watch it whenever you can!!
","A decent plot, good jokes, unbelievable scenes and two legendary actors - recipe for comedic success.The 'comedy' genre is way more difficult in movie business - both critically and commercially. So making an all-time classic as this is even harder.Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey cemented their place as one of the few all-time greats in the world of comedy because believe me, its been more than 20 years, and the film can still make you laugh your lungs out.I will return to this movie whenever I can, just to realise how fun life can actually be.",9,1,1,1 October 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Exceeded expectations!!!
",Loved this film. Was way beyond my expectation I must say. And the chemistry between the characters was so fun and full of life. Waiting to watch the second volume.,9,0,0,29 September 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Worth watching
","Was good. Though this was a tad different, the villain being the AI.",8,0,0,29 September 2019
Sinister," Worse than a spoof...
","Seriously?? You reveal everything there is to know about the ending, and then expect us to be BLOWN away by that final 'twist'??Abysmal casting, including the children and a plot that relies solely on annoying jump scares to keep you waiting for an ending that will have everything that was already revealed. If just the events were arranged properly and a few MAJOR details not revealed, it would've made for a decent horror-thriller.But all we have here is an uninterested shoddy excuse of a movie.",1,1,3,29 December 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Powerful story, exuding raw emotions and exceptional performances. IF it offends you, you are not looking where it wants you to..
","As the opening credits lead us into the movie, we witness the most captivating, iconic and chilling opening scene of cinema as the camera pans out with Alex delarge's(Malcolm McDowell) eyes fixated on ours. The eyes symbolize the character's inner mind, as if reflecting the soul of evil. And what makes this scene unforgettable is its background score.We are ushered into the world of Anthony Burgess, a distopyian future with a slang of its own. Alex and his droogs roam around, wrecking havoc that are beyond redeemable. One such scene shows Alex and his friends raping a writer's wife and disabling the writer's body. This then is followed by a look into Alex's personal world, who has a penchant for Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies.And his love for Beethoven is used as a symbolism for the pleasure he gets when committing crimes, as the music is played in the background. During one such crime, he is betrayed by his droogs and since the lady dies, he ends up in prison.We get further insight into his psychopathic mind when he reads religious works in prison, and fantasies himself as one of the tormentors of Christ, who inflicts pain on the weak and later enjoys the company of unclad women.During one of his prison visits, a political leader is looking for a volunteer for the Ludovico treatment, that basically robs the criminals of their human ability of liberty and making choices as it associates pain and trauma with their basic instincts. Seeing it as an opportunity to leave prison, Alex signs up for it despite the reservations of the church father who deemed the project immoral.As he is shown videos of violence, he realizes their background music -
Ludwig van Beethoven!!! He yells and pleads them to stop it, as he would never be able to listen to Ludwig van without the accompanying pain induced by the treatment. But realizes it is just too late.Upon release, he undergoes a series of abuse and heartbreak, from his parents disowning him to his earlier pals torturing him as police. And the worst happens when he ends up in the same writer's house who's wife he had raped. The writer decides to use him as a prop to expose the governments immoral project and gets him interviewed. Although after realizing Alex's true identity, he decides to push him to suicide by torturing him with Beethoven's music and blaming it on the government. Alex ends up committing suicide.But he opens his eyes to a hospital where he is being treated. As the nurse shows him pictures and asks for his response, we begin to realize Alex has been cured back to his normal self, as the government wanted to escape the wrath of the public and investigations on its Ludovico treatment. Alex's original self was proof by the government that there was no such treatment done. The movie ends with Alex in one of his usual fantasies of raw sex.For me, as hinted in the story, the movie is about the intrusion of the state into the lives of its common folks and that more than morality and humanity, the government cared for its agenda and results. The very government also did not hesitate in releasing back a potential psychopathic criminal into the society when it felt it was being cornered on the issues involved in the treatment.And as for Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Alex delarge, there is a reason why the character is loved(me included) despite his dangerous flaws. One of the most memorable and terrifying villains on screen. The narration by Alex was definitely praise-worthy, even quirky and humorous sometimes. Stanley Kubrick did not deserve the backlash back then for the offensiveness and the raw nature of the character and movie. And special thanks for the background music, Ludwig van Beethoven, could he get it wrong?One of Stanley Kubrick's finest works.",9,0,0,29 December 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino arrives!!
","Given this was Tarantino's first film, his style of non-linear timeline and blood and gore was evident in his very first project. Overall, the movie is a decent thriller, but what stands out is the original depiction of the tense situation portrayed with some brilliant performances.Michael Madsen in his role imbued dangerous fun and eccentricity.",8,0,1,8 January 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Nice sequel..
",Loved this one too. Did not let down the first installment and guess what...they will return.,8,0,1,29 September 2019
Titanic," Watched in 3d
","This was the best experience of watching Titanic I've ever had. 3D.
It was truly a more lively experience with this format. Moisted my eyes again. The casting, the music, the scenes...TITANIC indeed.",9,4,5,29 September 2019
Thor," Love Thor!!!
",Now this one I loved. Loved the way how the universe and Asgard was explained. Chris Hemsworth did justice to his role.,9,12,17,29 September 2019
The Shape of Water," Beautiful!!
","Watched this movie after hearing news from the academy awards. Must say, this was truly strong in generating a fable of love, and the music was deep too. Loved it, left me happy...sad..angry, everything you would expect from a movie like this.",9,3,8,30 September 2019
Joker," The Joker didn't die with Heath Ledger. The clown prince of crime gets the perfect origin story - BRILLIANT!!!
","Classic cinema trope has always glorified heroes, and while there have been a few memorable characters we've loved from the 'bad' side, the JOKER has earned much more than any of that - the character, despite doing things that should meet universal disdain, is respected. And given his appearance and name that literally exudes humour, this character is a beautiful, or rather, genius irony.'The Dark Knight' made me look at him in awe and reverence, and when I heard this enigma was finally getting an origin story, I was getting what I wanted. The Joker, after all, is an ordinary human, and what could've possibly gone wrong with a man that turned him into a brilliant chaotist - one who could bring down the likes of Batman himself.Joaquin Phoenix has convinced me that the Joker didn't die with Heath Ledger. I mean, the actor has carried the film on his shoulders with such conviction. The laughter, the swag, the creepiness, the taunting tease - everything. It's hard not to have any admiration for what he's done.And the way his journey has been portrayed is definitely satisfying. He's the hero of his own story. One cannot avoid feeling for the poor man - and the cruelties he has to endure. For someone already battling medical issues, his sanity gets its final push when he learns about his mother and his actual childhood, that's when he loses it.His walk to the elevator in his full costume to attend his TV show, with the background music playing, is probably the most kickass scenes of all - when his entry finally arrives. The theatre erupted in screams and howls. And what happens at the show comes definitely as a shocker, though I was expecting something. The crowd redeems him from the cops and he stands atop a cop car, carving that smile on his face with the blood in his mouth. That scene...wheww!!Finally, the director. Todd Philips has given me my all-time favourite comedy gems like 'the road trip' and 'the Hangover series'. His command on making comedy films is impeccable. So when I saw his name as the director - I was really surprised. Not that he isn't talented, but it's just that one wouldn't expect a movie of this type from him. And all I can say after watching it is....the man is definitely a genius - a versatile one at that. He has paid homage to another of my favourite gems, from Martin Scorsese - 'The Taxi driver'. And to borrow the line of daily living and thinking of the taxi driver for the Joker was pretty much justified.",9,4,7,4 October 2019
Halloween," Taken aback!!
","This movie had a decent start and the first 40 minutes looked promising.
What followed was something so mundane, banal and absurd in a prosterous way that I was completely taken aback. Dead slow movie with a horrible finish - which felt more laughable than 'scary'.
Classic?..No, not even by the standards of the 70s.",2,2,4,14 October 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Masterpiece!!
","Phew....Ok, This movie is a suspense-horror-thriller in the true sense. A movie that keeps you hooked, masterfully, till the very end. Scene after scene, you begin to realise the genius behind those stellar performances and dexterous direction. Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme make sure you experience something you will never forget. The movie bagged 5 Oscars, watch it, you'll know why.",10,0,1,30 September 2019
Black Panther," Wakanda!!
","Watched this film on IMAX 3d screen. It was spectacularly splendid...ohh the visual effects!!! T'chala aka the Black Panther was amazing, so was the rest of Wakanda. Had heard a lot about this movie and its maddening collection records, so decided to go experience it at the right place. Wakanda is one of the places where the infinity war will take place...can't wait",8,2,6,30 September 2019
Iron Man," Thats how you start an epic journey!!
","The first installation to the MCU series. This movie was a great start, and Robert Downey Jr brought Tony Stark to life.",8,0,0,29 September 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Don't believe the rumors..
","Even better than Thor 1. When a sequel betters the original, the fun just amplifies. Enjoyed Loki's presence too. And Thor...is my favorite.",9,0,1,29 September 2019
The Sixth Sense," Be patient and you will be rewarded
","The sixth sense is described as the movie with probably the most effective plot-twist in the history of horror cinema. The movie begins and proceeds with a very lethargic pace, and at times gets a bit too slow. But it doesn't let that affect the tension building that goes on and succeeds to keep us engaged. Cole(Haley Joel Osment), the kid, proves a worthy selection for his role. Bruce Willis with his calm demeanour as the psychologist is equally convincing. As the story moves towards its last nine minutes and one begins to judge the story, Bruce discovers something, something that changes the entire movie until then, and beyond. That's right -the last nine minutes reward us for our patience.
Shyamala as the writer-director had arrived.",9,0,0,21 September 2019
Deadpool," Crazy fun!!
","What do I say about this now?
This was fun sandwiched between crass language and buffoonery.
Enjoyed every bit of it.",9,0,2,29 September 2019
The Hangover Part III," Flawless franchise..
","When your first movie is so well received you think of turning it into a franchise. And then come movies carrying the branding they got from the first, but with mediocre stuff - this is the inevitable reality with almost all franchises.And if your franchise runs on comedy, you better be kidding if you think the sequels will meet the expectations. Making a single comedy movie that is appreciated by people with different levels of sense of humor is the hardest act in movie business. I mean there's setting, plot, execution, twists, ending and then the jokes itself - getting all of it right.So the 'Hangover' franchise is one of the very few outliers in the history of comedy cinema, where you have 3 movies, and all three are exceptionally good - I mean rib-tickling to the very end. Todd Philips and his writers get credit for that- and yes, they would still not be so successful if they weren't dealing with a genius cast - Zack, Bradley, Ed Helms and Ken Jeong.These movies are some of those things that make life worth living!! And I know I will revisit them again and again - I ain't getting rid of the Hangover they've given me!!",10,0,1,30 September 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," Watch it if you love an in-genuine horror plot
",What appears to be a cliche' plot of five young people vacationing in a jungle house is actually something way different than one would expect. A very innovative plot that seemed pretty convincing. It looked like one of those kids movies on holidays - except it suits all ages. The zombie designs were in-genuine and included some scary stuff. Kept me engaged till the end.,8,3,5,21 September 2019
