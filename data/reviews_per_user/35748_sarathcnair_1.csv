The Avengers," Movie that delivers a lot of action and special effects.Worth watching.
","I had a chance to watch The Avengers on Friday night and got to say the movie was way better than i expected.I didn't had much expectations for this movie because last couple of times i expected some movies to rock but they all let me down,lets say Transformers III?Yeah.The Acting was awesome and the special effects,one of the best i have seen in the recent times.And of course the 3D was great too.It guarantees you a fast paced action from the beginning to the end.The Movie is successful in every way.In terms of story telling and CGI action was awesome as it gets in every sense.If you are looking for a great movie that u are planning to watch it in the Cinemas?Then don't wait The Avengers is just what u r looking for ;-)",8,1,4,29 April 2012
